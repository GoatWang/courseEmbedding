Boromisa and Kruger Take Seats on Wolverine’s Board

Posted by SGB Media | Jul 17, 2006 | SEW, Uncategorized | 0  | 









Wolverine World Wide, Inc. ppointed Jeffrey M. Boromisa and Blake W. Krueger to the Company’s Board of Directors.

Jeffrey M. Boromisa is the Senior Vice President and CFO of the Kellogg Company, a leading global cereal, snack and specialty foods company. Jeff has been with Kellogg since 1981 and has held a variety of senior management positions. Before being promoted to CFO of the Company, Jeff was Senior Vice President, Corporate Controller and CFO of Kellogg International.

Boromisa is a proven leader who has previously been named the best CFO in the food category by Institutional Investor magazine and is a member of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.

“Jeff brings a wealth of experience in business and proven financial expertise to the Wolverine Board,” stated Timothy J. ODonovan, Wolverine World Wide Chairman and CEO. “He has a tremendous business background and his past successes and leadership skills will prove to be valuable assets to the Company as we pursue growth in our existing global brand portfolio and new growth initiatives for the future.”

Krueger was also appointed to the Wolverine World Wide Board of Directors. He has been a senior executive of the Company for over 10 years and currently serves as President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, a position he assumed in October 2005. Prior to this, he served as President of the Heritage Brands Group, which is one of the Company’s four branded global operating units and comprises the Caterpillar Footwear and Harley- Davidson footwear brands. He has also previously served as Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company with various responsibilities including the human resources, retail, business development, accessory licensing, mergers and acquisitions, and legal areas.

Commenting on this appointment, Timothy J. ODonovan stated, “I am pleased to announce this important move which acknowledges Blake’s expanding leadership role in the Company and will permit him to contribute at the next level. Blake’s in-depth knowledge of the business and innovative approach to the Company’s global operations have contributed significantly to Wolverine’s record performance. Having worked side-by-side with Blake, we are confident in his abilities and look forward to his future contributions both as Chief Operating Officer and now as a Director of the Company.”
