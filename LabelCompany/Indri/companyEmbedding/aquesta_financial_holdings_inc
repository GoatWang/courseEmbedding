Investor Relations 
Who is Aquesta?
Aquesta Bank is the largest and fastest growing commercial bank headquartered in the Lake Norman area.  Aquesta Insurance services, Inc. is one of the largest full service independent insurance agencies in the state.  Together, they are owned by Aquesta Financial Holdings, Inc..
Aquesta Bank was created in 2006 and has expanded to eight full service branches primarily in the Lake Norman area (15 miles north of Charlotte, NC) and with additional locations in Charlotte and Wilmington.  Aquesta Bank’s focus is commercial lending although it also provides residential construction and permanent home financing.  By deploying the most recent technology (e.g., remote deposit capabilities for both business and personal use) and superior customer service through fast customized decisions, Aquesta Bank’s growth has exceeded its competitors.
Similarly, Aquesta Insurance has focused on providing superior, personal assistance to both business and personal insurance customers.  Loss control, expedited handling and similar services sets Aquesta Insurance apart.
Aquesta’s goal is to balance growth of assets (loans) and profitability.  We believe this approach provides the best long term value to our shareholders, customers and employees. To achieve this goal, we strategically hire excellent market makers in strategic locations, often working for Aquesta out of low cost formats such as from their homes.  As a market maker’s loan portfolio grows large enough to cover costs, we look to expand with more substantial presence, such as a branch or loan production office.
Outstanding customer service is fundamental to any attempt to grow a business and so it is with Aquesta.  We hire those individuals with demonstrated attitude and ability to provide the highest level of customer care in the market.  To date, this approach has set Aquesta apart from our competition allowing us to provide higher returns to our shareholders.
We thank you for your support of Aquesta through your investment and, often through your business relationship with us.– Jim Engel, CEO and President of Aquesta Bank
Why Aquesta?
Personal service, fast decisions, innovative loan and deposit products, superior insurance coverage are just the beginning.  Most people choose Aquesta because they understand that when they really need a bank they will want the bank to know them.  Aquesta strives to know and understand its customers’ financial needs.  While on a day to day basis, most customers are not looking for personal services from their banker or insurance agent, our customers know they can count on Aquesta to be there for them when there are sudden changes in their lives.  New jobs, new businesses, changing homes, etc. are all times when you will want to know your financial advisor and you will want them to know you.  This is the primary difference between Aquesta and the others.
Aquesta stock is traded on the OTC Exchange under the symbol AQFH.

Aquesta Financial Holdings, Inc Announces Results Of Operations For The Second Quarter Of 2017






GlobeNewswire



Jul 20, 2017 11:59 AM EDT













 




























































 CORNELIUS, N.C., July 20, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aquesta Financial Holdings, Inc and subsidiaries ("Aquesta") (OTC Market:AQFH) - including its primary subsidiary Aquesta Bank announced today net income for the second quarter of 2017 (three month period ending June 30, 2017).  For the second quarter of 2017, Aquesta had unaudited net income of $482,000 (15 cents per share) compared to second quarter of 2016 net income of $623,000 (20 cents per share).  Jim Engel, CEO and President of Aquesta, said, "I'm very pleased with our continued strong loan production.   Second quarter loan growth was more than 20 percent annualized.  While our core earnings year to date were good with margin improvement and loan volume benefits, net income for the quarter was lower than the same quarter in the prior year.  The primary reason for the decrease during this quarter was that this year we did not recognize any SBA (Small Business Administration loans) gains or security gains unlike the same period last year.  With increasing interest rates, we strategically chose to keep the variable rate SBA loans we originated to benefit our long term net income in a rising rate environment. Even with this strategic decision, second quarter net income was up an annualized 10.0 percent compared to the first quarter of this current year."  Key Highlights  Loan growth of $17.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 (annualized 13.8 percent).  Core deposit growth of $13.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 (annualized 13.0 percent).   Solid Balance Sheet GrowthAt June 30, 2017, Aquesta's total assets were $365.6 million compared to $353.1 million at December 31, 2016.  Total loans were $268.1 million at June 30, 2017 compared to $250.8 million at December 31, 2016.  Core deposits were $218.7 million at June 30, 2017 compared to $205.3 million at December 31, 2016.  Strong Asset QualityAsset quality remains very strong.  Nonperforming assets as of June 30, 2017 were at $1.8 million compared to $1.7 million as of December 31, 2016   Aquesta had $291 thousand in nonaccrual loans as of June 30, 2017 compared to $122 thousand in nonaccrual loans as of December 31, 2016.  Other real estate owned was $1.5 million at the end of the second quarter 2017, as well as at the end of the fourth quarter 2016.  Aquesta only has two pieces of OREO property.  Net Interest IncomeNet interest income was $5.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to $5.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  This is an increase of $711 thousand or 13.6%.  The increase in net interest income continues to be directly associated with the Company's continued loan growth.  Non Interest ExpenseNon-interest expense was $6.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to $6.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Non-interest expense increased primarily due to additional personnel as the Company continues to expand.  Personnel expense was at $4.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to $3.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Occupancy expense decreased by $10 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the six months ending June 30, 2016.  The decrease in occupancy expense was due to the consolidation of the Wilmington bank and insurance branch.  Aquesta had $80 thousand in OREO losses for the six months ended June 30, 2017 as compared to $153 thousand for the six months ending June 30, 2016.
