  History   







 For two generations, the Laborde family has been a major player in the offshore oil and gas industry. In 1998, Tracy Laborde bought the company, formerly known as Star Power Services, which at the time was primarily a distributor of Yanmar engines. 
 
Under his leadership and with his extensive experience in the commercial marine industry, Laborde expanded, crediting its deal with Mitsubishi as a landmark in company history. After a year of discussions and a trip to Japan, Mitsubishi agreed to a long-term commitment with Laborde and a stable, mutually-beneficial relationship was born.
Laborde Products now carries Mitsubishi, Yanmar, Hatz, FPT (Fiat Powertrain Technologies) and SteyrMotors engines for the marine and industrial markets. Laborde also builds stand-alone products including diesel pumps and generators under its own brand, Diesel America and offers an array of other related equipment and accessories. 
Providing the best service and products has allowed Laborde Products to develop strong ties and long-term relationships with its customers. We've accomplished so much in the past 17 years and we look forward to what we'll achieve in the next decade.








The Laborde Family � History Line
The Oil and Gas Industry







1954 - ODECO
Alden
"Doc� Laborde, an Annapolis Naval Academy graduate, joined Kerr-McGee after
servicing as an Naval Officer in World War II.
As a marine superintendent, he saw first-hand the difficulty associated
with drilling offshore under varying conditions of water depth, wind and wave
action. 
He introduced a new drilling
concept to Kerr-McGee, but they declined to build his barge. Doc went on to design the submersible
drilling rig and team up with Charles Murphy of Murphy Oil and built the first
submersible drilling rig, named "Mr. Charlie� which was what Charles Murphy
father was commonly called. 
They formed ODECO ( Ocean Drilling
& Exploration Company) which became a leading company in the oil and gas industry. Doc
Laborde retired in 1977 at the age of 61, but has remained active starting new
companies to service and support the oil and gas industry. In 1985, he was selected by Fortune Magazine

LSU Law Celebrates Historic Gift of John P. Laborde (’49)
Posted on May 6, 2013

John P. Laborde (’49)
The LSU Law Center community, along with family and friends, honored alumnus John P. Laborde (’49) on Thursday, May 2, 2013, for his historic gift to the Law Center. Mr. Laborde has made a $2 Million gift to LSU Law, creating a Double Endowed Chair in Energy Law and a programmatic support fund to establish the LSU John P. Laborde Energy Law Center.  Mr. Laborde’s gift is the largest gift in the history of the Law Center.  LSU Law Center Chancellor Jack M. Weiss presented Mr. Laborde with the Law Center’s Distinguished Service Award during ceremonies held at the Audubon Tea Room in New Orleans.

Biography of John P. Laborde
Mr. Laborde has made a $2 Million gift to the Law Center to create a $1.2 Million Double Endowed Chair in Energy Law and an $800,000 programmatic support fund to establish the LSU John P. Laborde Energy Law Center. Mr. Laborde’s gift is the largest gift in the history of the Law Center.
Mr. Laborde graduated from Louisiana State University with B.A. and J.D. degrees. After his graduation from LSU Law in 1949, Mr. Laborde spent 5 years with Richardson & Bass, an independent oil and gas exploration company and then 40 years leading Tidewater Marine, an international marine service company that he co-founded. Tidewater’s story began in 1955, when a group of investors led by the Laborde family of New Orleans pioneered the development of the first offshore service vessel tailor-made to support the new and growing offshore oil and gas industry. A year later, Tidewater Marine Service, Inc. commenced operations as a publicly owned company with John P. Laborde at the helm.
Now, more than 55 years and many vessels later, Tidewater remains the leader of the industry it created, following the search for oil and gas into increasingly deeper waters globally and extending its proven record of service to installations closer to land. In the process, the company has earned a reputation for anticipating and responding to the changing worldwide needs of energy exploration and production. Mr. Laborde has also served on the Boards of several major corporations, including BellSouth Corp., American Bankers Insurance Group, United Gas Pipeline Co., Stewart Enterprises, Inc., and VT Halter Marine, Inc. He is currently Chairman of the Board of Laborde Marine Lifts, Inc., Laborde Products, Inc., Lab-More Properties LLC, and Laborde Integrated Services, Inc., and currently serves on the Board of Stone Energy Corporation. He retired from Tidewater in 1994.
Mr. Laborde is a well-known and respected civic leader in New Orleans and throughout Louisiana. In 2000, Louisiana Public Broadcasting honored him as a “Legend of Louisiana” and in 2003, Junior Achievement honored him with its Lifetime Achievement Award. He was recognized by LSU A&M as the Peoples Health “Illustrious Alumnus of the Game” during the LSU-Kentucky game in 2011, and has also recently received the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Association for Corporate Growth.
