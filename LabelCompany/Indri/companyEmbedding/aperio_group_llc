Active Tax Management: Aperio’s investment strategy that overlays tax-loss harvesting on top of a portfolio of equities that track an index. Taking advantage of the natural price movement in stocks, Aperio consistently monitors and systematically rebalances the portfolio to recognize tax losses from securities that have declined. Realized tax losses can offset taxable capital gains from other assets such as hedge funds, active mutual funds, private equity, company stock, or the sale of private businesses.
Alternative minimum tax (AMT): A tax calculation that adds certain tax-preference items back into adjusted gross income. AMT uses a separate set of rules to calculate taxable income after allowed deductions. Preferential deductions are added back, and then the AMT exemption is subtracted to get the AMT taxable income (AMTI). AMTI is then taxed at the current rate schedule to get tentative minimum tax (TMT). If the TMT is higher than the regular tax liability for the year, the taxpayer owes the regular tax and the amount by which the TMT exceeds the regular tax (i.e., the taxpayer pays the full TMT).
ESG/ESG databases: Data sets created by third-party social research vendors that review corporate practices on a variety of environmental, social, and governance issues.
Exchange traded funds (“ETFs”): A security that tracks an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund, but that trades like a stock on an exchange. ETFs experience price changes throughout the day as they are bought and sold.


Factor Tilts: Aperio’s investment strategy that implements a client’s desired investment exposure or approach using a multi-factor risk model that expresses the strategy as a set of risk-factor targets. Risk factors may include tilts towards select geographies, sectors, or styles. Each factor may be overweighted, underweighted, or excluded from the portfolio entirely. 
Indexing: An investment strategy that seeks to match the performance of a particular asset class as measured by an index by investing in all or a representative subset of securities comprising the index.


Socially Responsive Indexing/ESG: Aperio’s investment strategy that allows a client to customize their portfolio to a unique social philosophy while using a passive index implementation. This strategy can incorporate both negative and positive screens, including best-in-class and environmental impact, and sets priority levels for the most important issues for a given investor.
Tax alpha: Defined as the tax reduction from short-term and long-term capital losses, less commissions, over a period's beginning balance.
Tax-loss harvesting: The process of selling securities in a portfolio at a loss to offset a client’s capital gains tax liability. Tax-loss harvesting is typically used to limit short-term realized capital gains because they are normally taxed at higher federal income tax rates than long-term capital gains.

Aperio Group is an SEC-registered investment adviser; however such registration does not imply a certain level of skill or training and no inference to the contrary should be made. Aperio may only transact business or render personalized investment advice in those states and international jurisdictions where we are registered/filed notice or otherwise excluded or exempted from registration requirements. Any communications with prospective clients residing in states or international jurisdictions where Aperio is not registered or licensed shall be limited so as not to trigger registration or licensing requirements. The purpose of this website is to provide information, products, and services and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy or sell any securities. All investments involve risk, including loss of principal invested. Past performance does not guarantee future performance. Individual client accounts may vary. The strategies and/or investments referenced may not be suitable for all investors as the appropriateness of a particular investment or strategy will depend on an investor’s individual circumstances and objectives. The information provided reflects the views of the authors as of a particular time and are subject to change at any time without notice.
Hypothetical, back-tested performance results  have inherent limitations, including the  following: (1) the results do not reflect the results of actual trading, but were achieved by means of retroactive application, which may have been designed with the benefit of hindsight; (2) back-tested performance may not reflect the impact that any material market or economic factors might have had on Aperio’s decision-making process had the strategy been used during the stated period to actually manage client assets; and (3) for various reasons (including the reasons indicated above), clients may have experienced investment results during the corresponding time periods that were materially different from those portrayed. Back-tested returns do not represent actual returns and should not be interpreted as an indication of such.
Any forward-looking statements or forecasts are based on assumptions and actual results are expected to vary from any such statements or forecasts. No reliance should be placed on any such statements or forecasts when making any investment decision. The assumptions and projections displayed are estimates, hypothetical in nature, and meant to serve solely as a guideline. The results and analysis are not guarantees of future results because they are derived from mathematical modeling techniques of the economic and financial markets that may or may not reflect actual conditions and events. Accordingly, you should not rely solely on the information contained in these materials in making any investment decision.
There are different costs associated with different types of securities and investors may be responsible for paying fees separate and distinct from those paid to Aperio to invest in such securities. Importantly, the fees specific to what Aperio Group charges do not include certain fees and charges imposed by third parties such as custodial fees, mutual fund fees and expenses, and additional fees charged by wrap sponsors. An Aperio client’s assets also can be subject to asset-based transaction fees, brokerage fees and commissions, retirement plan administration fees (if applicable), deferred sales charges on mutual funds, 12b-1 fees, odd-lot differentials, transfer taxes, wire transfer and electronic fund fees, and other fees and taxes on custodial accounts and securities transactions. For mutual fund and exchange traded fund (“ETFs”) investments, investors are charged internal management fees, distribution fees and other expenses, which are described in each fund's prospectus.
All custodial fees and any other charges, fees and commissions incurred in connection with transactions for an Aperio client’s account are generally paid out of the assets in their managed account and are in addition to the investment management fees charged by Aperio Group. Notably, neither Aperio nor any of its associated persons receive any portion of the third-party fees. Investors should consider all fees that may be charged to their account and also understand that lower fees for comparable services may be available from other investment advisory firms.
Lower cost refers to Aperio’s management fees and transaction costs, and does not include the cost of custody, wrap fees, or custodial fees.
The information contained within this website was carefully compiled from sources Aperio believes to be reliable, but we cannot guarantee accuracy. We provide this information with the understanding that we are not engaged in rendering legal, accounting, or tax services. In particular, none of the examples should be considered advice tailored to the needs of any specific investor. We recommend that all investors seek out the services of competent professionals in any of the aforementioned areas. With respect to the description of any investment strategies, simulations, or investment recommendations, we cannot provide any assurances that they will perform as expected and as described in our materials. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Every investment program has the potential for loss as well as gain.
