Agria Corporation: A Chinese Agricultural Company - Agria Corporation (NYSE:GRO) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Agria Corporation: A Chinese Agricultural CompanyOct.21.14 | About: Agria Corporation (GRO) Daniel Gilcher Value, special situations, long onlySummaryWe provide an overview about Agria's diversified business and past performance.We analyze the company's balance sheet and important fundamentals to evaluate its general financial health.We conclude that under current circumstances GRO does not offer an appropriate margin of safety.The aim of this article is to review Agria Corporation's (NYSE:GRO) past performance. After describing the company's broad product spectrum and structure, we analyze its fundamental data and balance sheet. We hope to provide investors with a more informed estimation of the business with our review.
The company:
Agria Corporation is a globally active agricultural business. It stems originally from Shenzhen, China and was founded in 2004. Today, it has an important second branch in Christ Church, New Zealand, from where it runs its international business. The company went public 2007.
Agria's business is divided into two different sectors:
a) Seeds and grain:
This branch researches, develops and sells agricultural seeds. It has multiple co-operations with universities (e.g. university of Sydney) and other companies in the field to maintain its state-of-the-art product status. Last fiscal year, the company made 38% of its revenue from this part of its business. Inside the company, the segment is split into a Chinese and an international part.
b) Rural services:
This subsidiary of the company specializes in selling livestock and wool as well as farms. The installation and selling of pumping and irrigation systems and the selling of specific insurances completes this segment. The company's annual report suggests that these services make up around 60% of its annual revenue.
The management:
The board of directors consist of experienced Chinese professionals, who all hold international certifications in their field. All directors hold university degrees from western countries as well.
With its broad, globally distributed product spectrum and its strong connections to different R&D co-operations it is reasonable to call GRO a diversified agricultural business. The experienced team at the top of the company suggests that it is led very professionally.

Let's take a look at the share price:

GRO data by YCharts
After its IPO around $10, the stock lost 90% of value until 2009. Since mid 2010, it is trading in a very narrow range somewhere between 1 and 2 USD per ADR. It already made a run-up from $0.90 to $1.80 and is now on its way down again.
This is a rather interesting development. Many Chinese stocks lost a lot of value during the last few years. GRO managed to keep its price level somehow. Unfortunately, the management was not able to bring the share price back or close to the IPO level. We might conclude that the company was a rather unattractive play for investors in the last few years, without being a steady target of short selling or accused of fraudulent management.
We think a look into the fundamental data will help us to explain this unusual price development.
Analysis:
Please note that GRO's fiscal year ends 30 June.
Cash flow:
The company last reported a positive cash flow of 20 million USD. It is only since 2012 that they have managed to create a positive inflow of money again. The two years before were characterized by slightly negative cash flow.
We think it is generally a good sign that GRO managed to get back to a positive cash flow in a difficult global environment. In relation to a market capitalization of only 60 million USD at the current price level, we should not underestimate the value of such a relatively large inflow of money.
Income:
Since the last three years, the company reported a steady revenue of approximately one billion USD. The company did not manage to create a positive net income during all this time, but is back on the earning side since this year.
GRO reported a net income of a small 6 million USD. While 765 million USD accounts for cost of revenue, the other difficult position 'other operating expenses' accounts for another 224 million USD, which is shrinking the final net income.

Generally, positive net income is a good sign that a company is operating well. On the other side, we think recent 'cost of revenue' and 'other operating expenses' are very high compared to GRO's competitors in the sector.
Earnings per share are then calculated at $0.10 per share, with 55 million shares outstanding. This leaves the investor with a current price to earnings ratio of 10-11. This is generally assumed to indicate a reasonable pricing.
Balance sheet:
The company once held a strong cash position of more than 100 million USD in 2009. Since then the amount has declined more than 85% to 14 million USD. At the same time receivables and inventories inflated strongly more than 1000% from 18 and 11 million USD to 223 and 218 million USD.
In consequence, total assets rose more than 100% in the last five years. This again, is a generally good sign. Still, the negative side must not stay unmentioned. From an investors' point of view the growing positions for receivables and inventories are problematic. The more assets of a company are bound in these positions the greater is the risk that shareholders will lose money in the case of liquidation. Especially as the cash position decreases, we are skeptic about this kind of management and would appreciate a larger cash position instead of ever inflating receivables. Growing inventories might indeed be a necessary effect of growing research efforts etc., as a large 100 million USD position for net property, plant and equipment suggests.
The liabilities section of the balance sheet reveals that Agria carries 39 million USD in short term and 79 million USD in long-term debts. The total liabilities with 528 million USD are also in the range of the past two years. We think it is generally beneficial to prefer long term over short-term debts. However, the fact that the positions of 'other liabilities' play such a large role (together 269 million USD) here, again does becloud the overall picture.
Valuation:
If we try to calculate a net worth of the company for the worst-case scenario of bankruptcy and liquidation, we find that GRO might be a very uncomfortable play with its underlying fundamentals.

If we assume for such a liquidation value:
Liquidation value = Assets - Liabilities
where
Assets = cash + 75% receivables + 50% + 75% net property, plant and equipment
and
Liabilities = total liabilities
we arrive at a liquidation value of:
Liquidation value = 369 million USD - 528 million USD = -159 million USD
The negative amount indicates that, if our conservative model is correct, in the actual situation the company's shareholders will not see any money in case of GRO's bankruptcy. We think this is besides all other factors an important point against an investment in GRO under the current circumstances.
We think it is reasonable to assume that this tenuous situation is an important reason why the company's share price has not pulled back to former highs substantially. As long as the business is not changing its approach towards cash and receivables the situation will not improve. We do not see an appropriate margin of safety for long-term investments here at the moment. Apart from that, the current share price seems to match the company's value quite fairly.
To sum things up, we might conclude that Agria presents a somehow mixed picture today. While negative points overlay the positive aspects in our view, we are not generally bearish about the company. What we miss the most is a basic financial strength that shields shareholders against bankruptcy. If the company improves these critical points we might find it an interesting investment opportunity here.
Conclusion:
We presented Agria as a small and diversified agricultural company that operates worldwide.
We provided evidence why GRO's share price has not seen substantial and lasting improvements in the last few years.
With its current balance sheet we think investors should be careful about investing money here.
If the general situation improves here, we might look at a bargain opportunity in the future.

Agria Corporation Issues Statement Regarding Delisting Of Shares
Feb 15 17
Agria Corporation issued the following statements regarding the delisting of its American Depositary Shares (ADS or shares) from the New York Stock Exchange. Trading of the ADSs was suspended on November 3, 2016, and the shares were formally delisted on January 2, 2017. In consultation with management, legal counsel, and other advisors, the Company's Board of Directors is in the process of evaluating the merits and costs of the alternatives for trading of its shares. The alternatives span a wide range, from becoming a private company to relisting on other trading venues in the US or other jurisdictions. The Board is considering many variables during this process, but holds as its primary objective a decision that is in the best interests of shareholders. The Company intends to continue to communicate all material developments to its shareholders through normal channels, such as SEC filings and press releases. Unless and until the Company files a Form 15 with the SEC to terminate the registration of its securities and suspend its duty to file reports, the Company remains obligated to comply with all reporting obligations under SEC rules and regulations.


Agria Corporation Files Notice to Review NYSE Delisting
Nov 22 16
Agria Corporation announced that on November 17, 2016, it filed a notice (Notice) requesting a Committee of the Board of Directors of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to review the decision by the NYSE to delist the American Depositary Shares (ADSs) of Agria traded on the NYSE. Trading of the Company's ADSs was suspended on November 3, 2016. In the Notice, the Company challenged the NYSE's delisting decision on several grounds. The Company will continue to work with the NYSE during the appeal process.


Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC Announces Class Action Against Agria Corporation
Nov 10 16
Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC notified investors that a securities class action has been filed against American Depositary Shares of Agria Corporation and certain of its officers. This class action is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons who purchased Agria between December 16, 2011 and November 4, 2016, both dates inclusive. This class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: Defendants were trading to artificially inflate Agria's stock price to meet NYSE's continuing listing standards and to avoid being delisted from the NYSE; Agria lacked sufficient internal controls over financial reporting; and consequently, Defendants' public statements about Agira's business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.
