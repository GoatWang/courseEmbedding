                              foundation. This is precisely what David Gill sets out to help us do. His approach is deeply rooted within the Christian tradition
                              and specifically designed for people who want to allow Scripture to shape the way they think and act. Gill's arguments are
                              not drawn from ethical theory (though they are informed by it) but from the Bible - from Paul's admonitions to faith, hope
                              and love, and from Jesus' Beatitudes. --From publisher's description

                           The theme of Islam and Judeo-Christianity is the relationship between these three faiths under three headings that are often
                              promoted as a basis for commonality between them (sons of Abraham, monotheism, and religions of the book). Ellul incisively
                              critiques these expressions, finding less common ground than is generally accepted and a pattern of conformism. The English
                              edition of Islam and Judeo-Christianity includes a foreword by David Gill and Dominique North Ellul, and Alain Besancon's
                              extensive foreword to the French edition of Islam and Judeo-Christianity (relocated to the appendices in this edition). The
                              book also includes other writings on this theme by Ellul: Firstly, chapter 5 from Ellul's Subversion of Christianity where
                              ""Islam is portrayed as a non-progressive, totalitarian religion, founded on the concept of divine right, and credited with
                              having introduced into Christianity the idea of holy war."" Secondly, Ellul's foreword to The Dhimmi: Jews and Christians
                              under Islam written by Bat Ye'or (1985), which documents the conditions of Jews and Christians in Muslim society. Thirdly,
                              Ellul's foreword to The Decline of Eastern Christianity under Islam: From Jihad to Dhimmitude, also by Bat Ye'or (1996), which
                              further explores the history of Jews and Christians under Islam

During this time his contributions both in terms of knowledge and advice have been invaluable. He has also assisted our programs through his connections within the industry, helping us extend the reach of our Advisory board to include representation from a wider range of specializations within the Communications field. This has been a major factor in ensuring our Advisory team remains current and well connected to emerging aspects of the industry, ensuring that our program content reflects current practice.See moreSee lessI have known David since 2007 when he was Associate Director of IPTV implementation at Bell. David engaged Tii to develop a number of solutions to enable Bell to reduce costs and increase productivity regard the Fibe IPTV deployment. I found David to be a passionate, driven individual focussed on the customer and delivering leading support and follow-up. 
I hired David in 2014 to expand our relationship with the largest players in the Telecommunications space. David was a  brand ambassador with an out-of-the-box approach. His focus was relationships and expand our presence in the BIG players. He was also able to expand into several of the independents who are now customers.  I soon came to realize his technical prowess and as well his industry connection. I'm not sure if I had ever met some who had so many relationships (not just connections) in the industry. 
I would recommend David as an excellent, well-rounded resource within the telecommunications industry and a bonus to whomever he works with.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended DavidGroupsFTTProfessionalThe Project Manager Network - #1 Group for Project ManagersThe Recruiter.com NetworkDigital TV EuropeFierceTelecomCanadian Telecommunication ProfessionalsProject Managers GroupSee 7 moreDurham College Alumni (past & present students)PMI Durham Highlands ChapterSchulich School of Business, York UniversityPMI TORONTOIP&TV NewsInternational Business (43806)IPTV & Triple-Play GroupSee lessView David’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact David directlyView David’s Full ProfileNot the David you’re looking for?
