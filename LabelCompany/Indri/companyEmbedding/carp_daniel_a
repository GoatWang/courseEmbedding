      ■ In 2000 Daniel A. Carp became the chairman of the board and chief
      executive officer of the Eastman Kodak Company of Rochester, New York, one
      of the leading photo-imaging corporations in the world, with annual
      revenues of more than $13

      billion. A career-long Kodak employee, he climbed the corporate ladder
      gradually, filling positions in both the United States and abroad before
      entering the elite circle of top management in 1995 and ascending to the
      top position. Carp's leadership of Kodak was marked by several
      major initiatives that made him the object of much criticism from some
      shareholders and financial analysts. He was determined to maintain the
      company's long dominance in consumer photo-imaging as the industry
      passed through a radical transition from traditional photography (that is,
      the exposure of chemically treated film to light) to filmless digital
      photography (that is, the creation of pixels by computer program). At the
      same time, he led Kodak in a marketing and manufacturing push designed to
      make the company dominant in the enormous emerging consumer markets of
      Asia, especially China, where traditional photographic methods are likely
      to remain the norm in consumer imaging for decades to come.
    

      A ONE-COMPANY MAN
    

      Daniel Carp was born and raised in Wytheville, Virginia, a town of about
      eight thousand located in the southwestern corner of the state in the Blue
      Ridge Mountain region. He attended public schools, graduating from George
      Wythe High School in 1966. Little is known about his upbringing or family
      life, subjects he chose not to discuss in public. An early and steady
      desire for a career in business is evident in his academic record. As a
      student at Ohio University in Athens, a school known for its broad-based
      offerings in the liberal arts, he chose to pursue a strictly focused
      bachelor of business administration degree in quantitative analysis, which
      he received in 1970. Within months of graduation he secured a job with
      Kodak as a statistical analyst in Rochester. As an entry-level executive,
      he continued his studies in business at the Rochester Institute of
      Technology, earning an MBA. Carp's long climb through the ranks of
      "Big Yellow," as Kodak is sometimes called, was a gradual
      one that can be described in terms of three distinct career periods. From
      1970 to 1986 he gained hands-on experience and increasing responsibility
      in market research, business planning, marketing management, and
      line-of-business management in Kodak's U.S. and Canadian
      operations, rising through the ranks of middle management to hold such
      positions as manager of sales for Kodak Canada and general manager of
      Kodak's Consumer Electronics Division. A second phase, from 1986 to
      1995, was international in character. It included stints for Carp in
      high-level management positions with Kodak's divisions in the Latin
      American region (1986–1988) and the European, African, and Middle
      Eastern region (1989–1995).
    

      Carp's success on the world marketing stage in battling
      Kodak's arch rival, Fuji Corporation of Japan, clearly won the
      notice of top management and gained him consideration for further
      advancement. In 1987 he began a year as a Sloan Fellow at the
      Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management,
      where he earned a second graduate degree, a master of science in
      management, which served as a credential considered appropriate to the
      huge corporation's highest echelons. A third phase, in which Carp
      was integrated into Kodak's inner circle of top management, began
      in 1995 when he was recalled to Rochester from the London regional office
      and promoted to executive vice president. Within two years he took the
      positions of president and chief operating officer of the company and was
      elected to a seat on the board of directors as well. Carp became board
      chairman on January 1, 2000, thus consolidating his position of optimal
      executive power in the publicly held company. His predecessor, George
      Fisher, in handing over power to Carp, praised him for his
      "expansive focus on customer needs" and his
      "strategic understanding of growth opportunities" (Deutsch,
      June 10, 1999). His quick movement to the top in the late 1990s was
      attributed to the anomalous position in which the company found itself. It
      was successfully dominating an industry that showed signs of disappearing.
      Carp was brought in to save the company from a catastrophe attributable to
      its own success.
    

      ASTRIDE A TECHNOLOGICAL CUSP
    

      Carp was given a mandate to do what he thought necessary to make the
      venerable company, which had launched the mass market for home photography
      with its Brownie camera in 1900, into a state-of-the-art imaging
      corporation capable of achieving similar dominance in the emergent mass
      market for digital photography. Carp made his intentions clear. Within
      weeks of taking office he noted in an interview with 
      
        Industry Week
      
       that Kodak's founder, George Eastman, had first gained a dominant
      position for the company by developing new technologies and that he was
      prepared to follow the founder's example. "R & D
      [research and development] is at the core of what is going on in our
      company, probably more so today than at any time in our history,"
      he said (July 17, 2000). He knew that there would be opposition within the
      company but promised to be a devil's advocate for good ideas,
      whether or not they made it through the corporate bureaucracy. According
      to Carp, once an idea had proved viable to him, "it is incumbent on
      the CEO to find a new way to take [it] to the marketplace" (July
      17, 2000). In the broadest sense, the "idea" that Carp had
      to take to the marketplace was digital photography.
    

      FROM PICTURES TO PIXELS
    

      Though Kodak claims to have invented the digital camera in 1980, the
      company did little to capitalize on it for almost two decades. When Carp
      became CEO, Kodak had just completed a record year for traditional
      silver-halide film production, manufacturing more than one billion rolls
      in 1999 and utterly dominating the U.S. market with more than a twothirds
      share of retail sales, while filmless digital photography accounted for
      only about 10 percent of the American home-imaging market. Carp, however,
      saw past those figures to the belief that a mass public switch from
      film-based to digital photography was inevitable. Given Kodak's
      heavy investment in the former, the company had no choice, in his view,
      but to change its core business to meet the demands of this paradigm shift
      in home imaging. His experience in marketing was likely a factor in this
      vision.
    

      Whatever else can be said about the two imaging processes, digital offers
      more convenience to the consumer as well as lower cost at just about every
      step. Digital requires no purchase of film, nor does it require the time
      or expense of a developing process. Instead, consumers can view images on
      a personal computer or other video screen that they probably already own.
      If traditional photographic finished products are desired, the digital
      photographer has the option to print or to choose not to. Unlimited
      numbers of free electronic copies can be
       produced and delivered by e-mail at no expense. For many households
      already equipped with a personal computer, digital photography is the
      logical choice. Longtime Kodak executives, including some who had
      weathered the storms of previous technology fads, notably, the Polaroid
      "instant picture," remained skeptical. There was even less
      enthusiasm from those investors more interested in short-term profits than
      in seeing the company go through an expensive retooling process to become
      a primarily digital company, a process that Carp estimated could cost as
      much as $16 billion.
    

      Carp faced the enormous task of keeping the company astride both sides of
      this technological cusp in home imaging, even though he had no doubt about
      the eventual outcome of the struggle between the two technologies. While
      he was eager to capitalize on the value of the company's history
      and reputation as the leading force in home imaging, he put sentimentality
      about the past aside, lest the company be perceived as a doddering old
      behemoth trapped in a "sunset industry." For example, while
      Kodak continued to manufacture hundreds of millions of rolls of film each
      year, the company gradually phased out the use of its Kodachrome film
      brand in advertising, so as not to be identified as a predigital vendor by
      consumers switching to digital cameras. Carp liked to describe the change
      in his industry as an exciting opportunity rather than a threat.
      "Kodak is convinced that there has never been a better time to be
      in the picture business…. Digital can change the way people take
      and use pictures. Suddenly there are no boundaries to how often you can
      take pictures because cost and availability are no longer issues,"
      he said in a 2000 speech to the Advance Digital Photography forum in
      Boston (April 10, 2000). Rather than wait for the public to make the leap,
      Carp believed that Kodak should be a driving force in bringing about
      consumer conversions to digital.
    

      Though the price of Kodak shares suffered and the value of its dividends
      to shareholders dropped precipitously, Carp mobilized the company to
      implement his digitalization program. Before 1998 Kodak did not have a
      digital business to report on. By the end of 2003 it was doing one billion
      dollars per year of business in digital products and services, including
      its online photofinishing site, Ofoto.com. In addition to manufacturing
      its own lines of digital cameras and home-printer docks, Kodak emerged as
      the world's leading supplier of paper stocks, photofinishing
      products, and other materials used for commercial and home digital-image
      printing. Carp struck up corporate partnerships to capitalize on the power
      of the Kodak brand. Lexmark, for example, licensed the Kodak name for a
      line of its scanners and printers. Sanyo Electric Company and Kodak
      launched a joint venture to manufacture active-matrix organic
      light-emitting diode display screens. In the growing area of medical and
      dental imaging, Kodak worked on a variety of projects with GE Medical
      Systems. Retailing partners were outfitted with do-it-yourself Kodak
      picture kiosks and professional digital minilabs that can conveniently
      scan traditional pictures into digital documents and and convert digital
      shots into elegantly printed hard copy. One of Carp's first
      decisions as CEO was to have Kodak join the International Imaging Industry
      Association (IIIA), whose members included Fuji and Agfa-Gevaert, its two
      biggest worldwide competitors. Kodak then entered into an IIIA agreement
      providing for industry-wide compatibility of digital-imaging products.
      Kodak's movement from labor-intensive photographic equipment
      manufacturing to the service-oriented digital imaging industry occasioned
      sharp reductions in its workforce. In January 2004 Carp announced that
      Kodak would be cutting between 20 and 25 percent of its worldwide
      employees.
    

      LEADER OF A WORLDWIDE COMPANY
    

      While the digitalization of Kodak's consumer imaging business was
      the centerpiece of Carp's strategy, it was by no means his entire
      plan for Kodak. Emerging industrial societies, such as China and India,
      where home computers were rare and digital cameras too expensive for all
      but the wealthy, had large populations of newly urbanized consumers who
      had never owned a camera or taken a photograph. These countries
      represented an enormous potential market for traditional photo-chemical
      imaging, precisely the product line that Kodak had been delivering best
      for more than a century. In 2000 Carp journeyed to China and cemented ties
      between the company and Chinese leaders. Carp served as a member of the
      U.S.-China Business Council and joined the advisory board of the Tsinghua
      University School of Economics and Management. Kodak, which did business
      in China before the Communist revolution of 1949, reentered the Chinese
      market through its purchase of a stake in Lucky Film, China's
      largest film company. It provided technological and marketing assistance
      to Lucky Film in creating a line of entry-level cameras and film products.
      As consumers "graduate" to more advanced equipment they are
      sold products bearing the Kodak brand name. In 2003 China became
      Kodak's second largest market (after the U.S.) in terms of gross
      sales. Carp wanted Kodak to be there when China was ready to make the leap
      to digital.
    

      Carp was a strong and vocal advocate for diversity in the workplace. His
      hiring of Patricia F. Russo as his second in command at Kodak in April
      2001 was unprecedented at Kodak, long considered an "old
      boy" company. He was a trustee of the George Eastman House, the
      Rochester photography museum endowed by Kodak's founder; a trustee
      of the Malcolm Baldridge Foundation National Quality Award; a member of
      the board of directors of Africare; and a member of the Business
      Roundtable. He served on the Business Steering Committee of the Global
      Business Dialog on Electronic Commerce and was an executive member of the
      World Business Council for Sustainable Development. He was known to enjoy
      watching and playing basketball. Asked by the 
      
        Rochester Democrat and Chronicle
      
       how he felt about being in charge of
       making such radical changes in the company he had been with for most of
      his life, he said, "I am excited about this being on my watch. I
      wouldn't want to be anywhere else. I am glad I am here doing this.
      It's a relief that it is now obvious where the film business is
      going and we can get on with what we have to do to make the company
      stronger" (October 3, 2003).

Daniel A. Carp


chairman, eastman kodak





Chairman of Eastman Kodak, Daniel A. Carp, discusses the future of his industry at the Boston College Chief Executives' Club of Boston luncheon on June 16, 2005.
Picture this: Kodak may cut Peabody jobs
Eastman Kodak's Peabody facility is in the digital cross hairs.
Daniel A. Carp, Kodak's chairman, said yesterday that the fate of the Peabody plant, which makes gelatin material for traditional camera film, is under review- like other units as Kodak moves more deeply into the Digital Age.
Appearing at Boston College's Chief Executives' Club, Carp said Kodak is only halfway through a strategic transition from being primarily a film company to digital photo technology- and the Peabody plant "will get caught in that process."
Anne Finucane (President, Bank of America, Northeast) greets Deborah Jackson (CEO, American Red Cross of MA Bay) at the luncheon.
Carp said Kodak is faring well as it shifts to more digital-imaging products.
He added that that traditional film has a "long tail" and will be around for a while.
But the executive indicated that more cuts are on the way.
As part of an overall downsizing, Kodak has already reduced its Peabody work force to about 130 employees from 200 just a few years ago, said Bruce Watkins, general manager of the unit.
Watkins said Kodak will take care of workers no matter what decisions the firm makes over the next three years- a time limit Kodak has set for completing companywide downsizing. 
Benaree Wiley (former President, The Partnership) and Beverly Edgehill (President & CEO, The Partnership) speak with Patrick Purcell (President, Herald Media, Inc.).
