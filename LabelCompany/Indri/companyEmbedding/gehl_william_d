Product lines[edit]
The Gehl product lines, including skid steer loaders, track loaders, articulated loaders, asphalt pavers, compact excavators, and telescopic handlers, are used worldwide in construction and agricultural markets.[3] Gehl is North America's largest manufacturer of agricultural machinery other than tractors.[5] The Gehl Company owns the rights to manufacture Mustang skid steer loaders, and previously distributed Takeuchi Compact Track Loaders under the names Gehl and Mustang.[6]
History[edit]
Gehl was founded by Louis Lucas in 1859.[3]
Gehl was acquired in September 2008 for US$30 a share by the French equipment maker Manitou BF.[6] This allowed the company to expand its telehandler market into the US and enter several new equipment markets.[3][7] The company was delisted from NASDAQ under its ticker symbol GEHL.[citation needed]
In 2007, Gehl and the Milwaukee Brewers announced a naming rights deal for a group party club area in Miller Park.[8]

Gehl Company is a United States-based corporation headquartered in West Bend, Wisconsin, USA. Founded by Louis Lucas in 1859, Gehl is a manufacturer of heavy equipment used worldwide in construction and agricultural markets.  Their product line includes skid steer loaders, as well as asphalt pavers, compact excavators and telehandlers.[2] Gehl is also North America's largest non-tractor maker of agricultural machinery. [3]  The Gehl Company also owns the rights to manufacture Mustang skid steer loaders, and distributes Takeuchi Compact Track Loaders under the names Gehl and Mustang.  Gehl was acquired in September 2008 for $30 a share by the French equipment maker Manitou.[4] This allows the company to expand its telehandler market into the US and enter several new equipment markets.[2][5] The company was delisted from NASDAQ under its ticker symbol GEHL.

February 18, 2005 12:24 PM Eastern Standard Time



				WEST BEND, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 18, 2005--Gehl Company (NASDAQ:GEHL), a worldwide distributor and manufacturer of compact construction and agricultural equipment has launched an $8.7 million expansion of its Yankton, SD manufacturing and research and development (R&D) facilities.  The expansion will add additional manufacturing space and equipment to the Yankton plant, which manufactures telescopic handlers and pavers for the Gehl and Mustang brands. It will also expand manufacturing capacity to accommodate manufacturing several models of telescopic handlers under a license Agreement with Manitou BF S.A. of France. 

 Construction is underway for a 49,200-square foot addition to the manufacturing floor. The project will optimize the Company's manufacturing flow, facilitate new in-house laser metal-cutting capabilities and increase overall capacity to meet the growing demand for telescopic handlers and pavers. A 4,000-square foot addition is also underway to the plant's R&D building to increase the workspace needed to develop and prototype new products.  According to Dan Miller, Gehl Director of Manufacturing Operations, "Our plan to add in-house laser metal-cutting capabilities will reduce costs and shorten the lead times improving our production flexibility with our customers. Our ultimate goal is to build more quality telescopic handlers and pavers, and to deliver them to our dealer network faster to meet the demands of their customer markets."  Miller states that the company plans to purchase two high-tech laser metal-cutting systems in 2005 plus a third in the future, which should capture about $1.7 million in annual savings. Each system is capable of cutting varying thickness of raw material. "With these metal-cutting systems, we will also ultimately gain additional savings on some secondary processes," he said.  Gehl also plans to make other improvements to their manufacturing capabilities that will include automated forming, machining and welding equipment.  This project is also expected to add new jobs in the Yankton market. According to Miller, "We're still in the planning stages relative to the employment opportunities that will be available due to the expansion. We do expect that we'll need to add manufacturing and tech positions. These opportunities will also increase as we add additional work from other Gehl facilities."  Gehl business grew at a record pace in 2004 and demand for the company's compact equipment is expected to continue to grow in 2005.  According to William D. Gehl, Chairman and CEO of the company, "Our investment in expansion of the Yankton facility is part of our ongoing process to meet the increasing demand for all of our core products and to bring new products to market more rapidly. This will increase our market share and enhance shareholder value."
