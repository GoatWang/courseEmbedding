Enemy Aliens: Double Standards and Constitutional Freedoms in the War on Terrorism, received the American Book Award in 2004. No Equal Justice: Race and Class in the American Criminal Justice System was named Best Non-Fiction Book of 1999 by the Boston Book Review, and best book on an issue of national policy in 1999 by the American Political Science Association. His most recent book is The Torture Memos: Rationalizing the Unthinkable (2009). 


He received his bachelor’s degree and law degree from Yale University. He worked as a staff attorney for the Center for Constitutional Rights from 1985-90, and has continued to litigate as a professor. He has litigated many significant constitutional cases in the Supreme Court, including Texas v. Johnson and United States v. Eichman, which extended First Amendment protection to flagburning; National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, which challenged political content restriction on NEA funding; and Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, which challenged the constitutionality of the statute prohibiting “material support” to terrorist groups, which makes speech advocating peace and human rights a crime. He has been involved in many of the nation’s most important cases involving civil liberties and national security, including the case of Maher Arar, a Canadian citizen rendered to Syria by U.S. officials and tortured there.


The late New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis called David “one of the country’s great legal voices for civil liberties today,” and Nat Hentoff has called him “a one-man Committee of Correspondence in the tradition of patriot Sam Adams.” David has received two honorary degrees, and numerous awards for his human rights work, including, in 2013, the inaugural Norman Dorsen Presidential Prize from the ACLU for lifetime commitment to civil liberties.

Quirky: International Housewares Show
the International Housewares Show in Chicago is one of the biggest trade shows in the world showcasing some of the biggest and well known brandsQuirky was a relatively unknown brand doing something that no other business in the world was trying to attempt, "making invention accessible"at a show this size it can be difficult to get attendees to visit a booth, stay for the pitch and truly get to know your brand and create relationshipsthats why we designed a giant, mysterious looking, shipping container looking box to be dropped in the middle of the showattendees, curious to know who we were and what we made, eagerly lined up to be trapped in our maze containing vignettes of rooms showcasing a variety of our productseach vignette contained an actor (quirky employee) that had a semi scripted role demonstrating each of the quirky products showcased in the area this irreverent approach to sharing who we are and what we are about, proved to be incredibly effective and show stopping way of presenting our business  






















































Quirky: Shop in Shop
the shop in shop concept was done as an exercise for a retailer that had interest in having the Quirky brand in there store as an innovation and invention stationthe core of the shop in shop, like the business, was focused on member retention and driving invention on the site through idea submissions and voting , additionally consumers could see development videos and content of products that were in the pipelinethe outer edges of the space has 4 sections broken into the four core business units: power, home and kitchen, connected home and toyseach section has a powered tabletop to demonstrate products, shelving and peg wall for merchandising salable items and a light box graphic

MAC: Lash Bar
mac lashbar was conceived from a need to be able to sell more false eyelashes at retailfalse lashes were the one topical product that was not able to be sampled or tested, the ability to test the false lash is what drove the design of the lash ‘wand’ that rows the base of the lash bar and allows consumers to hold the false lash to their eye to get an impression of what the lash looks like once appliedadditionally the merchandising of the packaging with beauty images of each style of lash applied with both a ‘natural’ look and ‘dramatic’ look give the consumer the full impression of what the lash can look like once appliedthe miniature light boxes and packaging brackets are fully modular allowing lashes and beauty images to be traded in and out at the store level to complete and maintain merchandising guidelines correspondent to stock levels and seasonal guidelines
