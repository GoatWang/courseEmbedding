WOW! This is amazing! I cannot believe how super simple it is to research and create a family tree with very little information in hand. This is simply above and beyond anything else I've seen on the web! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

I have been trying to piece together my family for over 35 years and Smart Matches made it go past my wildest dreams. Thanks to MyHeritage, this is a wonderful and really exciting hobby to really dig deep into.
D. Henry, North Lauderdale, Florida, USA


MyHeritage is a great place to develop a family tree. In less than two weeks time I was able to track my family back to 1877. This is in no small part due to the vast storehouse of data that is available through MyHeritage.

I am having the time of my life. Thanks for offering such a fabulous site that is going to help so many!

Re: victoria lasiaga
/surnames.lasaga/3.1.1.1.1/mb.ashx
      The surname Lasaga  is  an ancient basque word, "Lats" + "aga". "Lats" is a place-name who means a place with a lot of watercourses. The ancient basques called it to their homes or "Caseríos", according with the nature of the place (for instance, the surname Echebarría or Etxe-berria in basque, means in basque language, New House  Etxe= house and berria=new; the surname Pagoaga is a place with beech trees,Pagoa in basque language is the beech tree). Actually exist the "Caserio Lasaga" in Aramayona, Alava Province, Basque Country, Spain, Europa, builded in the XV century. Their inhabitants have the surname Lasaga yet. Other variants are: Lazaga, Latsa, Lasa, Laza, Lasague, etc. And probably Lasiaga, too. The surname Arredondo come from the province of Santander, on the north of Spain. Exist as a little village in that province.
