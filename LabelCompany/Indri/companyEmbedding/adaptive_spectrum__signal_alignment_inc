ASSIA DSL TECHNOLOGY
DSL Management Challenges
ASSIA’s products and technologies enable DSL service providers to automate the management and maintenance of their DSL access networks, fundamentally improving performance and return-on-investment of DSL networks.
The chief technical obstacles to the cost-effective delivery of high-speed services are interference and physical faults in the copper plant. Physical faults can arise at any point in the plant, due to technician or subscriber activities, construction activities, and even environmental factors such as wind and rain. Interference is created by a variety of sources: appliances in the home, other services in the access network such as T1 and E1 services, and AM radio signals. In dense deployments of DSL, or in deployments with a mix of DSLAMs deployed in Central Offices and at remote locations (e.g., FTTN), crosstalk among DSL lines in a cable can be a significant impairment.

Unaddressed, these impairments limit DSL speeds and loop lengths, reducing an operator’s competitiveness. They also result in high rates of customer complaints, which often lead to churn, and expensive technician dispatches. ASSIA’s technology and products directly reduce trouble rates in DSL networks and increase the speed, coverage, and quality of DSL services.
ASSIA DSL Products
ASSIA’s products combine standardized DSL technologies with proprietary analysis methods and highly efficient data collection strategies to automatically stabilize the vast majority of unstable lines in a DSL network via software methods and, for the remaining lines, to generate actionable, pinpoint diagnostics that enable service personnel to efficiently address physical impairments in the copper plant.
ASSIA provides solutions for DSL operators and for DSL chipset vendors. The ASSIA DSL Expresse product delivers diagnostics and stabilization of all lines in even the largest DSL networks. The operation of the system is depicted in the figure below. Each line is inspected on a daily basis; unstable lines are stabilized by adjustment of their DSL profiles; and diagnostic reports are produced for all lines in the network. Diagnostic reports are available on a per-line, per-DSLAM, and per-geography basis.

ASSIA’s products for DSL chipset vendors improve the manageability and performance of DSL chipsets. While DSL Expresse can manage equipment containing any standards-compliant DSL chipset, the inclusion of ASSIA Rapide and ASSIA Chorale technologies in DSL chipsets  enables further gains with respect to performance and control. The Rapide product enables chipset vendors in creating DSM Level II products (see below for the definition of DSM), which have the ability to avoid crosstalk interference through shaping of the DSM spectrum. Chorale enables chipset vendors to create DSM Level III (or “vectored”) VDSL products, which actively cancel crosstalk and can provide speeds in excess of 100 Mbps in FTTN DSL deployments.
DSL Management Standards
ASSIA’s products and technologies work with all standards-compliant DSL equipment, delivering consistent management interfaces and strategies in today’s multi-vendor DSL networks.  In addition to the standardized protocols for DSL communications, the ITU-T has also standardized the DSL management parameters that must be available from all DSL equipment; this standard is known as ITU-T G.997.1. Other industry bodies such as the IETF and the Broadband Forum have developed standards for the exchange of management parameters between DSL equipment and management platforms such as ASSIA’s. And the ATIS standards organization has defined a collection of methodologies, known as Dynamic Spectrum Management or DSM, for leveraging these management quantities and protocols to optimize the technical and economic operations of DSL networks. The ASSIA products take full advantage of these standards to extract the maximum performance from DSL networks.
Technology Advantages from ASSIA
ASSIA maintains its industry leadership through continued technical innovation and growth of its world-class expertise in DSL, which includes the original developers of DSL technology.
Today, ASSIA’s intellectual property portfolio comprises hundreds of patents and patent applications filed worldwide, covering fundamental inventions for DSM, DSL system architectures, and other key technologies related to DSL. In addition, ASSIA is the exclusive licensee for key DSM patents and technology owned by AT&T and Stanford University.

Terabit Broadband Presentation



Terabit DSL Proposed By Stanford Professor John Cioffi
One Terabit 100 meters, 100 Gigabits 300 meters, 10 Gigabits 500 meters
REDWOOD CITY, Calif. — Adaptive Spectrum and Signal Alignment, Inc. (ASSIA®)
Extreme high frequency sub-millimeter waves can increase single-line data rates to terabits/second at 100 meter lengths on ordinary twisted pair phone wire.  Speeds of 100 Gigabits/second can be achieved at distances over 300 meters, and speeds of 10 Gigabits/second can be achieved at distances over 500 meters.
Dr. John Cioffi, Chairman and CEO of ASSIA and Emeritus Professor at Stanford explains, “Fiber-like speeds of 10 – 1000’s of gigabits/second (Gbps) are possible by using the previously unexploited waveguide modes of current copper infrastructure. Waveguide-mode use is similar to use of millimeter-wave transmissions in advanced wireless and 5G.  Waveguides can enable use of frequencies above 100 GHz for extraordinary speeds.”  ASSIA develops management and optimization software for broadband and Wi-Fi networks.
Cioffi’s keynote at the Paris G.fast Summit conference on May 10, 2017 titled “Terabit DSL,” will introduce the new method.  During the keynote, Dr. Cioffi will explain how 5G wireless often runs at 28 GHz and 39 GHz, while commercial microwave gear can run at 70 GHz and 90 GHz.  Wireless above 300 GHz (sub-millimeter wave) is being actively researched.  Early designs suggest link latency of 50-100 microsec is readily achievable, which would easily allow even the most stringent 5G latency specifications of 1ms or less to be achieved with these Terabit DSLs.
Today’s fastest DSL (G.fast) uses only 200 MHz, while wireless uses 25 times as much spectrum. “The challenge was to develop practical ways to use higher frequencies over wires.  Working with my ASSIA colleagues Dr. Chan Soo Hwang, Dr. Ken Kerpez, and Dr. Ioannis Kanellakopoulos, we found a solution.”
Cioffi adds, “I don’t expect anyone to need terabits/s (Tbps) to their home anytime soon. Terabits/s will be most valuable to the data centers controlled by phone companies as well as to internet companies such as Google and Microsoft.  While Tbps demand may be a few years into the future, 10-100 Gbps speeds are important to networks today and will be a big market.  Rapid advances in the Internet of Things (IoT), including autonomous vehicles, means the number of connected devices requiring high-speed ubiquitous connectivity will increase dramatically in the next decade.  We believe that Terabit DSL will play a critical role in serving the needs of that ecosystem with ultra-high-throughput and ultra-low-latency connectivity.”
Further driving the demand for bandwidth, “Hundreds of thousands of 5G small cells and DOCSIS 3.1 cable nodes will require 5-20 gigabit backhaul.  Most 5G cells will connect to a Cloud RAN controller that can use 100 gigabits/s to support dozens of cells.”
“AT&T and other telcos around the world are also deploying G.fast to apartments. G.fast speeds of 300 megabits to a gigabit can be supplied to every apartment.  This differs from cable, which has shared connections that require multi-gigabit backhaul.”
“Fiber is and always will be expensive to deploy. There are a billion phone lines around the world which will now be able to deliver fiber-like speeds over existing copper infrastructure.  Using the existing wires in place can dramatically reduce the cost of 5G networks.”
“There are a few years of work ahead in the industry to refine the system. LTE and now 5G wireless have proven major advances can evolve from concept to deployment in five to seven years. Data centers at Google and Facebook can leverage such new technologies in only a few years.”
