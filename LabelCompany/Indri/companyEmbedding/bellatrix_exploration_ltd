Home/ About Us/ Corporate Governance




Corporate Governance Bellatrix’s Recognition of and Adherence to TSX Guidelines The Company’s approach to Corporate Governance is compliant with Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSX") and New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") requirements.
  
However, as a Canadian corporation listed on the NYSE, Bellatrix is not required to comply with most of the NYSE corporate governance standards, so long as it complies with Canadian and TSX corporate governance requirements. In order to claim such an exemption, Bellatrix must disclose the significant differences between its corporate governance practices and those required to be followed by U.S. domestic companies under the NYSE corporate governance standards. Although Bellatrix is compliant with the most of the NYSE corporate governance standards required to be followed by U.S. domestic companies, there are some differences between its corporate governance practices and those required to be followed by U.S. domestic companies under the NYSE corporate governance standards. Please click on the link below for a summary of those differences. Board Responsibilities Board has assumed responsibility for the stewardship of the Company, including:   review and adoption of a strategic planning process establish or cause to be established systems to identify the principal risks of the Company’s business and the implementation of appropriate procedures to manage these risks succession planning, including appointing, training and monitoring senior management the Company’s communication policy establish or cause to be established the Company’s internal control and management information systems  Board of Directors Mandate - October 2014
 
  The Board Composition 
The Bellatrix Board of Directors is comprised of nine members, only one of whom, Brent A. Eshleman, is a member of management, and is therefore considered not independent. The other eight directors are considered independent for the purposes of National Instrument 58-101 – Disclosure of Corporate Governance Practices and the rules of the NYSE. The Company has appointed Mr. W.C. (Mickey) Dunn as Chairman of the Board. While W. C. (Mickey) Dunn is the Chairman of the Board, he is not considered by the Board to be a part of management and thus is considered to be an independent director. Board Committees Corporate Governance Committee
The Board has appointed a Corporate Governance Committee, comprising John H. Cuthbertson as Chairman of the Committee, W.C. (Mickey) Dunn and Steve Pully, all of whom are considered independent directors. The Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for enhancing corporate governance through a continuing assessment of Bellatrix's approach to corporate governance matters. The Committee’s mandate also includes also includes the responsibility for recommending suitable candidates for nomination to the Board and maintaining an overview of the entire membership of the Board. This includes assessing the effectiveness of the Board as a whole, the committees of the Board, the appointments to those committees and the mandates thereof, as well as the contribution of individual directors on an ongoing basis. The Corporate Governance Committee recommends to the Board following each annual meeting of shareholders on the allocation of Board members to each Board committee.
  Corporate Governance Mandate - October 2014 Audit Committee
The Board has appointed an Audit Committee comprised of Keith Turnbull as Chairman of the Committee, Keith Macdonald, and Tom MacInnis, all of whom are considered independent directors for the purposes of National Instrument 52-110 — Audit Committees, the rules of the NYSE and Rule 10A-3 under the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Audit Committee meets at least once each quarter and, among other things, with the assistance of the external auditors is responsible for reviewing management programs and policies regarding the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal controls over the accounting and financial reporting systems within the Company, including management’s response to internal control recommendations of the external auditors. The Audit Committee reviews, with the assistance of the external auditors, management plans regarding changes in accounting practices and policies and the financial impact thereof and is responsible for reviewing the major areas of management judgment and estimates that have a significant effect upon the financial statements. The Committee receives a yearly report from the external auditors with respect to the Company’s financial control and financial reporting systems, which comes to their attention during the course of conducting the year-end audit. Results of that update are relayed by the Committee to the full Board for its consideration. At least once a year, the Audit Committee meets with the Company’s external auditors without management present and may do so at any time throughout the rest of the year. All financial statements, quarterly reports, and other mandated disclosures that are publicly disseminated containing financial information are reviewed by the Audit Committee prior to release for approval.
  Audit Committee Mandate - October 2014 Compensation Committee
The Board has appointed a Compensation Committee comprised of Keith Macdonald as Chairman of the Committee, Murray Cobbe, Steve Pully and W.C. (Mickey) Dunn, all of whom are considered independent directors for the purposes of National Instrument 58-101 - Disclosure of Corporate Governance Practices, and the rules of the NYSE. The committee’s mandate is to formally make recommendations to the Board in respect of compensation issues relating to directors, senior management and staff of the Company, including recommending performance objectives and the compensation package for the Chief Executive Officer.
  Compensation Committee Mandate - October 2014 Reserves, Safety & Environmental Committee
The Board has appointed a Reserve, Safety & Environmental Committee comprised of Murray Todd as Chairman of the Committee, Murray Cobbe and Keith Macdonald, all of whom are considered independent directors. The Reserves, Safety & Environmental Committee is responsible for reviewing the independent engineering report provided to the Company. The Committee will also meet with the independent engineers without management present to discuss the submitted report.  Reserves, Safety & Environmental Committee Mandate - November 2015 Other Committees The Board does not have a nominating Committee; the responsibilities of such a committee form part of the mandate of the Corporate Governance Committee. As new directors have joined the Board, management has provided these individuals with, among other things, historical information about the Company and its performance, background information regarding the Company and its strategic plan with an outline of the general duties and responsibilities entailed in carrying out their duties. The Board believes that these procedures have proved to be a practical and effective approach in light of the Company’s particular circumstances, including the size of the Company, limited turnover of the directors and the experience and expertise of the Board members. Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
 The Board of Directors of Bellatrix has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and a Whistle Blowing Policy, all of which reflect Bellatrix’s commitment to the highest standards of professional and ethical conduct from its Directors, officers and employees and reflects Bellatrix’s commitment to a culture of honesty, integrity and accountability and outlines the basic principles and policies with which all employees are expected to comply and addresses a number of important topics, including conflicts of interest, corporate opportunities, confidentiality, protection and proper use of Company assets, insider trading, fair dealing, compliance with laws, rules and regulations, discrimination and harassment, safety and health, accuracy of Company records and reporting, political activities and contributions and reporting of illegal or unethical behaviour.

Home/ Operations/ Areas




Areas Bellatrix has established a large concentrated land base in west central Alberta, Canada. The Company maintains a large inventory of high impact liquids rich natural gas drilling locations in the Spirit River formation and higher liquids weighted opportunities in the Cardium formation that provide a balanced opportunity set of both natural gas and oil weighted investment opportunities. Bellatrix’s strategy is to control regional facilities and infrastructure in our core areas providing low cost operations and availability of processing capacity for future growth.  The Spirit River formation contains broad, thick, extensive sand rich valleys in the Notikewin, Falher and Wilrich members.  Bellatrix has several years history of successful exploitation in all three members of the Spirit River formation which is targeted for liquids rich natural gas.  Bellatrix controls over 150 net sections of land in its core west central area prospective for the Spirit River with an estimated future drilling inventory of over 390 net wells.   The Cardium resource play is the largest accumulation of light oil in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin developed to date spanning approximately 20,000 square miles with over 1.9 billion barrels produced to date. Bellatrix controls one of the largest positions across the Cardium trend with nearly 240 net future drilling locations.

Now the company puts forth a growth agenda in an attempt to resume growth.The three-year development plan centers around increasing E&P budget on the Spirit River play using internal funds.Per the company, with midstream investment tapering off and drilling and capital efficiency improving, more capital can be allocated to drilling.However, funds flow from operations cannot cover capex at the current level of commodity prices, which may imply more asset dispositions to three-year growth.We await the 2Q 2017 release to learn more about the new management, particularly whether they are walking their talk and delivering operational improvements.Please note: This article is an excerpt abbreviated from a full-length research report published as part of The Upstream Oil Hub, our exclusive service on the Seeking Alpha Marketplace platform. 1. Introduction After years of mismanagement, Bellatrix Exploration Ltd. (NYSE: BXE)[TSX: BXE] got itself into a quagmire. The junior Canadian petroleum exploration and production company had tried to raise as much money as it could, through equity dilution and various forms of debt. It used the money to buy up a large swath of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin, even though its limited operational capacity would never allow it to develop much of the hoarded land; it went full speed into surface infrastructure projects, in spite of the usual and more capital-efficient approach to outsource such projects to midstream specialists. The investors were given a beautiful mirage of steroid-powered growth through acquisitions after acquisitions. All seemed well until the oil prices crashed in 2014 (Fig. 1). Suddenly, one after another piece of land, which they used to adulate as strategically crucial for the firm's future hence however high a price would be justified, was labeled "non-core" and disposed in quick order, to raise capital so as to avoid covenant breach and so that operation can go on.
 Incredibly, these beggars-can't-be-choosers fire sales were extolled as "strategic repositioning" feats in which the management accomplished "increased asset concentration, a materially stronger balance sheet and an enhanced net asset value" (see here), as though the buy-high-sell-low never led to the evaporation of millions of dollars in asset value. 

Fig. 1. Stock Chart of BXE, after barchart.com. In retrospect, we now know that the management has failed to deliver consistent organic growth in every measure, from land holdings via reserves to production, except for one, which is the enrichment of themselves; over the years, they have cumulatively pocketed 27% of the company through stock option grants. In contrast, many investors, from some Wall Street hotshots to small independent shareholders, lost money. There is no wonder that investors have been avoiding the stock as of late, as though it were a leper. Amidst all of these depressing developments, Brent Eshleman was promoted to president and CEO in November 2016 and became a member of the board of directors on February 15, 2017, while Max Lof was hired as CFO on June 19, 2017. Eshleman had been executive vice president and chief operating officer at Bellatrix since 2012. Will he be able to steer the so-far-rudderless ship out of the shallow and send it sailing again toward profitable growth? 2. Source of capital Historically, Bellatrix raised capital through the issuance of share capital, convertible debentures, senior notes and bank borrowings to fund its operations including asset acquisition. In 2016, it further diluted equity through an $80 million of bought deal financing and $10 million of CDE flow-through financing. However, the oil crash served to expose the precarious state of its book and forced it to reduce debt level by repaying bank borrowings, convertible debentures beginning 2015 (Fig. 2).
 By the end of 1Q 2017, it had reduced bank debt from $341 million to $41 million and cut total net debt from $718 million to $435 million. As announced on June 14, 2017, Bellatrix sold its Strachan assets for total proceeds of $34.5 million, also gone being 1,750 boe/d production. Sale proceeds will be used to reduce indebtedness further down to approximately $30 million (see here); however, approximately $15 million will be allocated to drilling additional Spirit River wells.

Fig. 2. Bellatrix capital raising by year, author's chart based on data compiled from company releases, filings, and presentations. Although it is a bona fide value-destructing proposition to reverse purchases made in the boom years and offload them at such an inopportune time as an industry cyclical trough, the company resorted to whatever options they had so as to avoid bankruptcy and to pull itself out of the hole that it had dug for itself. From the beginning of 2016 to mid-2017, the company had sold upstream assets in Pembina, Harmattan, and Strachan, in association with the 5,756 boe/d production, to raise $162 million; it disposed facilities in May 2016 for gross proceeds of $75 million, and for $113 million, sold a 35% interest in the Alder Flats Plant, which it had gambled on a quick rebound of oil prices by using bank credit line to construct. In aggregate, the company raised $350 million through asset dispositions (Fig. 3). 


 Fig. 3. Recent capital raising transactions, after company presentation of June 2017. Going forward, the company may not be able to resort to debt at least for a while, which leave the following options for it to access capital: the cash flow generated from operations, capital raised through additional equity dilution, and selling more upstream and midstream assets. The management is currently pursuing a "three-year development plan designed to deliver internally funded production volume growth targeting a compounded annual growth rate of +/- 15%." The issuance of share capital may be a stretch to qualify as an internal fund, but they may consider money generated by additional asset disposition as an internally generated fund. 3. Capital allocation With the capital requirement for surface facilities especially the Adler Flats Plant construction tapering off, an increasingly higher percentage of capital will be deployed to exploration and development over the next few years (Fig. 4). The company appears to be refocusing on organic growth through exploration and development. 

 Fig. 4. Allocation of capital to drilling, surface facilities, and land, G&G and other, after company presentation of June 2017. 3.1. Spirit River focus After a series of land asset dispositions, Bellatrix now retreats to Ferrier, Willesden Green and Greater Pembina area in southwestern Alberta. This area is situated in the so-called Deep Basin, known for the emerging Spirit River liquids-rich gas play. Bellatrix holds 204 gross, or 112 net, land sections in Ferrier, Willesden Green, and Greater Pembina area, where the company has identified 86 proved, 30 probable, and 265 unbooked drilling locations (Fig. 5). The company has $0.85/Mcfe full-cycle F&D costs and $2.10/Mcfe cash costs under C$3/GJ (Fig. 6), after years of efficiency improvement.

Fig. 6. Full-cycle F&D costs and cash costs of the Spirit River play, modified after company presentation of June 2017. 3.2. 2017 capital budget On January 5, 2017, Bellatrix announced a $105 million net capital budget for the year of 2017, aiming to grow organically by over 10% forecast production growth and key strategic infrastructure investment. After the closing of the $34.5 million Strachan asset sale, the company updated the 2017 capital plan. The exploration and development spending was increased from $105 million to $120 million, to drill an additional four Spirit River wells in 2H 2017 to replace the 1,750 boe/d of lost production due to asset disposition and slightly beat the previously announced production guidance (Fig. 7). Consequently, the FFO will stay about the same. 

Fig. 7. The updated 2017 capital budget and guidance, modified after company news release of January 5, 2017. 4. Forecast production growth Production from the Spirit River play, at around 25,400 boe/d, contributes 73% of the sales volume of the entire company as of 1Q 2017, implying its emergence as the new growth engine of the company. In order to fulfill the compounded annual growth rate of 15% between 2017 and 2019, total production volume needs to increase by 52% from the 4Q 2016 production of 31,888 boe/d to reach 48,498 boe/d by end-2019. The company determined from the Spirit River type curve that a drilling program of approximately 14 net Spirit River wells per year is sufficient to maintain production in the current level of around 35,000 boe/d through 2020. We extrapolate the company's calculation by doubling the number of net Spring River wells in the drilling program. We found that it is more than enough to reach the 48,500 boe/d goal by drilling 28 net Spring River wells per year (Fig. 8).
 How large will a capital expenditure be required to implement a 28 net Spring River well drilling program? According to the full-cycle F&D costs of $5.1 million per well (the company still needs to spend on land, seismic and facilities), Bellatrix will need to spend $143 million per year over the next three years. As a comparison, the company is currently executing a $120 million capex budget. Does this imply more asset dispositions to come? 

Fig. 8. Forecast production profiles by drilling 14 or 28 net Spring River wells per year, as compared with production CAGR of 15%, modified after company presentation of June 2017. 5. Discussion and Conclusion Investors hanging on to the shares bought in for e.g., 2013-2014, had better assess the company as what it is here and now. The fairest treatment that the company can wish for is to be judged as a junior company, which is trying to start with a clean slate. Delivery of a 15% per year organic growth in terms of production over the next three years is a promise made by the new management of the company. For all intents and purposes, the promise is better to be viewed as a contract between the company and shareholders by the management. As they vouch for themselves on this contract, they consequently put their integrity and honesty on the line. For the poor shareholders had been given too many promises which vaporized, saddled with too heavy a debt load which had to be dealt with by selling much of the assets at a fraction of what was paid for. The investors deserve better. We have learned, particularly for this company, to watch how it walks the talk rather than allow oneself to be engrossed by the pep talk of the management. Although we are examining the company under a new management, it usually pays to keep a healthy level of distrust of the management. By reviewing the major moves taken by the company since the new management took the reins, we found mixed signals. On the one hand, the firm is yet to own up to the value-destructive flounders over the last few years, which they should not scapegoat entirely on farm-in partners or even the oil price crash.
 On the other hand, asset dispositions went on as planned, which led to a much more robust balance sheet, thus setting the stage for the company's resumption of organic growth. In January 2017, the company timidly rolled out a capital budget calling for a 10% production growth, which is more or less even with FFO. By June 2017, the growth target has been silently raised to 15%. We certainly hope that the rising target has not been a consequence of the $34.5 million Strachan asset sale because selling assets to pursue growth does not come across as a sustainable strategy. Even according to the updated capital budget and guidance, the company seems to have a shortfall between FFO and capex. It seems a truly profitable growth awaits materially improved commodity prices. Like many observers of Bellatrix, we are anxiously waiting for the release of 2Q 2017 operational and financial results to test whatever hypotheses concerning the future of the company, which we may have come up with.

 (1) Basic weighted average shares for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were 246,585,828 (2016: 191,963,910). In computing weighted average diluted profit per share, weighted average diluted cash flow from operating activities per share, and weighted average diluted funds flow from operations per share for the three months ended March 31, 2017, a total of nil (2016: nil) common shares were added to the denominator as a consequence of applying the treasury stock method to the Company's outstanding share options, and a total of 30,864,200 (2016: nil) common shares issuable on conversion of the Convertible Debentures (as defined below) were added to the denominator for the three month periods resulting in diluted weighted average common shares of 277,450,028 (2016: 191,963,910).  





 (2) The terms "funds flow from operations", "funds flow from operations per share", "total net debt", and "adjusted working capital deficiency", do not have standard meanings under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Refer to "Capital performance measures" disclosed at the end of this Press Release. 





 (3) Property dispositions – cash does not include transaction costs. 





 (4) The terms "operating netbacks", "total capital expenditures – net", and "total revenue" do not have standard meanings under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Refer to "Non-GAAP measures" disclosed at the end of this Press Release. 





 (5) A boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf:1 bbl has been used, which is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different than the energy equivalency of the conversion ratio, utilizing the 6:1 conversion ratio may be misleading as an indication of value. 





 (6) The Company has entered into various commodity price risk management contracts which are considered to be economic hedges.  Per unit metrics after risk management include only the realized portion of gains or losses on commodity contracts.  The Company does not apply hedge accounting to these contracts.  As such, these contracts are revalued to fair value at the end of each reporting date.  This results in recognition of unrealized gains or losses over the term of these contracts which is reflected each reporting period until these contracts are settled, at which time realized gains or losses are recorded.  These unrealized gains or losses on commodity contracts are not included for purposes of per unit metrics calculations disclosed. 





  (7) Fully diluted common shares outstanding for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were 287,760,127 (2016: 203,515,245). This includes 10,310,099 (2016: 11,551,335) of share options outstanding and 30,864,200 (2016: nil) of shares issuable on conversion of the Convertible Debentures. Shares issuable on conversion of the Convertible Debentures are calculated by dividing the $50 million principal amount of the Convertible Debentures by the conversion price of $1.62 per share. 





 (8) TSX and Other includes the trading statistics for the Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSX") and other Canadian trading markets. 




PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
Execution of our strategic three year development plan previously announced in January 2017 began in earnest during the first quarter of 2017, marking the resumption of Bellatrix's long term profitable growth.  The Company delivered on its objectives, exceeding the previously set full year 2017 production guidance target and providing clear line of sight to deliver +/-15% compound annual growth in production volumes over the next three years.  First quarter 2017 performance included the following operational and financial achievements:

Production volumes of 34,750 boe/d represented average volume growth of 9% compared with the previous quarter 
Funds flow from operations of $14.9 million grew 77% compared with the previous quarter 
Production expenditures of $9.37/boe were reduced by $1.20/boe or 11% from the previous quarter

Bellatrix has built a strong and sustainable business anchored by three pillars that provide the foundation for long term profitable growth: 1) high quality assets and acreage, 2) infrastructure ownership and control and 3) takeaway capacity and market egress.
High quality assets & acreage
Bellatrix is positioned to accelerate profitable growth of our large asset base as evidenced by our first quarter 2017 operational performance.  The core foundational assets for the Company reside in a proven area of the Deep Basin in west central Alberta, known for its exceptional geologic and hydrocarbon bearing characteristics.  Bellatrix maintains a dominant core acreage position along the Deep Basin fairway with decades of development ready opportunities anchored by our large inventory of net identified Spirit River and Cardium well locations and the Company retains significant torque to a higher crude oil price environment through its Cardium position.  
The Spirit River liquids rich natural gas play represents one of North America's lowest supply cost natural gas plays and delivers strong rates of return at current natural gas prices.  Rate of return expectations for the Spirit River continue to rank among the highest within our portfolio of investment opportunities thereby attracting the majority of anticipated capital investment in 2017.  Bellatrix has proven itself as a premier operator within the Spirit River play, consistently delivering industry leading well productivity results which drive strong rates of return for every capital dollar invested.  To that end, the first two wells completed in early February of Bellatrix's 2017 Spirit River program ranked as two of the best wells in Alberta during the month, followed by the remaining first quarter program wells being completed and placed on stream at or above internal expectations.  Our top tier acreage position and material running room provide a key long term competitive advantage for the Company.
Infrastructure ownership and control
Infrastructure ownership, operatorship and control creates significant barriers to competition within our core area thus ensuring operational flexibility and reliability to profitably process our production volumes and extract maximum value from each product stream. Since 2013, Bellatrix has invested approximately $350 million in strategic infrastructure assets within its core west central Alberta area providing above ground control of the region and creating significant barriers to industry competition. The capital build out for our long term growth strategy is nearly complete with investment in the Bellatrix O'Chiese Nees-Ohpawganu'ck deep-cut gas plant at Alder Flats (the "Alder Flats Plant"), ownership in two other major natural gas processing plants, operatorship and control of nine major compressor stations, and direct operatorship in over 1,000 kilometres of strategic gathering systems and pipelines.  Bellatrix's historic investment in key strategic infrastructure and facilities provide the processing capacity and capability to grow net Company production volumes beyond 60,000 boe/d, with minimal future facility related capital.  With the proportion of capital to facilities projects expected to materially reduce in 2018 and beyond, Bellatrix anticipates directing incremental capital directly to the drill bit, thereby enhancing already industry leading corporate capital efficiency metrics.  
Takeaway capacity and market egress
The third pillar that provides a key competitive advantage and underpins the Company's long term profitable growth profile is ensuring ample takeaway capacity and market egress for our production volumes.  Bellatrix maintains several long term firm transportation ("FT") agreements, ensuring market egress for current and forecast production, currently representing approximately 120% of current gross operated natural gas volumes at multiple receipt points on the Nova Gas Transmission Ltd. (the "NGTL") system.  The NGTL system has experienced, and is expected to experience further curtailments of both interruptible and firm service capacity as the operator continues work through 2017 to expand capacity along the system.  With excess FT relative to current production levels, Bellatrix is well positioned to deliver volumes with minimal impacts during periods of system curtailments.  Bellatrix previously negotiated additional FT capacity to facilitate increased growth volumes from Phase 2 of its Alder Flats Plant which provides additional strategic long term value for the Company. Bellatrix also maintains firm service contracts through a number of third party processing plants in its greater core Ferrier region to ensure unfettered delivery capability for current and planned production growth, with staggered contract maturity dates to align with the in-service date of Phase 2 of the Alder Flats Plant.  Finally, Bellatrix has secured fractionation capacity for its natural gas liquids ("NGL") volumes by way of long term agreements providing 100% coverage for current and forecast NGL volumes from both Phase 1 and Phase 2 of its Alder Flats Plant.  The foresight to obtain and control firm transportation along the main transmission system for not only current but also forecast growth volumes provides a key competitive long term advantage for the Company.
ENHANCED OUR ALREADY STRONG RISK MANAGEMENT POSITION 
Bellatrix continued to protect its long term strategic plan by adding to its already strong risk management position during the first quarter of 2017.  Bellatrix maintains approximately 64% of forecast gross natural gas volumes in 2017 hedged at an average fixed price of approximately $3.36/mcf (based on the mid-point of the updated 2017 average gross production guidance of 34,500 boe/d; 76% natural gas weighted).  In addition, the Company has in place material risk management protection in 2018 with a total of 65.6 MMcf/d of 2018 natural gas volumes hedged at an average fixed price of approximately $3.08/mcf; this represents approximately 42% of volumes compared to the mid-point of the updated 2017 full year average guidance. Strong propane prices in the first quarter of 2017 provided an attractive opportunity for Bellatrix to hedge 1,500 bbl/d of propane volumes at an average price of 51% of WTI light oil prices from February through December of 2017, and 1,000 bbl/d of propane volumes at an average price of 47% of WTI light oil prices in 2018, both meaningfully above long term historical averages.  Bellatrix's hedging program is part of its overall risk management strategy focused on providing reduced commodity price volatility and greater assurance over future revenue and cash flows which help drive the capital and reinvestment decisions within our business.
STRONG OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE ACHIEVED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2017
Bellatrix delivered strong operational performance through the first quarter of 2017. First quarter average production of 34,750 boe/d (75% natural gas weighted) surpassed the Company's 2017 prior average annual guidance (mid-point) estimate of 33,500 boe/d.  With first quarter objectives solidly met, Bellatrix remains favourably positioned to deliver strong results through 2017 with second quarter production levels currently exceeding management expectations.  With strong operational performance and momentum, Bellatrix is increasing its 2017 production guidance target as discussed in the Outlook section of this release.
Our focus on operational execution and delivery of our three year growth strategy was evident by the strong results achieved during the first quarter of 2017.  Bellatrix participated in 13 gross (10.6 net) wells in the first quarter which included 8 gross (7.6 net) operated Spirit River wells, 2 gross (2.0 net) operated Cardium wells and also 3 gross (1.0 net) non-operated wells in the Spirit River and Ellerslie formations.  Of the ten gross operated wells drilled during the first quarter, eight were brought on-stream during the first three months of the year, with the remaining operated Spirit River well subsequently brought on-stream in early April, and the one remaining Cardium operated well drilled and planned for completion and on-stream delivery in the third quarter of 2017.  
Bellatrix completed its planned first quarter capital program with exploration and development expenditures of $44.0 million and an unchanged expectation to spend approximately half of the full year's net capital expenditure budget of $105 million within the first six months of the year. 
First quarter production expenses averaged $9.37/boe, representing a marked reduction of $1.20/boe from the $10.57/boe production expenditure level in the fourth quarter of 2016.  First quarter production expenditure levels and anticipated production and expense levels position Bellatrix to maintain its full year average production expenditure guidance of approximately $9.00/boe. Previously set year 2017 guidance expectations refer to Bellatrix's guidance as announced on January 5, 2017; updated guidance metrics are included in the forward guidance section of this press release.

OPERATIONAL UPDATE 
With the conclusion of all joint venture drilling in 2016, Bellatrix has demonstrated the flexibility in 2017 to balance infill development drilling and expanded core area development.  The Company remains focused on growing production, adding reserves, and increasing our inventory of development drilling locations.  Bellatrix's working interest in operated wells drilled in the first quarter of 2017 averaged 96%.  Well results from the first quarter program continue to meet and exceed management expectations. To that end, Bellatrix is pleased to provide enhanced transparency for its operated 2017 development program results including the:

100/1-30-44-09W5 Spirit River (100% working interest) well IP85: 14.5 MMcf/d 
102/1-6-45-09W5 Spirit River (100% working interest) well IP50: 10.6 MMcf/d 
102/1-19-44-09W5 Spirit River (67% working interest) well IP70: 12.1 MMcf/d 
102/16-30-44-09W5 Spirit River (100% working interest) well IP50: 11.3 MMcf/d 
100/4-06-45-09W5 Spirit River (100% working interest) well IP35: 10.0 MMcf/d 
102/16-11-45-07W5 Spirit River (100% working interest) well IP20: 8.6 MMcf/d 
100/3-6-45-09W5 Spirit River (100% working interest) well IP30: 9.9 MMcf/d 
100/5-19-43-09W5 Spirit River (92% working interest) well IP20: 5.9 MMcf/d 
100/1-30-45-08W5 Cardium (100% working interest) well IP55: 550 boe/d

Bellatrix completed the majority of its first half program in the first three months of the year (in advance of the seasonal spring break-up period) with exploration and development capital expenditures invested during the first quarter of $44.0 million.  The Company's capital expenditure plans remain on target and in line with previously stated guidance levels for $105 million in 2017 with approximately 50% of capital expenditures to be invested within the first half of the year.
ALDER FLATS PHASE 2 EXPANSION NEARING COMPLETION WHICH REPRESENTS THE FINAL STAGE OF THE COMPANY'S LONG TERM STRATEGIC INFRASTRUCTURE BUILD-OUT 
The Alder Flats Plant represents a highly strategic asset for the Company as we continue to execute on our three year development plan to profitably grow production, expand netbacks and grow cash flow.  Phase 1 of the Alder Flats Plant has been on-stream for 21 continuous months delivering an average 96% capacity utilization rate over that period and firmly establishing the Bellatrix Alder Flats Plant as the most efficient plant in our greater west central Alberta core area. 
The Phase 2 expansion project, which will more than double gross throughput capacity at the plant to 230 MMcf/d (from 110 MMcf/d currently) remains on time and on budget for completion in the second quarter of 2018.  The Plant expansion is anticipated to drive improved revenue generation through additional higher margin NGL extraction, and provide further reductions to corporate operating costs, driving expanded corporate profit margins and cash flow.  Fabrication of all major equipment for Phase 2 is complete including compressors and propane bullets.  Fabrication and packaging of other material equipment including the condensate stabilizer, production tanks, heat medium package, and electrical equipment continues to progress according to plan and is expected to arrive on site for installation over the next several quarters.  Site construction activity will recommence late in the second quarter with scheduled pile driving activity anticipated to begin in June.  Major equipment will begin being delivered to site, with installation activities and mechanical work planned to begin in the third quarter of 2017.  
Bellatrix's investment in strategic infrastructure assets within the greater Ferrier and Willesden Green areas of west central Alberta provide the above ground control of the region and create significant barriers to industry competition.  The capital build out for our long term growth strategy is nearly complete given prior period investment in the Alder Flats Plant, major compressor stations, and strategic gathering systems and pipelines.  Bellatrix forecasts net capital expenditures of approximately $13 million in 2017 and $3 million in 2018 (excluding received partner prepayment) required to complete Phase 2 of the Alder Flats Plant which will solidify our infrastructure control, and provide the facilities and processing capacity to grow net production volumes beyond 60,000 boe/d, with minimal future facility related capital.
Completion of Phase 2 of the Alder Flats Plant, which will add an incremental 30 MMcf/d ownership capacity net to Bellatrix's 25% working interest, is expected to deliver a favourable step change reduction in operating costs down by approximately $1.00/boe relative to current full year 2017 average production expense guidance.
INDUSTRY LEADING WELL RESULTS AND CONTINUED CAPITAL COST SUPPRESSION EFFORTS
Bellatrix has established itself as a premier operator in west central Alberta, continuously delivering top tier well results from its Spirit River development program through the first quarter of 2017, coupled with continued capital cost reductions which in combination delivered another extremely capital efficient quarter.  All-in (drill, complete, equip and tie-in) estimated well costs in the first quarter of 2017 averaged $3.8 million, unchanged from average costs of $3.8 million achieved in 2016 despite modest upward pressure on select completion service costs in 2017.  Bellatrix continues to supress costs and mitigate inflationary pressure on capital costs, given structural and sustainable improvements achieved within both drilling and completion practices.   
ENHANCED LIQUIDITY POSITION WITH BORROWING BASE INCREASED 20%
Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, Bellatrix amended and restated the terms of its syndicated revolving credit facilities (the "Credit Facilities"). Effective May 9, 2017, the total commitments under the Credit Facilities were set at $120 million, comprised of a $25 million operating facility provided by a Canadian bank and a $95 million syndicated facility provided by four financial institutions.  Total commitments under the Credit Facilities were increased 20% relative to total commitments at year end 2016.  The borrowing base increase provides enhanced liquidity relative to prior levels, while maintaining Bellatrix's financial resources at a level that minimizes standby fees.  The Company remains committed to continued fiscal prudence, and achieving near term growth objectives within current capital spending guidance levels.
Other than the $41.5 million outstanding as at March 31, 2017 on the Credit Facilities, the Company has no debt maturities until 2020 and 2021.
Subsequent to the end of the first quarter 2017, Bellatrix completed two separate transactions whereby it monetized its $15 million vendor take back loan receivable and divested its marketable securities for combined net proceeds of approximately $20 million.  Bellatrix utilized proceeds from these two transactions to reduce the amount outstanding on its bank credit facilities to approximately $21 million as at April 30, 2017.
OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

Production volumes in the first quarter of 2017 averaged 34,750 boe/d (75% natural gas weighted), ahead of the Company's previously set full year 2017 guidance. Production levels in the first quarter 2017 increased 9% relative to fourth quarter 2016 levels, reflecting strong results achieved from the first quarter capital program. The Company was able to proactively manage system wide interruptible and firm takeaway constraints through the utilization of its strategic infrastructure including the Alder Flats Plant.  
Exploration and development capital expenditures were $44.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Capital expenditures in the quarter were focused on drilling and completion activity with 13 gross (10.6 net) wells drilled and/or participated in during the quarter. Facilities related investment net of transfers was focused primarily on the Phase 2 expansion project of the Alder Flats Plant. 
In the first quarter of 2017, Bellatrix drilled and/or participated in nine gross (7.8 net) Spirit River liquids rich natural gas wells, two gross (0.8 net) Ellerslie gas wells, and two gross (2.0 net) Cardium wells. 
Compared to first quarter 2016 levels, Bellatrix reduced bank debt by $317.2 million. At March 31, 2017, Bellatrix reduced outstanding bank debt to $41.5 million and total net debt to $435.4 million representing year over year reductions of 88% and 39%, respectively. The total net debt was reduced as proceeds from several non-core asset dispositions, facilities monetization transactions and capital financings completed in 2016 was used to reduce outstanding bank indebtedness. 
At March 31, 2017, Bellatrix had $58.5 million of undrawn capacity (approximately 59% undrawn) on its $100 million Credit Facilities excluding outstanding letters of credit of $12.9 million that reduce the amount otherwise available to be drawn on the facilities. Subsequent to quarter end, the Company entered into an amended and restated syndicated revolving credit facility agreement increasing the borrowing base of the Credit Facilities to $120 million providing enhanced liquidity compared with March 31, 2017 levels. 
For the year ended March 31, 2017, Bellatrix's Senior Debt to EBITDA (as defined below) ratio was 1.81 times, well below the financial covenant of 3.5 times as permitted by the agreement governing the credit facilities. 
Total revenue increased by 20% to $66.0 million for the first quarter 2017, compared to $55.2 million realized in the first quarter 2016 mainly attributable to an increase in commodity prices for oil, NGLs and natural gas from the comparative periods.  
The corporate royalty rate in the three months ended March 31, 2017 averaged 12% of sales (after transportation), compared to 7% in the first quarter of 2016. Higher average royalty rates over the comparative periods reflect higher commodity prices, and decreased gas cost allowance ("GCA") credits associated with prior period facilities monetization transactions completed in 2016. 
Production expenses in the first quarter 2017 averaged $9.37/boe. Production expenditures are expected to decline during 2017 and average approximately $9.00/boe during the year, as a result of cost suppression initiatives and increased production volumes which will reduce overall production expenditures on a per unit of production basis.  
The corporate operating netback (including risk management) realized for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $9.34/boe. Before risk management, the first quarter 2017 operating netback was $8.35/boe, an increase of 28% compared to the $6.50/boe netback realized in the first quarter 2016 reflecting improved realized commodity prices over the comparable periods.  
Net general and administrative ("G&A") expenses (after capitalized costs and recoveries) for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $6.0 million ($1.93/boe), compared to $4.5 million ($1.29/boe) in the comparative 2016 period. Net G&A costs increased in the current period due to an increase in gross expenses related to workforce restructuring costs and a decrease in capital recoveries from partners as a result of an increase in Bellatrix's average working interest in the operated wells drilled in the first quarter of 2017 compared with the prior period. 
Funds flow from operations generated in the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $14.9 million ($0.06 per basic and $0.05 per diluted share), an increase of 16% from $12.9 million ($0.07 per basic and diluted share) in the first quarter of 2016. Cash flow from operating activities was $8.3 million in the first quarter 2017 ($0.03 per basic and diluted share) a decrease of 19% from $10.3 million ($0.05 per basic and diluted share) in the first quarter of 2016.  
The net profit for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $13.0 million compared to a net profit of $19.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in net profit period over period is due to a decrease in the unrealized foreign exchange gain, offset by an increase in the operating netbacks realized.  
As at March 31, 2017, Bellatrix had approximately 173,595 net undeveloped acres of land in Alberta, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan. 
At March 31, 2017, Bellatrix had approximately $1.49 billion in tax pools available for deduction against future income.

OUTLOOK
Management's acute focus on operational execution during the first quarter of 2017 resulted in production volume outperformance relative to previously set full year 2017 average guidance levels, enabling management to increase our full year guidance expectations as described below. The majority of our first half capital investment program was completed during the first three months of the year, as capital investment activities are customarily curtailed during the second quarter, given the seasonal spring break-up period.  Average second quarter 2017 production levels are anticipated to commensurately meet the revised full year average guidance of 34,500 boe/d given strong well results and strong operational momentum achieved during the first quarter of 2017.  
Our capital investment plans for 2017 remain unchanged; Bellatrix plans to expand its drilling efforts across our core west central Alberta acreage including expanded development of the Spirit River formation in the Willesden Green area, following on our success in the Ferrier area. With the completion of joint venture programs in 2016, Bellatrix has strategically reviewed its drilling program to optimize capital investment, forecast rates of return, and long term net asset value and reserve growth potential.  Our current 2017 capital expenditure guidance anticipates drilling approximately 19 net wells during the year, of which approximately 10.6 wells were drilled during the first quarter of the year with one operated Cardium well currently uncompleted.  Our focused capital investment program is supported by an active risk management program, and will continue to target the low cost and high return Spirit River liquids rich natural gas play which delivers strong rates of return. 
INCREASED 2017 PRODUCTION GUIDANCE WITH NO CHANGE TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES GIVEN STRONG OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE 
Strong first quarter operational results and positive momentum into the second quarter provide visibility to meaningfully outperform prior forecast guidance expectation levels.  To that end, Bellatrix is increasing its full year 2017 average production guidance expectation to 34,500 boe/d, an increase of 1,000 boe/d from prior guidance announced on January 5, 2017.  Bellatrix has maintained its full year capital expenditure guidance at $105 million despite the increase in average production levels.  Bellatrix remains committed to providing sustainable long term growth for shareholders including delivery of our 2017 capital program providing +/-15% forecast production growth.

Bellatrix focused its capital activity in the first quarter of 2017 on drilling and completion activity within the Spirit River formation, as well as facilities and equipment expenditures related to the construction of Phase 2 of the Alder Flats Plant.  Bellatrix continues to advance the Phase 2 expansion project of the Alder Flats Plant which is expected to more than double the inlet capacity of the Plant from 110 MMcf/d currently to 230 MMcf/d.  The project remains on time and budget, and is scheduled for completion in the second quarter 2018.  
Subsequent to the first quarter of 2017, Bellatrix closed an agreement to complete the construction of, and transfer to a third party midstream company, certain production facilities and infrastructure in exchange for proceeds of $20 million.  Capital expenditures of $5.6 million were incurred in the first quarter 2017 and will be transferred under the agreement to the third party midstream company in the second quarter of 2017. Under the terms of the arrangement, Bellatrix will have exclusive access to, and operatorship of, the infrastructure.
Undeveloped Land
At March 31, 2017, Bellatrix had approximately 173,595 undeveloped acres of land in Alberta, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan.

Management believes that, in addition to cash flow from operating activities, funds flow from operations is a useful supplemental measure as it demonstrates the Company's ability to generate the cash necessary to fund future capital investments and to repay debt.  Funds flow from operations is calculated as cash flow from operating activities, excluding decommissioning costs incurred and changes in non-cash working capital incurred.
Bellatrix's cash flow from operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 decreased by 19% to $8.3 million ($0.03 per basic and diluted share) from $10.3 million ($0.05 per basic and diluted share) generated in the first quarter of 2016.  Bellatrix generated funds flow from operations of $14.9 million ($0.06 per basic and $0.05 per diluted share) in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 16% from $12.9 million ($0.07 per basic and diluted share) generated in the comparative 2016 period.  Funds flow increased in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily from the increased realized commodity prices over the comparable period.  
For the three months ended March 31, 2017, Bellatrix recognized net profit of $13.0 million ($0.05 per basic share and diluted share), compared to a net profit of $19.3 million ($0.10 per basic and diluted share) in the first quarter of 2016 due to a decrease in the unrealized foreign exchange gain in the first quarter of 2017, offset by an increase in the operating netbacks realized.

 (1) Total revenue includes petroleum and natural gas sales and other income 




The operating netback before commodity price risk management contracts for crude oil, condensate, NGLs, and natural gas during the first quarter of 2017 averaged $8.35/boe, an increase of 28% from the $6.50/boe realized during the same period in 2016 reflecting improved realized commodity prices over the comparable periods.
Total revenue increased by 20% to $66.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $55.2 million realized in the first quarter of 2016. The increase in total revenue was mainly attributable to an increase in commodity prices for oil, NGLs and natural gas from the comparative periods. Total revenue from crude oil, condensate, and NGLs contributed 38% of total first quarter 2017 revenue before other income, royalties, and commodity price risk management contracts, compared to 40% in the three months ended March 31, 2016.
In the three months ended March 31, 2017, production expenses totaled $29.3 million ($9.37/boe), compared to $25.8 million ($7.37/boe) recorded in the same period of 2016.  Production expenditures are expected to decline during 2017 and average $9.00/boe during the year, given cost suppression initiatives and increased production volumes which reduce overall production expenditures on a per unit of production basis.
For the three months ended March 31, 2017, Bellatrix incurred royalties of $7.4 million, compared to $3.4 million in the first quarter of 2016.  Overall royalties as a percentage of revenue (after transportation costs) in the first quarter of 2017 were 12% compared to 7% in the comparative 2016 period.  Higher average corporate royalty rates period over period include the impact from higher commodity prices as well as decreased GCA credits in the current period than in the first quarter of 2016 when the Company had credits associated with significant infrastructure and facilities investments.

Global crude oil prices fluctuated during the first quarter 2017 as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ("OPEC") members worked to achieve production cuts and add stability to crude oil prices.  Despite the collaborative efforts between OPEC and non-OPEC producing countries in stabilizing prices, WTI oil prices exhibited volatility, opening the year at US$53.72/bbl, reaching a low of US$47.00/bbl during the first quarter of 2017, before recovering to US$50.60/bbl at March 31, 2017. Robust global crude inventories and weekly increases in the United States oil directed drilling rig count are factors that tempered oil prices strengthening during the first quarter of 2017. 
North American natural gas prices declined during February of 2017 as warmer than normal weather kept heating demand at lower than expected levels. United States natural gas storage inventories at March 31, 2017 were 427 Bcf below last year's record high level, while declining United States production levels have added support to natural gas prices, rebounding from US$2.44/MMBtu in late February to close the first quarter at US$3.10/MMBtu. Total United States natural gas production continues to decline despite increased drilling activity. The combination of lower production, higher exports of liquefied natural gas ("LNG") and increased gas supplies to Mexico improved supply/demand dynamics in the market. Overall, industry activity levels are causing a slower supply response given backwardation in the forward pricing market.
In the first quarter of 2017 Bellatrix realized an average price of $67.30/bbl before commodity price risk management contracts for crude oil and condensate, an increase of 71% from the average price of $39.33/bbl received in the first quarter of 2016.  By comparison, Canadian Light crude blend price increased by 57% and the average WTI crude oil benchmark price increased by 54% between the first quarters of 2017 and 2016.  The WTI/Canadian Light sweet differential has remained in a historically tight range, averaging -US$3.54/bbl for the quarter. 
Bellatrix's average realized price for NGLs (excluding condensate) increased by 76% to $18.18/bbl during the first quarter of 2017, compared to $10.35/bbl received in the comparable 2016 period. NGL pricing in Western Canada improved significantly through the fourth quarter of 2016 given stronger underlying light oil prices and improved individual market conditions for propane and butane products.  Normal winter demand through the first quarter of 2017 kept North American propane demand firm, while exports materially reduced robust storage levels resulting in much stronger propane prices through the quarter.  Butane prices closely track the trend in WTI pricing and thus exhibited similar volatility to oil prices during the first quarter of 2017. Butane prices improved in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 and Bellatrix's average realized NGL price reflected the improvement in butane prices by 75% year over year.  
Natural gas prices increased during the first quarter of 2017 given strong demand and lower United States production resulting in reduced storage levels.  Bellatrix's natural gas sales are priced with reference to the daily or monthly AECO indices.  Bellatrix's natural gas sold has a higher heat content than the industry average, which results in slightly higher realized prices per mcf than the AECO daily index.  During the first quarter of 2017, the AECO daily reference price increased by 47% and the AECO monthly reference price increased by approximately 39% compared to the first quarter of 2016.  Bellatrix's natural gas average sales price before commodity price risk management contracts for the first quarter of 2017 increased by 44% to $2.87/mcf compared to $1.99/mcf in the same period in 2016.  Bellatrix's natural gas average price after including commodity price risk management contracts for the three months ended March 31, 2017 averaged $3.09/mcf compared to $2.41/mcf in the comparative 2016 period. Bellatrix was active in the first quarter of 2017 increasing its 2017 risk management protection, with approximately 64% of 2017 gross natural gas volumes hedged at an average fixed price of approximately $3.36/mcf. 
Debt
Bank Debt
At March 31, 2017, the Company had $41.5 million outstanding under its syndicated revolving Credit Facilities at a weighted average interest rate of 4.45%. As at March 31, 2017, the Company's Credit Facilities were available on an extendible revolving term basis and consisted of a $100 million facility provided by nine financial institutions, subject to a borrowing base test.  The maturity date of the Credit Facilities was October 1, 2017 as at March 31, 2017. Subsequent to March 31, 2017, Bellatrix entered into an amended and restated syndicated revolving credit facility agreement provided by four financial institutions increasing the borrowing base of the Credit Facilities to $120 million. Under the amended and restated terms, the Credit Facilities are available on an extendible revolving term basis and consists of a $25 million operated facility and a $95 million syndicated facility. Under the amended and restated terms, the Credit Facilities have an initial term of one year that is extendible annually at the option of the Company, subject to lender approval, with a 1 year term-out period if not renewed.  Availability under the Credit Facilities is subject to a borrowing base test, which will be subject to redetermination in May and November of each year, with the next regularly scheduled redetermination to occur in November 2017.
At March 31, 2017, Bellatrix had approximately $58.5 million of available capacity based on outstanding bank debt as at such date of approximately $41.5 million (excluding letters of credit). The Credit Facilities include a single financial covenant being the Company's Senior Debt to EBITDA ratio must not exceed 3.5 times for the fiscal quarters ending on or before March 31, 2017 ("Senior Debt Covenant"). Under the amended and restated terms of the Credit Facilities, the maximum Senior Debt to EBITDA ratio has been reduced to 3.0 times (3.5 times for the two fiscal quarters immediately following a material acquisition).  As at March 31, 2017, the Senior Debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.81 times. 
Senior Notes
At March 31, 2017, the Company has outstanding US$250 million of 8.50% senior unsecured notes maturing on May 15, 2020 (the "Senior Notes").  Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually and the Senior Notes are redeemable at the Company's option, in whole or in part, commencing on May 15, 2017 at specified redemption prices.
Convertible Debentures
At March 31, 2017, the Company has outstanding $50 million principal amount of 6.75% convertible subordinated debentures (the "Convertible Debentures") due on September 30, 2021 (the "Maturity Date"). Interest on the Convertible Debentures is payable semiannually in arrears on September 30 and March 31 of each year.  




 Notes: 





 (1) "EBITDA" refers to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is calculated based on terms and definitions set out in the agreement governing the Credit Facilities which adjusts net income for financing costs, certain specific unrealized and non-cash transactions, and acquisition and disposition activity and is calculated based on a trailing twelve month basis.  EBITDA for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2017 was $67.7 million. 





 (2) "Senior Debt" is defined as Consolidated Total Debt, excluding any unsecured or subordinated debt (Senior Notes and Convertible Debentures (liability component)). "Consolidated Total Debt" is defined as determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP and without duplication, all Debt of the Company. The Company's calculation of Consolidated Total Debt excludes decommissioning liabilities and deferred tax liability. The calculation includes outstanding letters of credit, bank debt, finance lease obligations, deferred lease inducements and net working capital deficiency (excess), calculated as working capital deficiency excluding current commodity contract assets and liabilities. Senior Debt at March 31, 2017 was $122.6 million.

Common shares of Bellatrix trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange and on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "BXE".  
NON-GAAP MEASURESThroughout this press release, the Company uses terms that are commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry, but do not have a standardized meaning presented by International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") and therefore may not be comparable to the calculations of similar measures for other entities. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors and shareholders as the measures provide increased transparency and the ability to better analyze performance against prior periods on a comparable basis. 
Operating netbacks are calculated by subtracting royalties, transportation, and operating expenses from total revenue.  Management believes this measure is a useful supplemental measure of the amount of total revenue received after transportation, royalties and operating expenses. The Company's calculation of total revenue includes petroleum and natural gas sales and other income, and excludes commodity price risk management. Total capital expenditures – net includes the cash impact of capital expenditures and property dispositions, as well as the non-cash capital impacts of corporate acquisitions, property acquisitions, adjustments to the Company's decommissioning liabilities, and share based compensation. Bellatrix's method of calculating this measure may differ from other entities, and accordingly, may not be comparable to measures used by other companies.  Total capital expenditures - net includes the cash impact of capital expenditures and property dispositions, as well as the non-cash capital impacts of corporate acquisitions, property acquisitions, adjustments to the Company's decommissioning liabilities, and share based compensation.
These measures have been described and presented in this news release in order to provide shareholders and potential investors with additional information regarding Bellatrix's liquidity and its ability to generate funds to finance its operations. 
CAPITAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES In addition to the non-GAAP measures described above, there are also terms that have been reconciled in the Company's financial statements to the most comparable IFRS measures. These terms do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable with the calculations of similar measures for other entities. These terms have been referenced in the Company's press release, MD&A and financial statements. These terms are used by management to analyze operating performance on a comparable basis with prior periods and to analyze the liquidity of the Company. 
This press release contains the term "funds flow from operations" which should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than "cash flow from operating activities" as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of the Company's performance. Therefore reference to funds flow from operations or funds flow from operations per share may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities. Management uses funds flow from operations to analyze operating performance and leverage and considers funds flow from operations to be a key measure as it demonstrates the Company's ability to generate the cash necessary to fund future capital investments and to repay debt.  Funds flow from operations is calculated as cash flow from operating activities, excluding decommissioning costs incurred, changes in non-cash working capital incurred, and transaction costs.  The reconciliation between cash flow from operating activities and funds flow from operations can be found in the MD&A.  Funds flow from operations per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares for the period.
This press release also contains the terms "total net debt" and "adjusted working capital deficiency", which also are not recognized measures under GAAP. Therefore reference to total net debt and adjusted working capital deficiency, may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities.  The Company's calculation of total net debt excludes other deferred liabilities, deferred capital obligations, long-term risk management contract liabilities, decommissioning liabilities, and deferred tax liabilities.  Total net debt includes the adjusted working capital deficiency, long term loans receivable, Convertible Debentures (liability component), current bank debt and long term bank debt.  The adjusted working capital deficiency is calculated as net working capital deficiency excluding current risk management contract assets and liabilities, current portion of other deferred liabilities, current portion of deferred capital obligation and the current bank debt.  Management believes these measures are useful supplementary measures of the total amount of current and long-term debt.

The use of any of the words "position", "continue", "opportunity", "expect", "plan", "maintain", "estimate", "assume", "target", "believe" "forecast", "intend", "strategy", "anticipate", "enhance" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

To the extent that any forward-looking information contained herein constitute a financial outlook, they were approved by management on May 9, 2017 and are included herein to provide readers with an understanding of the anticipated funds available to Bellatrix to fund its operations and readers are cautioned that the information may not be appropriate for other purposes.  Forward-looking statements necessarily involve risks, including, without limitation, risks associated with oil and gas exploration, development, exploitation, production, marketing and transportation, loss of markets, volatility of commodity prices, currency fluctuations, imprecision of reserve estimates, environmental risks, competition from other producers, inability to retain drilling rigs and other services, incorrect assessment of the value of acquisitions, failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, delays resulting from or inability to obtain required regulatory approvals, actions taken by the Company's lenders that reduce the Company's available credit and ability to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources.  Events or circumstances may cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted, as a result of the risk factors set out and other known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of Bellatrix. In addition, forward looking statements or information are based on a number of factors and assumptions which have been used to develop such statements and information but which may prove to be incorrect and which have been used to develop such statements and information in order to provide shareholders with a more complete perspective on Bellatrix's future operations.  Such information may prove to be incorrect and readers are cautioned that the information may not be appropriate for other purposes.  Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements or information are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on forward looking statements because the Company can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.  In addition to other factors and assumptions which may be identified herein, assumptions have been made regarding, among other things: the impact of increasing competition; the general stability of the economic and political environment in which the Company operates; the timely receipt of any required regulatory approvals; the ability of the Company to obtain qualified staff, equipment and services in a timely and cost efficient manner; drilling results; the ability of the operator of the projects which the Company has an interest in to operate the field in a safe, efficient and effective manner; the ability of the Company to obtain financing on acceptable terms; field production rates and decline rates; the ability to replace and expand oil and natural gas reserves through acquisition, development of exploration; the timing and costs of pipeline, storage and facility construction and expansion and the ability of the Company to secure adequate product transportation; future commodity prices; currency, exchange and interest rates; the regulatory framework regarding royalties, taxes and environmental matters in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates; and the ability of the Company to successfully market its oil and natural gas products.  Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list is not exhaustive of all factors and assumptions which have been used.  As a consequence, actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.  Additional information on these and other factors that could affect Bellatrix's operations and financial results are included in reports on file with Canadian and United States securities regulatory authorities and may be accessed through the SEDAR website (www.sedar.com), through the SEC website (www.sec.gov), and at Bellatrix's website (www.bellatrixexploration.com).  Furthermore, the forward looking statements contained herein are made as at the date hereof and Bellatrix does not undertake any obligation to update publicly or to revise any of the included forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by applicable securities laws.
BARRELS OF OIL EQUIVALENTThe term barrels of oil equivalent ("boe") may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent (6 mcf/bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. All boe conversions in this press release are derived from converting gas to oil in the ratio of six thousand cubic feet of gas to one barrel of oil. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.
INITIAL RATES OF PRODUCTIONReferences in this press release to initial production rates associated with certain wells are useful in confirming the presence of hydrocarbons, however such rates are not determinative of the rates at which such wells will commence production and decline thereafter and are not indicative of long term performance or of ultimate recovery. While encouraging, readers are cautioned not to place reliance on such rates in calculating the aggregate production for the Company. The Company cautions that such production rates should be considered to be preliminary.
