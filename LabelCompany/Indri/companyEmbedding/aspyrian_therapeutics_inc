Technology — Aspyrian Therapeutics, Inc.





















































Photoimmunotherapy: A New Precision Targeted Approach to Treat Cancer.Photoimmunotherapy is based on a new drug system that consist of a cancer targeting monoclonal antibody conjugated to a photoactivatable molecule. This drug conjugate is not pharmacologically active until the conjugate is bound to the cancer cells and gains anticancer activity upon light-mediated activation at the tumor site. Tumor targeting and context precision activation of the drug provides exquisite cancer specificity and permits rapid cancer cell killing without damage to the surrounding healthy tissues.Anticancer activity of Photoimmunotherapy is highly effective and it works with multiple types of monoclonal antibodies, thus the platform enables the targeting of a broad range of cancer antigens and tumor types.

SAN DIEGO, July 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Aspyrian Therapeutics, Inc., a biotechnology company developing precision-targeted cancer therapies based on the proprietary Photoimmunotherapy (PIT) platform, has closed $15.1 million as part of a Series B-1 financing round, expected to reach about $19 million in the next few weeks. The series B-1 financing was provided by private investors including Hiroshi Mikitani, the CEO of Rakuten Inc., and Chairman of Aspyrian Therapeutics' board. This financing will accelerate clinical development of its proprietary investigational compound, the antibody conjugate RM-1929, in recurrent head and neck cancer as well as other cancer areas. Development activities include initiating Phase 1 trials in Japan in 2017, completion of the ongoing Phase 2 study in the USA, initiation of a global registration clinical trial in the first half of 2018, and CMC manufacturing processes to support the launch and commercialization of RM-1929. 



Aspyrian recently presented findings from an ongoing clinical trial of RM-1929 at the American Head & Neck Society meeting, April 27, 2017 in San Diego. The presentation received the American Head & Neck Society Poster of Distinction Award in the category of Clinical Trials/NMSC/Immunotherapy. More information available at: http://www.aspyriantherapeutics.com/news-room/
Aspyrian today announced that an abstract describing clinical study results of RM-1929 was accepted for presentation at European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) held in Madrid, Spain from 8th -12th September 2017.
In addition to the development of RM-1929, Aspyrian is progressing with preclinical development of new proprietary immune oncology approaches that rapidly eliminate the immunosuppressive tumor environment and elicit innate and adaptive systemic immune responses to destroy tumors that are resistant to other classes of immune modulators, such as anti-PD1 antibodies. 
"We are honored to work with visionary private investors that support our long-term vision to create a fully integrated R&D and commercial biopharmaceutical company and realize our mission to conquer cancer. Aspyrian is fully committed to develop and commercialize novel and potentially transformative approaches to treat cancer, including RM-1929". said Miguel Garcia-Guzman, President and CEO of Aspyrian. "The Series B-1 funding will also support the progression into the clinic of novel proprietary ways to eliminate the immunosuppressive tumor environment. These approaches are designed to empower the patient's immune system so it can recognize its own tumor neoantigens and attack cancer cells, as a personalized treatment to conquer their disease".
About RM-1929
RM-1929, a conjugate of Cetuximab and IRDye 700DX®, targets epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a cancer antigen expressed in multiple types of solid tumors, including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, esophagus, lung, colon, pancreas and other cancers. This first-in-class therapy uses an antibody conjugate to precisely target cancer cells after which it is locally activated with red light to elicit rapid anti-cancer responses. The dual specificity resulting from local activation of a tumor-selective conjugate promises to deliver oncologists the ability to achieve locoregional tumor control with minimal damage to surrounding healthy tissues and structures.
RM-1929 is an investigational compound that is not approved for any use in any country.

"This clinical trial is the first of its kind to evaluate a novel therapy with a two-step targeting approach designed to deliver unparalleled tumor specificity," said Dr. Merrill Biel, M.D. Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer of Aspyrian. "Recurrent head and neck cancer patients who have failed standard treatments of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy currently have no further treatment options available. RM-1929 offers hope to these difficult-to-treat patients and has the added advantage that it targets their cancer while sparing damage to adjacent normal tissues that are critical to their quality of life, such as those required for normal speech and swallowing."
RM-1929 was developed in collaboration with Dr. Hisataka Kobayashi and Dr. Peter Choyke at the National Cancer Institute (USA), the inventors of the Photoimmunotherapy platform. "Activation of RM-1929 at the tumor triggers very rapid tumor destruction with exquisite specificity," said Miguel Garcia-Guzman, Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer at Aspyrian.

SAN DIEGO, July 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Aspyrian Therapeutics, Inc., a biotechnology company developing precision-targeted cancer therapies based on the proprietary Photoimmunotherapy (PIT) platform, has closed $15.1 million as part of a Series B-1 financing round, expected to reach about $19 million in the next few weeks. The series B-1 financing was provided by private investors including Hiroshi Mikitani, the CEO of Rakuten Inc., and Chairman of Aspyrian Therapeutics' board. This financing will accelerate clinical development of its proprietary investigational compound, the antibody conjugate RM-1929, in recurrent head and neck cancer as well as other cancer areas. Development activities include initiating Phase 1 trials in Japan in 2017, completion of the ongoing Phase 2 study in the USA, initiation of a global pivotal clinical trial in the first half of 2018, and CMC manufacturing processes to support the launch and commercialization of RM-1929.








Aspyrian recently presented findings from an ongoing clinical trial of RM-1929 at the American Head & Neck Society meeting, April 27, 2017 in San Diego. The presentation received the American Head & Neck Society Poster of Distinction Award in the category of Clinical Trials/NMSC/Immunotherapy. More information available at: http://www.aspyriantherapeutics.com/news-room/
Aspyrian today announced that an abstract describing clinical study results of RM-1929 was accepted for presentation at European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) held in Madrid, Spain from 8th -12th September 2017.
In addition to the development of RM-1929, Aspyrian is progressing with preclinical development of new proprietary immune oncology approaches that rapidly eliminate the immunosuppressive tumor environment and elicit innate and adaptive systemic immune responses to destroy tumors that are resistant to other classes of immune modulators, such as anti-PD1 antibodies.
"We are honored to work with visionary private investors that support our long-term vision to create a fully integrated R&D and commercial biopharmaceutical company and realize our mission to conquer cancer. Aspyrian is fully committed to develop and commercialize novel and potentially transformative approaches to treat cancer, including RM-1929". said Miguel Garcia-Guzman, President and CEO of Aspyrian. "The Series B-1 funding will also support the progression into the clinic of novel proprietary ways to eliminate the immunosuppressive tumor environment. These approaches are designed to empower the patient's immune system so it can recognize its own tumor neoantigens and attack cancer cells, as a personalized treatment to conquer their disease".
About RM-1929
RM-1929, a conjugate of Cetuximab and IRDye 700DX®, targets epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a cancer antigen expressed in multiple types of solid tumors, including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, esophagus, lung, colon, pancreas and other cancers. This first-in-class therapy uses an antibody conjugate to precisely target cancer cells after which it is locally activated with red light to elicit rapid anti-cancer responses. The dual specificity resulting from local activation of a tumor-selective conjugate promises to deliver oncologists the ability to achieve locoregional tumor control with minimal damage to surrounding healthy tissues and structures.
RM-1929 is an investigational compound that is not approved for any use in any country.
