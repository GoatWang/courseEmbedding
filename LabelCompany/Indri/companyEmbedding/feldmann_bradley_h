Bradley H. Feldmann (2016) 



Bradley H. Feldmann has served as president and chief executive officer of Cubic Corporation since July 2014. Feldmann was appointed to the board of directors in May 2014.
Previously, he served as the president and chief operating officer from January 2013 until assuming his current position, and as the president of the companies comprising the Cubic Defense Systems segment from 2008 through March 2013.
Prior to re-joining the company in 2008, Feldmann held senior leadership positions at OMNIPLEX World Services Corporation and ManTech International. He previously worked at Cubic Defense Systems from 1989 to 1999.
Feldmann is a graduate of the Stanford Executive Institute and holds a Master of Business Administration with honors from San Diego State University. He is also a distinguished graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and a top graduate of the USAF Squadron Officer School.
Feldmann is a Fellow of the National Association of Corporate Directors. He is also a member of the Aerospace Industries Association board of governors, and serves on the board of several organizations including the National Defense Industrial Association and UrbanLife.
Company SynopsisCubic Corporation designs, integrates and operates systems, products and services focused in the transportation, defense training and secure communications markets. As the parent company of two major business units, Cubic’s mission is to increase situational awareness and understanding for customers worldwide. Cubic Transportation Systems is a leading integrator of payment and information technology and services to create intelligent travel solutions for transportation authorities and operators. Cubic Global Defense is a leading provider of realistic combat training systems, secure communications and networking and highly specialized support services for military and security forces of the U.S. and allied nations.
What do we need to do in the U.S. to continue to be at the top of global innovation? According to statistics from the National Math + Science Initiative (NMSI), by 2009, over half of U.S. patents were awarded to non-U.S. companies because STEM shortcomings are forcing a hold on innovation. Seeing these kinds of statistics is not good when you manage a company that relies on cutting-edge products and solutions.
Cubic Corporation, founded and headquartered in San Diego, CA, is a company well known for its innovation in the transportation and defense industries. Cubic Transportation Systems (CTS) is a leading integrator of payment and information technology and services for intelligent travel solutions; and Cubic Global Defense (CGD) is a leading provider of realistic combat training systems, secure communications and networking and highly specialized support services for military and security forces of the U.S. and allied nations. Both businesses are engaged in the design, development, integration and sustainment of high-technology systems, products and services for government and commercial customers worldwide. We began as an innovation company in 1951 and we continue to be an innovation company today.
At Cubic we understand the importance of STEM and recognize the need to promote STEM-based learning to students at an early stage. To support these initiatives, Cubic and its subsidiary Intific developed a multitude of online games related to STEM to help attract America’s youth to the STEM subjects. Teaching physics to Kindergartners and promoting computer programming and robotics to middle school girls are few successful examples.
Developing STEM educational activities relatable to these age groups is critical for not only the children, but also to global companies that will need employees who studied subjects in the hard sciences related to STEM. We need to lean forward and be creative with how we attract the brilliant minds of tomorrow to STEM disciplines to spark the nation’s competitiveness.
In order to maintain Cubic’s competitiveness and to foster leading-edge innovations, we developed IdeaSpark – an internal innovation social system where our employees solicit and share ideas across the company. These ideas include the development of new products, improvements to current products or discovering solutions our customers need.
Employees are encouraged to participate. Every week, a Tech Council review submitted ideas and chooses the best “IdeaSpark” to advance to the next ‘make-it-real’ stage. This allows the idea to be provided with seed funding, researched and developed into prototype production, solution or service. Lastly, when all is complete, the idea is launched into an offered solution.
Since the inception of IdeaSpark in 2014, over 245 ideas have been submitted, 136 catalogued, 106 advanced to the ‘make-it-real’ stage and three products/solutions launched. We at Cubic believe creativity and interaction between employees is important. It’s the reason we leverage 2-3% of our revenue into research and development. Cubic is also committed to co-developing with our customers. We observe for possible pain points and brainstorm potential solutions cooperatively with customers. We rank-order these projects and make investments to a portfolio approach for short-term, long-term, incremental and game-changer products and services. Today, we have nearly 20 unique projects that are in the process of working to solve our customers’ pain points. We work on innovation projects using a phased, incremental approach to co-develop with our customers to ensure we are developing the most relevant solutions. Cubic is known for many great breakthroughs over the years, including inventing the ‘Top-gun’ training system, implementation of the first contactless-card ticketing system and the first ‘One-Account’ ticketing system using a smartphone.  We are continuously working to increase the pace of breakthroughs for our customers through our innovation social system, IdeaSpark.
Cubic is dedicated to encouraging and cultivating ideas and innovations, which start from a young age. It’s why Cubic interacts with hundreds of students, teachers and administrators who are hungry and excited for the opportunity to implement STEM technology and learning paradigms into their education curriculum. And it’s one of the many ways Cubic is global, innovative and trusted (our motto). Similarly, I believe that in order for the U.S. to be a top producer of innovation, we need to empower the youth of our country with the STEM sciences and recognize our workforce for their creativity. By making such efforts, we can maintain our competitiveness and provide better products and solutions that help make the world a better place.
Where would you advise Queen fans to buy their clothes?It really depends, there are so many places. There’s a place called Essences, that’s a very good place. They seem to get very good quality stuff, but still old, 1920’s stuff. If they have the money I’d ask them to go to Zandra Rhodes, because she’s got a place where she works and you can buy them off the rail. They’re quite beautiful.
