About ALPS






 "Do Things Right" that is our commitment to you 









Our History
ALPS Today
Our Philosophy
Our Focus
Guiding Principles







Our History

ALPS, celebrating over 30 years of customized and innovative service to the mutual fund industry, traces its roots to changes in the Glass-Steagall banking laws back in the early 1980's. Indeed, with the financial institutions deregulation act, a wide range of securities, insurance and other financial products suddenly became available to banks and thrift institutions, and banks across the country were getting into the mutual fund business.
It was inside that emerging market that company founders Bob Alexander and Art Lucey, both executives with the First National Bank of Denver, saw opportunity. Specifically, they saw a chance to create a company that provided certain specialized services that banks could not themselves offer. And so it was that in June of 1985, ALPS came to be.

  




ALPS Today





660 +
Employees and Growing






400 +
Clients Serviced






30 +
Years of Customized and Innovative Service






20 +
Years of Executive Team Tenure




In almost three decades, ALPS has evolved from its modest beginnings of servicing a single bank mutual fund client into a full-service provider to the investment management industry. Now with more than 660 employees, over 400 clients, and an executive team that's been in place for over 20 years, ALPS continues to actively promote all of its various business segments, from asset servicing through ALPS Fund Services, Inc. to asset gathering through ALPS Distributors, Inc. and ALPS Advisors, Inc.


With a combination of expertise in a broad range of products and a culture built around the founders' encouragement to "Do Things Right," ALPS is uniquely positioned in the industry to help its clients' structure, service and distribution of all product types.







Our Philosophy


We consider ourselves to be a partner to our clients, not a vendor, by providing service beyond what is required in our contracts. As highlighted in our Guiding Principles, ALPS was founded on the premise to always "Do Things Right" and this motto still flourishes within our company today.



Management at ALPS has made a conscious decision to control growth so that we never have to compromise our service levels or our reputation in the industry for delivering tailored, high-touch services to our clients. By following this philosophy, ALPS has demonstrated a consistent ability over the years to grow revenues while maintaining high levels of service and excellence.



Truly customized service requires care and forethought. To ensure we can always fulfill that commitment, we aim to partner with like-minded clients who share our values. Your success is our success; therefore, we maintain a deep commitment to providing a range of high-quality services critical to the growth of your funds. 







Our Focus
ALPS is focused on providing a suite of asset servicing and asset management solutions to the investment management industry. Clients successfully leverage both aspects of ALPS, to combine a top-rated fund servicing model with the expertise needed to develop new products.

Asset Servicing

Global Custodian’s 2015 Mutual Fund Administrator of the Year
Asset servicing is tailored to you and second to none



Asset Management

Guiding Principles

We believe that personal relationships are the foundation of our success.
We are driven by growth and the challenges and opportunities it presents.
We promote an open and enthusiastic environment that leads to job satisfaction and career advancement based on merit.

Why Energy Infrastructure MLPs?
Thematically, MLPs represent an investment in the build-out of US energy infrastructure
                        over the next few decades. MLPs own, operate, and build energy infrastructure assets

About ALPS







Our History
Our Approach
Management






Our History

ALPS is a comprehensive financial services company offering a variety of services to the investment management industry. With over 25 years of experience, we have developed a strong track record of innovation in the asset management, asset servicing and asset gathering business. ALPS entered the ETF market as one of the first service providers in 1995 and has since grown to become the 4th largest distributor of ETFs in the US. In 2007, we expanded our capabilities as an asset manager, specializing in satellite and alternative investment strategies that are designed to help advisors and Institutional Investors build better portfolios.
Our approach involves asset class and manager evaluation, seeking to partner with best-in-class index providers and sub-advisors to deliver portfolio solutions that help improve diversification and provide exposure to attractive investment themes. By utilizing Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and Open-End Mutual Funds, we are able to provide asset class exposure that is registered, liquid and transparent.





Our Approach

ALPS offers innovative investment solutions that help advisors and investors build better portfolios. Through both our alternative investment products and access to specialty asset managers we strive to deliver portfolio solutions that allow investors to diversify their core holdings and obtain exposure to attractive investment themes. Our exposure to alternatives and specialty managers is achieved primarily through exchange-traded funds, exchange-traded products, closed-end funds and open-end funds so that we can provide access that is registered, liquid and fully transparent.
