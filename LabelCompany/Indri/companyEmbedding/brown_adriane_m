Closed Waste Management Landfill is Home to New, 3.6 MWdc Solar Farm
Former Berkley Landfill now generating clean, renewable energy for area homes and businesses

July 18, 2017 09:00

BERKLEY, Mass., July 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Waste Management (NYSE: WM), in partnership with project owner Captona Partners, recently completed construction on a 3.6 megawatt (MW DC) solar farm at the closed Berkley landfill.  Closed since 1994, the landfill now contains 11,286 solar panels on over 18 acres of land.  The 3.6 megawatt (MW DC) capacity generates enough energy to power nearly 700 homes in the region."Solar farms require a lot of area, and closed landfills make excellent sites for them," said Chris DeSantis, Area Vice President, Waste Management. "Waste Management has developed similar projects at other closed facilities across the country.  We are pleased to add Berkley, which is now one of four closed landfill sites in Massachusetts that are generating renewable, solar energy."  Two additional sites - MT Sullivan Landfill in Chicopee, MA - 2 MW; and Hudson/Stow Landfill in Hudson, MA - 5 MW were also developed by Captona Partners while the fourth site – Hunt Road LF in Amesbury, MA – 4.5MW was developed by Citizens Energy Corporation.   Collectively, the four solar farms generate enough energy to power approximately 3,000 Massachusetts homes."We are excited to create additional, long-term value for the closed landfill by supplying clean energy to the area's residents and businesses," said Roshni Mali, Director from Captona Partners, and project manager for the Hudson/Stow, Berkley, and Chicopee solar projects.ABOUT WASTE MANAGEMENTWaste Management, based in Houston, Texas, is the leading provider of comprehensive waste management services in North America. Through its subsidiaries, the company provides collection, transfer, recycling and resource recovery, and disposal services.
