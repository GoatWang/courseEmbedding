This is what most individuals turn to for a more complete approach to PEMF therapy. The OMI PEMF therapy mat is lightweight, easy to use, easy to clean and it is beautifully designed with a soft microfiber surface comfortable enough for anyone to use.

View PEMF Mat Comparison Chart 

Complementary Therapy for Numerous Health Conditions
OMI (Oxford Medical Instruments) PEMF Therapy Mats are often used in the offices of chiropractors, homeopathic physicians and now it is being requested for home use throughout North America.




Fibromyalgia
Arthritis
Joint and muscle pain




Fatigue
Sleep disorders
Diabetes




Increased circulation
Stroke recovery
Stress relief



The list of conditions that have been studied using PEMF therapy is extensive and the research continues today. Pulsed electromagnetic field mats have become a more commonly used device in the last 5 years, and studies have shown that it has been a welcome change for those who are unable to find relief from other therapies, or when surgical procedures have failed.
While there are several PEMF devices to choose from, the OMI mat is still the best choice for therapy for the whole body. This makes it easy for you to issue therapy to the mind and body all at the same time. Many who suffer from pain in multiple areas find that they get great relief by using the mat for full body coverage.
Quick Facts About the OMI PEMF Mat



The 8 copper coils, evenly distributed throughout the mat enable anyone to get the best therapy for the entire body when using the OMI PEMF therapy mat.


The OMI mat has been proven to promote the body’s natural regeneration processes down to the cellular level. This includes the regeneration of blood vessels, as well as healthier tissue, cells, and nerves.


The OMI mat measures 65 x 20 inches, and has a quad fold compact design making it easy to store in your home, office, or to transport it to a friend’s home to share the benefits with them.


Your OMI mat has a field strength of between 22 and 60 Microtesla depending upon the frequency you choose to use. 


The OMI mat uses a square wave, which NASA studies have shown to be effective in that the pattern with a square wave is more beneficial for cell stimulation and regeneration.


Pulses originate from the top side of the mat so that they can directly impact nerves and cells with gentle, pulsed electromagnetic fields. This gentle stimulation is what helps recharge the body after it has been under environmental or emotional stress or physical injury.

Everyone will experience different results with the OMI mat. Some report that they notice a difference upon their first use of the mat. Others have reported results within as little as a few days to a few weeks or longer. It is best to be patient. Your body deserves it!
Tips for Getting the Best Results

It is important to use the mat on a flat and firm surface. Using the mat on a waterbed or uneven surface can cause damage to the copper coils inside as well as the overall structure of the mat.
Are multiple people using the same mat? If multiple family members are using the mat, you may want to lay a sheet over the mat. Keeping your OMI mat clean is important.

NASA is one of the ultimate resources for learning about PEMF therapy and how it works. Having worked with wave forms as it pertains to aerospace technology and optimal health under extreme conditions, they discovered that the square wave form worked best for healing and regeneration.
The square wave, emitted from pure copper coils, ensures that the human body is only receiving a pure magnetic field. No mesh is used in any of the products sold by PEMF Supply (View this NASA article).

Windows 8.1 Product Key: How to Get it from the BIOS | PCsteps.com

 Laptops with preinstalled Windows 7 usually have a sticker with the product key under the laptop. Laptops with preinstalled Windows 8 or Windows 8.1, however, never have such a sticker. The reason is that the Windows 8.1 product key is embedded into the BIOS or UEFI. Here's how to get the product key, in case we cant to install Windows 8 on a different PC.

Table of ContentsWhen do I need the Windows 8.1 product key?How to get the Windows 8.1 product key from inside WindowsAlternative way to get the Windows 8.1 product keyGet the Windows 8.1 product key without WindowsCan I use the Windows 8.1 product key to activate Windows on another PC?What will happen if two PCs have the same product key?Did you have any trouble finding the Windows 8.1 product key?

When do I need the Windows 8.1 product key?
On a laptop that came with Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 preinstalled, we never need to enter the Windows 8.1 product key manually.
If we reinstall the proper version of Windows 8.1 (Home, Professional, or Windows with Bing), the installation process reads the product key automatically from the BIOS; we don't even get the product key prompt.

The only reason to get the Windows 8.1 product key is if we want to transfer Windows to another PC. After transferring Windows 8, we can also upgrade to Windows 10 on the second PC.
How to get the Windows 8.1 product key from inside Windows
In this scenario, the laptop that came with preinstalled Windows 8 has a fully functional Windows operating system. It doesn't need to be Windows 8; it could have Windows 7.

After we boot in Windows, we download NeoSmart's Oem Product Key Tool.

We don't need to enter a name or an email; we just click on the Download! button.

After that, we just run the OpenKey application, and we will get the Windows 8.1 product key from BIOS / UEFI.

No installation is needed; it's simple as that.
Alternative way to get the Windows 8.1 product key
If the Oem Product Key Tool doesn't work on our PC, we can use RWEverything.

We just download the latest portable version for 32-bit or 64-bit Windows.

After the download, we extract the .zip contents...

...and run the RW application.

There, we select ACPI, then click on the MSDM tab, and we will find the Windows 8.1 product key.

Get the Windows 8.1 product key without Windows
Let's say we can't run Windows on the old laptop anymore. Maybe there is something wrong, and Windows won't boot. Or we installed Linux, and the above applications won't work through WINE.
So, now what?
There are a couple of applications that can create a bootable environment that can detect the Windows 8.1 product key. For this guide, we will use Lazesoft Recover My Password Home Edition.

The installation is safe; it doesn't hide any toolbars or adware.

After we run the program, we click on "Burn Bootable CD/USB Disk Now!".

We leave the default "DO NOT Specify the Windows version".

We can either prepare the bootable environment on DVD, USB or create an ISO image for later use.

The program will first download the WinPE components from Microsoft...

...then format the USB drive (make sure you don't have any important data on it because it will be deleted)...

...and begin writing the information on the drive. On a USB 2.0 drive, it shouldn't take more than a couple of minutes.

After the disk is ready...

...we make sure to remove it safely, to avoid the chance of any data corruption.

Then we setup the BIOS/UEFI or the boot menu of the laptop from which we want to get the Window 8.1 product key.

We boot from the Lazesoft recovery media and select the Lazesoft Live CD or USB option.

At the recovery environment, we select the "Find Windows Product Key" option.

We confirm that we are using the free version for non-commercial reasons...

...and this is it. We get the Windows 8.1 product key, either through Windows or from the BIOS / UEFI.

Can I use the Windows 8.1 product key to activate Windows on another PC?
The OEM product keys are tied to the particular motherboard of the first PC they are activated on, and won't automatically activate through the Internet on another PC.
There is, however, a workaround for this: we can activate by phone.
After the installation, we press the Windows Key + Pause/Break to open the system properties and click on "Activate Windows

Then, we select "Activate by phone". Don't bother with the "Activate Windows online" option, it won't work.

Don't worry, you won't need to talk to anyone at Microsoft. The Phone Activation system is automated.
We just enter the unique nine groups of numbers for our system through the phone keypad...

...and then the automated system will provide with eight groups of numbers for the activation.

Should this fail for any reason, stay on the line and you will be connected to a Microsoft support representative.
What will happen if two PCs have the same product key?
To transfer Windows 8.1, we need to remove it completely from the old PC after we get the product key e.g. by installing a Linux distribution.
If we have two Windows installations on two separate PCs simultaneously, with the same product key, we violate Microsoft's license agreement.
It's a matter of time before Microsoft blacklists the product key, and we won't be able to use it to activate Windows anymore.
Did you have any trouble finding the Windows 8.1 product key?
If anything in the above guide didn't work as described, and you weren't able to find the Windows 8.1 product key, leave us a comment.

HP Desktop PCs - Updating the BIOS






This document includes the steps for finding, downloading, and installing updates to the BIOS (Basic Input Output System) for your HP or Compaq computer.

Updating the BIOS, also known as "flashing the BIOS," replaces the BIOS firmware. When completed successfully, a BIOS update can fix or enhance aspects of a computer's performance, or provide support for newly installed hardware. However, if an incorrect update is installed or if the update process is interrupted, the motherboard can be permanently damaged, leaving the computer unable to boot. It is recommended to update your BIOS only if one or more of the following conditions apply:

The update fixes a problem with your computer.


The update enhances your computer's performance in a desired way.


You are planning to change the operating system, processor, or other feature(s), and the current BIOS version will not support the new configuration.


An HP Support Agent, or an HP support document, recommends that you download and install a specific updated BIOS.







				 
				caution:

Only install BIOS updates from HP. Do not install BIOS updates from the motherboard manufacturer's Web site. Doing so might prevent the computer from accepting an HP System Recovery.



Use the following steps to update the BIOS in your computer:

Before you begin

The following tools and information are needed to perform the steps in this document:




				 
				note:
When updating the BIOS in your HP Desktop computer, it is very important to identify the correct ROM Family SSID for the motherboard in your PC. 






Model number (located on the nameplate and/or on a sticker attached to the computer).


An Internet connection.
If your computer does not have an Internet connection, use another computer with an Internet connection to download the update and save it to removable media (for example,  a CD or thumb drive).


A printout of this document.


Pencil and paper.






Step 1: Verify the current BIOS version installed and the correct ROM Family SSID for your PC


To find the current BIOS version, follow these steps:



Use one of the following methods, depending on your Windows version:




Windows 10 and Windows 8: Search Windows for msinfo32. Click msinfo32 from the list of results.



Windows 7 and Vista: Click Start, type msinfo32 in the Search field. Then select msinfo32.exe from the list of results. 



Windows XP: Click Start, select  Run, type msinfo32.exe in the Open field, and then click OK.





In the System Information window under the System Summary category, look for the BIOS Version/Date entry. This is your current BIOS version.


Figure : BIOS Version/Date





Write down the BIOS version and date.


There might be several BIOS versions on the HP website. To make sure that you download the correct version, you must identify the ROM Family SSID. 
Use one of the following methods to identify the  ROM Family SSID for your computer:




Find the ROM Family SSID in the product specifications (Internet connection required)




Go to the HP Customer Support page.


In the Search box, type the computer model number followed by Product Specifications.
 For example, type  34-a172cn product specifications.
Then press Enter.


Figure : Searching for your product specification





	Click the link to the Product Specifications for your computer.


Figure : Locate the product specifications for your computer





Click the motherboard name to expand the specifications.


Figure : Example of Motherboard specifications





	Scroll down and click the motherboard specifications link.


Figure : Example of link to motherboard specification





	Find the Motherboard description section. The description contains the SSID for your computer. 


Figure : Example of the SSID





Write down the SSID and continue to the next step to download and install the BIOS update.






 Find the ROM Family SSID in the BIOS (requires shutting down the computer)




 Turn the computer off completely.


 Turn on the computer and press the F10 key continually to access the BIOS configuration.




				 
				note:
Depending on your computer model, you might need to press F6 or F2 (instead of F10) during this step to access the BIOS.




 In the File menu, select System Information, and then press Enter. 



Figure : Opening System Information in the BIOS





Find the System Board ID (SSID).


Figure : System Board ID (ROM Family SSID)





 Write down the System Board ID (SSID) and continue with the next step to find and download the BIOS update.








Step 2: Find the BIOS updates

To find and download the BIOS updates for your computer, find the specific product number of your computer. Then follow these steps.



Go to the HP Customer Support page.


Type the product number or complete product name of your computer in the Find my product field, and then click Go.


Figure : Type a product name/number





If you are presented with a list of several links to product support sites, click the link that matches your computer's model number.


Figure : Click model number




Click Go under Option 2: Go directly to the software and driver results.

Figure : Click Go





On the Drivers page for your computer, use the drop-down menu to select the original operating system that came with your computer, and then click Next.


Figure : Select your original operating system





If a BIOS category is listed, click the plus sign (+) to expand the category.
Figure : Expand BIOS options





If a BIOS category is not listed on the web page, the original BIOS version already on the computer might be the latest available.


If there are several BIOS updates available for different ROM Family SSIDs, select the correct update using the SSID you noted in Step 1. 


Figure : Example of several available BIOS updates





If the version and date of the listed BIOS is the same or older than the current BIOS on the computer, you may exit this procedure. The computer does not require a BIOS update at this time.




Click the Download link for the BIOS update file for your computer to go to the HP software and driver downloads page.




				 
				caution:
Read the Details section to verify that the BIOS update is more recent then the one installed and that it applies to your computer. Installing a BIOS that is not designed for your computer could cause the computer to stop working. 



Continue to the next section to download and install the BIOS update.  







Step 3: Download and install the BIOS update

To download and install the BIOS update for your computer, read and follow the instructions on the download page carefully. Then complete the following steps:



Before installing the BIOS update, close any open programs and temporarily disable your antivirus software. Remember to re-enable the antivirus software after the installation is complete.


Select the HP Download and Install Assistant, and then click Next.


When prompted, choose Run or Save depending on how you would like to install the update.




Run: Choose Run to download and install the BIOS update from this screen.



Save: Choose Save to install the BIOS update later, or if you are downloading the update to install on a different computer. This will  download and save the file to your computer or a removable storage device.





If you chose to Save the BIOS update file, navigate to where the file is stored, and double-click the file to begin installation. If you chose to Run the update, continue to the next step. 


Agree to the terms and then follow the on-screen instructions to install the BIOS update.
Do not interrupt the update process.


Allow the installation to complete all of its actions. Then restart the computer when prompted.
The latest version of the BIOS is now installed on the computer.







				 
				note:
If a 251 or CMOS Checksum  error occurs after installing the BIOS update, use the steps in the HP support document Error: CMOS Checksum Bad to resolve the error.

Re: CI reconciliation in RTSM (OMi)








As a solution I updated the 'Node' reconciliation rule to include 'net_bios_name’  as a primary propery for reconcilation.I added these lines:<validation-criterion priority="1">                <attribute-condition attributeName="net_bios_name" includeNullValue="false" conditionType="approveAndContradict"/>    </validation-criterion>Bear in mind to use cautious when manipulating this rule.

View PEMF Mat Comparison Chart 

Complementary Therapy for Numerous Health Conditions
OMI (Oxford Medical Instruments) PEMF Therapy Mats are often used in the offices of chiropractors, homeopathic physicians and now it is being requested for home use throughout North America.




Fibromyalgia
Arthritis
Joint and muscle pain




Fatigue
Sleep disorders
Diabetes




Increased circulation
Stroke recovery
Stress relief



The list of conditions that have been studied using PEMF therapy is extensive and the research continues today. Pulsed electromagnetic field mats have become a more commonly used device in the last 5 years, and studies have shown that it has been a welcome change for those who are unable to find relief from other therapies, or when surgical procedures have failed.
While there are several PEMF devices to choose from, the OMI mat is still the best choice for therapy for the whole body. This makes it easy for you to issue therapy to the mind and body all at the same time. Many who suffer from pain in multiple areas find that they get great relief by using the mat for full body coverage.
Quick Facts About the OMI PEMF Mat



The 8 copper coils, evenly distributed throughout the mat enable anyone to get the best therapy for the entire body when using the OMI PEMF therapy mat.


The OMI mat has been proven to promote the body’s natural regeneration processes down to the cellular level. This includes the regeneration of blood vessels, as well as healthier tissue, cells, and nerves.


The OMI mat measures 65 x 20 inches, and has a quad fold compact design making it easy to store in your home, office, or to transport it to a friend’s home to share the benefits with them.


Your OMI mat has a field strength of between 22 and 60 Microtesla depending upon the frequency you choose to use. 


The OMI mat uses a square wave, which NASA studies have shown to be effective in that the pattern with a square wave is more beneficial for cell stimulation and regeneration.


Pulses originate from the top side of the mat so that they can directly impact nerves and cells with gentle, pulsed electromagnetic fields. This gentle stimulation is what helps recharge the body after it has been under environmental or emotional stress or physical injury.

Everyone will experience different results with the OMI mat. Some report that they notice a difference upon their first use of the mat. Others have reported results within as little as a few days to a few weeks or longer. It is best to be patient. Your body deserves it!
Tips for Getting the Best Results

It is important to use the mat on a flat and firm surface. Using the mat on a waterbed or uneven surface can cause damage to the copper coils inside as well as the overall structure of the mat.
Are multiple people using the same mat? If multiple family members are using the mat, you may want to lay a sheet over the mat. Keeping your OMI mat clean is important.

NASA is one of the ultimate resources for learning about PEMF therapy and how it works. Having worked with wave forms as it pertains to aerospace technology and optimal health under extreme conditions, they discovered that the square wave form worked best for healing and regeneration.
The square wave, emitted from pure copper coils, ensures that the human body is only receiving a pure magnetic field. No mesh is used in any of the products sold by PEMF Supply (View this NASA article).
