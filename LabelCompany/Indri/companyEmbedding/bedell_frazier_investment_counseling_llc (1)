 TGIF –  Gone With the Big Screen?

Sticky Post
By Michael Frazier
On July 21, 2017






Gone With The Big Screen?
What’s your favorite method of getting news, sports or entertainment? There are so many mediums in today’s digital age and longterm norms have been turned upside down. Remember when a phone was a phone? When I moved back to San Francisco from New York in 2002, I didn’t get a landline phone, and thought I was cutting edge. Today, a growing population certainly don’t have landlines, and don’t have cable or even television sets!
The average American adult spends over 12 hours per day consuming media content. A recent study by Deloitte found that we check our phones over 8 Billion times per day. That translates to an average of 46 times per person. Not surprisingly, the younger you are, the more often you check. Americans 18-24 on average check their phones 74 times per day. Chances are they’re not using it as a telephone either. The 18-24 demographic really stands out with media statistics.
Consumer behavior has changed so much over the years. Cable is a great example. It took off in the 1980’s, and my old boss Ted Turner was the pioneer. Before 1980, less than 20% of Americans had cable television. It surged to over 60% by 1990. Pay TV usage expanded over the years with satellite added in and topped out in 2013 with roughly 87%. It’s expected to fall back towards 75% by the end of the decade. 2 Million people cut the cable cord last year. That means they got rid of their cable service and are accessing content directly from the web. Nearly 15% of the country now access content away from the traditional pay, multichannel TV model. Netflix has over 80 Million subscribers, of which half of them watch on a video game console. Over 40% watch from their computer. A small but growing 6% watch from a cell phone.
Attention spans have changed too. Nearly 70% of Americans online watch television while they’re simultaneously on their phone or tablet. Does that sound like someone you know? It’s expected to be over 90% next year. Americans are consuming content like never before. Over 40% of Americans get their news on Facebook. For those of you who still enjoy the morning paper delivered to your home, you’re not alone. Over half of Americans that read the paper get it in print. That also means that nearly half don’t. Just 17% of Americans 18-24 read a newspaper at all.
Do you love going to the movies? Summer is huge for the box-office. Did you know that movie theaters generate nearly 50% of their revenues across the 3-month Summer season? But people don’t go to the movies like they used to. And some argue the art of Hollywood has been lost with quality story telling being replaced with high-priced action films and re-runs. Whatever the case, the traffic trend is undeniable.
In 1946, 57% of Americans went to the movies at least once per week. It was at the theater where people socialized and got news updates, particularly during WWII. They also saw cutting edge cartoons and other shorts. It was a destination. It was a way of life. The advancement of televisions in the home reversed the movie traffic for good. Last year, 71% of Americans saw a movie in a theater at least once. Nearly half went at least once per month. The age group that frequented theaters the most were age 18-24, averaging 6.5 movies in 2016. This was surprising on one hand, as this is the most tech-savvy segment of our population. But with many in the group in College, or not working, they have a little more free time. Then there’s this stat: 75% of frequent moviegoers own at least 4 different types of technology devices such as smartphones, tablets and video-game systems. The tech savvy still like the cinema experience.
Movie tickets have increased in price over the years. Today, a movie in the Bay Area during primetime costs $12. A ticket to see Gone With the Wind in 1939 cost 23 cents. The original Star Wars cost $2.23 to see it the Summer of 1977. Would you pay $30 to get a blockbuster film on your High Def screen at home the same day it opens at the box-office? You just may get the chance soon. Online video is available on-demand, all the time, giving users significantly more power to choose what they want to watch when they want it.
Americans don’t seem to have the patience anymore to sit back and relax with a box of popcorn in the quiet sanctuary of the movie theater. They can’t sit still in their own living room long enough without picking up their phones. They’ve ditched the big screens for smaller screens. Disruptive business models have shaken the traditional norm to its core. Content providers have had to make drastic changes. Content distributors have been squeezed. Advertisers have to re-think everything. These trends have been disruptive. They’ve been evolutionary. And they most certainly have been investable. We pay close attention.
Have a nice weekend. We’ll be back, dark and early on Monday.

 TGIF – Emerging Markets on the Run

Sticky Post
By Michael Frazier
On July 14, 2017






Emerging Markets on the Run
Emerging Markets have been running hot this year. But you don’t really hear much about it. Investors are finally taking notice. A decade and a half ago, Emerging Markets were all the rage. It was the BRIC nations that represented the greatest growth opportunity around the globe for investors. BRIC stands for Brazil Russia India and China. The BRIC nations got hit hard during the Financial Crisis, and have only recently recovered. Emerging Markets are up over 20% this year, but are well below their all-time, pre-crisis highs. In fact, they still remain below their 2014 levels. China is now the 2nd largest economy in the world, but is still considered an Emerging Market. Of the 4 BRIC’s, India stands out.
India is now the 7th largest economy in the world. Growing over 6% annually, India’s economy is accelerating again and is on track to become #3 by the end of the decade. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been implementing economic reforms required to bridge the gap between the potential and the reality. Modi announced a plan to spend $59 Billion on India’s infrastructure, focusing on roads, rail and airports. Also included in the plan is a massive Tech buildout of servers, networks and storage. India is investing in themselves and their bright future. Apple has made a big push recently to capture the Indian market, the second largest market for phones. The lack of internal infrastructure in India has led to many internet-based business models, and they’re taking off. India is where China was 10 years ago, in terms of consumer spending. But the opportunity for growth is enormous.
Emerging Markets account for 85% of the world’s population, but only half of global GDP and less than 10% of global market cap, i.e. Total Global Stock Market value. Importantly, Emerging Markets will be responsible for over 70% of the economic growth in the coming years. India and China are the fastest growers. They also have the largest populations by a long shot, with over 1 Billion people each. Most Emerging Market nations have very young populations. Half of the world’s population is under the age of 30. 9 out of 10 live in an Emerging Market.
Besides the young populations, Emerging Market nations share another common theme: Commodities. Emerging Market nations in Africa, South America, South East Asia and the Middle East are rich in raw materials. When the global economy picks up momentum, demand for raw materials like industrial metals, agriculture and energy go with it. Global infrastructure and development is about building new stuff, modern stuff. That requires tons of raw materials. These are longterm themes that look sustainable.
The DOW and S&P hit fresh all-time highs again this week. The gains continue to come in the face of so much skepticism. Earnings Season has just begun, which will provide the necessary facts to confirm the health of this rally. The global economy is expected to grow 3.5% this year, while the US is slated for 2% growth. Emerging Markets are expected to grow 4.5%, leading the way and their stock markets have been playing catch-up, but remain well below their all-time highs. For those concerned that the DOW is too high, rest assured, there are plenty of investment opportunities out there. We could see a needed breather ahead, but see tremendous opportunity beyond.
Have a nice weekend. We’ll be back, dark and early on Monday.
Mike

 TGIF – Big Picture Metrics

Sticky Post
By Meredith
On July 7, 2017






Big Picture Metrics
As we turn the corner into the 2nd half of the year, we thought it timely to show a few Big Picture metrics we follow to help give a sense of where the economy and markets sit.
Jobs
The June jobs report came out today and was about where we expected it to come in and stabilize the run rate of annual jobs created. After the economy broke positive in 2011 from the financial crisis we have averaged a run rate of +2.14 million jobs created annually. Today’s report puts us right back at that trend at +2.18 million created. For reference, the hottest peak labor market hiring was +3.3 million in February of 2015.
Manufacturing & Industrial Production
Both hit new cyclical highs in June after peaking in late 2014. If you recall we saw the S&P 500 go through a flat period from 2015 to early 2016 as these numbers started to slow. Manufacturing & Industrial Production started to show expansion last fall which gave clues the economy was about to expand again after resting for a year and a half. These are both humming along as expected for a strong fundamental backbone of the markets.


The Bond Market
We saw the 10-year Treasury yield start 2017 at 2.45% and drop to a low of 2.14% in June. Fast forward a few weeks and the 10-year Treasury yield is pushing back to 2.40%. What was unique about this move down in interest rates at the longer end of the Yield curve, was how much the Yield curve Flattened, because the front end actually rose. What does that mean? The Yield curve is measured by taking the 30-year yield, or furthest out in time, and subtracting the 1-month bill or 3-month bill yields, or closest to today. The yield curve was 2.62% steep as we began 2017. Now a few weeks ago the curve “flattened” from that 2.62% all the way down to 1.85%. Why is this important? Often times when the Yield curve inverts or goes negative (pays higher rates in the front maturities then the further out maturities) it is a big sign of economic weakness and potential recession. For reference the last “Inverted” Yield curve we saw was in 2006/2007 and we know what followed a year or so later.
The Yield curve since that 1.85% low has “steepened” back towards 2.0% in a quick 2 weeks. This is exactly what we want to be seeing in tandem with rates beginning to move back up. The end of the curve is moving up more than the front again.
Earnings & Revenues
Earnings rose 13% and 5% for Q1 and Q2 respectively, while Revenues rose 8% and almost 4% for the first 2 quarters. Earnings are still on pace to grow around 12% for 2017 and revenues around 6%, which would be sufficient to earn $128 a share and support our 2500+ target on the S&P 500 this year.

There will continue to be quick dips and vacillations along the way, but from our perch these are not the characteristics of a stock market top. They continue to look like very normal “late stage” economic cycle fundamentals.
Have a nice weekend.

 TGIF – The Price We Pay

Sticky Post
By Michael Frazier
On June 23, 2017






The Price We Pay
When you think of inflation, what immediately comes to mind? Do you think about mortgage rates in the early 1980’s? Maybe the cost of a loaf of bread today or what a Coke cost when you were 10 years old? You probably cringe at the thought of how much you paid for that hot dog and beer at the ballgame the other day. Inflation is the general increase in price of a product, good or service. Sometimes it’s driven by increased demand or reduced supply, while it also can be a function of a higher cost to produce. We see the results everyday.
Anyone who has paid attention to California real estate over the years knows very well that prices have increased substantially over time. A house purchased in San Francisco in 1987 is worth on average nearly 6X more 30 years later. In 1987, tickets to Disneyland cost $21. It’s over $100 today. A can of Coke has doubled in cost from 30 years ago. A call at a phone booth cost a dime in 1987 while today it costs… wait a second, what’s a phone booth?
So clearly there have been inflationary pressures over the years. We certainly have seen it in the price of food, healthcare and education. But we’ve also seen some serious deflationary pressures as well. Intel Founder Gordon Moore observed that computing power would increase over time while cost would decrease at an exponential pace. Moore’s Law has proven a valuable force in pricing innovative products. A 50-inch television in 1987 cost over $1200. You can get a 50 inch HDTV today for under $300. Stating the obvious, the quality of the picture has improved quite a bit in 30 years while the price has dropped dramatically. We’ve certainly experienced deflationary pressures in our industry. The average trade commission for stocks was around $50 in 1987, though some “full service” brokers charged as much as $500! Electronic trades are under $10 today.
Price at the Pump
Gas prices have experienced both inflation and deflation over the years. A gallon of gas cost 79 cents in 1987. It’s $2.27 today. When the price of oil reached $150 in 2008, the national average was $4 per gallon and over $5 in California. Historically, gas prices and oil prices have been a barometer for economic growth. Stronger demand implies economic growth, which drives prices higher. That hasn’t been the case of late because oil and gas prices today are driven by the increasing supply in the US, which has outpaced demand. Importantly, demand continues to grow, particularly overseas. Some people have been concerned that falling Oil prices means a recession is coming. The deflationary pressure in gas prices is not a negative sign for economic growth, in fact the lower prices are an important stimulant, particularly for the American Consumer, which represents nearly 70% of the US economy.
The Fed has been concerned about deflation ever since the crisis, which is why they were so aggressive to increase the money supply with rounds of quantitative easing to help stoke inflation. The Fed has yet to achieve its goal of 2% inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, on a consistent basis. Part of the issue is we have been importing deflation for years in the form of Chinese manufactured goods. The Amazon effect has driven consumer pricing down as well since commerce has become much more efficient. This is a trend that should continue. It’s great for consumers but can hurt jobs.
Pay attention to prices this summer and think about what they used to be. In some cases you’re paying a lot more for seemingly the same thing while in other cases you’re getting quite a bit more and paying much less. Of course I’m factoring in absolute Dollars and not considering currency inflation and deflation, which is another subject altogether. I know my grandfather, who passed away in 1992, wouldn’t believe people today pay $3 for a bottle of water…
Have a nice weekend. We’ll be back, dark and early on Monday.

 TGIF – The Amazon Effect

Sticky Post
By Michael Frazier
On June 16, 2017






The Amazon Effect
The big news of the day, the week and perhaps the decade for retail is Amazon buying Whole Foods. It looks like a really compelling fit. Amazon needed help cracking the urban retail market and Whole Foods needed help in pretty much everything. Amazon has a disruptive business model. It has had the greatest influence on how people make purchases today. The Jeff Bezos led company started off selling books. Amazon has shaken up every aspect of retail. Today they just torpedoed the grocery business.
Amazon the Disruptor
Amazon sent shockwaves throughout the North American retail chain with news it is buying Whole Foods, in an all-cash deal. It will be the biggest deal in Amazon history. It will be the biggest deal in the history of the $800 Billion grocery business. With this deal, Amazon will immediately be the 5th largest grocer in the US. It won’t stop there. It’s going to be a game changer of great proportions. Amazon has built an empire and has proven that it can and will compete with nearly everyone. The Amazon effect has reached nearly every industry. It changed the retail business. It changed the server and storage business. It has changed the logistics, delivery and distribution business. Only Amazon could get the mailman to work on Sunday! Amazon has even disrupted Hollywood, breaking into show business when so many others failed. Amazon won an Oscar this year, the first time for a streaming video provider. The company has been active in original content with Amazon Prime series for a few years.
The opportunities are boundless for Amazon with these physical stores integrated with its web based stores. There is quite a bit of overlap between its existing Prime members and Whole Foods shoppers. Amazon has mastered the study of consumer behavior. It has been tracking people’s purchases and searches for years and know more about people than they perhaps know about themselves. It has so much data and metrics to analyze. Amazon has been an innovator in the artificial intelligence space, and knows a great deal about human behavior and continues to sell people things that they want or need in a very efficient and easy manner. Amazon is pretty good at selling things that you don’t need too…
Amazon is paying nearly $14 Billion for Whole Foods. That comes down to roughly $30 Million per store. The grocery business is a tough business. It’s hyper-competitive. The profit margins are very low. Amazon knows low margin business. It was clear that Bezos wanted to get into the food business when he rolled out Amazon Fresh. But early experiences saw the difficulty of providing fresh food sold over the web. People generally don’t like bruised bananas and moldy berries. Most prefer to see the meat and touch the fruit before purchase. Having Whole Foods stores will enhance the Amazon Fresh pickup model, where you have the option to buy merchandise online and pick it up within 15 minutes. It’s clear that Amazon doesn’t plan to stop here. What Amazon is likely thinking; they just purchased over 400 upper-income area hubs throughout the country to distribute pretty much everything they sell. Competitors be warned.
What does this mean?
We ask ourselves this question all the time. Clearly all retail stores have been struggling, and this will make things even more difficult. Drug stores are on watch too. Amazon could be a huge player in the prescription drug industry and it already thrives on selling dry goods. Warehouse stores like Costco will feel the pressure. But how about this; online food delivery is expected to grow 15 times faster than the restaurant business through the end of the decade. People would rather order meals online and have them delivered to their home than go out to eat these days. Amazon will no doubt capitalize on this trend. There will be more white Amazon vans coming to the neighborhood.
Generally, mega deals don’t work. This one looks like it will. It should be good for consumers but possibly bad for jobs. Amazon will drive already competitive prices even lower. It should bring Whole Foods prices down too. But it speeds up the irreversible trend towards automation. That’s been a job crusher. You know Google and Apple are watching with interest. I saw an interesting tweet this morning which said that a summer job returning shopping carts in the parking lot just became an entry level position in high tech. Perhaps so. It’s the Digital Age.
Have a nice weekend. We’ll be back, dark and early on Monday.
Happy Father’s Day!

 TGIF – The State of the World

Sticky Post
By Steve Harris
On June 9, 2017






Planet Earth Is A Confusing Place
Trying to make sense of these global developments has been a challenge. We are always up for challenges.  The thing is, these days information travels at the speed of light. The problem is: knowledge does not.
I had the great fortune of meeting Former CIA Director and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta a couple of years ago. This week I attended his lecture series with Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Former Defense Secretary Ash Carter, who succeeded Panetta in 2014. These are 3 of the smartest people on global issues. The topic was THE WORLD, and the focus was on Russia, North Korea, Cybersecurity and the United States. It was quite an event.
The discussion began with the established understanding that the United States is facing threats not seen since World War II. Growing aggression and failed states are breeding grounds for terror. Foreign governments are behind much of the cyber espionage, manipulation and theft. How the international community is responding to these threats has changed in 2017. The panel reminded us that the “international community” is a bit of a farce. Self interest always drives strategies. Pre World War I was a zero-sum game, driven by national interests. Post World War II has seen global collaboration with democratic competition in relative peace. The fact is, Americans have become “allergic” to war and nation-building overseas after Afghanistan and Iraq. The populist movement created the Trump Presidency and Brexit. NATO and the Paris Climate Agreement is testing the strength of the West’s 7-decade allegiances. The current administration’s foreign policy is still evolving according the panel. The One China policy and NATO are examples of this. Secretary Carter said that the US needs to stand for things and get what we want through competitive behavior with collaboration.
Rice, Carter and Panetta all agreed they would have advised the President to stay in the Paris Climate Accord. Even though it is limited in what it can do, Condoleezza Rice said she believes the U.S. can and will continue to achieve economic growth in an environmentally conscientious way, embracing sustainable energy sources with traditional. The panel also reminded everyone that nothing will change until 2020 at the earliest. Rice said that China leading the environmental push is a joke. “Have you tried to breathe the air in Beijing recently?” She quipped. Rice reminded the group that the U.S. continues to lead as evidenced by its 66% reduction in carbon emissions output over the past several years.
Naturally, someone in the audience asked them about their thoughts on the President’s use of Twitter. They acknowledged it was a serious issue, but was also a method that helped get him elected. Broadly speaking, Panetta, Rice and Carter are concerned about the use of social media and politics. “Democracy takes time. It takes listening and compromise”, said Secretary Carter. Today, people send out personal thoughts immediately, often emotionally driven, and it is documented forever. Having emotional thoughts and discussions is as old as humankind. But they are best practiced behind closed doors in a professional forum. They’re dangerous out in the open. Leaders need clear and consistent messages. We don’t always get that right now.
© Panetta Institute via YouTube
As it pertains to Russia and Vladimir Putin, Condoleezza Rice had this to say: “I know him pretty well and he is an eye-for-an-eye kind of person. He is still unable to accept that the Cold War ended as it did. He called the end of the Soviet Union the greatest tragedy of the 20th century”. Rice said he always tries to project strength. He only respects strength. He thinks of himself as “Vladimir the Great”, following the line of other Russian and Soviet leaders. Putin has played a weak hand masterfully as he has reasserted Russian influence on the global stage. The fact is the Russian economy is a 20th century model, driven by fossil fuels. They are having trouble competing in the digital age, but the weakening alliances in the West and the political infighting in the United States could not have been scripted better for the Russian leader. Putin loves these disruptions. An interesting observation that the panel made was what an effective move that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson did when he said the Russians are either complicit or incompetent in Syria. He called them on it, to their face, on Russian ground. That was an important moment. Vladimir Putin makes sure that nobody questions his competency.
In closing, Mr. Panetta asked what issue kept them up at night. Ash Carter gave a list in order of North Korea, Russia, Iran and China, but that his “job was to stay up at night so Americans could sleep”. Condoleezza Rice answered differently. Her greatest concern is that America loses the energy, commitment and confidence to do the right thing. As soon as we stop defending values, the American way begins to dissolve. “It would be an ugly world without us…”.
Despite all of the problems we face, America’s best days could absolutely lie ahead. It won’t happen by itself. We have a vibrant, innovative economy and a way of life that is the envy of the world. But there are serious issues to address. There’s a great deal of anger and animosity. Listening and patience are being left behind. We’re never going to agree on everything. Unfortunately, compromise has become a four-letter word. United we stand. Divided we fall.
Have a nice weekend. We’ll be back, dark and early on Monday.

 TGIF – New Highs and Mixed Messages

Sticky Post
By Michael Frazier
On June 2, 2017






New Highs and Mixed Messages
It’s a new month, but a similar theme: The Stock Market just doesn’t want to go down. 
It had been trading sideways since March, in a very tight range. June started out with a bang and the rally continued, with the DOW and S&P reaching fresh new highs. It keeps happening in the face of so much turmoil and confusion in Washington and around the globe. Many are just scratching their heads in disbelief.
It seems so counterintuitive, but it shows that stocks are driven more so by earnings and corporate growth than politics and geopolitics.
Friday brought a disappointing job report. What’s worse, both April and March were revised lower, showing the labor market is not as strong as previously thought. A big problem is the fact that some jobs can’t be filled due to the lack of qualified skills, particularly in Silicon Valley. It may also be a sign business leaders are reluctant to expand their workforce until they see more evidence the White House plans are translating into legislation that’ll simplify and lower taxes and accelerate growth. Our sense is this Market had been pricing in tax reform and other pro-growth policies being passed in early 2018, not this year, but it’s still very much up in the air.
With these revisions, the 3-month average of payroll gains was the weakest since 2012.
Is the economy slowing or is it a temporary issue?
The Bond Market is showing some signs of concerns with the 10-Year Treasury yield back below 2.2% for the first time this year. Money has been flowing into Bonds of late, seeking a little safety. As a refresher, Bond yields drive prices. When yields go up, prices go down and vice versa. Will this new bit of uncertainty have the Fed switching gears? It doesn’t seem so, with the Futures Market pricing in a 91% probability of another interest rate hike in 2 weeks. We will find out soon enough. One thing is certain, there still is a great deal of skepticism out there.
As we’ve mentioned on numerous occasions, Bull Markets generally grow on skepticism and die on euphoria. There is very little euphoria out there, but there is some brewing. We’re starting to see it in Tech, where some stocks have been soaring while the broader Market has not. The Top 5 stocks in the S&P 500 are having a huge impact on this Market rally. They are Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. Case in point, these 5 stocks represent a mere 1% of the 500 S&P companies. However, they represent nearly 13% of the weighting of the index. These 5 Tech stocks have been the biggest drivers for the US Stock Market. It’s even more pronounced when you consider the Tech-heavy NASDAQ. The same 5 stocks represent over 40% of the weighting of the NAS 100 index. It’s a handful of stocks that are driving the rally. It’s a momentum rally. The Bull Market is maturing. A rotation of leadership is overdue. It’s needed for the next stage of this Bull, in our work. We still see higher levels to be reached. We definitely expect the choppy price action to continue.
Have a nice weekend. We’ll be back, dark and early on Monday.

Currencies are always Market moving, but what happened this week was particularly noteworthy.
Currencies are always Market moving, but what happened this week was particularly noteworthy.
Bitcoin is all the rage.  The value surged in price, crossing $2,000 for the first time.  One bitcoin was worth nearly $2,800 on Wednesday.  It was worth $1,000 just a month ago.  Some of you might be wondering what exactly is Bitcoin and where did it come from?  Bitcoin is what’s called a cryptocurrency.  You don’t carry them in your pocket.  It’s completely digital.  Bitcoin was created in Japan in 2009.  The actual creator is unknown, but believed to be a group of software programmers under the name “Satoshi Nakamoto”.
Most retailers do not accept bitcoin for purchase, but you might be surprised who does.  Bitcoin is accepted at the Gap, Subway and Whole Foods.  It can also be used on Expedia and Virgin Airlines.  There’s a Bitcoin ATM at a North Beach Market in San Francisco and a gas station in Concord, California.
Bitcoin runs through a digital network known as a blockchain.  It keeps a secure record of each transaction all in one place. Every time anyone buys or sells bitcoin, the transaction is logged.  No one controls these blocks, because blockchains are decentralized across every computer that has a bitcoin wallet, which you only get if you buy bitcoins.  It’s a very efficient system.  Competition in the digital currency space has been fierce.  Bitcoin used to account for over 85% of the Market in February, but is now just 45%.  One of its competitors, Zcash, is up over 200% since it cut a deal with JP Morgan Chase.  You can see why tech savvy consumers love it and government  regulators do not.
Bitcoin’s anonymity also lends itself to crime.  Bad guys use them too.  In fact the recent WannaCry ransomware demanded payment in Bitcoin.  It was reported that Disney was a victim and the new Pirates of the Caribbean film was being held for ransom.
Despite the rapid growth of cryptocurrencies, cash is still king.  Cash is convenient. Cash is private. Cash is intuitive. Cash does not require transactions costs.  But cash really only works with direct handoff and can be clunky to carry and easy to be stolen or lost.  In this digital age, there absolutely is a pressing need for a digital currency that works.  Cryptocurrencies serve that purpose.  It’s still very early in this trend.  Despite many attempts, nothing rivals the US Dollar.
Today, over 1/3 of consumer transactions in the United States are paid with cash.  It is still the single largest source of payment.  But, if you combine debit and credit cards, they account for nearly half of consumer spending habits.  Roughly 10% of all purchases are made online today, and it’s certainly growing.  Bitcoin is included in this.  Checks and other electronic payments are less frequent but tend to account for the larger transactions.  No surprise, cash is more popular for smaller purchases.  But outside the United States, over 80% of transactions are paid in cash.  Cryptocurrencies will likely play a much bigger role overseas over time as new consumers enter global markets.
The world still loves Dollars.  It’s probably not a surprise that the $1 Bill is the most common note in circulation.  George Washington’s face is on just over 30% of the $1.1 Trillion Federal notes in circulation.  What might be a surprise is the $100 Bill is in greater circulation than the $20 Bill.  It’s close (26% vs 23% of total), but Ben Franklin wins out over Old Hickory.  There are more $100 Bills overseas than in the United States.  Have you ever wondered why our money is green?  It was hard to copy, which helped prevent counterfeiting.  In 1861, money was first printed with green ink on the back, which quickly earned the name the “Greenback”.  Knowledge is power.
These Markets move fast, but we’re all over it.  Have a fantastic Memorial Day weekend.  We’ll be back, dark and early on Tuesday.

TGIF – The Bull is Still Alive and Kicking
“Has Trump killed the Bull Market?” That was a headline from one of our research sources this week. The title is certainly an attention getter, and many investors have been no doubt thinking this was possible, if not probable. But remember, Politics rarely drive Markets. Earnings and economic activity take that role. To be sure, Politics absolutely influence Market activity. Government policies can both help and hurt investment as it applies to tax treatment and regulation among others. But earnings and economic cycles are much more powerful and natural. They’re demand driven. Politics feed on emotion, which can be enhancers and detractors from progress. These are indeed emotional times in which we live. We do not think the Bull Market is coming to an end quite yet. We have however prepared for increased volatility.
The Market finally got rattled this week as the issues at the White House continued to escalate and the severity of the situation grew by the minute. For most of the 7 months since President Trump was elected, the Market has taken his controversial and unconventional behavior in stride. The focus has been on earnings and economic acceleration. Both have been better than expected. That is a really good thing. But it feels a little different now, and the controversy surrounding classified intelligence and Russia is catching up to the President. The prospects for tax reform and other pro-growth policies are seemingly slipping away while the White House scrambles to maintain composure. The Market doesn’t like it and has begun repricing those expectations. Wednesday brought the biggest selloff on the year. But keep in mind the S&P 500 hit a fresh, all-time high on Monday. The week ended on a high note for stocks, but the weekend no doubt will be full of more news and events.
Things still look ok under the hood, no cause for panic yet
The credit markets are functioning properly. That wasn’t the case in previous corrections. The yield curve has flattened a bit, but mostly because the front end has increased, which is normal with expected Fed rate hikes. The Dollar is weak, and has been for a while. After hitting 15 year highs, the Dollar has erased all its gains for the year, and is back at the level it was ahead of the election. This is important because it suggests that the Market believes there is risk to a strengthening US economy and the stability and predictability of the US government is actually in question. But a weak Dollar is good for American products overseas. The only problem is, global markets are still mired in the debate about free trade and fair trade. That will likely continue. Our sense is the Fed will be a little more careful with their interest rate hike campaign now, in light of the Washington turmoil. A rate hike in June is still likely, but beyond is very much in question. For the first time in years, money has been flowing out of US assets into international stocks. Gold has also been a recipient of money leaving the Dollar. We like our exposure in both these areas, which we began building last year.
It was a big week for Oil, which broke above $50 again. Russia and Saudi Arabia, the 2 largest oil producers, agreed to extend production cuts for the rest of the year in an attempt to drive the price higher. They’re also combatting the continued production acceleration in Texas. But global demand is increasing, largely driven by India and China. The global economy is showing signs of acceleration. Energy stocks have had a tough go this year, but we believe higher levels are ahead.
Earnings Season is basically over, and was very solid, with the S&P growing earnings over 13% in Q1. It was the best quarter in years. But the focus has turned towards Geopolitics, which brought more volatile price action to the mix. So many investors haven’t trusted this rally and are shocked that the Market has gone up as much as it has this year. This Bull Market is definitely in the latter stages of its life. Low rates and slow growth are unique characteristics that could make it the longest in history. Right now it’s second only to the Dot.comrally in the 90’s. As famed investor John Templeton eloquently said, “Bull markets are born on pessimism, grown on skepticism, mature on optimism and die on euphoria”. There is no euphoria today, a dominant characteristic from the 2 prior Bull Markets that ended very poorly. But Bull Markets don’t move in straight-lines  either. We are not getting overly aggressive to protect the downside, as we still think there is more life in this Bull yet. But we did raise cash and initiate a hedge for a reason last week. A healthy correction is coming; the only question is when. Tighten those belts and hang on for the ride. We’re all over it.
Have a nice weekend.
Mike

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 09/18/2014
            

                BBB has determined that Bedell Frazier Investment Counseling, LLC meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means

5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

 Cd Interest Rates Ira Cd Rates 





10 BEST CD RATES
        The best CD rates largely depend on how long you’re willing to have your money tied up. As of January 2016, the average one-year CD interest rate is 0.27%. Searching for the highest yield possible on a certificate of deposit, or CD, is essential to maximizing your savings. CD rates for similar terms can vary widely and that translates into money earned or potential savings lost.With thousands of banks, credit unions and online institutions to choose from, getting started isn't always so easy.The highest rankings excelled in low minimum deposit requirements and high interest rates on 12-month terms.With higher rates and a short time commitment of just 12 months, even those hesitant to lock down their savings can benefit from a one-year CD. Finding an account with a low (or no) minimum deposit requirement can make it even easier to open a CD regardless of how much money you are comfortable setting aside.Nationwide Bank- Rewarding those with higher account balances, Nationwide Bank's CD account offers 1.14 percent APY on deposits up to $99,999.99 and 1.19 percent APY on accounts over $100,000 for a 12-month term. The account also has a relatively low minimum deposit requirement of $500, ranking it in the top spot. There's also no minimum balance requirement to earn interest. Barclays Bank-Also requiring no minimum deposit requirement, Barclays Bank Delaware's 12-month Online CD account gleans a return of 0.80 percent APY. This online bank offers its customers nine term length options. Ally Bank-Ally Bank's CD account is among the top for having no minimum deposit requirement and APY of 1.05 percent for 12-month terms. Ally Bank offers depositors a 10-day grace period to withdraw funds upon opening a CD account without incurring a penalty. CIT Bank- The interest rate CIT Bank's Term CD offers is the same as GE Capital Bank's, 1.10 percent APY for a 12-month CD, but the minimum deposit requirement is higher, at $1,000. All CD accounts except for the bank's six-month option are also available as IRA CDs. TIAA Direct.-In the sixth seat, with the same minimum account deposit as CIT Bank of $1,000, TIAA Direct's CD account offers lower yields of 1.01 percent APY, making its returns just shy of double the national average. TIAA Direct customers enjoy choice, as the bank offers 11 different CD terms ranging from six months to five years Presidential Online Bank.-Presidential Online Bank's 12-month CD offers a rate of 0.95 percent APY, and requires a minimum deposit of $1,000 to open, rounding out our list. Presidential Online Bank also offers a variety of short-term CD options, including 30-day, 60-day and 182-day terms; these options are perfect for those who don't wish to commit to a longer-term account. GE Capital Bank-With the same minimum deposit requirement as Nationwide Bank at $500 and only a slightly lower interest rate of 1.10 percent APY for a 12-month CD, GE Capital Bank's CD account ranked No. 2. GE Capital Bank also accepts high deposits, capping CD accounts at $1 million. Bank5 Connect.-Due to its $500 minimum account deposit and high 1 percent APY for terms of 12 months, Bank5 Connect's CD account claimed the fourth spot. Accounts at Bank5 Connect are protected above the FDIC's regular $250,000 threshold through Depositors Insurance Fund protection. Synchrony Bank.-With the highest minimum deposit requirement on the list, Synchrony Bank's Optimizer+Plus CD accounts require account holders to invest $2,000 into their CDs in exchange for a return of 1.15 percent APY* on 12-month terms. Encouraging savings, Synchrony Bank offers higher yields for greater balances, providing plenty of motivation to save. First Internet Bank.-With a 1 percent APY that's barely below TIAA Direct's account, this account has a higher minimum account balance requirement of $1,000. First Internet Bank offers eight different CD terms, from three months to five years, to its customers. So what are the best strategies for CD savers? Interest rates are at historical lows, and certificate of deposit rates are no exception. With years of paltry yields ahead, savers have fewer safe options than ever. As the great yield drought continues, what can savers and CD lovers do?Stick to short maturitiesWhen rates are very low, fixed-income investors run into increased interest rate risk. If interest rates go up, savers are left holding underperforming investments to maturity or trying to sell them at a loss. While CD owners may be able to sell their CD, the more likely scenario would be to break the terms of the CD and take the early withdrawal penalty. That could wipe out years of interest or even eat into principal, depending on how punishing the penalty fee is.Beware of early withdrawal penaltiesEarly withdrawal penalties are all over the map and vary among financial institutions. Bankrate's 2014 early withdrawal penalty survey found that the fee for breaking a CD early can be as high as $50 plus 3 percent of the amount withdrawn. Most are not that onerous -- the average penalty for early withdrawal on a long-term CD equals six months' worth of interest. For CDs with a maturity of less than a year, the average penalty is equal to three months' worth of interest.Save moreWith a finite supply of money, individuals may struggle to supplement returns on their own. Some CDs, known as add-on CDs, allow you to add deposits, which could at least allow your initial savings to keep up with inflation.Evaluate options such as the bump-up CDSome types of CDs are better suited to today's low-rate environment than others -- for instance, the bump-up. If interest rates go up, a bump-up CD allows the owner to request a CD rate increase. With interest rates set to rise in 2015, longer term bump-up CDs would seem to be just the ticket for savers worried about chasing yield and interest rate risk. Unfortunately, they may be hard to come by.Consider the indexed or structured CDAnother nontraditional CD is the structured CD, which is linked to some other kind of investment, such as the stock market, currency market or commodities. Though they won't lose money as long as they are held to maturity, returns are typically capped at a percentage of the total return of the underlying index or basket of securities.
