Why order flowers through us?

    Ordering through the funeral home helps ensure your order will be placed through a local flower shop with whom the funeral home has a personal and trusting relationship with. Through this service, you will be able to leave a longer message of support to the family via a card with the picture of your selection that will be included with your thoughtful gesture. As well as a photo of your arrangement and message will remain in perpetuity within this memorial website. This service also includes “Smart Select” whereby the store notifies you if your floral selection has already been selected by another sender, allowing you the opportunity to choose a different arrangement if you wish.
  

  The price of these selections also include the funeral home caring for the flowers after the funeral and delivering them to the family, or various care facilities where they can be rearranged and enjoyed by others for a longer period.

Go to the Heartfelt Sympathies store






Memorial Candles
A Perpetual Tribute
The solitude and quiet peace of a flickering candle has long been a symbol of remembrance. Each candle lit will remain lit within this memorial website for the period you select. Your thoughtful gesture will be captured both in the candle as well as listed in perpetuity within the tributes section.

Go to the Heartfelt Sympathies store






Memorial Trees
Circle of Life
In today’s changing world with climate change and environment concerns, “Honoring a Life” allows for
  family and friends to plant a memorial tree in honor of their loved one and friend. The purchase of a tree creates a beautiful permanent record on the Honoring a Life website, www.honoringalife.org. Each tree is planted through the efforts of Forestry Services throughout North America who determine where the greatest needs for reforestation are. Once planted, the geographical location where the tree is planted will be added to the record. A beautiful card is also sent to the family signifying your thoughtful gesture.

Financial Support
A Helping Hand
The time surrounding a death can often bring unexpected final expenses for the family far beyond the funeral itself. We are pleased to offer the ability for friends and relatives to financially support the family during their time of loss as an alternative to flowers and other sympathy gestures.
