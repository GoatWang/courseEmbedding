What is an independent financial advisor?
Independent Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) are professional independent advisory firms that provide personalized financial advice to their clients, many of whom have complex financial needs. Because these advisors are independent, they are not tied to any particular family of funds or investment products. As fiduciaries, they are held to the highest standard of care – and are required to act in the best interests of their clients at all times. They are registered with either the Securities and Exchange Commission or state securities regulators1.

Why does Charles Schwab support independent advisors?

Charles Schwab has provided custodial services to independent financial advisors for over 25 years. We are proud to support over 7,000 of these firms and the important work they do for their clients.






Why does it matter if your  advisor is independent?
Many independent advisory firms are owned by the individual advisors who run them, so they forge deep, personal relationships and have a strong sense of accountability to their clients.


Key Benefits:

Customized guidance based on your entire financial picture.
A relationship that’s responsive, attentive, and personal.
A fee structure that is simple and transparent.
A high level of expertise to support your complex financial needs.
Your money is held by an independent custodian, not the advisor firm.

Learn more about the key benefits






Choosing the right advisor.
Whether triggered by a life event or evolving goals, many people reach a point where they need more from their financial advisor. You may be asking yourself one of these questions:

Does the financial guidance I’m currently receiving truly reflect my goals?
Could I be getting more personalized attention from my advisor?
Is there a better way?

It can be a challenge to find an advisor that’s right for you. But there are tangible clues that can help you evaluate how responsive and accountable an advisor may be.

“Get acquainted with independent financial advisors”



Independent Financial Advisors
Understanding fiduciary.
As fiduciaries regulated under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, independent registered investment advisors are held by law to the highest standard of responsibility to their clients, therefore upholding them to always act in their clients’ best interests. This encourages a unique level of personalized service not always found in investor-advisor relationships.






Key benefits of independent registered investment advisors.



Customized guidance based on your entire financial picture
Independent advisors are not tied to any particular family of funds or investment products. So whether you need help with retirement planning, a tax situation, estate planning, or managing assets at multiple places, independent advisors have the freedom to choose from a wide range of investment options in order to tailor their advice based on what’s best for you.




A relationship that’s responsive, attentive, and personal
To offer advice closely aligned with your goals, independent advisors must first build a strong understanding of your situation. As a result, many independent advisors focus on building deep relationships with their clients. This often takes regular, ongoing interactions. And because many of these advisors are entrepreneurial business owners, they hold themselves personally accountable to their clients.




A fee structure that is simple and transparent
Independent advisors typically charge a fee based on a percentage of assets managed. This fee structure is simple, transparent, and easy to understand. It also gives your advisor an incentive to help grow your assets. When you succeed, your advisor succeeds.




A high level of expertise to support your complex financial needs
Independent advisors can help investors address the variety of complex investment needs that arise when you accumulate significant wealth. While specific services vary from firm to firm, they are often described as financial “quarterbacks” focused on your holistic financial picture. Some advisors are specialists in certain investment strategies. Others can assist you with comprehensive services, such as estate planning or borrowing, the sale of a business, complicated tax situations, trusts, and intergenerational wealth transfer.




Your money is held by an independent custodian, not the advisor firm.
Independent advisors use independent custodians, such as Charles Schwab and others, to hold and safeguard clients’ assets. For many investors, this provides a reassuring system of checks and balances – your money is not held by the same person who advises you about how to invest it.

“The difference is approach”









Questions to ask yourself.
Whether you’re starting with a list of recommended advisors or you have a specific advisor in mind, starting with the three questions located in the tabs below can help you make a thoughtful choice.



What are my goals and preferences?
Consider these Factors: risk tolerance, time horizon, income, taxes, and holdings.
Being able to clearly articulate your needs and expectations will help you and the advisors you talk with make an informed decision about whether you’re right for each other. If you are an individual investor, your advisor should understand your goals and your particular financial situation and make recommendations that are suitable for you. Some important factors to consider in defining your goals include:

Investment Goals – What are you working toward: A comfortable retirement? Leaving a legacy? Philanthropic goals?
Risk Tolerance – How much fluctuation in value can you tolerate in exchange for the opportunity to earn above-average returns?
Time Horizon – When will you need to withdraw money from your investments?
Income Needs – Do you need current income from your portfolio? How much?
Tax Situation – Does your tax bracket require a tax-sensitive strategy?
Other Holdings – Do you have significant wealth tied up in real estate or other illiquid assets?
Other Needs – Do you have complex planning needs related to wealth transfer, executive compensation, risk management, business succession planning, or philanthropic planning?



What investment services do I need?

Consider what level of investment and advisory services you need. For example, some advisors provide clients with a pure investment management relationship while other advisors provide clients with sophisticated financial planning and advisory services in addition to investment management services.

Portfolio design
Discretionary portfolio management
Ongoing investment advice



Cash management

Planning

Education funding
Business succession
Charitable giving

Wealth transfers

What is my preferred communication style?
You should also consider the nature of the client relationship that you would like with an investment advisor, including the frequency, level, and form of communication you would like to maintain with the advisor. How often would you like to communicate with your advisor? Would you like to communicate only by phone and email, or would you prefer to discuss your investments in person?

Interview questions to ask advisors.
As you begin to talk with advisors, you’ll want to evaluate them objectively. Asking each advisor a consistent set of questions will help ensure that you have the information you need to make a good comparison. 





What are your credentials?




An advisor’s professional designations can tell you a great deal about his or her education and areas of expertise.


CFP® (Certified Financial Planner™)
CFP professionals have completed university-level financial planning coursework and passed a 10-hour exam covering nearly 90 topics, from group medical insurance to derivatives.
                          More information >



CFA® (Chartered Financial Analyst®)
CFAs must pass three exams, each of which demands a minimum of 250 hours of study and includes corporate finance and financial statements.
                          More information >



PFS (Personal Financial Specialist)
Personal financial specialists are certified public accountants who specialize in personal financial planning. The credential requires a detailed exam and significant financial planning expertise.
                          More information >



CIMA® (Certified Investment Management Analyst®)
CIMAs focus on asset allocation and typically complete final coursework at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, or at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.
                          More information >



Suggestion - Visit the website of the organization that issued an advisor’s credential to verify that the advisor is a member in good standing and to learn about the requirements for certification.
Common credentials - This is not a complete list of certifications. There is no implied endorsement of one certification over another. Professional designations attained by an advisor do not guarantee a profit or protect against loss in periods of declining values.






Do you offer the services I need?




Investment advisory practices vary widely in the services they provide. In general, they fall into one or a combination of the categories listed below.


Money managers
If you need someone to manage your portfolio and do your investing, consider money managers. They:

Design investment portfolios, generally consisting of stocks, bonds, and other individual securities.
Often manage the portfolio on a discretionary basis, meaning that you authorize the advisor to trade on your behalf without the need for advance approval from you.
May not offer general financial planning services.



Financial planners
If you need someone to review your situation and help with big-picture planning, consider financial planners. They:

Help you look to the future and do long-term financial planning in the areas of retirement, college funding, wealth transfer, tax planning, and insurance.
May not offer investing and portfolio management services.



Wealth managers
If you need an advisor who can handle both your investing and planning needs, consider wealth managers. They:

Provide highly personalized, comprehensive financial planning as well as investment and portfolio management for high-net-worth clients.
Coordinate with other professional advisors, such as attorneys and accountants, to serve more complex financial needs, which may include tax minimization, trust management, wealth transfers, real estate management, and portfolio performance analytics.









How are you compensated?




Knowing how your advisor is compensated may help you evaluate the relative objectivity of the recommendations you receive. Independent advisors generally work on a fee-only or fee-plus-commissions basis.
Types of compensation and what they mean to you:


Fee only
Asset-based, hourly, or flat fees: Many independent advisors charge a percentage of the assets they manage for you (typically 1%–2%). This compensation method gives your advisor an incentive to help grow your assets. Hourly or flat fees are often associated with a specific, one-time service (e.g., developing a financial plan). The fee may vary by account size and service. In addition to these fees, you may pay commissions and/or other fees for execution of the trades your advisor makes and for custody of your assets.


Fee plus commissions
Along with an advisory or financial planning fee, some advisors may receive a portion of the commissions you pay when you buy or sell certain financial products the advisor recommends, such as insurance policies or annuities.


Commissions only
Advisors sometimes receive compensation only from sales commissions on the investments they buy and sell for you.


Wrap fees
Sometimes advisors charge a wrap fee, which is typically a single asset-based fee for the advice they provide and the execution of the trades they make.








How will we work together?




Good communication between you and your advisor is essential. Asking the questions below can help you judge the amount of attention and regular communication you can expect.
What to ask:


With whom will I work?
In some cases, the firm’s principal may conduct your initial meeting and then turn your portfolio over to an associate or a team that actually manages it. If personal rapport is important to you, ask to meet with the people you’ll be working with.


How often will we communicate?
Regular contact helps ensure that you and your advisor are clear about your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment strategy. Typically, your advisor meets you in person at least annually – and stays in touch more frequently by phone and email.


How will you report performance?
At a minimum, you should expect to receive:

Account statements from the advisor or custodian/brokerage firm where your assets are held.
Quarterly summaries of year-to-date investment performance.
A comprehensive annual performance report from your advisor.



What is the size of your firm?
A firm’s size – including the number of employees, the assets under management, and the average portfolio size – can have a bearing on the quality of service you receive.

Large firms may have more resources – an important consideration if your needs call for specialized services. Small firms may offer more personalized attention.
The average portfolio size of the advisor’s other clients helps you understand your potential fit with the firm.









How do you approach investing for people like me?




Things to consider:


Performance

Ask to see portfolio performance numbers for up and down markets1.
Ask the advisor to compare the performance with relevant benchmarks, such as the S&P 500® Index2, during the same time period.
An advisor should at least meet – and preferably beat – the benchmark.



Investment style

Advisors may specialize in certain types of investments (such as mutual funds, stocks, or bonds) and styles (such as growth or value).
You can assess whether the advisor's methodology or style aligns with your objectives.
Asking about an advisor's investment style is a good way to make sure that the advisor can explain his or her approach clearly and in a way that you understand.



Decision-making

Advisors who have a disciplined approach to decision-making may be more likely to stay focused on your long-term goals.
Many advisors use an asset allocation strategy that has a history of success over time. Your strategy should be based on your goals, time horizon, and comfort with risk.
Knowing how often an advisor adjusts portfolios can indicate whether the advisor uses a strategic, long-term approach or invests in short-term trends.




1Past performance does not guarantee future results.
2The S&P 500® Index is an index of widely traded stocks. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur fees or expenses, and cannot be invested in directly.







Where will my assets be held?




Independent financial advisors typically use independent custodians – generally brokerage firms or banks – to hold and safeguard their clients’ stocks, mutual funds, and other assets.
Why should you ask this question?
You want to be confident that your advisor has chosen a custodian that meets or exceeds the security measures required by industry regulators to help protect your assets.

Look for a custodian with important services, such as trade execution and preparation of monthly brokerage statements, which allow your advisor to concentrate on managing your portfolio.

Ask about the custodian’s policies to help protect personal and financial information from unauthorized activity.










Preliminary screening.




You can review pertinent information about an advisor even before you meet
All independent advisors are required to publicly disclose details about their business by filing a Form ADV. You can review the Form ADVs on the SEC website at www.adviserinfo.sec.gov.
Find a local advisor


Form ADV, Part 1 describes the advisor’s business, ownership, clients, employees, business practices, affiliations, and disciplinary history.
Form ADV, Part 2 is a narrative brochure that describes in plain English the advisor’s services, fee schedule, disciplinary information, conflicts of interest, and the educational and business background of management and key advisory personnel. Advisors are required to give you this information before you hire them.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

                            With the rising costs of college, families are taking a multigenerational approach to planning for education and other life goals.
                        





It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.
With the costs of higher education trending higher each year, paying for college has become a top-tier life expense, alongside other big-ticket goals like buying a home and planning for retirement. However, education costs have now skyrocketed to the extent that saving for both of those life goals—retirement and home-buying—has become hampered in some families.

Some parents are cutting back on retirement savings contributions to help fund their children’s education.  At the same time, children are entering their 20’s with student loan debt, which in some cases is delaying the purchase of their first home. Even grandparents have modified life goals, choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now, rather than leaving a larger legacy later.
In short, paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern. But with a little advance planning, families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college. 





The Growing Cost of Education



According to the College Board's latest “Trends in Higher Education" report, the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes, financial aid and many consumer goods and services. It now costs, on average, $45,370 per year for tuition, fees, room and board, for a four-year private college. Assuming a college-cost inflation rate of 3%, today’s 8-year-old child may need $255,090 come college time in 2027.
“For parents, the number-one goal from a financial planning perspective is still retirement, but close behind is paying for a child’s education,” says Marc Dextraze, Executive Director, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions.




It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.

One option, says Dextraze, is for parents to start saving early with a 529 college savings plan.  “Having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on, avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans," he says. For the child, “Having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options, like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals, as opposed to the college that offers the most aid. And graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom."
Named after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, a 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save, or even pay in advance, for college expenses. Earnings in a 529 plan can be tax deferred, and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition, fees, room and board and supplies. Many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that.





Making Education a Family Affair



Motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education, grandparents, relatives and even family friends have also begun creating 529 accounts in a child’s name. Not only do 529 plans offer potential tax advantages, they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt.
“Today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college," says Jennifer Tierney, Vice President, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions and 529 plans product manager. “It's so important to plan ahead. For grandparents, aunts and uncles, family friends, it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that 529 plans provide to a child and from a tax-perspective, to themselves.”

A Flexible Way to Save and Invest for College



The appeal of 529 plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility.
There are no income restrictions, no required minimum distributions, no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own, generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account, and high contribution limits. Virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child, grandchild, niece, nephew, spouse, even a friend.1
According to Chris Stack, a managing consultant at Savingforcollege.com, one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the 529 account, as opposed to a UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) or UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act) account or other strategy. “With 529s, grandparents or extended family give themselves an option, but not an obligation, to apply their funds to help pay college costs," he says. 


Another significant benefit of 529 plans is tax-free compounding. “Earning on an account’s growth, rather than paying taxes on the earnings, provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality," Stack says. “Having the ability to withdraw the principal and tax-deferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit, especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account."
Stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible. While as soon as the child is born is ideal, he said, some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future."
Says Dextraze, “At the end of the day, the idea is to harmonize all of your goals, taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there, including 401Ks, 529s and others. It’s using all of the available tools. That’s how you reach your goals.”


Morgan Stanley offers many 529s from some of the nation’s leading mutual fund companies. You can choose from a range of investment strategies depending on the specific plan, the age of the beneficiary, your financial objectives and risk tolerance. Talk with your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor, or find one using the locator below, for more information. 
















1 Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes, and beneficiary changes may result in an immediate tax liability if the new beneficiary is not a member of the old beneficiary’s family. Contribution limits vary by state. Refer to the individual plan for specific guidelines.


Disclosures
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses associated with 529 plans and municipal fund securities before investing. More information about municipal fund securities is available in the issuer's official statement – the 529 Plan Program Disclosure – which is available from your Financial Advisor. It should be read carefully before investing.
Investments are subject to market risk and may fluctuate in value. Before investing, investors should consider whether tax or other benefits are only available for investments in the investor’s home-state 529 college savings plan. Assets can accumulate and be withdrawn federally tax-free only if they are used to pay for qualified expenses. Earnings on nonqualified distributions will be subject to income tax and a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some states offer favorable tax treatment and other benefits to their residents only if they invest in the state’s own Qualified Tuition Program. Investors should consult with their financial and tax advisor before investing in any 529 plan, or contact their state tax division for more information. Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes.

                            Navigate the money taboo and get together around what really matters—your family.
                        





What’s the hardest thing to talk about? Death, religion, politics? Would it surprise you to know that one of the most difficult things to discuss is money? When polled, 44% of Americans claimed that personal finance was the hardest to discuss – beating out politics and even death.1
Perhaps this is because money represents more than a topic – it can represent control, power, embarrassment, insecurity, fear. For some people, the hesitation stems from a natural reluctance to confront their own mortality or their potential for future disability. For others, avoiding the topic is caused by the perception that planning is associated with complicated—and expensive—legal and tax issues.

Silence Can Be Harmful



Avoiding these sometimes difficult conversations can have detrimental outcomes and unexpected consequences for your family, such as:
Passing On Bad Habits - Talking to your children about money now can help them avoid mistakes in the future. The key is to talk about what money means to you and why you worked hard to achieve your success. It involves being open about the challenges and responsibilities that accompany wealth – including what you might have wished you’d done differently when younger. And, most important, it’s about your values and what you wish for yourself and your children to accomplish with your privilege. The conversation can serve as an empowering first step to forming a healthy relationship with wealth.
Lost Opportunities - It’s never too early for your children to understand the value of creating a wealth plan that takes family members’ needs into account. Family members may not be aligned on priorities, such as long-term health care needs, charitable giving and generational gifting strategies, and taking the time to establish common goals is the first step in understanding how all members can participate in achieving them. 
The reality is that 70% of families lose their wealth by the second generation.[ii] Lack of communication can ultimately lead to misunderstandings and divergent objectives that could jeopardize your legacy and work against your values.
Costly Procrastination - Perhaps the hardest of conversations to have as an adult is with your aging parents. This is where the danger of putting it off grows exponentially. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human services, 70% of people over 65 will require some long-term care at some point in their lives.[iii] Once a crisis hits, it’s often too late. Now is the time to determine if sufficient long-term health care plans have been made, as well as who will make financial decisions on your parents’ behalf if they lose the ability to safely handle their money. Proper planning gives you time to discuss your decisions with family members. This open communication can help to reduce, if not eliminate, the risk of family discord, resentment or conflict.




Having a hard time starting a conversation about family finances? Here are a few questions to make it easy for you.



 
Is it important to talk about money as a family?




 
At what age do you hope to retire?




 
When is it ok to borrow money?




 
What's your favorite charitable cause and why?




 
How is your generation different from the generations before you?




 
Should children give to charity?

A New Paradigm for Family Wealth Planning











Align Your Goals with Strategies for Reaching Them



Morgan Stanley’s goals-based wealth planning framework strives to guard against more than just market volatility. We believe that a successful planning strategy must meet the following criteria:
1. Your plan should be customized to reflect what you care about most. It should address both the goals you hope to achieve and the risk of outliving your assets.
2. Your plan should address the shifting nature of issues and unknowns you face at different stages of your life and consider risks beyond market volatility, like inflation.
3. Your plan should seek to mitigate judgment and behavioral risks such as panic selling in difficult markets or overspending.





Smash the Taboo



We know it’s hard. Sitting down to discuss your parents’ long-term health needs or checking in with your siblings to see if you are all on the same page relating to any inheritance isn’t easy. What about your children; do they value the same causes that have moved you all your life? Is your spouse prepared should something happen to you?
The tough part is getting started, and that’s where bringing in an objective financial professional can help. We understand that wealth is about much more than just money, and can guide the conversation down those difficult paths to uncover the things that matter most to you and your family. We don’t believe in having a single conversation, but rather a series of talks that shift as your life changes. It’s a road. And you don’t have to travel it alone.
It starts with family, but doesn’t have to end there. We are ready to provide the guidance, tools and information that can help you tackle these difficult topics and transform them into meaningful discussions for your future. Uncover what matters most to you and find a Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor to help guide the conversation. Because the road starts here.

Capstone ira Retirement Planning & Financial investment advisors, cfa in Colorado Springs

 

As a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) we keep up to date on our IRA and retirement planning, a recent study (source: Northwestern Mutual) showed:
58% OF AMERICANS BELIEVE THEIR FINANCIAL PLANNING EFFORTS NEED IMPROVEMENT.
34% OF AMERICANS HAVE DONE NOTHING TO PLAN FOR THEIR FINANCIAL FUTURES.
Do you need:
…to know when you can retire?
…to build a financially secure future?
…guidance to make financial decisions for your circumstances?
The most common question we hear as financial advisors is WHEN CAN I RETIRE?
Clients often ask, “Can I retire early?” or “When can I comfortably retire with enough money?” To find a solution, as a Certified Financial Advisor, we must first get to know your financial situation and calculate your FUNDED INCOME. This is the income you want and need in retirement to live a life of significance.
Capstone Investment Financial Advisors Group is your resource for building a secure IRA & financial future.
KNOW WHEN YOU CAN RETIRE
 
Confused about your finances?
You might think you are looking at a jigsaw puzzle when it comes to analyzing your Roth IRA and knowing when you can retire.
Here are some client stories. Do you relate?
“I have a 30 minute commute in traffic. The deadlines of work are weighing on me.
I want to do a good job, but to get it done takes a lot out of me.
I don’t know how much money I need and how best to put my money to work, so I continue to work.
I want to be able to retire soon, but how much will that cost?”
“For years, I have been working in a job with a six figure income, but it is unfulfilling to me. I long to switch jobs and do something I know would make me happy, but to do so I would be making significantly less than my current income. How would this factor into my future retirement?”
“I have been working a long time. I have had to make hard decisions and sacrifice for my family. Now that I’m getting older, I want time to do what I want.”
The things you want to do could be as diverse as traveling in an RV, taking a trip to Italy, or having time to read a library of books. There are many variables to consider before you retire. You need strategies to make sure you get the results you’re looking for in retirement.
Capstone’s financial advisors identify the individual pieces of your retirement picture and helps you assemble the puzzle. This means taking into consideration your income, spending, investments, Social Security, Medicare, and pension data and how it compares to your anticipated retirement expenses. The idea is to create a picture of retirement life. We will determine how much you will spend in retirement, the income to support that spending, and the portion of that income you will need to withdraw from your investments and IRA.
The Answer?
BUILD A FINANCIALLY SECURE FUTURE
We frequently hear from clients the following: “So many variables! So much news to follow! I don’t enjoy looking at my financial status or have the experience to make those decisions. I am uncertain about the future and what to do.”

Our Colorado Springs financial advisor Clients tell us they have spent their time teaching, nursing, selling for their company; not following the stock market or knowing how best to invest their money. They say things like: “I think I have done a good job saving. But how do I know? How do I know that I can send my kids to college, or I can purchase a second home in the mountains or on the beach? I don’t want to worry about these things. I want to play tennis and go golfing and be active.”
They know they want to make the right decisions, but they don’t know where to start or who they can trust to put them on the right path.
We can show you how to organize the money and income you have to create the life you want and live a financially secure future.
Our Services include Financial Planning, Retirement Planning, Investment Management, Risk Management & Wealth Management.
WHAT WE DO IN COLORADO SPRINGS, CO

Investors trust independent advisors with over $4 trillion of their money.
That’s some serious trust.


Independent advisors are accountable.


Independent advisors are here to serve, not sell.


Independent Registered Investment Advisors are professionals held to a fiduciary standard.


Independent advisor firms are one of the fastest-growing areas within the financial services industry.


Independent advisors are not tied to any particular family of funds or investment products.


Independent advisors focus on building deep, lasting relationships with clients.



































What is an independent financial advisor?
Independent Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) are professional independent advisory firms that provide personalized financial advice to their clients, many of whom have complex financial needs. Because these advisors are independent, they are not tied to any particular family of funds or investment products. As fiduciaries, they are held to the highest standard of care – and are required to act in the best interests of their clients at all times. They are registered with either the Securities and Exchange Commission or state securities regulators1.

Why does Charles Schwab support independent advisors?

Charles Schwab has provided custodial services to independent financial advisors for over 25 years. We are proud to support over 7,000 of these firms and the important work they do for their clients.






Why does it matter if your  advisor is independent?
Many independent advisory firms are owned by the individual advisors who run them, so they forge deep, personal relationships and have a strong sense of accountability to their clients.


Key Benefits:

Customized guidance based on your entire financial picture.
A relationship that’s responsive, attentive, and personal.
A fee structure that is simple and transparent.
A high level of expertise to support your complex financial needs.
Your money is held by an independent custodian, not the advisor firm.

Learn more about the key benefits






Choosing the right advisor.
Whether triggered by a life event or evolving goals, many people reach a point where they need more from their financial advisor. You may be asking yourself one of these questions:

Does the financial guidance I’m currently receiving truly reflect my goals?
Could I be getting more personalized attention from my advisor?
Is there a better way?

It can be a challenge to find an advisor that’s right for you. But there are tangible clues that can help you evaluate how responsive and accountable an advisor may be.

“The difference is approach”









Questions to ask yourself.
Whether you’re starting with a list of recommended advisors or you have a specific advisor in mind, starting with the three questions located in the tabs below can help you make a thoughtful choice.



What are my goals and preferences?
Consider these Factors: risk tolerance, time horizon, income, taxes, and holdings.
Being able to clearly articulate your needs and expectations will help you and the advisors you talk with make an informed decision about whether you’re right for each other. If you are an individual investor, your advisor should understand your goals and your particular financial situation and make recommendations that are suitable for you. Some important factors to consider in defining your goals include:

Investment Goals – What are you working toward: A comfortable retirement? Leaving a legacy? Philanthropic goals?
Risk Tolerance – How much fluctuation in value can you tolerate in exchange for the opportunity to earn above-average returns?
Time Horizon – When will you need to withdraw money from your investments?
Income Needs – Do you need current income from your portfolio? How much?
Tax Situation – Does your tax bracket require a tax-sensitive strategy?
Other Holdings – Do you have significant wealth tied up in real estate or other illiquid assets?
Other Needs – Do you have complex planning needs related to wealth transfer, executive compensation, risk management, business succession planning, or philanthropic planning?



What investment services do I need?

Consider what level of investment and advisory services you need. For example, some advisors provide clients with a pure investment management relationship while other advisors provide clients with sophisticated financial planning and advisory services in addition to investment management services.

You should also consider the nature of the client relationship that you would like with an investment advisor, including the frequency, level, and form of communication you would like to maintain with the advisor. How often would you like to communicate with your advisor? Would you like to communicate only by phone and email, or would you prefer to discuss your investments in person?












What Are My Goals and Preferences?


What Investment Services Do I Need?


What Is My Preferred Communication Style?







What are my goals and preferences?

Consider these factors: risk tolerance, time horizon, income, taxes, and holdings.
Being able to clearly articulate your needs and expectations will help you and the advisors you talk with make an informed decision about whether you’re right for each other. If you are an individual investor, your advisor should understand your goals and your particular financial situation and make recommendations that are suitable for you. Some important factors to consider in defining your goals include:




1. Investment goals - What are you working toward: A comfortable retirement? Leaving a legacy? Philanthropic goals?
2. Risk tolerance - How much fluctuation in value can you tolerate in exchange for the opportunity to earn above-average returns?
3. Time horizon - When will you need to withdraw money from your investments?
4. Income needs - Do you need current income from your portfolio? How much?


5. Tax situation - Does your tax bracket require a tax-sensitive strategy?
6. Other holdings - Do you have significant wealth tied up in real estate or other illiquid assets?
7. Other needs - Do you have complex planning needs related to wealth transfer, executive compensation, risk management, business succession planning, or philanthropic planning?







What investment services do I need?



Consider what level of investment and advisory services you need. For example, some advisors provide clients with a pure investment management relationship while other advisors provide clients with sophisticated financial planning and advisory services in addition to investment management services.

How often would you like to communicate with your advisor? Would you like to communicate only by phone and email, or would you prefer to discuss your investments in person?














Interview questions to ask advisors.
As you begin to talk with advisors, you’ll want to evaluate them objectively. Asking each advisor a consistent set of questions will help ensure that you have the information you need to make a good comparison. 





What are your credentials?




An advisor’s professional designations can tell you a great deal about his or her education and areas of expertise.


CFP® (Certified Financial Planner™)
CFP professionals have completed university-level financial planning coursework and passed a 10-hour exam covering nearly 90 topics, from group medical insurance to derivatives.
                          More information >



CFA® (Chartered Financial Analyst®)
CFAs must pass three exams, each of which demands a minimum of 250 hours of study and includes corporate finance and financial statements.
                          More information >



PFS (Personal Financial Specialist)
Personal financial specialists are certified public accountants who specialize in personal financial planning. The credential requires a detailed exam and significant financial planning expertise.
                          More information >



CIMA® (Certified Investment Management Analyst®)
CIMAs focus on asset allocation and typically complete final coursework at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, or at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.
                          More information >



Suggestion - Visit the website of the organization that issued an advisor’s credential to verify that the advisor is a member in good standing and to learn about the requirements for certification.
Common credentials - This is not a complete list of certifications. There is no implied endorsement of one certification over another. Professional designations attained by an advisor do not guarantee a profit or protect against loss in periods of declining values.






Do you offer the services I need?




Investment advisory practices vary widely in the services they provide. In general, they fall into one or a combination of the categories listed below.


Money managers
If you need someone to manage your portfolio and do your investing, consider money managers. They:

Design investment portfolios, generally consisting of stocks, bonds, and other individual securities.
Often manage the portfolio on a discretionary basis, meaning that you authorize the advisor to trade on your behalf without the need for advance approval from you.
May not offer general financial planning services.



Financial planners
If you need someone to review your situation and help with big-picture planning, consider financial planners. They:

Help you look to the future and do long-term financial planning in the areas of retirement, college funding, wealth transfer, tax planning, and insurance.
May not offer investing and portfolio management services.



Wealth managers
If you need an advisor who can handle both your investing and planning needs, consider wealth managers. They:

Provide highly personalized, comprehensive financial planning as well as investment and portfolio management for high-net-worth clients.
Coordinate with other professional advisors, such as attorneys and accountants, to serve more complex financial needs, which may include tax minimization, trust management, wealth transfers, real estate management, and portfolio performance analytics.









How are you compensated?




Knowing how your advisor is compensated may help you evaluate the relative objectivity of the recommendations you receive. Independent advisors generally work on a fee-only or fee-plus-commissions basis.
Types of compensation and what they mean to you:


Fee only
Asset-based, hourly, or flat fees: Many independent advisors charge a percentage of the assets they manage for you (typically 1%–2%). This compensation method gives your advisor an incentive to help grow your assets. Hourly or flat fees are often associated with a specific, one-time service (e.g., developing a financial plan). The fee may vary by account size and service. In addition to these fees, you may pay commissions and/or other fees for execution of the trades your advisor makes and for custody of your assets.


Fee plus commissions
Along with an advisory or financial planning fee, some advisors may receive a portion of the commissions you pay when you buy or sell certain financial products the advisor recommends, such as insurance policies or annuities.


Commissions only
Advisors sometimes receive compensation only from sales commissions on the investments they buy and sell for you.


Wrap fees
Sometimes advisors charge a wrap fee, which is typically a single asset-based fee for the advice they provide and the execution of the trades they make.








How will we work together?




Good communication between you and your advisor is essential. Asking the questions below can help you judge the amount of attention and regular communication you can expect.
What to ask:


With whom will I work?
In some cases, the firm’s principal may conduct your initial meeting and then turn your portfolio over to an associate or a team that actually manages it. If personal rapport is important to you, ask to meet with the people you’ll be working with.


How often will we communicate?
Regular contact helps ensure that you and your advisor are clear about your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment strategy. Typically, your advisor meets you in person at least annually – and stays in touch more frequently by phone and email.


How will you report performance?
At a minimum, you should expect to receive:

Account statements from the advisor or custodian/brokerage firm where your assets are held.
Quarterly summaries of year-to-date investment performance.
A comprehensive annual performance report from your advisor.



What is the size of your firm?
A firm’s size – including the number of employees, the assets under management, and the average portfolio size – can have a bearing on the quality of service you receive.

Large firms may have more resources – an important consideration if your needs call for specialized services. Small firms may offer more personalized attention.
The average portfolio size of the advisor’s other clients helps you understand your potential fit with the firm.









How do you approach investing for people like me?




Things to consider:


Performance

Ask to see portfolio performance numbers for up and down markets1.
Ask the advisor to compare the performance with relevant benchmarks, such as the S&P 500® Index2, during the same time period.
An advisor should at least meet – and preferably beat – the benchmark.



Investment style

Advisors may specialize in certain types of investments (such as mutual funds, stocks, or bonds) and styles (such as growth or value).
You can assess whether the advisor's methodology or style aligns with your objectives.
Asking about an advisor's investment style is a good way to make sure that the advisor can explain his or her approach clearly and in a way that you understand.



Decision-making

Advisors who have a disciplined approach to decision-making may be more likely to stay focused on your long-term goals.
Many advisors use an asset allocation strategy that has a history of success over time. Your strategy should be based on your goals, time horizon, and comfort with risk.
Knowing how often an advisor adjusts portfolios can indicate whether the advisor uses a strategic, long-term approach or invests in short-term trends.




1Past performance does not guarantee future results.
2The S&P 500® Index is an index of widely traded stocks. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur fees or expenses, and cannot be invested in directly.







Where will my assets be held?




Independent financial advisors typically use independent custodians – generally brokerage firms or banks – to hold and safeguard their clients’ stocks, mutual funds, and other assets.
Why should you ask this question?
You want to be confident that your advisor has chosen a custodian that meets or exceeds the security measures required by industry regulators to help protect your assets.

Look for a custodian with important services, such as trade execution and preparation of monthly brokerage statements, which allow your advisor to concentrate on managing your portfolio.

Ask about the custodian’s policies to help protect personal and financial information from unauthorized activity.










Preliminary screening.




You can review pertinent information about an advisor even before you meet
All independent advisors are required to publicly disclose details about their business by filing a Form ADV. You can review the Form ADVs on the SEC website at www.adviserinfo.sec.gov.
Find a local advisor


Form ADV, Part 1 describes the advisor’s business, ownership, clients, employees, business practices, affiliations, and disciplinary history.
Form ADV, Part 2 is a narrative brochure that describes in plain English the advisor’s services, fee schedule, disciplinary information, conflicts of interest, and the educational and business background of management and key advisory personnel. Advisors are required to give you this information before you hire them.

“Get acquainted with independent financial advisors”



Independent Financial Advisors
Understanding fiduciary.
As fiduciaries regulated under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, independent registered investment advisors are held by law to the highest standard of responsibility to their clients, therefore upholding them to always act in their clients’ best interests. This encourages a unique level of personalized service not always found in investor-advisor relationships.






Key benefits of independent registered investment advisors.



Customized guidance based on your entire financial picture
Independent advisors are not tied to any particular family of funds or investment products. So whether you need help with retirement planning, a tax situation, estate planning, or managing assets at multiple places, independent advisors have the freedom to choose from a wide range of investment options in order to tailor their advice based on what’s best for you.




A relationship that’s responsive, attentive, and personal
To offer advice closely aligned with your goals, independent advisors must first build a strong understanding of your situation. As a result, many independent advisors focus on building deep relationships with their clients. This often takes regular, ongoing interactions. And because many of these advisors are entrepreneurial business owners, they hold themselves personally accountable to their clients.




A fee structure that is simple and transparent
Independent advisors typically charge a fee based on a percentage of assets managed. This fee structure is simple, transparent, and easy to understand. It also gives your advisor an incentive to help grow your assets. When you succeed, your advisor succeeds.




A high level of expertise to support your complex financial needs
Independent advisors can help investors address the variety of complex investment needs that arise when you accumulate significant wealth. While specific services vary from firm to firm, they are often described as financial “quarterbacks” focused on your holistic financial picture. Some advisors are specialists in certain investment strategies. Others can assist you with comprehensive services, such as estate planning or borrowing, the sale of a business, complicated tax situations, trusts, and intergenerational wealth transfer.




Your money is held by an independent custodian, not the advisor firm.
Independent advisors use independent custodians, such as Charles Schwab and others, to hold and safeguard clients’ assets. For many investors, this provides a reassuring system of checks and balances – your money is not held by the same person who advises you about how to invest it.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

Legal and Disclosures
 
All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification and asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
 
Forward Looking Statements
The statements made herein take into account information currently available as well as historical trends. However, any forward-looking statement involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual performance of future markets to differ materially from the projections depicted here. There can be no certainty as to the extent or depth of any market downturn, nor any assurance regarding the nature, extent or timing of markets rebounding, and past performance cannot be relied upon for future performance. When evaluating the information included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect judgments only as of the date of the materials creation.
 
Statements of Opinion Including Case Studies
The information and opinions expressed herein are obtained from sources believed to be reliable and up-to-date, however their accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed. Opinions expressed reflect judgment current as of the date of this publication and are subject to change. Opinions expressed are current as of the date of the materials and are subject to change.
The materials on this site should in no way be construed as investment advice nor a solicitation to buy or sell securities or insurance products and services. No investment actions should be implemented based on the materials presented herein.
 
Investment Risk
Investment involves risk. The value of an investment as well as income associated with investments is not guaranteed and may fluctuate. Accordingly, investments may decline below what was originally invested.
 
International Investing
International investing, especially in emerging markets, involves special risks, such as currency exchange, political and economic risks. 
Alternative Investments
Alternative Investments involve a higher degree of risk because they may engage in leveraging or other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss. Alternative investments can also be highly illiquid.
 
REITs
REITs may be subject to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities and pose special risks. The value of real estate and portfolios that invest in real estate may fluctuate due to losses from causality or condemnation, changes in local and general economic conditions, supply and demand, interest rates, property taxes, and regulatory limitations on rents, zoning laws, and operating expenses.
 
Commodities
Commodities may be subject to greater volatility than securities and pose special risks. Investments in commodities may be affected by changes in interest rates, and other factors such as weather, disease, embargoes and international economic and political developments.
 
High Yield Bonds
High yield bonds are lower grade bonds whose principal may be subject to greater fluctuation than investments in higher rated bonds. Use of these instruments may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk.
 
Indices
Index performance is shown as total return. You cannot invest directly in an index, but you can invest in securities that track an index. Index funds are weighted and so may not perform in unison with the index.
 
Professional Designations
CFP
Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards Inc. owns the certification marks CFP®, CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ and federally registered CFP (with flame design) in the U.S., which it awards to individuals who successfully complete CFP Board's initial and ongoing certification requirements.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
