	AirEase introduced a single-stage, 5-ton air conditioner, the 4SCU14LE159 model, that is capable of 14- to 16-SEER performance. Every AirEase air conditioner is equipped with proprietary MHT™ technology, a heat transfer system that delivers maximum heat transfer and performance. The 14LE air conditioner also offers both high- and low-pressure switches to help protect the product against adverse system pressures. A single-stage scroll compressor and an upgraded contactor are designed to reduce nuisance failures, and a heavy-duty sound blanket helps provide quieter operation. AirEase air conditioning units are backed by a 10-year limited warranty on the compressor and a 10-year limited warranty on all covered parts in residential applications.
