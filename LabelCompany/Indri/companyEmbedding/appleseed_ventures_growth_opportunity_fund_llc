Community Growth Fund

Community Growth Fund
The Greenline Community Growth Fund (GCGF) is a Greenline-managed community development venture capital fund with a national footprint that targets small operating businesses with less than $5 million of capitalization.

Target Market
Primarily in conjunction with the underwriting and due diligence of its larger NMTC transactions, Greenline conducts in-depth reviews of community challenges and needs, including numerous meetings with local community leaders and nonprofit groups. Based on these reviews, Greenline identifies the types of businesses that can benefit the local community and then endeavors to fund:

Operating businesses offering employment or wealth creation for low-income persons or low-income communities.
Operating businesses delivering products or services that are beneficial to low-income communities and/or low-income people.

Technical Assistance
During community reviews Greenline identifies one or more local partners to help provide technical assistance to the GCGF target market businesses.
This technical assistance supports the seed and growth phases of the businesses, including: business planning; training in areas of need; provision of incubator office space, back-office support services and raising capital. Partners are typically a Small Business Development Center (SBDC) or a local community organization.

Fund Overview
GCGF is currently capitalized with $2 million of Greenline’s proprietary capital and is expected to grow over time. Investments typically range from $5,000 to $500,000 depending on the size/needs of the business. Approximately $500,000 of existing funds are targeted toward the smaller end of the range (less than $100,000) to ensure a significant number of “main street” businesses gain access to funding.

Terms
Investment terms vary depending on product type and are structured to deliver “patient capital” that best meets the needs of the business.

 The Green Century Funds
Approach
Green Century is a leader in environmentally and socially responsible investing. Through our three-pronged approach, we offer investors the opportunity to make an impact in a way no other mutual fund family can: through investing in sustainable companies; our leading shareholder advocacy program; and our unique ownership, where 100% of the profits earned managing the Green Century Funds can be used to support the environmental and public health work of our non-profit owners. 
Green Century believes that companies that seek to protect the environment by avoiding dangerous practices and policies may be more profitable in the long run since they may be likely to have less exposure to devalued or stranded carbon assets, they may avoid costly litigation, and may be better prepared for new regulatory restrictions. Green Century also believes that companies that pay attention to environmental, social and governance factors and take proactive actions around public health and environmental issues may enjoy a competitive advantage in appealing to consumers concerned about a company’s commitment to sustainability, and avoid damage to their brands.
Investment Strategy
All our Funds avoid these dangerous industries and corporations:
• Fossil fuel companies
• Fossil fuel fired utilities and companies with carbon reserves
• Producers of GMOs (genetically modified organisms)
• Civilian firearms and military weapons companies
• Nuclear power companies
• Companies that derive revenues from tobacco



And instead seek to invest in companies that:
• Have outstanding rankings on environmental factors, including performance on critical environmental impacts
• Apply extensive sustainability criteria throughout their supply chains
• Minimize risks to air, water and public health
• Act as socially responsible companies in the communities in which they operate
• Rank highly on governance factors
• Are environmental innovators such as energy efficiency and clean energy companies
• Are sustainable agriculture companies involved in natural and organic foods


The MSCI International Index Fund
The Green Century MSCI International Index Fund invests in the stocks of foreign companies in developed markets chosen for their outstanding environmental, social and governance factors.  This passively managed Fund invests in the stocks of companies included in the MSCI World ex USA SRI ex Fossil Fuels Index, customized to screen out fossil fuel companies.
Learn moreThe Equity Fund

Five Reasons to Consider Divesting from Fossil Fuels








October 16, 2013Share this page:Facebook89Twitter0LinkedIn5
Click to view PDF version
Since fall 2012, colleges, churches and cities have been leading robust discussions and moving to divest their holdings in the fossil fuel industry. Inspired by these actions, individual investors also have been moving their money out of coal, oil and gas companies.
Green Century has nearly a decade of experience with fossil fuel free investing and more than two decades of success with shareholder advocacy. This moment in history offers investors a unique opportunity to make a difference on climate change, while saving for their future.
Here are the top five reasons to consider divesting from fossil fuel companies:
1. Get Your Investments in Line with Your Values
Climate  change  is  a  serious  threat  to  our  society,  and  burning  fossil  fuels  is  a  main  cause  of worsening  floods,  droughts,  and  wildfires.  Many  investors  want  to  keep  their  investments  away from the industry that is principally responsible for causing a changing climate. Divesting allows you to align your beliefs with your investment decisions – an alignment that is being increasingly sought by young and old alike.
2. Reduce Corporate Influence on Energy Policy

Fossil fuel companies have tremendous influence over legislation and regulations, through lobbying in  state  capitols  and  Congress.  For  years,  this  power  has  helped  thwart  progress  on  the  policy solutions to climate change. The fossil fuel divestment campaign is inspired by the successful South African divestment campaign, and aims to exert similar pressure on the companies and institutions standing in the path of needed change.
3. Strengthen the Climate Movement
Climate change is so profound, and the solutions so wide-ranging, that it is often a challenge for people to find a way to make a powerful difference. The divestment strategy is successfully engaging the  public.  A  coordinated  and  organized  climate  change  network  –  that  includes  mayors,  church leaders and college students – is essential to passing needed energy policies.
4. May Reduce Exposure to Stranded Carbon Assets
The fossil fuel industry now controls reserves of coal, oil, and  gas  that  –  if  extracted  and  burned  –  will  release  five times more carbon dioxide than scientists agree is safe.* If governments restrict carbon emissions, companies owning those  fossil  fuel  reserves  may  not  be  able  to  extract  and sell them. The reserves may become stranded assets, and investors may then be left with devalued assets. Divesting now  could  allow  investors  to  reduce  their  exposure  to  a possible collapse of the so-called “carbon bubble.”
5. Reinvest in the Solutions
Once  divested  from  fossil  fuels,  investors  have  the opportunity to invest in forward-looking climate solutions, like companies specializing in energy efficiency, renewable energy, or other related climate mitigation strategies.

The Green Century Balanced Fund is already fully divested from fossil fuel companies and re-invested in green solutions.
The Green Century Equity Fund is divested from coal and major oil companies, and invests in the longest running socially responsible index.
Next Steps
Each investor must decide whether divesting from fossil fuels meets his or her objectives. But every day, more investors are deciding it is the right path forward.
