Eugene Levin


1921 - 2015
Obituary
Condolences

































 LEVIN, Eugene Eugene Levin, born April 2, 1921, passed away on January 17, 2015 after a long and fulfilling life. Eugene was born in St. Louis, Missouri and moved to Dallas at the age of 14. He attended Forest High Ave School where he met the love of his life, Margie Blasser. They married in 1941 and made their life-long home in Dallas, Texas. On December 14, 2014 they celebrated their 73rd anniversary. Eugene was an exceptional merchant and true pioneer in the retail landscape of Dallas, TX. In 1943, he founded Margie's Dress Shop, with his first store located in downtown Dallas. For the next forty years, he worked hard to build a successful company. In addition to Margie's, he eventually built and owned sixty stores throughout the southwest including Barnaby's, St. Denise, and Gene's Jeans. He was instrumental in so many people's lives and careers, and helped other entrepreneurs create their businesses. He supported the community in passionate and meaningful ways. He was a deeply devoted family man and loved anything and everything that involved his family. He was also an avid golfer and loved to travel, especially to California where Palm Springs became a second home. So many happy memories were made traveling with friends and family throughout the world. He was predeceased by his parents Lillian and Phil Levin, and his siblings Milton Levin, Elliot Levin and Thelma Saxe. Left to cherish his memory is his beloved wife Margie, his daughter Denise Gasc, and his son and daughter in law, Steven and Leslie Levin. Grampy was especially proud of his adoring grandchildren Perren Gasc and his wife Rachel, Todd Levin and Rachel Levin. He is also survived by his sister Adrienne Epstein, and his many nieces, nephews, and very close friends. He was a blessing to everyone who loved him. The graveside service will be on Tuesday, January 20th at 3pm at Hillcrest Memorial Park, 7405 W. Northwest Highway in Dallas, TX 75225 and Minyan will be at 6:30pm at the Bonaventure. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that if desired, remembrances may be made in Eugene's honor to the Gladney Center for Adoption, 6300 John Ryan Drive Fort Worth, TX 76132, or Temple Emanu-El, 8500 Hillcrest Rd Dallas, TX 75225.
