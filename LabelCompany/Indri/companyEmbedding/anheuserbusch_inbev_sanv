By Jennifer Maloney 

     Just as the soda giants are going after startups making healthy, non-alcoholic fizz, so too is Anheuser-Busch InBev NV. 

     After signing a deal last year with Starbucks Corp. to sell ready-to-drink tea, the world's largest brewer on Thursday said it is acquiring Hiball Inc., a San Francisco-based company making organic energy drinks and carbonated juices and water. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed. 

     João Castro Neves, chief executive of AB InBev's U.S. subsidiary Anheuser-Busch, said the company and its U.S. wholesaler network were looking for new opportunities in non-alcoholic beverages. 

     "We're looking for high growth, high margins," he said. Energy drinks and sparkling water fit the bill, he said. Hiball was a "natural place to go." 

     AB InBev in Latin America sells a range of energy drinks, soft drinks and teas. Its latest step toward a similar expansion in the U.S. is a modest one. Hiball, founded in 2005, has 20 employees. It had retail sales of about $40 million over the last 12 months, according to a person familiar with the matter. 

     Its products include Hiball Energy, a line of caffeinated drinks with ingredients such as guarana and ginseng, and Alta Palla, a line of sparkling juices with organic and fair-trade ingredients. 

     AB InBev has been broadening its U.S. portfolio as consumers shift away from American lagers, including its Budweiser and Bud Light brands, toward craft beers, Mexican imports, wine and spirits. Nonalcoholic drinks represent about 13% of AB InBev's global volume. In the U.S., the percentage is negligible, a spokeswoman said. 

     Meanwhile, as Americans drink less soda, Coca-Cola Co., PepsiCo Inc. and other beverage companies have been expanding into fast-growing categories such as sparkling water and health and wellness beverages. 

     Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. in November agreed to pay $1.7 billion for Bai Brands LLC, which makes low-calorie, coffee-fruit drinks. At the same time, PepsiCo bought KeVita Inc., a maker of fermented probiotic and kombucha beverages.

Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈɑnɦɔi̯zər ˈbuʃ ˈɪmbɛf]; abbreviated as AB InBev) is a multinational beverage and brewing company with global headquarters in Leuven, Belgium. Additional main offices are located in New York City, São Paulo, St. Louis, London, Mexico City, Johannesburg, Toronto, Buenos Aires and others.[4] The company was enlarged in October 2016 when AB InBev purchased SABMiller and concluded a merger of the two entities. It was the world's largest brewer even before the acquisition of SABMiller and is considered one of the largest fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies in the world. The estimated annual sales for the company in 2017 will be US$55 billion; prior to the merger, ABInBev had realized US$45.5 billion in revenue in 2016.[1] The company is expected to have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5] The company has recently announced a commitment to secure 100% of its purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025.[6][7]
The original AB InBev was formed through successive mergers of three international brewing groups completed in 2008: Interbrew from Belgium, AmBev from Brazil, and Anheuser-Busch from the United States. In October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev announced a successful all-cash bid to acquire multinational competitor SABMiller for £69 billion (US $107 billion). Shareholders for both companies approved the merger on 28 September 2016. The deal closed on 10 October 2016. The new entity has approximately 500 beer brands in 50 countries as of January 2017, up from the 200 that ABInBev had prior to the merger.[1][5][8]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets. The company subsequently sold the former SABMiller's interest in MillerCoors to Molson Coors, sold many of the former SABMiller's European brands to Asahi Breweries and sold much of its Coca-Cola bottling and distribution interests to the Coca-Cola Company.[9][10][11][12]
Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV is a publicly listed company, with its primary listing on the Euronext Brussels. It has secondary listings on Mexican Stock Exchange, Johannesburg Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[13]

History[edit]
AB InBev was formed following the acquisition of American brewer Anheuser-Busch by Belgian-Brazilian brewer InBev, which is a merger of AmBev and Interbrew.

Interbrew was formed in 1987 from a merger of the two largest breweries in Belgium: Artois and Piedboeuf. The Artois brewery, previously known as Den Hoorn, was established by 1366. In 1995, Interbrew expanded by acquiring Labatt Brewing Company (founded 1847), the largest brewer in Canada. In 2002 it acquired Beck's (founded 1873), the maker of the world's top selling German beer.
AmBev (short for Companhia de Bebidas das Américas, or "Beverages Company of the Americas") was created in 1999 with the merger of the two biggest Brazilian brewers, Antarctica (founded in 1880) and Brahma (founded in 1886).
Anheuser-Busch was established in 1852 in St. Louis, Missouri as Anheuser & Co

In 2004, Interbrew and AmBev merged, creating the world's largest brewer, InBev.[14] The deal was valued at $11.5 billion and combined the 3rd largest (Interbrew) and 5th largest (Ambev) brewers into the world's No.1 beermaker. The deal consolidated the top brands from Belgium, Canada, Germany and Brazil.[15]
Anheuser bought Harbin Brewery, the maker of Harbin beer in 2004 and Fujian Sedrin Brewery, the maker of Sedrin beer, in 2006, making AB InBev the No. 3 brewer in China, the world's largest beer market.[16] In 2007, subsidiary Labatt acquired Lakeport in Canada, and InBev increased its shareholding in QUINSA, strengthening the company’s foothold in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.[citation needed]
In 2008, the merger of InBev and Anheuser-Busch was completed, creating Anheuser–Busch InBev, expanding on InBev's previous status as the world's largest brewer, creating one of the top five consumer products companies in the world. Under the terms of the merger agreement, all shares of Anheuser-Busch were acquired for 70 USD per share in cash, for an aggregate of 52 billion USD.[17]
In 2013, Anheuser-Busch InBev joined leading alcohol producers as part of a producers' commitments to reducing harmful drinking.[citation needed]

Interbrew[edit]
Main article: Interbrew
After the merger in 1987, Interbrew acquired a number of local breweries in Belgium. By 1991, a second phase of targeted external growth began outside Belgium. The first transaction in this phase took place in Hungary, followed in 1995 by the acquisition of Labatt, in Canada, and then in 1999 by a joint venture with Sun in Russia.
In 2000, Interbrew acquired Bass and Whitbread in the UK, and in 2001 the company established itself in Germany, with the acquisition of Diebels. This was followed by the acquisition of Beck’s & Co., the Gilde Group and Spaten. Interbrew operated as a family-owned business until December 2000. At this point it organized an Initial Public Offering, becoming a publicly owned company trading on the Euronext stock exchange (Brussels, Belgium).
In 2002, Interbrew strengthened its position in China, by acquiring stakes in the K.K. Brewery and the Zhujiang Brewery.
AmBev[edit]
Main article: AmBev
AmBev is a Brazilian beverages company formed by a merger in 1999 between the Brahma and Antarctica breweries. It has a dominant position in South America and the Caribbean region.[18][19][20] The subsidiary is listed on BM&F Bovespa, the São Paulo stock exchange, and on the New York Stock Exchange.
Anheuser-Busch[edit]
Main article: Anheuser-Busch
Anheuser-Busch is the largest brewing company in the United States and employs over 30,000 people. It was the world's largest brewing company based on revenue, but third in brewing volume, before the acquisition by InBev announced 13 July 2008. The division operated 12 breweries in the United States and 17 others overseas.
Anheuser-Busch's best known beers included brands such as Budweiser, the Busch (originally known as Busch Bavarian Beer) and Michelob families, and Natural Light and Ice. The company also produced a number of smaller-volume and specialty beers, nonalcoholic brews, malt liquors (King Cobra and the Hurricane family), and flavored malt beverages (e.g., the Bacardi Silver family and Tequiza).
Anheuser-Busch was also one of the largest theme park operators in the United States with ten parks throughout the United States. In October 2009, AB InBev announced the sale of its Busch Entertainment theme park division to The Blackstone Group for $2.7 billion. The company had been investigating a sale of Busch Entertainment since the merger with AB InBev.[21][22]
InBev[edit]
Main article: InBev
InBev was the second largest brewery company in the world.[23] While its core business is beer, the company also had a strong presence in the soft drink market in Latin America. It employed about 86,000 people and was headquartered in Leuven, Belgium, where Anheuser–Busch InBev is based.
Before the merger with AmBev, Interbrew was the third largest brewing company in the world by volume, Anheuser-Busch was the largest, followed by SABMiller in second place. Heineken International was in fourth place and AmBev was the world's fifth largest brewer.
InBev employed close to 89,000 people, running operations in over 30 countries across the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. In 2007, InBev realized 14.4 billion euro of revenue.
Grupo Modelo[edit]
The company owns Grupo Modelo, Mexico's leading brewer and owner of the Corona brand as of 4 June 2013. This transaction was valued at 20.1 billion USD. To satisfy US anti-trust demands, Grupo Modelo sold its US business, including US brand rights and the Piedras Negras Brewery in Mexico, for approx. 4.75 billion USD to Constellation Brands, a competitor of AB Inbev in some beverage sectors.[24]
Additionally, the group has a 51% controlling stock on Cerveceria Nacional Dominicana through the AmBev division.
Oriental Brewery[edit]
On 1 April 2014, AB Inbev completed the re-acquisition of the Oriental Brewery (OB), which it had sold in July 2009. OB is the largest brewer in South Korea. Its CASS brand is the best-selling beer in South Korea. All beers produced by OB are brewed using rice.[25]
Bud Analytics Lab[edit]
In 2013, AB Inbev opened its Bud Analytics Lab in Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which develops data research and innovation to solve problems ranging from assortment optimization, social media, and market trends to large scale data initiatives.
Acquisition of SABMiller; formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV[edit]
Main article: SABMiller
On 13 October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev made a bid of £70 billion, (US $107 billion when the deal closed), or £44 per share, for its largest rival, SABMiller, which if approved would give the company a third of the global market share for beer sales and a half of the global profit.[26][27] The company had previously offered £38, £40, £42.15, £43.50 per share respectively, but each of these had been turned down.[28][29][30]
SABMiller accepted the bid in principle, but consummation of the deal required antitrust approval by regulatory agencies.[31] In 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had agreed to the deal only on the basis that SABMiller "spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S. — which include both Miller- and Coors-held brands — along with its Miller brands outside the U.S." The entire ownership situation was complicated: "In the United States, Coors is majority owned by MillerCoors (a subsidiary of SABMiller) and minority owned by Molson Coors, though internationally it’s entirely owned by Molson Coors, and Miller is owned by SABMiller."[32]
The merger (A-B InBev acquisition of SABMiller), closed on 10 October 2016. The new company is called Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (AB InBev), based in Leuven, Belgium and listed on Euronext (Euronext: ABI), with secondary listings on the Mexico (MEXBOL: ABI) and South Africa (JSE: ANH) stock exchanges and with American Depositary Receipts on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: BUD).[33]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets and divested itself of its interests in the MillerCoors beer company to Molson Coors.[10][11]
The new AB InBev entity is the world's largest beer company. Estimated annual sales are US$55 billion in and the company will have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5]
As per the agreement with the regulators, the former SABMiller sold to Molson Coors full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico for US$12 billion. Molson Coors also retained "the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd’s and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell." The agreement made Molson Coors the world's third largest brewer.[34]
In Canada, Molson Coors regained the right to make and market Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite from the former SABMiller.[35]
Immediately after the formation of Anheuser Busch Inbev SA/NV (AB InBev), the Company owned over 200 beer brands including Budweiser and Bud Light, Corona, Stella Artois, Beck's, Leffe, Hoegaarden, Skol, Brahma, Antarctica, Quilmes, Victoria, Modelo Especial, Michelob Ultra, Harbin, Sedrin, Klinskoye, Sibirskaya Korona, Chernigivske, Cass and Jupiler. Anheuser Busch Company also owns a soft drinks business that has bottling contracts with PepsiCo through its subsidiary, Ambev.[36] In December 2016, Coca-Cola Co. bought many of the former SABMiller's Coca Cola operations, including those in Africa.[12][37]
As part of the agreements made with regulators before Anheuser-Busch InBev was allowed to acquire SABMiller, the company sold the Peroni, Meantime and Grolsch brands to Asahi on 13 October 2016.[38][39]
After acquiring SABMiller, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV agreed on 21 December 2016 to sell the former SABMiller Ltd. business in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania to Asahi Breweries Group Holdings, Ltd. for US$7.8 billion. The deal includes popular brands such as Pilsner Urquell, Tyskie, Lech, Dreher and Ursus.[40][41]
Management team[edit]
After the formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV on 20 October 2016, the company was to be run by teams of "functional chiefs" and "zone presidents" who report to AB InBev Chief Executive Officer Carlos Brito. All but one of those 19 positions are held by people who were already ABInBev executives before the acquisition of SABMiller.[42][43]
Ownership[edit]
Anheuser-Busch InBev is controlled by Belgian families Vandamme, De Mévius and de Spoelbergh, who as of 2015 owned a combined 28.6% of the company, and billionaire Brazilian investor Jorge Paulo Lemann, Carlos Alberto Sicupira and Marcel Telles, who owned 23 percent through their private investment firm 3G Capital.[44][45]
Brands[edit]
Main article: AB InBev brands
AB InBev's brand portfolio included highly popular beer and soft-drink brands. The company classified its brands as Global Brands, International Brands, and Local Champions. The following are some of the more popular 200 brands for ABInBev prior to the merger with SABMiller on 10 October 2016.[46] The combined ABInBev/SAB Miller entity has approximately 400 beer brands as of January 2017.[5][47]

The company also owns distribution rights to Bacardi.[citation needed]
Controversies[edit]
In October 2015, the company was investigated by the Justice Department for buying beer distributors and preventing them from selling the beers of its competitors.[53]
In May 2017, the company was criticized for reportedly engaging in anti-competitive behavior after purchasing the entire supply of South African hops from SAB Hop Farms, as part of the SABMiller purchase, and making the hops unavailable to any other US craft brewers.[54] Similar anti-competitive claims were also made in association with the company's purchase of Roseville, Minnesota-based Northern Brewer, the biggest homebrew-supply chain in the country, through AB Inbev's venture arm ZX Ventures.[54]
The following month, the company was further criticized for having purchased a stake in the beer rating website RateBeer, leading to concerns that the purchase was a conflict of interest.[55]
In July 2017 the company terminates the lease with the Munich pizza place „Casa mia“, after the politician Ernst Dill vainly tried to persuade the owner to ban Pegida supporters amongst his guests. The year before Anheuser-Busch InBev already bound the owner of Casa mia by contract to interpose at any sign of political activities.[56] Though, regarding the terminated lease a company spokesperson said, that the termination of the lease was announced, timely and not politically motivated.[57]

Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈɑnɦɔi̯zər ˈbuʃ ˈɪmbɛf]; abbreviated as AB InBev) is a multinational beverage and brewing company with global headquarters in Leuven, Belgium. Additional main offices are located in New York City, São Paulo, St. Louis, London, Mexico City, Johannesburg, Toronto, Buenos Aires and others.[4] The company was enlarged in October 2016 when AB InBev purchased SABMiller and concluded a merger of the two entities. It was the world's largest brewer even before the acquisition of SABMiller and is considered one of the largest fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies in the world. The estimated annual sales for the company in 2017 will be US$55 billion; prior to the merger, ABInBev had realized US$45.5 billion in revenue in 2016.[1] The company is expected to have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5] The company has recently announced a commitment to secure 100% of its purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025.[6][7]
The original AB InBev was formed through successive mergers of three international brewing groups completed in 2008: Interbrew from Belgium, AmBev from Brazil, and Anheuser-Busch from the United States. In October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev announced a successful all-cash bid to acquire multinational competitor SABMiller for £69 billion (US $107 billion). Shareholders for both companies approved the merger on 28 September 2016. The deal closed on 10 October 2016. The new entity has approximately 500 beer brands in 50 countries as of January 2017, up from the 200 that ABInBev had prior to the merger.[1][5][8]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets. The company subsequently sold the former SABMiller's interest in MillerCoors to Molson Coors, sold many of the former SABMiller's European brands to Asahi Breweries and sold much of its Coca-Cola bottling and distribution interests to the Coca-Cola Company.[9][10][11][12]
Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV is a publicly listed company, with its primary listing on the Euronext Brussels. It has secondary listings on Mexican Stock Exchange, Johannesburg Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[13]

History[edit]
AB InBev was formed following the acquisition of American brewer Anheuser-Busch by Belgian-Brazilian brewer InBev, which is a merger of AmBev and Interbrew.

Interbrew was formed in 1987 from a merger of the two largest breweries in Belgium: Artois and Piedboeuf. The Artois brewery, previously known as Den Hoorn, was established by 1366. In 1995, Interbrew expanded by acquiring Labatt Brewing Company (founded 1847), the largest brewer in Canada. In 2002 it acquired Beck's (founded 1873), the maker of the world's top selling German beer.
AmBev (short for Companhia de Bebidas das Américas, or "Beverages Company of the Americas") was created in 1999 with the merger of the two biggest Brazilian brewers, Antarctica (founded in 1880) and Brahma (founded in 1886).
Anheuser-Busch was established in 1852 in St. Louis, Missouri as Anheuser & Co

In 2004, Interbrew and AmBev merged, creating the world's largest brewer, InBev.[14] The deal was valued at $11.5 billion and combined the 3rd largest (Interbrew) and 5th largest (Ambev) brewers into the world's No.1 beermaker. The deal consolidated the top brands from Belgium, Canada, Germany and Brazil.[15]
Anheuser bought Harbin Brewery, the maker of Harbin beer in 2004 and Fujian Sedrin Brewery, the maker of Sedrin beer, in 2006, making AB InBev the No. 3 brewer in China, the world's largest beer market.[16] In 2007, subsidiary Labatt acquired Lakeport in Canada, and InBev increased its shareholding in QUINSA, strengthening the company’s foothold in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.[citation needed]
In 2008, the merger of InBev and Anheuser-Busch was completed, creating Anheuser–Busch InBev, expanding on InBev's previous status as the world's largest brewer, creating one of the top five consumer products companies in the world. Under the terms of the merger agreement, all shares of Anheuser-Busch were acquired for 70 USD per share in cash, for an aggregate of 52 billion USD.[17]
In 2013, Anheuser-Busch InBev joined leading alcohol producers as part of a producers' commitments to reducing harmful drinking.[citation needed]

Interbrew[edit]
Main article: Interbrew
After the merger in 1987, Interbrew acquired a number of local breweries in Belgium. By 1991, a second phase of targeted external growth began outside Belgium. The first transaction in this phase took place in Hungary, followed in 1995 by the acquisition of Labatt, in Canada, and then in 1999 by a joint venture with Sun in Russia.
In 2000, Interbrew acquired Bass and Whitbread in the UK, and in 2001 the company established itself in Germany, with the acquisition of Diebels. This was followed by the acquisition of Beck’s & Co., the Gilde Group and Spaten. Interbrew operated as a family-owned business until December 2000. At this point it organized an Initial Public Offering, becoming a publicly owned company trading on the Euronext stock exchange (Brussels, Belgium).
In 2002, Interbrew strengthened its position in China, by acquiring stakes in the K.K. Brewery and the Zhujiang Brewery.
AmBev[edit]
Main article: AmBev
AmBev is a Brazilian beverages company formed by a merger in 1999 between the Brahma and Antarctica breweries. It has a dominant position in South America and the Caribbean region.[18][19][20] The subsidiary is listed on BM&F Bovespa, the São Paulo stock exchange, and on the New York Stock Exchange.
Anheuser-Busch[edit]
Main article: Anheuser-Busch
Anheuser-Busch is the largest brewing company in the United States and employs over 30,000 people. It was the world's largest brewing company based on revenue, but third in brewing volume, before the acquisition by InBev announced 13 July 2008. The division operated 12 breweries in the United States and 17 others overseas.
Anheuser-Busch's best known beers included brands such as Budweiser, the Busch (originally known as Busch Bavarian Beer) and Michelob families, and Natural Light and Ice. The company also produced a number of smaller-volume and specialty beers, nonalcoholic brews, malt liquors (King Cobra and the Hurricane family), and flavored malt beverages (e.g., the Bacardi Silver family and Tequiza).
Anheuser-Busch was also one of the largest theme park operators in the United States with ten parks throughout the United States. In October 2009, AB InBev announced the sale of its Busch Entertainment theme park division to The Blackstone Group for $2.7 billion. The company had been investigating a sale of Busch Entertainment since the merger with AB InBev.[21][22]
InBev[edit]
Main article: InBev
InBev was the second largest brewery company in the world.[23] While its core business is beer, the company also had a strong presence in the soft drink market in Latin America. It employed about 86,000 people and was headquartered in Leuven, Belgium, where Anheuser–Busch InBev is based.
Before the merger with AmBev, Interbrew was the third largest brewing company in the world by volume, Anheuser-Busch was the largest, followed by SABMiller in second place. Heineken International was in fourth place and AmBev was the world's fifth largest brewer.
InBev employed close to 89,000 people, running operations in over 30 countries across the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. In 2007, InBev realized 14.4 billion euro of revenue.
Grupo Modelo[edit]
The company owns Grupo Modelo, Mexico's leading brewer and owner of the Corona brand as of 4 June 2013. This transaction was valued at 20.1 billion USD. To satisfy US anti-trust demands, Grupo Modelo sold its US business, including US brand rights and the Piedras Negras Brewery in Mexico, for approx. 4.75 billion USD to Constellation Brands, a competitor of AB Inbev in some beverage sectors.[24]
Additionally, the group has a 51% controlling stock on Cerveceria Nacional Dominicana through the AmBev division.
Oriental Brewery[edit]
On 1 April 2014, AB Inbev completed the re-acquisition of the Oriental Brewery (OB), which it had sold in July 2009. OB is the largest brewer in South Korea. Its CASS brand is the best-selling beer in South Korea. All beers produced by OB are brewed using rice.[25]
Bud Analytics Lab[edit]
In 2013, AB Inbev opened its Bud Analytics Lab in Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which develops data research and innovation to solve problems ranging from assortment optimization, social media, and market trends to large scale data initiatives.
Acquisition of SABMiller; formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV[edit]
Main article: SABMiller
On 13 October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev made a bid of £70 billion, (US $107 billion when the deal closed), or £44 per share, for its largest rival, SABMiller, which if approved would give the company a third of the global market share for beer sales and a half of the global profit.[26][27] The company had previously offered £38, £40, £42.15, £43.50 per share respectively, but each of these had been turned down.[28][29][30]
SABMiller accepted the bid in principle, but consummation of the deal required antitrust approval by regulatory agencies.[31] In 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had agreed to the deal only on the basis that SABMiller "spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S. — which include both Miller- and Coors-held brands — along with its Miller brands outside the U.S." The entire ownership situation was complicated: "In the United States, Coors is majority owned by MillerCoors (a subsidiary of SABMiller) and minority owned by Molson Coors, though internationally it’s entirely owned by Molson Coors, and Miller is owned by SABMiller."[32]
The merger (A-B InBev acquisition of SABMiller), closed on 10 October 2016. The new company is called Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (AB InBev), based in Leuven, Belgium and listed on Euronext (Euronext: ABI), with secondary listings on the Mexico (MEXBOL: ABI) and South Africa (JSE: ANH) stock exchanges and with American Depositary Receipts on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: BUD).[33]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets and divested itself of its interests in the MillerCoors beer company to Molson Coors.[10][11]
The new AB InBev entity is the world's largest beer company. Estimated annual sales are US$55 billion in and the company will have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5]
As per the agreement with the regulators, the former SABMiller sold to Molson Coors full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico for US$12 billion. Molson Coors also retained "the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd’s and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell." The agreement made Molson Coors the world's third largest brewer.[34]
In Canada, Molson Coors regained the right to make and market Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite from the former SABMiller.[35]
Immediately after the formation of Anheuser Busch Inbev SA/NV (AB InBev), the Company owned over 200 beer brands including Budweiser and Bud Light, Corona, Stella Artois, Beck's, Leffe, Hoegaarden, Skol, Brahma, Antarctica, Quilmes, Victoria, Modelo Especial, Michelob Ultra, Harbin, Sedrin, Klinskoye, Sibirskaya Korona, Chernigivske, Cass and Jupiler. Anheuser Busch Company also owns a soft drinks business that has bottling contracts with PepsiCo through its subsidiary, Ambev.[36] In December 2016, Coca-Cola Co. bought many of the former SABMiller's Coca Cola operations, including those in Africa.[12][37]
As part of the agreements made with regulators before Anheuser-Busch InBev was allowed to acquire SABMiller, the company sold the Peroni, Meantime and Grolsch brands to Asahi on 13 October 2016.[38][39]
After acquiring SABMiller, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV agreed on 21 December 2016 to sell the former SABMiller Ltd. business in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania to Asahi Breweries Group Holdings, Ltd. for US$7.8 billion. The deal includes popular brands such as Pilsner Urquell, Tyskie, Lech, Dreher and Ursus.[40][41]
Management team[edit]
After the formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV on 20 October 2016, the company was to be run by teams of "functional chiefs" and "zone presidents" who report to AB InBev Chief Executive Officer Carlos Brito. All but one of those 19 positions are held by people who were already ABInBev executives before the acquisition of SABMiller.[42][43]
Ownership[edit]
Anheuser-Busch InBev is controlled by Belgian families Vandamme, De Mévius and de Spoelbergh, who as of 2015 owned a combined 28.6% of the company, and billionaire Brazilian investor Jorge Paulo Lemann, Carlos Alberto Sicupira and Marcel Telles, who owned 23 percent through their private investment firm 3G Capital.[44][45]
Brands[edit]
Main article: AB InBev brands
AB InBev's brand portfolio included highly popular beer and soft-drink brands. The company classified its brands as Global Brands, International Brands, and Local Champions. The following are some of the more popular 200 brands for ABInBev prior to the merger with SABMiller on 10 October 2016.[46] The combined ABInBev/SAB Miller entity has approximately 400 beer brands as of January 2017.[5][47]

The company also owns distribution rights to Bacardi.[citation needed]
Controversies[edit]
In October 2015, the company was investigated by the Justice Department for buying beer distributors and preventing them from selling the beers of its competitors.[53]
In May 2017, the company was criticized for reportedly engaging in anti-competitive behavior after purchasing the entire supply of South African hops from SAB Hop Farms, as part of the SABMiller purchase, and making the hops unavailable to any other US craft brewers.[54] Similar anti-competitive claims were also made in association with the company's purchase of Roseville, Minnesota-based Northern Brewer, the biggest homebrew-supply chain in the country, through AB Inbev's venture arm ZX Ventures.[54]
The following month, the company was further criticized for having purchased a stake in the beer rating website RateBeer, leading to concerns that the purchase was a conflict of interest.[55]
In July 2017 the company terminates the lease with the Munich pizza place „Casa mia“, after the politician Ernst Dill vainly tried to persuade the owner to ban Pegida supporters amongst his guests. The year before Anheuser-Busch InBev already bound the owner of Casa mia by contract to interpose at any sign of political activities.[56] Though, regarding the terminated lease a company spokesperson said, that the termination of the lease was announced, timely and not politically motivated.[57]

Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈɑnɦɔi̯zər ˈbuʃ ˈɪmbɛf]; abbreviated as AB InBev) is a multinational beverage and brewing company with global headquarters in Leuven, Belgium. Additional main offices are located in New York City, São Paulo, St. Louis, London, Mexico City, Johannesburg, Toronto, Buenos Aires and others.[4] The company was enlarged in October 2016 when AB InBev purchased SABMiller and concluded a merger of the two entities. It was the world's largest brewer even before the acquisition of SABMiller and is considered one of the largest fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies in the world. The estimated annual sales for the company in 2017 will be US$55 billion; prior to the merger, ABInBev had realized US$45.5 billion in revenue in 2016.[1] The company is expected to have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5] The company has recently announced a commitment to secure 100% of its purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025.[6][7]
The original AB InBev was formed through successive mergers of three international brewing groups completed in 2008: Interbrew from Belgium, AmBev from Brazil, and Anheuser-Busch from the United States. In October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev announced a successful all-cash bid to acquire multinational competitor SABMiller for £69 billion (US $107 billion). Shareholders for both companies approved the merger on 28 September 2016. The deal closed on 10 October 2016. The new entity has approximately 500 beer brands in 50 countries as of January 2017, up from the 200 that ABInBev had prior to the merger.[1][5][8]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets. The company subsequently sold the former SABMiller's interest in MillerCoors to Molson Coors, sold many of the former SABMiller's European brands to Asahi Breweries and sold much of its Coca-Cola bottling and distribution interests to the Coca-Cola Company.[9][10][11][12]
Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV is a publicly listed company, with its primary listing on the Euronext Brussels. It has secondary listings on Mexican Stock Exchange, Johannesburg Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[13]

History[edit]
AB InBev was formed following the acquisition of American brewer Anheuser-Busch by Belgian-Brazilian brewer InBev, which is a merger of AmBev and Interbrew.

Interbrew was formed in 1987 from a merger of the two largest breweries in Belgium: Artois and Piedboeuf. The Artois brewery, previously known as Den Hoorn, was established by 1366. In 1995, Interbrew expanded by acquiring Labatt Brewing Company (founded 1847), the largest brewer in Canada. In 2002 it acquired Beck's (founded 1873), the maker of the world's top selling German beer.
AmBev (short for Companhia de Bebidas das Américas, or "Beverages Company of the Americas") was created in 1999 with the merger of the two biggest Brazilian brewers, Antarctica (founded in 1880) and Brahma (founded in 1886).
Anheuser-Busch was established in 1852 in St. Louis, Missouri as Anheuser & Co

In 2004, Interbrew and AmBev merged, creating the world's largest brewer, InBev.[14] The deal was valued at $11.5 billion and combined the 3rd largest (Interbrew) and 5th largest (Ambev) brewers into the world's No.1 beermaker. The deal consolidated the top brands from Belgium, Canada, Germany and Brazil.[15]
Anheuser bought Harbin Brewery, the maker of Harbin beer in 2004 and Fujian Sedrin Brewery, the maker of Sedrin beer, in 2006, making AB InBev the No. 3 brewer in China, the world's largest beer market.[16] In 2007, subsidiary Labatt acquired Lakeport in Canada, and InBev increased its shareholding in QUINSA, strengthening the company’s foothold in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.[citation needed]
In 2008, the merger of InBev and Anheuser-Busch was completed, creating Anheuser–Busch InBev, expanding on InBev's previous status as the world's largest brewer, creating one of the top five consumer products companies in the world. Under the terms of the merger agreement, all shares of Anheuser-Busch were acquired for 70 USD per share in cash, for an aggregate of 52 billion USD.[17]
In 2013, Anheuser-Busch InBev joined leading alcohol producers as part of a producers' commitments to reducing harmful drinking.[citation needed]

Interbrew[edit]
Main article: Interbrew
After the merger in 1987, Interbrew acquired a number of local breweries in Belgium. By 1991, a second phase of targeted external growth began outside Belgium. The first transaction in this phase took place in Hungary, followed in 1995 by the acquisition of Labatt, in Canada, and then in 1999 by a joint venture with Sun in Russia.
In 2000, Interbrew acquired Bass and Whitbread in the UK, and in 2001 the company established itself in Germany, with the acquisition of Diebels. This was followed by the acquisition of Beck’s & Co., the Gilde Group and Spaten. Interbrew operated as a family-owned business until December 2000. At this point it organized an Initial Public Offering, becoming a publicly owned company trading on the Euronext stock exchange (Brussels, Belgium).
In 2002, Interbrew strengthened its position in China, by acquiring stakes in the K.K. Brewery and the Zhujiang Brewery.
AmBev[edit]
Main article: AmBev
AmBev is a Brazilian beverages company formed by a merger in 1999 between the Brahma and Antarctica breweries. It has a dominant position in South America and the Caribbean region.[18][19][20] The subsidiary is listed on BM&F Bovespa, the São Paulo stock exchange, and on the New York Stock Exchange.
Anheuser-Busch[edit]
Main article: Anheuser-Busch
Anheuser-Busch is the largest brewing company in the United States and employs over 30,000 people. It was the world's largest brewing company based on revenue, but third in brewing volume, before the acquisition by InBev announced 13 July 2008. The division operated 12 breweries in the United States and 17 others overseas.
Anheuser-Busch's best known beers included brands such as Budweiser, the Busch (originally known as Busch Bavarian Beer) and Michelob families, and Natural Light and Ice. The company also produced a number of smaller-volume and specialty beers, nonalcoholic brews, malt liquors (King Cobra and the Hurricane family), and flavored malt beverages (e.g., the Bacardi Silver family and Tequiza).
Anheuser-Busch was also one of the largest theme park operators in the United States with ten parks throughout the United States. In October 2009, AB InBev announced the sale of its Busch Entertainment theme park division to The Blackstone Group for $2.7 billion. The company had been investigating a sale of Busch Entertainment since the merger with AB InBev.[21][22]
InBev[edit]
Main article: InBev
InBev was the second largest brewery company in the world.[23] While its core business is beer, the company also had a strong presence in the soft drink market in Latin America. It employed about 86,000 people and was headquartered in Leuven, Belgium, where Anheuser–Busch InBev is based.
Before the merger with AmBev, Interbrew was the third largest brewing company in the world by volume, Anheuser-Busch was the largest, followed by SABMiller in second place. Heineken International was in fourth place and AmBev was the world's fifth largest brewer.
InBev employed close to 89,000 people, running operations in over 30 countries across the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. In 2007, InBev realized 14.4 billion euro of revenue.
Grupo Modelo[edit]
The company owns Grupo Modelo, Mexico's leading brewer and owner of the Corona brand as of 4 June 2013. This transaction was valued at 20.1 billion USD. To satisfy US anti-trust demands, Grupo Modelo sold its US business, including US brand rights and the Piedras Negras Brewery in Mexico, for approx. 4.75 billion USD to Constellation Brands, a competitor of AB Inbev in some beverage sectors.[24]
Additionally, the group has a 51% controlling stock on Cerveceria Nacional Dominicana through the AmBev division.
Oriental Brewery[edit]
On 1 April 2014, AB Inbev completed the re-acquisition of the Oriental Brewery (OB), which it had sold in July 2009. OB is the largest brewer in South Korea. Its CASS brand is the best-selling beer in South Korea. All beers produced by OB are brewed using rice.[25]
Bud Analytics Lab[edit]
In 2013, AB Inbev opened its Bud Analytics Lab in Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which develops data research and innovation to solve problems ranging from assortment optimization, social media, and market trends to large scale data initiatives.
Acquisition of SABMiller; formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV[edit]
Main article: SABMiller
On 13 October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev made a bid of £70 billion, (US $107 billion when the deal closed), or £44 per share, for its largest rival, SABMiller, which if approved would give the company a third of the global market share for beer sales and a half of the global profit.[26][27] The company had previously offered £38, £40, £42.15, £43.50 per share respectively, but each of these had been turned down.[28][29][30]
SABMiller accepted the bid in principle, but consummation of the deal required antitrust approval by regulatory agencies.[31] In 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had agreed to the deal only on the basis that SABMiller "spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S. — which include both Miller- and Coors-held brands — along with its Miller brands outside the U.S." The entire ownership situation was complicated: "In the United States, Coors is majority owned by MillerCoors (a subsidiary of SABMiller) and minority owned by Molson Coors, though internationally it’s entirely owned by Molson Coors, and Miller is owned by SABMiller."[32]
The merger (A-B InBev acquisition of SABMiller), closed on 10 October 2016. The new company is called Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (AB InBev), based in Leuven, Belgium and listed on Euronext (Euronext: ABI), with secondary listings on the Mexico (MEXBOL: ABI) and South Africa (JSE: ANH) stock exchanges and with American Depositary Receipts on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: BUD).[33]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets and divested itself of its interests in the MillerCoors beer company to Molson Coors.[10][11]
The new AB InBev entity is the world's largest beer company. Estimated annual sales are US$55 billion in and the company will have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5]
As per the agreement with the regulators, the former SABMiller sold to Molson Coors full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico for US$12 billion. Molson Coors also retained "the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd’s and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell." The agreement made Molson Coors the world's third largest brewer.[34]
In Canada, Molson Coors regained the right to make and market Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite from the former SABMiller.[35]
Immediately after the formation of Anheuser Busch Inbev SA/NV (AB InBev), the Company owned over 200 beer brands including Budweiser and Bud Light, Corona, Stella Artois, Beck's, Leffe, Hoegaarden, Skol, Brahma, Antarctica, Quilmes, Victoria, Modelo Especial, Michelob Ultra, Harbin, Sedrin, Klinskoye, Sibirskaya Korona, Chernigivske, Cass and Jupiler. Anheuser Busch Company also owns a soft drinks business that has bottling contracts with PepsiCo through its subsidiary, Ambev.[36] In December 2016, Coca-Cola Co. bought many of the former SABMiller's Coca Cola operations, including those in Africa.[12][37]
As part of the agreements made with regulators before Anheuser-Busch InBev was allowed to acquire SABMiller, the company sold the Peroni, Meantime and Grolsch brands to Asahi on 13 October 2016.[38][39]
After acquiring SABMiller, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV agreed on 21 December 2016 to sell the former SABMiller Ltd. business in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania to Asahi Breweries Group Holdings, Ltd. for US$7.8 billion. The deal includes popular brands such as Pilsner Urquell, Tyskie, Lech, Dreher and Ursus.[40][41]
Management team[edit]
After the formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV on 20 October 2016, the company was to be run by teams of "functional chiefs" and "zone presidents" who report to AB InBev Chief Executive Officer Carlos Brito. All but one of those 19 positions are held by people who were already ABInBev executives before the acquisition of SABMiller.[42][43]
Ownership[edit]
Anheuser-Busch InBev is controlled by Belgian families Vandamme, De Mévius and de Spoelbergh, who as of 2015 owned a combined 28.6% of the company, and billionaire Brazilian investor Jorge Paulo Lemann, Carlos Alberto Sicupira and Marcel Telles, who owned 23 percent through their private investment firm 3G Capital.[44][45]

Controversies[edit]
In October 2015, the company was investigated by the Justice Department for buying beer distributors and preventing them from selling the beers of its competitors.[53]
In May 2017, the company was criticized for reportedly engaging in anti-competitive behavior after purchasing the entire supply of South African hops from SAB Hop Farms, as part of the SABMiller purchase, and making the hops unavailable to any other US craft brewers.[54] Similar anti-competitive claims were also made in association with the company's purchase of Roseville, Minnesota-based Northern Brewer, the biggest homebrew-supply chain in the country, through AB Inbev's venture arm ZX Ventures.[54]
The following month, the company was further criticized for having purchased a stake in the beer rating website RateBeer, leading to concerns that the purchase was a conflict of interest.[55]
In July 2017 the company terminates the lease with the Munich pizza place „Casa mia“, after the politician Ernst Dill vainly tried to persuade the owner to ban Pegida supporters amongst his guests. The year before Anheuser-Busch InBev already bound the owner of Casa mia by contract to interpose at any sign of political activities.[56] Though, regarding the terminated lease a company spokesperson said, that the termination of the lease was announced, timely and not politically motivated.[57]

Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈɑnɦɔi̯zər ˈbuʃ ˈɪmbɛf]; abbreviated as AB InBev) is a multinational beverage and brewing company with global headquarters in Leuven, Belgium. Additional main offices are located in New York City, São Paulo, St. Louis, London, Mexico City, Johannesburg, Toronto, Buenos Aires and others.[4] The company was enlarged in October 2016 when AB InBev purchased SABMiller and concluded a merger of the two entities. It was the world's largest brewer even before the acquisition of SABMiller and is considered one of the largest fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies in the world. The estimated annual sales for the company in 2017 will be US$55 billion; prior to the merger, ABInBev had realized US$45.5 billion in revenue in 2016.[1] The company is expected to have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5] The company has recently announced a commitment to secure 100% of its purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025.[6][7]
The original AB InBev was formed through successive mergers of three international brewing groups completed in 2008: Interbrew from Belgium, AmBev from Brazil, and Anheuser-Busch from the United States. In October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev announced a successful all-cash bid to acquire multinational competitor SABMiller for £69 billion (US $107 billion). Shareholders for both companies approved the merger on 28 September 2016. The deal closed on 10 October 2016. The new entity has approximately 500 beer brands in 50 countries as of January 2017, up from the 200 that ABInBev had prior to the merger.[1][5][8]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets. The company subsequently sold the former SABMiller's interest in MillerCoors to Molson Coors, sold many of the former SABMiller's European brands to Asahi Breweries and sold much of its Coca-Cola bottling and distribution interests to the Coca-Cola Company.[9][10][11][12]
Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV is a publicly listed company, with its primary listing on the Euronext Brussels. It has secondary listings on Mexican Stock Exchange, Johannesburg Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[13]

History[edit]
AB InBev was formed following the acquisition of American brewer Anheuser-Busch by Belgian-Brazilian brewer InBev, which is a merger of AmBev and Interbrew.

Interbrew was formed in 1987 from a merger of the two largest breweries in Belgium: Artois and Piedboeuf. The Artois brewery, previously known as Den Hoorn, was established by 1366. In 1995, Interbrew expanded by acquiring Labatt Brewing Company (founded 1847), the largest brewer in Canada. In 2002 it acquired Beck's (founded 1873), the maker of the world's top selling German beer.
AmBev (short for Companhia de Bebidas das Américas, or "Beverages Company of the Americas") was created in 1999 with the merger of the two biggest Brazilian brewers, Antarctica (founded in 1880) and Brahma (founded in 1886).
Anheuser-Busch was established in 1852 in St. Louis, Missouri as Anheuser & Co

In 2004, Interbrew and AmBev merged, creating the world's largest brewer, InBev.[14] The deal was valued at $11.5 billion and combined the 3rd largest (Interbrew) and 5th largest (Ambev) brewers into the world's No.1 beermaker. The deal consolidated the top brands from Belgium, Canada, Germany and Brazil.[15]
Anheuser bought Harbin Brewery, the maker of Harbin beer in 2004 and Fujian Sedrin Brewery, the maker of Sedrin beer, in 2006, making AB InBev the No. 3 brewer in China, the world's largest beer market.[16] In 2007, subsidiary Labatt acquired Lakeport in Canada, and InBev increased its shareholding in QUINSA, strengthening the company’s foothold in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.[citation needed]
In 2008, the merger of InBev and Anheuser-Busch was completed, creating Anheuser–Busch InBev, expanding on InBev's previous status as the world's largest brewer, creating one of the top five consumer products companies in the world. Under the terms of the merger agreement, all shares of Anheuser-Busch were acquired for 70 USD per share in cash, for an aggregate of 52 billion USD.[17]
In 2013, Anheuser-Busch InBev joined leading alcohol producers as part of a producers' commitments to reducing harmful drinking.[citation needed]

Interbrew[edit]
Main article: Interbrew
After the merger in 1987, Interbrew acquired a number of local breweries in Belgium. By 1991, a second phase of targeted external growth began outside Belgium. The first transaction in this phase took place in Hungary, followed in 1995 by the acquisition of Labatt, in Canada, and then in 1999 by a joint venture with Sun in Russia.
In 2000, Interbrew acquired Bass and Whitbread in the UK, and in 2001 the company established itself in Germany, with the acquisition of Diebels. This was followed by the acquisition of Beck’s & Co., the Gilde Group and Spaten. Interbrew operated as a family-owned business until December 2000. At this point it organized an Initial Public Offering, becoming a publicly owned company trading on the Euronext stock exchange (Brussels, Belgium).
In 2002, Interbrew strengthened its position in China, by acquiring stakes in the K.K. Brewery and the Zhujiang Brewery.
AmBev[edit]
Main article: AmBev
AmBev is a Brazilian beverages company formed by a merger in 1999 between the Brahma and Antarctica breweries. It has a dominant position in South America and the Caribbean region.[18][19][20] The subsidiary is listed on BM&F Bovespa, the São Paulo stock exchange, and on the New York Stock Exchange.
Anheuser-Busch[edit]
Main article: Anheuser-Busch
Anheuser-Busch is the largest brewing company in the United States and employs over 30,000 people. It was the world's largest brewing company based on revenue, but third in brewing volume, before the acquisition by InBev announced 13 July 2008. The division operated 12 breweries in the United States and 17 others overseas.
Anheuser-Busch's best known beers included brands such as Budweiser, the Busch (originally known as Busch Bavarian Beer) and Michelob families, and Natural Light and Ice. The company also produced a number of smaller-volume and specialty beers, nonalcoholic brews, malt liquors (King Cobra and the Hurricane family), and flavored malt beverages (e.g., the Bacardi Silver family and Tequiza).
Anheuser-Busch was also one of the largest theme park operators in the United States with ten parks throughout the United States. In October 2009, AB InBev announced the sale of its Busch Entertainment theme park division to The Blackstone Group for $2.7 billion. The company had been investigating a sale of Busch Entertainment since the merger with AB InBev.[21][22]
InBev[edit]
Main article: InBev
InBev was the second largest brewery company in the world.[23] While its core business is beer, the company also had a strong presence in the soft drink market in Latin America. It employed about 86,000 people and was headquartered in Leuven, Belgium, where Anheuser–Busch InBev is based.
Before the merger with AmBev, Interbrew was the third largest brewing company in the world by volume, Anheuser-Busch was the largest, followed by SABMiller in second place. Heineken International was in fourth place and AmBev was the world's fifth largest brewer.
InBev employed close to 89,000 people, running operations in over 30 countries across the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. In 2007, InBev realized 14.4 billion euro of revenue.
Grupo Modelo[edit]
The company owns Grupo Modelo, Mexico's leading brewer and owner of the Corona brand as of 4 June 2013. This transaction was valued at 20.1 billion USD. To satisfy US anti-trust demands, Grupo Modelo sold its US business, including US brand rights and the Piedras Negras Brewery in Mexico, for approx. 4.75 billion USD to Constellation Brands, a competitor of AB Inbev in some beverage sectors.[24]
Additionally, the group has a 51% controlling stock on Cerveceria Nacional Dominicana through the AmBev division.
Oriental Brewery[edit]
On 1 April 2014, AB Inbev completed the re-acquisition of the Oriental Brewery (OB), which it had sold in July 2009. OB is the largest brewer in South Korea. Its CASS brand is the best-selling beer in South Korea. All beers produced by OB are brewed using rice.[25]
Bud Analytics Lab[edit]
In 2013, AB Inbev opened its Bud Analytics Lab in Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which develops data research and innovation to solve problems ranging from assortment optimization, social media, and market trends to large scale data initiatives.

On 13 October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev made a bid of £70 billion, (US $107 billion when the deal closed), or £44 per share, for its largest rival, SABMiller, which if approved would give the company a third of the global market share for beer sales and a half of the global profit.[26][27] The company had previously offered £38, £40, £42.15, £43.50 per share respectively, but each of these had been turned down.[28][29][30]
SABMiller accepted the bid in principle, but consummation of the deal required antitrust approval by regulatory agencies.[31] In 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had agreed to the deal only on the basis that SABMiller "spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S. — which include both Miller- and Coors-held brands — along with its Miller brands outside the U.S." The entire ownership situation was complicated: "In the United States, Coors is majority owned by MillerCoors (a subsidiary of SABMiller) and minority owned by Molson Coors, though internationally it’s entirely owned by Molson Coors, and Miller is owned by SABMiller."[32]
The merger (A-B InBev acquisition of SABMiller), closed on 10 October 2016. The new company is called Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (AB InBev), based in Leuven, Belgium and listed on Euronext (Euronext: ABI), with secondary listings on the Mexico (MEXBOL: ABI) and South Africa (JSE: ANH) stock exchanges and with American Depositary Receipts on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: BUD).[33]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets and divested itself of its interests in the MillerCoors beer company to Molson Coors.[10][11]
The new AB InBev entity is the world's largest beer company. Estimated annual sales are US$55 billion in and the company will have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5]
As per the agreement with the regulators, the former SABMiller sold to Molson Coors full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico for US$12 billion. Molson Coors also retained "the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd’s and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell." The agreement made Molson Coors the world's third largest brewer.[34]
In Canada, Molson Coors regained the right to make and market Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite from the former SABMiller.[35]
Immediately after the formation of Anheuser Busch Inbev SA/NV (AB InBev), the Company owned over 200 beer brands including Budweiser and Bud Light, Corona, Stella Artois, Beck's, Leffe, Hoegaarden, Skol, Brahma, Antarctica, Quilmes, Victoria, Modelo Especial, Michelob Ultra, Harbin, Sedrin, Klinskoye, Sibirskaya Korona, Chernigivske, Cass and Jupiler. Anheuser Busch Company also owns a soft drinks business that has bottling contracts with PepsiCo through its subsidiary, Ambev.[36] In December 2016, Coca-Cola Co. bought many of the former SABMiller's Coca Cola operations, including those in Africa.[12][37]
As part of the agreements made with regulators before Anheuser-Busch InBev was allowed to acquire SABMiller, the company sold the Peroni, Meantime and Grolsch brands to Asahi on 13 October 2016.[38][39]
After acquiring SABMiller, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV agreed on 21 December 2016 to sell the former SABMiller Ltd. business in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania to Asahi Breweries Group Holdings, Ltd. for US$7.8 billion. The deal includes popular brands such as Pilsner Urquell, Tyskie, Lech, Dreher and Ursus.[40][41]
Management team[edit]
After the formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV on 20 October 2016, the company was to be run by teams of "functional chiefs" and "zone presidents" who report to AB InBev Chief Executive Officer Carlos Brito. All but one of those 19 positions are held by people who were already ABInBev executives before the acquisition of SABMiller.[42][43]
Ownership[edit]
Anheuser-Busch InBev is controlled by Belgian families Vandamme, De Mévius and de Spoelbergh, who as of 2015 owned a combined 28.6% of the company, and billionaire Brazilian investor Jorge Paulo Lemann, Carlos Alberto Sicupira and Marcel Telles, who owned 23 percent through their private investment firm 3G Capital.[44][45]
Brands[edit]

Controversies[edit]
In October 2015, the company was investigated by the Justice Department for buying beer distributors and preventing them from selling the beers of its competitors.[53]
In May 2017, the company was criticized for reportedly engaging in anti-competitive behavior after purchasing the entire supply of South African hops from SAB Hop Farms, as part of the SABMiller purchase, and making the hops unavailable to any other US craft brewers.[54] Similar anti-competitive claims were also made in association with the company's purchase of Roseville, Minnesota-based Northern Brewer, the biggest homebrew-supply chain in the country, through AB Inbev's venture arm ZX Ventures.[54]
The following month, the company was further criticized for having purchased a stake in the beer rating website RateBeer, leading to concerns that the purchase was a conflict of interest.[55]
In July 2017 the company terminates the lease with the Munich pizza place „Casa mia“, after the politician Ernst Dill vainly tried to persuade the owner to ban Pegida supporters amongst his guests. The year before Anheuser-Busch InBev already bound the owner of Casa mia by contract to interpose at any sign of political activities.[56] Though, regarding the terminated lease a company spokesperson said, that the termination of the lease was announced, timely and not politically motivated.[57]

Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈɑnɦɔi̯zər ˈbuʃ ˈɪmbɛf]; abbreviated as AB InBev) is a multinational beverage and brewing company with global headquarters in Leuven, Belgium. Additional main offices are located in New York City, São Paulo, St. Louis, London, Mexico City, Johannesburg, Toronto, Buenos Aires and others.[4] The company was enlarged in October 2016 when AB InBev purchased SABMiller and concluded a merger of the two entities. It was the world's largest brewer even before the acquisition of SABMiller and is considered one of the largest fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies in the world. The estimated annual sales for the company in 2017 will be US$55 billion; prior to the merger, ABInBev had realized US$45.5 billion in revenue in 2016.[1] The company is expected to have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5] The company has recently announced a commitment to secure 100% of its purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025.[6][7]
The original AB InBev was formed through successive mergers of three international brewing groups completed in 2008: Interbrew from Belgium, AmBev from Brazil, and Anheuser-Busch from the United States. In October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev announced a successful all-cash bid to acquire multinational competitor SABMiller for £69 billion (US $107 billion). Shareholders for both companies approved the merger on 28 September 2016. The deal closed on 10 October 2016. The new entity has approximately 500 beer brands in 50 countries as of January 2017, up from the 200 that ABInBev had prior to the merger.[1][5][8]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets. The company subsequently sold the former SABMiller's interest in MillerCoors to Molson Coors, sold many of the former SABMiller's European brands to Asahi Breweries and sold much of its Coca-Cola bottling and distribution interests to the Coca-Cola Company.[9][10][11][12]
Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV is a publicly listed company, with its primary listing on the Euronext Brussels. It has secondary listings on Mexican Stock Exchange, Johannesburg Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[13]

History[edit]
AB InBev was formed following the acquisition of American brewer Anheuser-Busch by Belgian-Brazilian brewer InBev, which is a merger of AmBev and Interbrew.

Interbrew was formed in 1987 from a merger of the two largest breweries in Belgium: Artois and Piedboeuf. The Artois brewery, previously known as Den Hoorn, was established by 1366. In 1995, Interbrew expanded by acquiring Labatt Brewing Company (founded 1847), the largest brewer in Canada. In 2002 it acquired Beck's (founded 1873), the maker of the world's top selling German beer.
AmBev (short for Companhia de Bebidas das Américas, or "Beverages Company of the Americas") was created in 1999 with the merger of the two biggest Brazilian brewers, Antarctica (founded in 1880) and Brahma (founded in 1886).
Anheuser-Busch was established in 1852 in St. Louis, Missouri as Anheuser & Co

In 2004, Interbrew and AmBev merged, creating the world's largest brewer, InBev.[14] The deal was valued at $11.5 billion and combined the 3rd largest (Interbrew) and 5th largest (Ambev) brewers into the world's No.1 beermaker. The deal consolidated the top brands from Belgium, Canada, Germany and Brazil.[15]
Anheuser bought Harbin Brewery, the maker of Harbin beer in 2004 and Fujian Sedrin Brewery, the maker of Sedrin beer, in 2006, making AB InBev the No. 3 brewer in China, the world's largest beer market.[16] In 2007, subsidiary Labatt acquired Lakeport in Canada, and InBev increased its shareholding in QUINSA, strengthening the company’s foothold in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.[citation needed]
In 2008, the merger of InBev and Anheuser-Busch was completed, creating Anheuser–Busch InBev, expanding on InBev's previous status as the world's largest brewer, creating one of the top five consumer products companies in the world. Under the terms of the merger agreement, all shares of Anheuser-Busch were acquired for 70 USD per share in cash, for an aggregate of 52 billion USD.[17]
In 2013, Anheuser-Busch InBev joined leading alcohol producers as part of a producers' commitments to reducing harmful drinking.[citation needed]

Interbrew[edit]
Main article: Interbrew
After the merger in 1987, Interbrew acquired a number of local breweries in Belgium. By 1991, a second phase of targeted external growth began outside Belgium. The first transaction in this phase took place in Hungary, followed in 1995 by the acquisition of Labatt, in Canada, and then in 1999 by a joint venture with Sun in Russia.
In 2000, Interbrew acquired Bass and Whitbread in the UK, and in 2001 the company established itself in Germany, with the acquisition of Diebels. This was followed by the acquisition of Beck’s & Co., the Gilde Group and Spaten. Interbrew operated as a family-owned business until December 2000. At this point it organized an Initial Public Offering, becoming a publicly owned company trading on the Euronext stock exchange (Brussels, Belgium).
In 2002, Interbrew strengthened its position in China, by acquiring stakes in the K.K. Brewery and the Zhujiang Brewery.
AmBev[edit]
Main article: AmBev
AmBev is a Brazilian beverages company formed by a merger in 1999 between the Brahma and Antarctica breweries. It has a dominant position in South America and the Caribbean region.[18][19][20] The subsidiary is listed on BM&F Bovespa, the São Paulo stock exchange, and on the New York Stock Exchange.
Anheuser-Busch[edit]
Main article: Anheuser-Busch
Anheuser-Busch is the largest brewing company in the United States and employs over 30,000 people. It was the world's largest brewing company based on revenue, but third in brewing volume, before the acquisition by InBev announced 13 July 2008. The division operated 12 breweries in the United States and 17 others overseas.
Anheuser-Busch's best known beers included brands such as Budweiser, the Busch (originally known as Busch Bavarian Beer) and Michelob families, and Natural Light and Ice. The company also produced a number of smaller-volume and specialty beers, nonalcoholic brews, malt liquors (King Cobra and the Hurricane family), and flavored malt beverages (e.g., the Bacardi Silver family and Tequiza).
Anheuser-Busch was also one of the largest theme park operators in the United States with ten parks throughout the United States. In October 2009, AB InBev announced the sale of its Busch Entertainment theme park division to The Blackstone Group for $2.7 billion. The company had been investigating a sale of Busch Entertainment since the merger with AB InBev.[21][22]
InBev[edit]
Main article: InBev
InBev was the second largest brewery company in the world.[23] While its core business is beer, the company also had a strong presence in the soft drink market in Latin America. It employed about 86,000 people and was headquartered in Leuven, Belgium, where Anheuser–Busch InBev is based.
Before the merger with AmBev, Interbrew was the third largest brewing company in the world by volume, Anheuser-Busch was the largest, followed by SABMiller in second place. Heineken International was in fourth place and AmBev was the world's fifth largest brewer.
InBev employed close to 89,000 people, running operations in over 30 countries across the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. In 2007, InBev realized 14.4 billion euro of revenue.
Grupo Modelo[edit]
The company owns Grupo Modelo, Mexico's leading brewer and owner of the Corona brand as of 4 June 2013. This transaction was valued at 20.1 billion USD. To satisfy US anti-trust demands, Grupo Modelo sold its US business, including US brand rights and the Piedras Negras Brewery in Mexico, for approx. 4.75 billion USD to Constellation Brands, a competitor of AB Inbev in some beverage sectors.[24]
Additionally, the group has a 51% controlling stock on Cerveceria Nacional Dominicana through the AmBev division.
Oriental Brewery[edit]
On 1 April 2014, AB Inbev completed the re-acquisition of the Oriental Brewery (OB), which it had sold in July 2009. OB is the largest brewer in South Korea. Its CASS brand is the best-selling beer in South Korea. All beers produced by OB are brewed using rice.[25]
Bud Analytics Lab[edit]
In 2013, AB Inbev opened its Bud Analytics Lab in Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which develops data research and innovation to solve problems ranging from assortment optimization, social media, and market trends to large scale data initiatives.
Acquisition of SABMiller; formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV[edit]
Main article: SABMiller
On 13 October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev made a bid of £70 billion, (US $107 billion when the deal closed), or £44 per share, for its largest rival, SABMiller, which if approved would give the company a third of the global market share for beer sales and a half of the global profit.[26][27] The company had previously offered £38, £40, £42.15, £43.50 per share respectively, but each of these had been turned down.[28][29][30]
SABMiller accepted the bid in principle, but consummation of the deal required antitrust approval by regulatory agencies.[31] In 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had agreed to the deal only on the basis that SABMiller "spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S. — which include both Miller- and Coors-held brands — along with its Miller brands outside the U.S." The entire ownership situation was complicated: "In the United States, Coors is majority owned by MillerCoors (a subsidiary of SABMiller) and minority owned by Molson Coors, though internationally it’s entirely owned by Molson Coors, and Miller is owned by SABMiller."[32]
The merger (A-B InBev acquisition of SABMiller), closed on 10 October 2016. The new company is called Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (AB InBev), based in Leuven, Belgium and listed on Euronext (Euronext: ABI), with secondary listings on the Mexico (MEXBOL: ABI) and South Africa (JSE: ANH) stock exchanges and with American Depositary Receipts on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: BUD).[33]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets and divested itself of its interests in the MillerCoors beer company to Molson Coors.[10][11]
The new AB InBev entity is the world's largest beer company. Estimated annual sales are US$55 billion in and the company will have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5]
As per the agreement with the regulators, the former SABMiller sold to Molson Coors full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico for US$12 billion. Molson Coors also retained "the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd’s and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell." The agreement made Molson Coors the world's third largest brewer.[34]
In Canada, Molson Coors regained the right to make and market Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite from the former SABMiller.[35]
Immediately after the formation of Anheuser Busch Inbev SA/NV (AB InBev), the Company owned over 200 beer brands including Budweiser and Bud Light, Corona, Stella Artois, Beck's, Leffe, Hoegaarden, Skol, Brahma, Antarctica, Quilmes, Victoria, Modelo Especial, Michelob Ultra, Harbin, Sedrin, Klinskoye, Sibirskaya Korona, Chernigivske, Cass and Jupiler. Anheuser Busch Company also owns a soft drinks business that has bottling contracts with PepsiCo through its subsidiary, Ambev.[36] In December 2016, Coca-Cola Co. bought many of the former SABMiller's Coca Cola operations, including those in Africa.[12][37]
As part of the agreements made with regulators before Anheuser-Busch InBev was allowed to acquire SABMiller, the company sold the Peroni, Meantime and Grolsch brands to Asahi on 13 October 2016.[38][39]
After acquiring SABMiller, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV agreed on 21 December 2016 to sell the former SABMiller Ltd. business in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania to Asahi Breweries Group Holdings, Ltd. for US$7.8 billion. The deal includes popular brands such as Pilsner Urquell, Tyskie, Lech, Dreher and Ursus.[40][41]
Management team[edit]
After the formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV on 20 October 2016, the company was to be run by teams of "functional chiefs" and "zone presidents" who report to AB InBev Chief Executive Officer Carlos Brito. All but one of those 19 positions are held by people who were already ABInBev executives before the acquisition of SABMiller.[42][43]
Ownership[edit]
Anheuser-Busch InBev is controlled by Belgian families Vandamme, De Mévius and de Spoelbergh, who as of 2015 owned a combined 28.6% of the company, and billionaire Brazilian investor Jorge Paulo Lemann, Carlos Alberto Sicupira and Marcel Telles, who owned 23 percent through their private investment firm 3G Capital.[44][45]
Brands[edit]
Main article: AB InBev brands
AB InBev's brand portfolio included highly popular beer and soft-drink brands. The company classified its brands as Global Brands, International Brands, and Local Champions. The following are some of the more popular 200 brands for ABInBev prior to the merger with SABMiller on 10 October 2016.[46] The combined ABInBev/SAB Miller entity has approximately 400 beer brands as of January 2017.[5][47]

Controversies[edit]
In October 2015, the company was investigated by the Justice Department for buying beer distributors and preventing them from selling the beers of its competitors.[53]
In May 2017, the company was criticized for reportedly engaging in anti-competitive behavior after purchasing the entire supply of South African hops from SAB Hop Farms, as part of the SABMiller purchase, and making the hops unavailable to any other US craft brewers.[54] Similar anti-competitive claims were also made in association with the company's purchase of Roseville, Minnesota-based Northern Brewer, the biggest homebrew-supply chain in the country, through AB Inbev's venture arm ZX Ventures.[54]
The following month, the company was further criticized for having purchased a stake in the beer rating website RateBeer, leading to concerns that the purchase was a conflict of interest.[55]
In July 2017 the company terminates the lease with the Munich pizza place „Casa mia“, after the politician Ernst Dill vainly tried to persuade the owner to ban Pegida supporters amongst his guests. The year before Anheuser-Busch InBev already bound the owner of Casa mia by contract to interpose at any sign of political activities.[56] Though, regarding the terminated lease a company spokesperson said, that the termination of the lease was announced, timely and not politically motivated.[57]

Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈɑnɦɔi̯zər ˈbuʃ ˈɪmbɛf]; abbreviated as AB InBev) is a multinational beverage and brewing company with global headquarters in Leuven, Belgium. Additional main offices are located in New York City, São Paulo, St. Louis, London, Mexico City, Johannesburg, Toronto, Buenos Aires and others.[4] The company was enlarged in October 2016 when AB InBev purchased SABMiller and concluded a merger of the two entities. It was the world's largest brewer even before the acquisition of SABMiller and is considered one of the largest fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies in the world. The estimated annual sales for the company in 2017 will be US$55 billion; prior to the merger, ABInBev had realized US$45.5 billion in revenue in 2016.[1] The company is expected to have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5] The company has recently announced a commitment to secure 100% of its purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025.[6][7]
The original AB InBev was formed through successive mergers of three international brewing groups completed in 2008: Interbrew from Belgium, AmBev from Brazil, and Anheuser-Busch from the United States. In October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev announced a successful all-cash bid to acquire multinational competitor SABMiller for £69 billion (US $107 billion). Shareholders for both companies approved the merger on 28 September 2016. The deal closed on 10 October 2016. The new entity has approximately 500 beer brands in 50 countries as of January 2017, up from the 200 that ABInBev had prior to the merger.[1][5][8]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets. The company subsequently sold the former SABMiller's interest in MillerCoors to Molson Coors, sold many of the former SABMiller's European brands to Asahi Breweries and sold much of its Coca-Cola bottling and distribution interests to the Coca-Cola Company.[9][10][11][12]
Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV is a publicly listed company, with its primary listing on the Euronext Brussels. It has secondary listings on Mexican Stock Exchange, Johannesburg Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[13]

History[edit]
AB InBev was formed following the acquisition of American brewer Anheuser-Busch by Belgian-Brazilian brewer InBev, which is a merger of AmBev and Interbrew.

Interbrew was formed in 1987 from a merger of the two largest breweries in Belgium: Artois and Piedboeuf. The Artois brewery, previously known as Den Hoorn, was established by 1366. In 1995, Interbrew expanded by acquiring Labatt Brewing Company (founded 1847), the largest brewer in Canada. In 2002 it acquired Beck's (founded 1873), the maker of the world's top selling German beer.
AmBev (short for Companhia de Bebidas das Américas, or "Beverages Company of the Americas") was created in 1999 with the merger of the two biggest Brazilian brewers, Antarctica (founded in 1880) and Brahma (founded in 1886).
Anheuser-Busch was established in 1852 in St. Louis, Missouri as Anheuser & Co

In 2004, Interbrew and AmBev merged, creating the world's largest brewer, InBev.[14] The deal was valued at $11.5 billion and combined the 3rd largest (Interbrew) and 5th largest (Ambev) brewers into the world's No.1 beermaker. The deal consolidated the top brands from Belgium, Canada, Germany and Brazil.[15]
Anheuser bought Harbin Brewery, the maker of Harbin beer in 2004 and Fujian Sedrin Brewery, the maker of Sedrin beer, in 2006, making AB InBev the No. 3 brewer in China, the world's largest beer market.[16] In 2007, subsidiary Labatt acquired Lakeport in Canada, and InBev increased its shareholding in QUINSA, strengthening the company’s foothold in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.[citation needed]
In 2008, the merger of InBev and Anheuser-Busch was completed, creating Anheuser–Busch InBev, expanding on InBev's previous status as the world's largest brewer, creating one of the top five consumer products companies in the world. Under the terms of the merger agreement, all shares of Anheuser-Busch were acquired for 70 USD per share in cash, for an aggregate of 52 billion USD.[17]
In 2013, Anheuser-Busch InBev joined leading alcohol producers as part of a producers' commitments to reducing harmful drinking.[citation needed]

Interbrew[edit]
Main article: Interbrew
After the merger in 1987, Interbrew acquired a number of local breweries in Belgium. By 1991, a second phase of targeted external growth began outside Belgium. The first transaction in this phase took place in Hungary, followed in 1995 by the acquisition of Labatt, in Canada, and then in 1999 by a joint venture with Sun in Russia.
In 2000, Interbrew acquired Bass and Whitbread in the UK, and in 2001 the company established itself in Germany, with the acquisition of Diebels. This was followed by the acquisition of Beck’s & Co., the Gilde Group and Spaten. Interbrew operated as a family-owned business until December 2000. At this point it organized an Initial Public Offering, becoming a publicly owned company trading on the Euronext stock exchange (Brussels, Belgium).
In 2002, Interbrew strengthened its position in China, by acquiring stakes in the K.K. Brewery and the Zhujiang Brewery.
AmBev[edit]
Main article: AmBev
AmBev is a Brazilian beverages company formed by a merger in 1999 between the Brahma and Antarctica breweries. It has a dominant position in South America and the Caribbean region.[18][19][20] The subsidiary is listed on BM&F Bovespa, the São Paulo stock exchange, and on the New York Stock Exchange.
Anheuser-Busch[edit]
Main article: Anheuser-Busch
Anheuser-Busch is the largest brewing company in the United States and employs over 30,000 people. It was the world's largest brewing company based on revenue, but third in brewing volume, before the acquisition by InBev announced 13 July 2008. The division operated 12 breweries in the United States and 17 others overseas.
Anheuser-Busch's best known beers included brands such as Budweiser, the Busch (originally known as Busch Bavarian Beer) and Michelob families, and Natural Light and Ice. The company also produced a number of smaller-volume and specialty beers, nonalcoholic brews, malt liquors (King Cobra and the Hurricane family), and flavored malt beverages (e.g., the Bacardi Silver family and Tequiza).
Anheuser-Busch was also one of the largest theme park operators in the United States with ten parks throughout the United States. In October 2009, AB InBev announced the sale of its Busch Entertainment theme park division to The Blackstone Group for $2.7 billion. The company had been investigating a sale of Busch Entertainment since the merger with AB InBev.[21][22]
InBev[edit]
Main article: InBev
InBev was the second largest brewery company in the world.[23] While its core business is beer, the company also had a strong presence in the soft drink market in Latin America. It employed about 86,000 people and was headquartered in Leuven, Belgium, where Anheuser–Busch InBev is based.
Before the merger with AmBev, Interbrew was the third largest brewing company in the world by volume, Anheuser-Busch was the largest, followed by SABMiller in second place. Heineken International was in fourth place and AmBev was the world's fifth largest brewer.
InBev employed close to 89,000 people, running operations in over 30 countries across the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. In 2007, InBev realized 14.4 billion euro of revenue.
Grupo Modelo[edit]
The company owns Grupo Modelo, Mexico's leading brewer and owner of the Corona brand as of 4 June 2013. This transaction was valued at 20.1 billion USD. To satisfy US anti-trust demands, Grupo Modelo sold its US business, including US brand rights and the Piedras Negras Brewery in Mexico, for approx. 4.75 billion USD to Constellation Brands, a competitor of AB Inbev in some beverage sectors.[24]
Additionally, the group has a 51% controlling stock on Cerveceria Nacional Dominicana through the AmBev division.
Oriental Brewery[edit]
On 1 April 2014, AB Inbev completed the re-acquisition of the Oriental Brewery (OB), which it had sold in July 2009. OB is the largest brewer in South Korea. Its CASS brand is the best-selling beer in South Korea. All beers produced by OB are brewed using rice.[25]
Bud Analytics Lab[edit]
In 2013, AB Inbev opened its Bud Analytics Lab in Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which develops data research and innovation to solve problems ranging from assortment optimization, social media, and market trends to large scale data initiatives.
Acquisition of SABMiller; formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV[edit]
Main article: SABMiller
On 13 October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev made a bid of £70 billion, (US $107 billion when the deal closed), or £44 per share, for its largest rival, SABMiller, which if approved would give the company a third of the global market share for beer sales and a half of the global profit.[26][27] The company had previously offered £38, £40, £42.15, £43.50 per share respectively, but each of these had been turned down.[28][29][30]
SABMiller accepted the bid in principle, but consummation of the deal required antitrust approval by regulatory agencies.[31] In 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had agreed to the deal only on the basis that SABMiller "spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S. — which include both Miller- and Coors-held brands — along with its Miller brands outside the U.S." The entire ownership situation was complicated: "In the United States, Coors is majority owned by MillerCoors (a subsidiary of SABMiller) and minority owned by Molson Coors, though internationally it’s entirely owned by Molson Coors, and Miller is owned by SABMiller."[32]
The merger (A-B InBev acquisition of SABMiller), closed on 10 October 2016. The new company is called Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (AB InBev), based in Leuven, Belgium and listed on Euronext (Euronext: ABI), with secondary listings on the Mexico (MEXBOL: ABI) and South Africa (JSE: ANH) stock exchanges and with American Depositary Receipts on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: BUD).[33]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets and divested itself of its interests in the MillerCoors beer company to Molson Coors.[10][11]
The new AB InBev entity is the world's largest beer company. Estimated annual sales are US$55 billion in and the company will have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5]
As per the agreement with the regulators, the former SABMiller sold to Molson Coors full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico for US$12 billion. Molson Coors also retained "the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd’s and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell." The agreement made Molson Coors the world's third largest brewer.[34]
In Canada, Molson Coors regained the right to make and market Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite from the former SABMiller.[35]
Immediately after the formation of Anheuser Busch Inbev SA/NV (AB InBev), the Company owned over 200 beer brands including Budweiser and Bud Light, Corona, Stella Artois, Beck's, Leffe, Hoegaarden, Skol, Brahma, Antarctica, Quilmes, Victoria, Modelo Especial, Michelob Ultra, Harbin, Sedrin, Klinskoye, Sibirskaya Korona, Chernigivske, Cass and Jupiler. Anheuser Busch Company also owns a soft drinks business that has bottling contracts with PepsiCo through its subsidiary, Ambev.[36] In December 2016, Coca-Cola Co. bought many of the former SABMiller's Coca Cola operations, including those in Africa.[12][37]
As part of the agreements made with regulators before Anheuser-Busch InBev was allowed to acquire SABMiller, the company sold the Peroni, Meantime and Grolsch brands to Asahi on 13 October 2016.[38][39]
After acquiring SABMiller, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV agreed on 21 December 2016 to sell the former SABMiller Ltd. business in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania to Asahi Breweries Group Holdings, Ltd. for US$7.8 billion. The deal includes popular brands such as Pilsner Urquell, Tyskie, Lech, Dreher and Ursus.[40][41]
Management team[edit]
After the formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV on 20 October 2016, the company was to be run by teams of "functional chiefs" and "zone presidents" who report to AB InBev Chief Executive Officer Carlos Brito. All but one of those 19 positions are held by people who were already ABInBev executives before the acquisition of SABMiller.[42][43]
Ownership[edit]
Anheuser-Busch InBev is controlled by Belgian families Vandamme, De Mévius and de Spoelbergh, who as of 2015 owned a combined 28.6% of the company, and billionaire Brazilian investor Jorge Paulo Lemann, Carlos Alberto Sicupira and Marcel Telles, who owned 23 percent through their private investment firm 3G Capital.[44][45]
Brands[edit]
Main article: AB InBev brands
AB InBev's brand portfolio included highly popular beer and soft-drink brands. The company classified its brands as Global Brands, International Brands, and Local Champions. The following are some of the more popular 200 brands for ABInBev prior to the merger with SABMiller on 10 October 2016.[46] The combined ABInBev/SAB Miller entity has approximately 400 beer brands as of January 2017.[5][47]

Controversies[edit]
In October 2015, the company was investigated by the Justice Department for buying beer distributors and preventing them from selling the beers of its competitors.[53]
In May 2017, the company was criticized for reportedly engaging in anti-competitive behavior after purchasing the entire supply of South African hops from SAB Hop Farms, as part of the SABMiller purchase, and making the hops unavailable to any other US craft brewers.[54] Similar anti-competitive claims were also made in association with the company's purchase of Roseville, Minnesota-based Northern Brewer, the biggest homebrew-supply chain in the country, through AB Inbev's venture arm ZX Ventures.[54]
The following month, the company was further criticized for having purchased a stake in the beer rating website RateBeer, leading to concerns that the purchase was a conflict of interest.[55]
In July 2017 the company terminates the lease with the Munich pizza place „Casa mia“, after the politician Ernst Dill vainly tried to persuade the owner to ban Pegida supporters amongst his guests. The year before Anheuser-Busch InBev already bound the owner of Casa mia by contract to interpose at any sign of political activities.[56] Though, regarding the terminated lease a company spokesperson said, that the termination of the lease was announced, timely and not politically motivated.[57]

Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈɑnɦɔi̯zər ˈbuʃ ˈɪmbɛf]; abbreviated as AB InBev) is a multinational beverage and brewing company with global headquarters in Leuven, Belgium. Additional main offices are located in New York City, São Paulo, St. Louis, London, Mexico City, Johannesburg, Toronto, Buenos Aires and others.[4] The company was enlarged in October 2016 when AB InBev purchased SABMiller and concluded a merger of the two entities. It was the world's largest brewer even before the acquisition of SABMiller and is considered one of the largest fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies in the world. The estimated annual sales for the company in 2017 will be US$55 billion; prior to the merger, ABInBev had realized US$45.5 billion in revenue in 2016.[1] The company is expected to have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5] The company has recently announced a commitment to secure 100% of its purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025.[6][7]
The original AB InBev was formed through successive mergers of three international brewing groups completed in 2008: Interbrew from Belgium, AmBev from Brazil, and Anheuser-Busch from the United States. In October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev announced a successful all-cash bid to acquire multinational competitor SABMiller for £69 billion (US $107 billion). Shareholders for both companies approved the merger on 28 September 2016. The deal closed on 10 October 2016. The new entity has approximately 500 beer brands in 50 countries as of January 2017, up from the 200 that ABInBev had prior to the merger.[1][5][8]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets. The company subsequently sold the former SABMiller's interest in MillerCoors to Molson Coors, sold many of the former SABMiller's European brands to Asahi Breweries and sold much of its Coca-Cola bottling and distribution interests to the Coca-Cola Company.[9][10][11][12]
Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV is a publicly listed company, with its primary listing on the Euronext Brussels. It has secondary listings on Mexican Stock Exchange, Johannesburg Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[13]

History[edit]
AB InBev was formed following the acquisition of American brewer Anheuser-Busch by Belgian-Brazilian brewer InBev, which is a merger of AmBev and Interbrew.

Interbrew was formed in 1987 from a merger of the two largest breweries in Belgium: Artois and Piedboeuf. The Artois brewery, previously known as Den Hoorn, was established by 1366. In 1995, Interbrew expanded by acquiring Labatt Brewing Company (founded 1847), the largest brewer in Canada. In 2002 it acquired Beck's (founded 1873), the maker of the world's top selling German beer.
AmBev (short for Companhia de Bebidas das Américas, or "Beverages Company of the Americas") was created in 1999 with the merger of the two biggest Brazilian brewers, Antarctica (founded in 1880) and Brahma (founded in 1886).
Anheuser-Busch was established in 1852 in St. Louis, Missouri as Anheuser & Co

In 2004, Interbrew and AmBev merged, creating the world's largest brewer, InBev.[14] The deal was valued at $11.5 billion and combined the 3rd largest (Interbrew) and 5th largest (Ambev) brewers into the world's No.1 beermaker. The deal consolidated the top brands from Belgium, Canada, Germany and Brazil.[15]
Anheuser bought Harbin Brewery, the maker of Harbin beer in 2004 and Fujian Sedrin Brewery, the maker of Sedrin beer, in 2006, making AB InBev the No. 3 brewer in China, the world's largest beer market.[16] In 2007, subsidiary Labatt acquired Lakeport in Canada, and InBev increased its shareholding in QUINSA, strengthening the company’s foothold in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.[citation needed]
In 2008, the merger of InBev and Anheuser-Busch was completed, creating Anheuser–Busch InBev, expanding on InBev's previous status as the world's largest brewer, creating one of the top five consumer products companies in the world. Under the terms of the merger agreement, all shares of Anheuser-Busch were acquired for 70 USD per share in cash, for an aggregate of 52 billion USD.[17]
In 2013, Anheuser-Busch InBev joined leading alcohol producers as part of a producers' commitments to reducing harmful drinking.[citation needed]

Interbrew[edit]
Main article: Interbrew
After the merger in 1987, Interbrew acquired a number of local breweries in Belgium. By 1991, a second phase of targeted external growth began outside Belgium. The first transaction in this phase took place in Hungary, followed in 1995 by the acquisition of Labatt, in Canada, and then in 1999 by a joint venture with Sun in Russia.
In 2000, Interbrew acquired Bass and Whitbread in the UK, and in 2001 the company established itself in Germany, with the acquisition of Diebels. This was followed by the acquisition of Beck’s & Co., the Gilde Group and Spaten. Interbrew operated as a family-owned business until December 2000. At this point it organized an Initial Public Offering, becoming a publicly owned company trading on the Euronext stock exchange (Brussels, Belgium).
In 2002, Interbrew strengthened its position in China, by acquiring stakes in the K.K. Brewery and the Zhujiang Brewery.
AmBev[edit]
Main article: AmBev
AmBev is a Brazilian beverages company formed by a merger in 1999 between the Brahma and Antarctica breweries. It has a dominant position in South America and the Caribbean region.[18][19][20] The subsidiary is listed on BM&F Bovespa, the São Paulo stock exchange, and on the New York Stock Exchange.
Anheuser-Busch[edit]
Main article: Anheuser-Busch
Anheuser-Busch is the largest brewing company in the United States and employs over 30,000 people. It was the world's largest brewing company based on revenue, but third in brewing volume, before the acquisition by InBev announced 13 July 2008. The division operated 12 breweries in the United States and 17 others overseas.
Anheuser-Busch's best known beers included brands such as Budweiser, the Busch (originally known as Busch Bavarian Beer) and Michelob families, and Natural Light and Ice. The company also produced a number of smaller-volume and specialty beers, nonalcoholic brews, malt liquors (King Cobra and the Hurricane family), and flavored malt beverages (e.g., the Bacardi Silver family and Tequiza).
Anheuser-Busch was also one of the largest theme park operators in the United States with ten parks throughout the United States. In October 2009, AB InBev announced the sale of its Busch Entertainment theme park division to The Blackstone Group for $2.7 billion. The company had been investigating a sale of Busch Entertainment since the merger with AB InBev.[21][22]
InBev[edit]
Main article: InBev
InBev was the second largest brewery company in the world.[23] While its core business is beer, the company also had a strong presence in the soft drink market in Latin America. It employed about 86,000 people and was headquartered in Leuven, Belgium, where Anheuser–Busch InBev is based.
Before the merger with AmBev, Interbrew was the third largest brewing company in the world by volume, Anheuser-Busch was the largest, followed by SABMiller in second place. Heineken International was in fourth place and AmBev was the world's fifth largest brewer.
InBev employed close to 89,000 people, running operations in over 30 countries across the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. In 2007, InBev realized 14.4 billion euro of revenue.
Grupo Modelo[edit]
The company owns Grupo Modelo, Mexico's leading brewer and owner of the Corona brand as of 4 June 2013. This transaction was valued at 20.1 billion USD. To satisfy US anti-trust demands, Grupo Modelo sold its US business, including US brand rights and the Piedras Negras Brewery in Mexico, for approx. 4.75 billion USD to Constellation Brands, a competitor of AB Inbev in some beverage sectors.[24]
Additionally, the group has a 51% controlling stock on Cerveceria Nacional Dominicana through the AmBev division.
Oriental Brewery[edit]
On 1 April 2014, AB Inbev completed the re-acquisition of the Oriental Brewery (OB), which it had sold in July 2009. OB is the largest brewer in South Korea. Its CASS brand is the best-selling beer in South Korea. All beers produced by OB are brewed using rice.[25]
Bud Analytics Lab[edit]
In 2013, AB Inbev opened its Bud Analytics Lab in Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which develops data research and innovation to solve problems ranging from assortment optimization, social media, and market trends to large scale data initiatives.
Acquisition of SABMiller; formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV[edit]
Main article: SABMiller
On 13 October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev made a bid of £70 billion, (US $107 billion when the deal closed), or £44 per share, for its largest rival, SABMiller, which if approved would give the company a third of the global market share for beer sales and a half of the global profit.[26][27] The company had previously offered £38, £40, £42.15, £43.50 per share respectively, but each of these had been turned down.[28][29][30]
SABMiller accepted the bid in principle, but consummation of the deal required antitrust approval by regulatory agencies.[31] In 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had agreed to the deal only on the basis that SABMiller "spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S. — which include both Miller- and Coors-held brands — along with its Miller brands outside the U.S." The entire ownership situation was complicated: "In the United States, Coors is majority owned by MillerCoors (a subsidiary of SABMiller) and minority owned by Molson Coors, though internationally it’s entirely owned by Molson Coors, and Miller is owned by SABMiller."[32]
The merger (A-B InBev acquisition of SABMiller), closed on 10 October 2016. The new company is called Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (AB InBev), based in Leuven, Belgium and listed on Euronext (Euronext: ABI), with secondary listings on the Mexico (MEXBOL: ABI) and South Africa (JSE: ANH) stock exchanges and with American Depositary Receipts on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: BUD).[33]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets and divested itself of its interests in the MillerCoors beer company to Molson Coors.[10][11]
The new AB InBev entity is the world's largest beer company. Estimated annual sales are US$55 billion in and the company will have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5]
As per the agreement with the regulators, the former SABMiller sold to Molson Coors full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico for US$12 billion. Molson Coors also retained "the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd’s and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell." The agreement made Molson Coors the world's third largest brewer.[34]
In Canada, Molson Coors regained the right to make and market Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite from the former SABMiller.[35]
Immediately after the formation of Anheuser Busch Inbev SA/NV (AB InBev), the Company owned over 200 beer brands including Budweiser and Bud Light, Corona, Stella Artois, Beck's, Leffe, Hoegaarden, Skol, Brahma, Antarctica, Quilmes, Victoria, Modelo Especial, Michelob Ultra, Harbin, Sedrin, Klinskoye, Sibirskaya Korona, Chernigivske, Cass and Jupiler. Anheuser Busch Company also owns a soft drinks business that has bottling contracts with PepsiCo through its subsidiary, Ambev.[36] In December 2016, Coca-Cola Co. bought many of the former SABMiller's Coca Cola operations, including those in Africa.[12][37]
As part of the agreements made with regulators before Anheuser-Busch InBev was allowed to acquire SABMiller, the company sold the Peroni, Meantime and Grolsch brands to Asahi on 13 October 2016.[38][39]
After acquiring SABMiller, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV agreed on 21 December 2016 to sell the former SABMiller Ltd. business in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania to Asahi Breweries Group Holdings, Ltd. for US$7.8 billion. The deal includes popular brands such as Pilsner Urquell, Tyskie, Lech, Dreher and Ursus.[40][41]
Management team[edit]
After the formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV on 20 October 2016, the company was to be run by teams of "functional chiefs" and "zone presidents" who report to AB InBev Chief Executive Officer Carlos Brito. All but one of those 19 positions are held by people who were already ABInBev executives before the acquisition of SABMiller.[42][43]
Ownership[edit]
Anheuser-Busch InBev is controlled by Belgian families Vandamme, De Mévius and de Spoelbergh, who as of 2015 owned a combined 28.6% of the company, and billionaire Brazilian investor Jorge Paulo Lemann, Carlos Alberto Sicupira and Marcel Telles, who owned 23 percent through their private investment firm 3G Capital.[44][45]
Brands[edit]
Main article: AB InBev brands
AB InBev's brand portfolio included highly popular beer and soft-drink brands. The company classified its brands as Global Brands, International Brands, and Local Champions. The following are some of the more popular 200 brands for ABInBev prior to the merger with SABMiller on 10 October 2016.[46] The combined ABInBev/SAB Miller entity has approximately 400 beer brands as of January 2017.[5][47]

Controversies[edit]
In October 2015, the company was investigated by the Justice Department for buying beer distributors and preventing them from selling the beers of its competitors.[53]
In May 2017, the company was criticized for reportedly engaging in anti-competitive behavior after purchasing the entire supply of South African hops from SAB Hop Farms, as part of the SABMiller purchase, and making the hops unavailable to any other US craft brewers.[54] Similar anti-competitive claims were also made in association with the company's purchase of Roseville, Minnesota-based Northern Brewer, the biggest homebrew-supply chain in the country, through AB Inbev's venture arm ZX Ventures.[54]
The following month, the company was further criticized for having purchased a stake in the beer rating website RateBeer, leading to concerns that the purchase was a conflict of interest.[55]
In July 2017 the company terminates the lease with the Munich pizza place „Casa mia“, after the politician Ernst Dill vainly tried to persuade the owner to ban Pegida supporters amongst his guests. The year before Anheuser-Busch InBev already bound the owner of Casa mia by contract to interpose at any sign of political activities.[56] Though, regarding the terminated lease a company spokesperson said, that the termination of the lease was announced, timely and not politically motivated.[57]

Regional performance





North America


North America delivered solid financial performance with 2.0% normalized EBITDA growth, the highest in the last four years - achieved while making major investments in sales and marketing. Despite a weakened industry, the US was able to deliver flat full year revenue, with lower volumes offset by revenue per hl growth, driven by revenue management initiatives and favorable brand mix.
Our market share trend is improving in the U.S. thanks to strong performance from Michelob Ultra and our portfolio of high-end brands, as well as improvement in our value brands. Our positioning of Michelob Ultra as a lifestyle brand led to double-digit growth and seven consecutive quarters of share gains. We’re also gaining share with high-end brands Stella Artois and Goose Island.
Strong advertising campaigns and activations like the Made in America festival are helping stabilize Budweiser in the U.S. We have work to do on our largest U.S. brand, Bud Light, and have transitioned to a new platform, Famous Among Friends," grounded in Bud Light's role cementing friendships over time.
We are connecting with sports lovers in the U.S. in innovative new ways. For more than 30 years, we have been the leader in sports marketing, and we are revolutionizing our approach to deliver richer fan experiences. In 2016, we signed new deals with the NFL and the NBA, have adopted a more focused approach to team sponsorships, and launched our eSports initiative. We remain a leader in digital and social media executions and continue to experiment with new technologies. We are also forging authentic connections in the Hispanic market, through our first Spanish-language Super Bowl ad for Bud Light and activations across Hispanic passion points like the NFL and the Copa America Centenario.
In 2017, we are focused on improving market share performance with Budweiser, Bud Light and Michelob Ultra, supported by our portfolio of value brands and regional bets like Estrella Jalisco, which launched in several states in March. We are looking outside beer to innovations like the Teavana ready-to-drink line and our flavored malt beverage offerings, including the SpikedSeltzer brand, which is new to the portfolio.  We will also continue to invest in our craft brands to develop these future growth engines.





Latin America North


We had a very difficult year in Brazil in 2016. Our beer volumes were down -6.6% for the year, driven by continued pressure on consumer disposable income. Net revenue declined by -5.3% with net revenue per hl up 1.2%.
As part of our revenue management strategy, we are using our complete portfolio of packs and brands to achieve attractive, more competitive consumer price points. This includes growing our mix of returnable glass bottles (RGBs), a format that now accounts for 25% of our volume in the supermarket channel. While RGBs have a negative impact on net revenue per hl, they can help boost EBITDA and margin over time.
Although 2016 has been a very challenging year in Brazil, we remain optimistic about the future for our business. We expect that favorable demographics, the closing of regional disparities in per capita incomes and consumer demand for innovative and premium products will help drive long-term growth.





Latin America South


Despite outstanding performance from our global brands and overall business growth in Paraguay and Chile, our Latin America South zone had a tough 2016. We saw contraction in consumption and the industry in Argentina due to structural reforms, higher tariffs and high inflation. Solid revenue management and cost controls helped offset volume declines in the zone, and price increases in line with inflation helped the top-line grow 16.9% for the year.
There were several bright spots. Corona and Budweiser both enjoyed significant double-digit net revenue growth. The Corona SunSets platform continues to grow and perform well in the region, and hosted its second winter festival at a ski resort in Farellones, Chile, in August. Buenos Aires was one of four global cities to experience the 360-degree Stella Artois “Le Savoir” series.
Despite the weak economic backdrop, Brahma grew beer volumes in Argentina, as did Corona in the premium space. Craft brand Patagonia nearly doubled volumes in 2016. It welcomed beer lovers to its rustic microbrewery in Bariloche, overlooking Moreno Lake, where visitors can enjoy special limited edition beers and regional cuisine. The brand also opened 23 “refugio” bars made from shipping containers in various locations around Argentina.
In 2017 we are looking to drive growth through supporting our global brands, stabilizing Quilmes and continuing initiatives related to affordability and convenience.





Latin America West


Our Latin America West region, which includes Mexico, Colombia, Peru and Ecuador, delivered solid results in 2016, led by continued strength in Mexico. Beer volumes for the region grew 5.9%, with top-line expansion of 9.3%. The industry struggled in Ecuador due to a tough macro environment combined with the aftermath of a strong earthquake in April. The trading environments in Colombia and Peru were less challenging.
Our global brands performed well throughout the region. Corona helped develop the premium segment with its expanded coverage and disruptive consumer experiences via its SunSets platform. In Corona’s home country of Mexico, preference and volume gains for both Corona Extra and Corona Light provided a boost to the brand, which now represents nearly half of our domestic beer sales.
We launched the no-alcohol Corona Cero in Mexico with a “Same Taste, No Alcohol” campaign, and expect it to help create new consumption occasions and increase consumption frequency in the country. Strengthened by consistent positioning efforts, premium brands Club Colombia in Colombia and Cusqueña in Peru delivered double-digit top-line growth. We also continued to develop innovative new options including Bud Light Mang-o-Rita, Victoria Chelada, Victoria Oro, Modelo Trigo, Club Colombia Trigo, Cusqueña Quinua, Redd’s Apple and Pony Malta Plus.





Asia Pacific


A tough macro environment and extreme weather put pressure on the industry in China and South Korea in 2016. Despite stable economies, industry volumes contracted in both markets.  In Australia, a portfolio shift toward contemporary brands such as Great Northern, Pure Blonde and Carlton Dry helped drive momentum as well as market share gains and premiumization initiatives.  Our total volumes across the region declined by 1.2% for the year, but net revenue increased 1.5% due to a favorable brand mix.
A focus on the super-premium segment has helped deliver growth in China and South Korea, with Corona and Hoegaarden leading the way. Budweiser has steadily gained momentum across China, and is the number one premium brand among high-income drinkers. Cass is the market leader in South Korea and delivered a great performance in 2016, with positive momentum across all key segments.
In Australia, we took over distribution rights for Corona, Stella Artois, Budweiser and our other premium brands, as part of the combination with SABMiller. With this move, we have become the market leader in the country. Australia is the most important export market for Corona in terms of volumes. It is the country’s most popular import beer and holds nearly 6% of market share. Stella Artois and Budweiser are smaller brands there today, but represent a tremendous growth opportunity.
Given its population growth, economic environment and growing beer market, India represents a significant opportunity. As a combined entity in India, we are now the second largest brewer with 18 breweries. The increase in scale in the country will help relieve capacity constraints and accelerate the growth of Budweiser and our other global brands in the country.
In Vietnam, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of the opening of our state-of-the-art brewery, which enables us to deliver fresh beer to consumers in Southeast Asia. Budweiser posted double-digit growth in Vietnam in 2016, and its new design was well received by consumers.





Europe, Middle East, and Africa


In our EMEA region, top-line growth increased 4.2% and own beer volumes declined 1.1% in 2016 with particularly strong and consistent performance in Western Europe driven mostly by premiumization initiatives. Our top-line in Western Europe grew 3.4% over 2015. Normalized EBITDA across EMEA grew 3.7%.
Our global and premium brands delivered strong top-line growth in Europe, with standout performance from Corona, Budweiser, Leffe and Cubanisto – which all showed solid double-digit growth.  Stella Artois and Budweiser enjoyed successful activations in Europe, such as Wimbledon and Tomorrowland, and launched new packaging in the UK, including a new Budweiser twist-off bottle.
Beck’s, our top brand in Germany and Italy, launched a new Red Ale variant from Ireland as part of its super-premium Taste of the World range. Leffe Royale Spring, a seasonal variant using Crystal Hops from the U.S. West Coast, helped demonstrate the brand’s premium craftsmanship. Also in France, Cubanisto released a Mojito variant in November. Jupiler, one of our strongest brands, celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2016. The brand also launched a new equity campaign and continued to focus on its football and music platforms through Tomorrowland and the Eurocup activation in the summer.  We also launched several no- and low-alcohol innovations across Europe.
We are excited to gain a presence on the African continent, which will play a key role for the company going forward. Africa offers attractive markets with increasing GDPs, a growing middle class and expanding opportunities. It is also becoming more important in the context of the global beer industry: Going forward, a significant portion of beer category growth is likely to come from Africa. It is estimated that, by 2025, Africa will represent approximately 8.1% of the global beer industry by volumes, up from approximately 6.5% in 2014.
We are preparing for the growing importance of the African beer market by positioning our resources and key brands in the largest and fastest-growing markets there, including South Africa, East Africa and Nigeria and Ghana in West Africa. To address future demand from consumers, we will partner with local growers to generate local value and ensure supply.

Corporate Governance



The Corporate Governance rules established by the Anheuser-Busch
  InBev Board of Directors support our business ambitions. They ensure
  that the company is responsibly managed and properly controlled.
  Without limiting vision or hampering swift action, the rules establish
  a framework of best practices, a way of thinking, and the modus
  operandi within and around the company to ensure clarity and proper conduct.
 



Introduction
As a company incorporated under Belgian law and listed on Euronext
  Brussels, Anheuser-Busch InBev adheres to the principles and
  provisions of the Belgian Corporate Governance Code, published in
  March 2009.
 
The majority of the Code is reflected in Anheuser-Busch InBev’s
  Corporate Governance rules. The complete set of these Corporate
  Governance rules is posted on the Corporate Governance Charter page. The rules are
  regularly updated.

 In order to reflect Anheuser-Busch InBev’s specific
  shareholding structure and the global nature of its operations, the
  Board of Directors has nevertheless adopted the following rules which
  depart from the Belgian Corporate Governance Code:
 

Principle 5.3./1 (Appendix D) of the Belgian Code: “the Board
    should set up a nomination committee composed of a majority of
    independent non-executive Directors”: The Board of Directors
  appoints the chairman and members of the Compensation and Nominating
  Committee from among the Directors, including at least one member from
  among the independent Directors. As the Committee is composed
  exclusively of non-executive Directors who are independent of
  management and free from any business relationship which could
  materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgment,
  the Board considers that the composition of this Committee achieves
  the Code’s aim of avoiding potential conflicts of interest.
 

Principle 7.7. of the Belgian Code : “Non-executive Directors
    should not be entitled to performance-related remuneration such as
    bonuses, stock-related, long-term incentive schemes, fringe benefits
    or pension benefits” : The remuneration of the Board members is
  composed of a fixed fee and a limited, pre-determined number of
  options, which ensures the independence of the Board members as well
  as aligning the Directors’ interests with those of the shareholders.
  The Board of Directors considers it very unlikely that the granting of
  options could affect their judgement as Board members. As a
  consequence, the Board considers Anheuser-Busch InBev’s principles of
  remuneration compatible with the recommendations of the Belgian Code
  on Corporate Governance.
 
Finally, it should be noted that options may only be granted upon
  the recommendation of the Compensation and Nominating Committee. Any
  such recommendation must be subsequently approved by the Board and the
  shareholders in a general meeting.
 
Further to the New York Stock Exchange listing of ADS’s representing
  ordinary shares of Anheuser-Busch InBev, the New York Stock Exchange
  Corporate Governance rules for Foreign Private Issuers are applicable
  to the company. According to these rules, the company discloses in
  item 16G of its annual report on Form 20-F significant ways in which
  its Corporate Governance practices differ from those followed by
  companies listed on the NYSE.
 
Finally, Anheuser-Busch InBev has registered with the United States
  Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). As a result, it is subject
  to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and to rules of the SEC relating to
  corporate governance.

SEC Charges Anheuser-Busch InBev With Violating FCPA and Whistleblower Protection Laws
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
          2016-196
        

          Washington D.C.,           Sept. 28, 2016—
        
The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Anheuser-Busch InBev has agreed to pay $6 million to settle charges that it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and chilled a whistleblower who reported the misconduct.
An SEC investigation found that the company used third-party sales promoters to make improper payments to government officials in India to increase the sales and production of Anheuser-Busch InBev products in that country.  Despite repeated complaints from employees, Anheuser-Busch InBev had inadequate internal accounting controls to detect and prevent the improper payments, and the company failed to ensure that transactions involving the promoters were recorded properly in its books and records.
 
The SEC’s order further finds that Anheuser-Busch InBev entered into a separation agreement that stopped an employee from continuing to voluntarily communicate with the SEC about potential FCPA violations due to a substantial financial penalty that would be imposed for violating strict non-disclosure terms.
 
“Anheuser-Busch InBev recorded improper payments by its sales promoters in India as legitimate expenses in its financial accounting, and then exacerbated the problem by including language in a separation agreement that chilled an employee from communicating with the SEC,” said Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s FCPA Unit. 
 
“Threat of financial punishment for whistleblowing is unacceptable,” added Jane Norberg, Acting Chief of the SEC’s Office of the Whistleblower.  “We will continue to take a hard look at these types of provisions and fact patterns.”
 
The SEC’s order finds that Anheuser-Busch InBev, which is headquartered in Leuven, Belgium, violated the books and records provisions and the internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws as well as Securities Exchange Act Rule 21F-17(a).  Anheuser-Busch InBev agreed to pay $2,712,955 in disgorgement plus interest of $292,381 and a penalty of $3,002,955.  For a two-year period, the company must cooperate with the SEC and report its FCPA compliance efforts while making reasonable efforts to notify certain former employees that Anheuser-Busch InBev does not prohibit employees from contacting the SEC about possible law violations.
 
The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Morgan B. Ward Doran, Sonali Singh, and Carol Shau, and supervised by Alka Patel.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Fraud Section of the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Securities and Exchange Board of India.

Anheuser-Busch Companies, LLC[5] /ˈænhaɪzər ˈbʊʃ/ is a brewing company based in St. Louis, Missouri USA and headquartered in Leuven, Belgium. Since 2008, it has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev)[6] which also has its North American regional management headquarters in St. Louis.[6][7]
The original Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev) was formed through successive mergers of three international brewing groups: Interbrew from Belgium, AmBev from Brazil and Anheuser-Busch. Hence, since 2008, Anheuser-Busch has been a division of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, now the world's largest brewing company.[8]
The company employs over 30,000 people, operates 12 breweries in the United States,[2] and until December 2009, was one of the largest theme park operators in the United States, with ten theme parks through the company's family entertainment division, Busch Entertainment Corporation.[9]
Anheuser-Busch InBev is the largest beer producer in the world.[10]

History[edit]
Beginnings and national expansion[edit]
In 1852, German American brewer and saloon operator George Schneider opened the Bavarian Brewery on Carondelet Avenue (later known as South Broadway) between Dorcas and Lynch streets in South St. Louis.[11] Schneider's brewery expanded in 1856 to a new brewhouse near Eighth and Crittenden streets; however, the following year financial problems forced the sale of the brewery to various owners during the late 1850s.[11] In 1860, the brewery was purchased on the brink of bankruptcy by William D'Oench, a local pharmacist, and Eberhard Anheuser, a prosperous German-born soap manufacturer.[11][12] D'Oench was the silent partner in the business until 1869, when he sold his half-interest in the company.[11] From 1860 to 1875, the brewery was known as E. Anheuser & Co., and from 1875 to 1879 as the E. Anheuser Company's Brewing Association.[11]
Adolphus Busch, a wholesaler who had immigrated to St. Louis from Germany in 1857, married Eberhard Anheuser's daughter, Lilly, in 1861. Following his service in the American Civil War, Busch began working as a salesman for the Anheuser brewery.[13] Busch purchased D'Oench's share of the company in 1869, and he assumed the role of company secretary from that time until the death of his father-in-law.[13]




Anheuser-Busch was one of the first companies to transport beer nationwide using railroad refrigerator cars.


Adolphus Busch was the first American brewer to use pasteurization to keep beer fresh; the first to use mechanical refrigeration and refrigerated railroad cars, which he introduced in 1876; and the first to bottle beer extensively.[1][14][15] By 1877, the company owned a fleet of 40 refrigerated railroad cars to transport beer.[15] Expanding the company's distribution range led to increased demand for Anheuser products, and the company substantially expanded its facilities in St. Louis during the 1870s.[16] The expansions led production to increase from 31,500 barrels in 1875 to more than 200,000 in 1881.[16]
To streamline the company's refrigerator car operations and achieve vertical integration, Busch established the St. Louis Refrigerator Car Company in 1878, which was charged with building, selling, and leasing refrigerator cars; by 1883, the company owned 200 cars, and by 1888 it owned 850.[17] To serve these cars and switch them in and out of their St. Louis brewery, Anheuser-Busch founded the Manufacturers Railway Company in 1887. The shortline operated until 2011 when Anheuser-Busch sought to shut down operations.[18]
During the 1870s, Adolphus Busch toured Europe and studied the changes in brewing methods which were taking place at the time, particularly the success of pilsner beer, which included a locally popular example brewed in Budweis.[12] In 1876, Busch introduced Budweiser, with the ambition of transcending regional tastes.[12] His company's ability to transport bottled beer made Budweiser the first national beer brand in the United States, and it was marketed as a "premium" beer.[12]
The company was renamed Anheuser-Busch Brewing Association in 1879; in 1880, Adolphus Busch became company president upon Anheuser's death.[17][19] The Busch family fully controlled the company through the generations until Anheuser-Busch's sale to InBev in 2008.[20]
During the 1880s and 1890s, Busch introduced a series of advertisements and marketing giveaways for the company, including bottle openers, calendars, corkscrews, pocketknives, postcards, and prints.[21] Among the most well-known of these giveaways was Custer's Last Fight, a lithograph print of a painting by St. Louis artist Cassilly Adams.[21] As a marketing tactic, Busch distributed thousands of copies of the print to bars in 1896,[21] the same year Anheuser-Busch introduced its new "super-premium" brand, Michelob.[22] Eventually more than one million copies of the print were produced, and it became "one of the most popular pieces of artwork in American history."[21]
At the turn of the 20th century, Anheuser-Busch continued to expand its production facilities to keep up with demand.[23] In 1905, the company built a new stockhouse in St. Louis, and by 1907 it produced nearly 1.6 million barrels of beer.[23] As demands for the prohibition of alcohol in the United States grew, Anheuser-Busch began producing non-alcoholic and low-alcoholic beverages (known as near beer); the most successful of these was Bevo, a malt beverage introduced in 1908.[23] After the death of Adolphus Busch in 1913, control of the company passed to his son, August Anheuser Busch, Sr., who continued to combat the rise of prohibitionists.[23] As part of an effort to improve the respectability of drinking, August Busch built three upscale restaurants in St. Louis during the 1910s: the Stork Inn, the Gretchen Inn (now known as the Feasting Fox), and the Bevo Mill.[23]




Anheuser-Busch produced olive-colored Budweiser cans during World War II.


Prohibition Period[edit]
As with all breweries in the country, the Temperance movement and eventual Prohibition in the United States dealt a major blow to the company in the 1910s through the 1930s. Some of the products sold by Anheuser-Busch to survive during Prohibition included brewer's yeast, malt extract, ice cream, and Bevo, a nonalcoholic malt beverage, or "near beer".[19][24]
Prohibition to Acquisition by InBev[edit]
In 1957, Anheuser-Busch became the largest brewer in the United States.
In 1981, Anheuser-Busch International, Inc., was established as a subsidiary responsible for the company's international operations and equity investments. Prior to its 2008 acquisition, Anheuser-Busch operated 15 breweries internationally: 14 in China and one in the United Kingdom.
In 1997, Chinese production of Anheuser-Busch products began after the company's purchase of a local brewery; later, the company operated both Budweiser Wuhan International Brewing Company and Harbin Brewery, which Anheuser-Busch fully acquired in 2004. In the United Kingdom, the Budweiser Stag Brewing Company produced and packaged Budweiser at the Stag Brewery in Mortlake.
At one time, Anheuser-Busch International also held investments in Grupo Modelo in Mexico[25] Tsingtao Brewery in China;[25] Anheuser-Busch also held investments in Redhook Ale Brewery of Seattle, Washington[26] and Widmer Brothers Brewery of Portland, Oregon.[26] After the 2008 acquisition, most international operations were transferred to AB InBev zones where the interests are located.
On June 12, 2008, Belgian-Brazilian brewing company InBev announced that it had made a US$46 billion offer for the company,[27] which if it was accepted would join two of the world's four largest brewing companies (based on revenue) and create a company brewing three of the highest-grossing beers in the world, namely Bud Light, Budweiser, and Skol. InBev also stated that the merger would not result in any U.S. brewery closures and they would attempt to retain management and board members from both companies.[28] On June 25, 2008, Anheuser-Busch officially announced that they would reject InBev's offer and provide a restructuring of the company to maintain shareholders and United States World Headquarters in St. Louis.[29] On July 1, 2008, InBev urged Anheuser-Busch shareholders to vote in favor of the buyout as InBev felt the offer of $65 per share should be considered a reasonable offer in view of the falling stock market. The company had previously filed suit in Delaware, after the rejection of their offer, to ensure that the stockholders could oust Anheuser-Busch's 13 board members.[30] On July 7, 2008, Anheuser-Busch filed a lawsuit against InBev to stop them from soliciting support of shareholders, stating that the company's offer is an illegal scheme. InBev was also accused of concealing that they do business in Cuba, which might have created additional obstacles to their efforts to operate in the United States.[31]
On July 13, 2008, Anheuser-Busch and InBev said they had agreed to a deal, pending shareholder and regulatory approval,[32] for InBev to purchase the American icon at $70 per share, creating a new company to be named Anheuser-Busch InBev. Anheuser-Busch would get two seats on the combined board of directors. The all-cash agreement, almost $52 billion in total equity, created the world's largest brewer, uniting the maker of Budweiser and Michelob with the producer of Beck's, Stella Artois, Hoegaarden, Leffe, Bass, Labatt and Brahma. The two companies had combined yearly sales of more than $36.4 billion, surpassing the current No. 1 brewer, London-based SABMiller.[33][34]
Grupo Modelo took inBev to arbitration for more than a year and a half after the deal was completed over whether they could block the deal.
On October 7, 2009, parent company Anheuser-Busch InBev announced plans to sell the theme parks division to The Blackstone Group for up to $2.7 Billion USD.[35]
In July 2010, a panel decided that the takeover did not violate Anheuser-Busch agreement with Modelo.[36]
Post-acquisition changes[edit]
On November 18, 2008, the hostile takeover was completed, and the parent corporation was renamed Anheuser-Busch InBev; Anheuser-Busch became a wholly owned subsidiary of the new corporation, controlled within the North America zone unit of AB InBev. By early 2009, AB InBev "turned a family-led company that spared little expense into one that is focused intently on cost-cutting and profit margins, while rethinking the way it sells beer."[37] AB InBev focused on reducing costs in the Anheuser-Busch Companies subsidiary and implemented performance-related pay,[37] along with several other changes. They immediately laid off 1,400 employees and 415 contractors,[38] sold Busch Entertainment Corporation and company-owned aircraft, lengthened accounts payable terms, and introduced zero-based budgeting.
For employees, AB InBev ended perquisites such as executive assistants for senior management, company contributions to the salaried employee pension plan, and company-provided life insurance to retirees; it also reduced the number of company-provided cell phones, taking back 1200 Blackberries;[39] and ended tuition reimbursement, and severance packages. These internal changes accompanied changes in its advertising. These cost-cutting measures rapidly reduced AB InBev's debt from $56.6 billion in 2008 to $30.1 billion at the end of 2012. When the restructuring was complete, only three senior-level Anheuser-Busch managers remained.[39]
InBev auctioned off several large assets in an effort to pay off debt to the banks that financed the merger.[40] It sold Anheuser's 27% stake in China's Tsingtao, sold a few beverage can and lid-making plants to Ball Corporation, and sold its own Korean beer business for $1.8 billion to private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis and Roberts & Co.[41]
It put the 10 theme parks in Anheuser's Busch Entertainment Unit, which included its three SeaWorlds locations, up for sale.[40]
The new company caused concern from its suppliers when it announced it would take 120 days to pay its bills rather than 30 days, taking time to use that money for other purposes.[40] The new payment policy often results in longer periods than 120 days, since the 120 days starts from the end of the month in which the invoice is 'approved' internally, which can be many days/months after an invoice is submitted.
Following the merger, perks like free tickets to St. Louis Cardinals baseball games and for Busch Gardens were taken away from employees. Anheuser-Busch stopped providing free beer to its employees and visitors to its theme parks.[40]
InBev signed a 10-year lease on 31,500 square feet of office space on Park Avenue in New York, which led to speculation that they would move Anheuser-Busch InBev North American headquarters from St Louis.[42]
In February 2013, a widely publicized lawsuit accused AB InBev[43] "watering down" products including Budweiser and Michelob. Such beers are intentionally brewed over-strength and then "watered down" to the intended level, creating a product of equal or greater quality.[44][45] The lawsuit was dismissed.[46]
Of Anheuser's top executives, only three remained in their jobs following the acquisition: Dave Peacock as president of the merged company's US division; Gary Rutledge as general counsel for the company's North American business; and Bob Golden, Anheuser's former acquisitions head, as global head of the merged company's mergers and acquisitions effort.[47]
Operations and products[edit]
Anheuser-Busch Companies operates as one of several subsidiaries in the North America zone unit of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (AB InBev) and it produces and distributes hundreds of products from the AB InBev portfolio.
On October 10, 2016 a $100 billion merger between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller closed. The new company is trading as NewbelcoSABMiller.[48]
Corporate leadership[edit]
Since 2014, João Castro Neves has been the President and CEO, North America at Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, the parent company of the U.S. operation.[49]

Anheuser-Busch Companies has operated 13 breweries, all located in the United States:

St. Louis, Missouri (opened 1852)
Newark, New Jersey (opened 1951)
Van Nuys, California (opened 1954)
Tampa, Florida (opened 1959)
Houston, Texas (opened 1966)
Columbus, Ohio (opened 1968)
Jacksonville, Florida (opened 1969)
Merrimack, New Hampshire (opened 1970)
Williamsburg, Virginia (opened 1972)
Fairfield, California (opened 1976)
Baldwinsville, New York (opened 1983)
Fort Collins, Colorado (opened 1988)
Cartersville, Georgia (opened 1993)

The St. Louis brewery, which opened in 1852, is a National Historic Landmark District, and includes three buildings listed as National Historic Landmarks. Free public tours of the brewery are given. The tour takes visitors through the complex where they can see beer being made and packaged (not a part of the free tour, but is a part of the $10 Day Fresh Tour) in a working part of the brewery. The company keeps a rotation of its famous Budweiser Clydesdales at its headquarters, and visitors to the brewery can observe the clydesdales in their exercise field and see their places in the carriage house.
The brewery was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966.[50][51] The landmarked area includes 189 structures spread over 142 acres (57 ha), including many red brick Romanesque ones "with square crenelated towers and elaborate details."[50] The Brew House, built in 1891–1892, is particularly notable for its "multi-storied hop chandeliers, intricate iron-work, and utilization of natural light".[50]
Other operations[edit]
Aside from supply operations like brewing and packaging, Anheuser-Busch Companies includes Anheuser-Busch Wholesale Operations Divisions (WOD), Anheuser-Busch Agricultural Operations, Anheuser-Busch Recycling Corporation, Eagle Packaging, and Busch Properties, which manages subsidiary-owned property. Suppliers to Anheuser-Busch Companies include Owens-Illinois, which provides glass bottles to several Anheuser-Busch breweries. Anheuser-Busch also owns glass production facilities, such as the former Longhorn Glass, which provides glass for the Houston brewery. Anheuser-Busch Companies delivers its products to retailers through a network of more than 500 independent wholesalers and 13 wholly owned distributors.[52]
From February 20, 1953, the St. Louis Cardinals major league baseball club was owned by Anheuser-Busch.
On March 21, 1996, the club was sold to a group of private investors.
In 1966, Busch Memorial Stadium was paid for and built by the brewery and opened for business. The stadium was demolished in late 2005 and replaced by a new ballpark in 2006. Anheuser-Busch signed an agreement to retain the "Busch Stadium" name on the new building through 2025.
Up until 2009, Anheuser-Busch was also one of the largest theme park owners/operators in the United States, with ten parks throughout the country through its entertainment division, Busch Entertainment Corporation, including its 3 SeaWorld locations.
Beverage products[edit]
Main article: Anheuser-Busch brands
Anheuser-Busch Companies is responsible for the production, importation and distribution of several AB InBev products, including three company-designated global brands, Budweiser, Stella Artois, and Beck's.[2] Other multi-country brands distributed or produced by Anheuser-Busch Companies include Leffe and Hoegaarden, while local brands produced by the company include Bass Pale Ale, Bud Light, Busch Beer, Landshark Lager, Michelob, Natural Light, and Shock Top.[2] The company also produces nonalcoholic beverages, malt liquors (such as King Cobra and Hurricane), and flavored malt beverages (e.g. the Bacardi Silver family and Tequiza).[citation needed]
On Dec 22, 2015, it was announced that Anheuser-Busch would purchase up Breckenridge Brewery for an undisclosed sum.[53]
Advertising[edit]

Prior to its acquisition by InBev, the company was known in the United States for its advertising presence, including a sports marketing division which created advertising material for the Super Bowl and many other sporting events. Budweiser has sponsored horse racing events and motor sports including NASCAR, the "Miss Budweiser" racing hydroplane, and the "Budweiser King" championship top fuel dragster of Kenny Bernstein.
Since the acquisition by AB InBev, significant cuts in advertising plans have been rolled out, predicated on the belief that "changing demographics and media habits no longer require spending as much on mainstream sports events".[37]
Controversies[edit]
Spykes Underaged Alcohol Marketing[edit]
In 2007, the company introduced a flavored 12% abv malt liquor under the name Spykes. It was sold in colorful, 2-ounce bottles. Available flavors included mango, lime, melon and chocolate.[54] It was withdrawn in the same year after criticism from alcohol industry watchdog groups that it was being marketed to underage customers, and the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau found that the labeling of Spykes was illegal.[55][56][57]
Environmental Record[edit]
In 2002, the Political Economy Research Institute ranked Anheuser–Busch 40th among the "Toxic 100", a list of U.S. corporations most responsible for air pollution. The study found that Anheuser–Busch released 1,002,786 kg (2,213,657 lbs) of toxic pollutants annually into the air.[58] This is mainly because large amounts of CO2 are released during the process of fermentation.
Anheuser-Busch has received numerous awards for its efforts to reduce its impact on the environment.[59] In 1995 Anheuser-Busch's Baldwinsville brewery won an award for pollution prevention from the New York Governor for its use of a "comprehensive, energy-producing pollution-prevention system – bioenergy recovery – to treat wastewater from the brewing process." The brewery also reduced solid waste by nearly 70 percent from 1990 to 1994. In addition, the Baldwinsville brewery found markets for previous "waste" materials used in the fermentation of Anheuser-Busch beers.[60] The Anheuser-Busch Recycling Corp. recycled more than 27 billion cans in 2006, a number far greater than what was used in its own packaging. Similarly, Anheuser-Busch has set short-term goals to reduce energy consumption 5% and increasing use of renewable fuel from 8 to 15% by 2010. Along with these goals, Anheuser-Busch has succeeded in cutting down its water use by 3% since 2002.[61] Its parent company Anheuser-Busch InBev has recently announced a commitment to secure 100% of the company's purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025.[62][63]
The brewery also operates an environmental outreach program to encourage recycling, energy conservation, and habitat preservation, as well as to prevent littering and water pollution.[64] For past 18 years Anheuser-Busch employees have participated in "Green Week", which focuses on environmental conservation education for employees and their families.[65]
Anheuser-Busch states they do not use animal derived products, artificial ingredients, additives or preservatives at any stage of the brewing process or as part of the packaging in any of their range, with the exception of three Michelob products and two Bud Light products, which contain honey and shellfish respectively, and are marketed as such.[66] All other Anheuser-Busch beers are brewed using water, yeast, barley malt, hops, and additional cereal grains. Anheuser-Busch eliminates the need for isinglass finings by settling and removing particles before fermentation. The beechwood aging process also helps to attract and remove yeast from the brew before the lagering process has ended.[67][68] This only applies to the beers the company brews itself.
Budweiser Bill[edit]
In 2003, after numerous deaths in football stadiums, Brazil passed a law outlawing alcohol sales in stadiums. FIFA demanded that Brazil allow alcohol sales at the 2014 FIFA World Cup because Budweiser, a major World Cup sponsor is the "Official Beer of the FIFA World Cup", a role it has played since 1986.
In response, Brazil passed a law paving the way for alcohol sales in the World Cup, nicknamed the "Budweiser Bill".[69][70]
"Up for Whatever" beer campaign controversy[edit]
In April 2015, Anheuser-Busch, in an effort to target new, younger consumers to buy its products, the company printed a slogan on Bud Light bottles that said "The perfect beer for removing 'no' from your vocabulary for the night. #UpForWhatever."[71] The label triggered a backlash, and the company was immediately criticized by people who charged that it could be interpreted as promoting rape.[72] Alexander Lambrecht, Vice President of Anheuser-Busch, later apologized in a statement for the bottle tagline, saying that the message "missed the mark" and that they would never "condone disrespectful or irresponsible behavior."[73]
Liquor Law Violations in Seattle[edit]
The Washington State Liquor and Cannabis (WSLCB) board issued a $150,000 violation to Anheuser-Busch in May 2016. Investigators determined that Anheuser-Busch entered into an illegal agreement of exclusivity with two concert venues in Seattle – the Showbox and the Showbox SoDo.[74]
2017 Super Bowl Advertising[edit]
In early February 2017, Anheuser-Busch's "Budweiser – Born the Hard Way" Super Bowl commercial was released online, prompting conservative political rebuke over its depiction of the immigration of founder Adolphus Busch from Germany to St. Louis. Although the ad had been conceived eight months before its release, some perceived the ad to be a political statement in opposition to President Donald Trump. A week before the ad's release, public controversy erupted over an executive order prohibiting entry of immigrants, refugees, and re-entry of permanent residents from seven countries into the United States.[75] The script for the advertisement was finalized after the November elections, when Budweiser's internal marketing team settled on the twelfth revision of the script. Shooting for the commercial then took place in January.[76] The ad controversy followed after controversy in May 2016 when then Presidential candidate Donald Trump, was perceived by some to be hijacking Budweiser's 'America' branding campaign for his own political purposes.[77]

Anheuser-Busch Companies, LLC[5] /ˈænhaɪzər ˈbʊʃ/ is a brewing company based in St. Louis, Missouri USA and headquartered in Leuven, Belgium. Since 2008, it has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev)[6] which also has its North American regional management headquarters in St. Louis.[6][7]
The original Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev) was formed through successive mergers of three international brewing groups: Interbrew from Belgium, AmBev from Brazil and Anheuser-Busch. Hence, since 2008, Anheuser-Busch has been a division of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, now the world's largest brewing company.[8]
The company employs over 30,000 people, operates 12 breweries in the United States,[2] and until December 2009, was one of the largest theme park operators in the United States, with ten theme parks through the company's family entertainment division, Busch Entertainment Corporation.[9]
Anheuser-Busch InBev is the largest beer producer in the world.[10]

History[edit]
Beginnings and national expansion[edit]
In 1852, German American brewer and saloon operator George Schneider opened the Bavarian Brewery on Carondelet Avenue (later known as South Broadway) between Dorcas and Lynch streets in South St. Louis.[11] Schneider's brewery expanded in 1856 to a new brewhouse near Eighth and Crittenden streets; however, the following year financial problems forced the sale of the brewery to various owners during the late 1850s.[11] In 1860, the brewery was purchased on the brink of bankruptcy by William D'Oench, a local pharmacist, and Eberhard Anheuser, a prosperous German-born soap manufacturer.[11][12] D'Oench was the silent partner in the business until 1869, when he sold his half-interest in the company.[11] From 1860 to 1875, the brewery was known as E. Anheuser & Co., and from 1875 to 1879 as the E. Anheuser Company's Brewing Association.[11]
Adolphus Busch, a wholesaler who had immigrated to St. Louis from Germany in 1857, married Eberhard Anheuser's daughter, Lilly, in 1861. Following his service in the American Civil War, Busch began working as a salesman for the Anheuser brewery.[13] Busch purchased D'Oench's share of the company in 1869, and he assumed the role of company secretary from that time until the death of his father-in-law.[13]




Anheuser-Busch was one of the first companies to transport beer nationwide using railroad refrigerator cars.


Adolphus Busch was the first American brewer to use pasteurization to keep beer fresh; the first to use mechanical refrigeration and refrigerated railroad cars, which he introduced in 1876; and the first to bottle beer extensively.[1][14][15] By 1877, the company owned a fleet of 40 refrigerated railroad cars to transport beer.[15] Expanding the company's distribution range led to increased demand for Anheuser products, and the company substantially expanded its facilities in St. Louis during the 1870s.[16] The expansions led production to increase from 31,500 barrels in 1875 to more than 200,000 in 1881.[16]
To streamline the company's refrigerator car operations and achieve vertical integration, Busch established the St. Louis Refrigerator Car Company in 1878, which was charged with building, selling, and leasing refrigerator cars; by 1883, the company owned 200 cars, and by 1888 it owned 850.[17] To serve these cars and switch them in and out of their St. Louis brewery, Anheuser-Busch founded the Manufacturers Railway Company in 1887. The shortline operated until 2011 when Anheuser-Busch sought to shut down operations.[18]
During the 1870s, Adolphus Busch toured Europe and studied the changes in brewing methods which were taking place at the time, particularly the success of pilsner beer, which included a locally popular example brewed in Budweis.[12] In 1876, Busch introduced Budweiser, with the ambition of transcending regional tastes.[12] His company's ability to transport bottled beer made Budweiser the first national beer brand in the United States, and it was marketed as a "premium" beer.[12]
The company was renamed Anheuser-Busch Brewing Association in 1879; in 1880, Adolphus Busch became company president upon Anheuser's death.[17][19] The Busch family fully controlled the company through the generations until Anheuser-Busch's sale to InBev in 2008.[20]
During the 1880s and 1890s, Busch introduced a series of advertisements and marketing giveaways for the company, including bottle openers, calendars, corkscrews, pocketknives, postcards, and prints.[21] Among the most well-known of these giveaways was Custer's Last Fight, a lithograph print of a painting by St. Louis artist Cassilly Adams.[21] As a marketing tactic, Busch distributed thousands of copies of the print to bars in 1896,[21] the same year Anheuser-Busch introduced its new "super-premium" brand, Michelob.[22] Eventually more than one million copies of the print were produced, and it became "one of the most popular pieces of artwork in American history."[21]
At the turn of the 20th century, Anheuser-Busch continued to expand its production facilities to keep up with demand.[23] In 1905, the company built a new stockhouse in St. Louis, and by 1907 it produced nearly 1.6 million barrels of beer.[23] As demands for the prohibition of alcohol in the United States grew, Anheuser-Busch began producing non-alcoholic and low-alcoholic beverages (known as near beer); the most successful of these was Bevo, a malt beverage introduced in 1908.[23] After the death of Adolphus Busch in 1913, control of the company passed to his son, August Anheuser Busch, Sr., who continued to combat the rise of prohibitionists.[23] As part of an effort to improve the respectability of drinking, August Busch built three upscale restaurants in St. Louis during the 1910s: the Stork Inn, the Gretchen Inn (now known as the Feasting Fox), and the Bevo Mill.[23]




Anheuser-Busch produced olive-colored Budweiser cans during World War II.


Prohibition Period[edit]
As with all breweries in the country, the Temperance movement and eventual Prohibition in the United States dealt a major blow to the company in the 1910s through the 1930s. Some of the products sold by Anheuser-Busch to survive during Prohibition included brewer's yeast, malt extract, ice cream, and Bevo, a nonalcoholic malt beverage, or "near beer".[19][24]
Prohibition to Acquisition by InBev[edit]
In 1957, Anheuser-Busch became the largest brewer in the United States.
In 1981, Anheuser-Busch International, Inc., was established as a subsidiary responsible for the company's international operations and equity investments. Prior to its 2008 acquisition, Anheuser-Busch operated 15 breweries internationally: 14 in China and one in the United Kingdom.
In 1997, Chinese production of Anheuser-Busch products began after the company's purchase of a local brewery; later, the company operated both Budweiser Wuhan International Brewing Company and Harbin Brewery, which Anheuser-Busch fully acquired in 2004. In the United Kingdom, the Budweiser Stag Brewing Company produced and packaged Budweiser at the Stag Brewery in Mortlake.
At one time, Anheuser-Busch International also held investments in Grupo Modelo in Mexico[25] Tsingtao Brewery in China;[25] Anheuser-Busch also held investments in Redhook Ale Brewery of Seattle, Washington[26] and Widmer Brothers Brewery of Portland, Oregon.[26] After the 2008 acquisition, most international operations were transferred to AB InBev zones where the interests are located.
On June 12, 2008, Belgian-Brazilian brewing company InBev announced that it had made a US$46 billion offer for the company,[27] which if it was accepted would join two of the world's four largest brewing companies (based on revenue) and create a company brewing three of the highest-grossing beers in the world, namely Bud Light, Budweiser, and Skol. InBev also stated that the merger would not result in any U.S. brewery closures and they would attempt to retain management and board members from both companies.[28] On June 25, 2008, Anheuser-Busch officially announced that they would reject InBev's offer and provide a restructuring of the company to maintain shareholders and United States World Headquarters in St. Louis.[29] On July 1, 2008, InBev urged Anheuser-Busch shareholders to vote in favor of the buyout as InBev felt the offer of $65 per share should be considered a reasonable offer in view of the falling stock market. The company had previously filed suit in Delaware, after the rejection of their offer, to ensure that the stockholders could oust Anheuser-Busch's 13 board members.[30] On July 7, 2008, Anheuser-Busch filed a lawsuit against InBev to stop them from soliciting support of shareholders, stating that the company's offer is an illegal scheme. InBev was also accused of concealing that they do business in Cuba, which might have created additional obstacles to their efforts to operate in the United States.[31]
On July 13, 2008, Anheuser-Busch and InBev said they had agreed to a deal, pending shareholder and regulatory approval,[32] for InBev to purchase the American icon at $70 per share, creating a new company to be named Anheuser-Busch InBev. Anheuser-Busch would get two seats on the combined board of directors. The all-cash agreement, almost $52 billion in total equity, created the world's largest brewer, uniting the maker of Budweiser and Michelob with the producer of Beck's, Stella Artois, Hoegaarden, Leffe, Bass, Labatt and Brahma. The two companies had combined yearly sales of more than $36.4 billion, surpassing the current No. 1 brewer, London-based SABMiller.[33][34]
Grupo Modelo took inBev to arbitration for more than a year and a half after the deal was completed over whether they could block the deal.
On October 7, 2009, parent company Anheuser-Busch InBev announced plans to sell the theme parks division to The Blackstone Group for up to $2.7 Billion USD.[35]
In July 2010, a panel decided that the takeover did not violate Anheuser-Busch agreement with Modelo.[36]
Post-acquisition changes[edit]
On November 18, 2008, the hostile takeover was completed, and the parent corporation was renamed Anheuser-Busch InBev; Anheuser-Busch became a wholly owned subsidiary of the new corporation, controlled within the North America zone unit of AB InBev. By early 2009, AB InBev "turned a family-led company that spared little expense into one that is focused intently on cost-cutting and profit margins, while rethinking the way it sells beer."[37] AB InBev focused on reducing costs in the Anheuser-Busch Companies subsidiary and implemented performance-related pay,[37] along with several other changes. They immediately laid off 1,400 employees and 415 contractors,[38] sold Busch Entertainment Corporation and company-owned aircraft, lengthened accounts payable terms, and introduced zero-based budgeting.
For employees, AB InBev ended perquisites such as executive assistants for senior management, company contributions to the salaried employee pension plan, and company-provided life insurance to retirees; it also reduced the number of company-provided cell phones, taking back 1200 Blackberries;[39] and ended tuition reimbursement, and severance packages. These internal changes accompanied changes in its advertising. These cost-cutting measures rapidly reduced AB InBev's debt from $56.6 billion in 2008 to $30.1 billion at the end of 2012. When the restructuring was complete, only three senior-level Anheuser-Busch managers remained.[39]
InBev auctioned off several large assets in an effort to pay off debt to the banks that financed the merger.[40] It sold Anheuser's 27% stake in China's Tsingtao, sold a few beverage can and lid-making plants to Ball Corporation, and sold its own Korean beer business for $1.8 billion to private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis and Roberts & Co.[41]
It put the 10 theme parks in Anheuser's Busch Entertainment Unit, which included its three SeaWorlds locations, up for sale.[40]
The new company caused concern from its suppliers when it announced it would take 120 days to pay its bills rather than 30 days, taking time to use that money for other purposes.[40] The new payment policy often results in longer periods than 120 days, since the 120 days starts from the end of the month in which the invoice is 'approved' internally, which can be many days/months after an invoice is submitted.
Following the merger, perks like free tickets to St. Louis Cardinals baseball games and for Busch Gardens were taken away from employees. Anheuser-Busch stopped providing free beer to its employees and visitors to its theme parks.[40]
InBev signed a 10-year lease on 31,500 square feet of office space on Park Avenue in New York, which led to speculation that they would move Anheuser-Busch InBev North American headquarters from St Louis.[42]
In February 2013, a widely publicized lawsuit accused AB InBev[43] "watering down" products including Budweiser and Michelob. Such beers are intentionally brewed over-strength and then "watered down" to the intended level, creating a product of equal or greater quality.[44][45] The lawsuit was dismissed.[46]
Of Anheuser's top executives, only three remained in their jobs following the acquisition: Dave Peacock as president of the merged company's US division; Gary Rutledge as general counsel for the company's North American business; and Bob Golden, Anheuser's former acquisitions head, as global head of the merged company's mergers and acquisitions effort.[47]
Operations and products[edit]
Anheuser-Busch Companies operates as one of several subsidiaries in the North America zone unit of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (AB InBev) and it produces and distributes hundreds of products from the AB InBev portfolio.
On October 10, 2016 a $100 billion merger between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller closed. The new company is trading as NewbelcoSABMiller.[48]
Corporate leadership[edit]
Since 2014, João Castro Neves has been the President and CEO, North America at Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, the parent company of the U.S. operation.[49]
Previous corporate leaders of Anheuser-Busch include:

Brewery operations[edit]




Brewery at St. Louis






The packaging plant in St. Louis


Anheuser-Busch Companies has operated 13 breweries, all located in the United States:

St. Louis, Missouri (opened 1852)
Newark, New Jersey (opened 1951)
Van Nuys, California (opened 1954)
Tampa, Florida (opened 1959)
Houston, Texas (opened 1966)
Columbus, Ohio (opened 1968)
Jacksonville, Florida (opened 1969)
Merrimack, New Hampshire (opened 1970)
Williamsburg, Virginia (opened 1972)
Fairfield, California (opened 1976)
Baldwinsville, New York (opened 1983)
Fort Collins, Colorado (opened 1988)
Cartersville, Georgia (opened 1993)

The St. Louis brewery, which opened in 1852, is a National Historic Landmark District, and includes three buildings listed as National Historic Landmarks. Free public tours of the brewery are given. The tour takes visitors through the complex where they can see beer being made and packaged (not a part of the free tour, but is a part of the $10 Day Fresh Tour) in a working part of the brewery. The company keeps a rotation of its famous Budweiser Clydesdales at its headquarters, and visitors to the brewery can observe the clydesdales in their exercise field and see their places in the carriage house.
The brewery was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966.[50][51] The landmarked area includes 189 structures spread over 142 acres (57 ha), including many red brick Romanesque ones "with square crenelated towers and elaborate details."[50] The Brew House, built in 1891–1892, is particularly notable for its "multi-storied hop chandeliers, intricate iron-work, and utilization of natural light".[50]
Other operations[edit]
Aside from supply operations like brewing and packaging, Anheuser-Busch Companies includes Anheuser-Busch Wholesale Operations Divisions (WOD), Anheuser-Busch Agricultural Operations, Anheuser-Busch Recycling Corporation, Eagle Packaging, and Busch Properties, which manages subsidiary-owned property. Suppliers to Anheuser-Busch Companies include Owens-Illinois, which provides glass bottles to several Anheuser-Busch breweries. Anheuser-Busch also owns glass production facilities, such as the former Longhorn Glass, which provides glass for the Houston brewery. Anheuser-Busch Companies delivers its products to retailers through a network of more than 500 independent wholesalers and 13 wholly owned distributors.[52]
From February 20, 1953, the St. Louis Cardinals major league baseball club was owned by Anheuser-Busch.
On March 21, 1996, the club was sold to a group of private investors.
In 1966, Busch Memorial Stadium was paid for and built by the brewery and opened for business. The stadium was demolished in late 2005 and replaced by a new ballpark in 2006. Anheuser-Busch signed an agreement to retain the "Busch Stadium" name on the new building through 2025.
Up until 2009, Anheuser-Busch was also one of the largest theme park owners/operators in the United States, with ten parks throughout the country through its entertainment division, Busch Entertainment Corporation, including its 3 SeaWorld locations.
Beverage products[edit]
Main article: Anheuser-Busch brands
Anheuser-Busch Companies is responsible for the production, importation and distribution of several AB InBev products, including three company-designated global brands, Budweiser, Stella Artois, and Beck's.[2] Other multi-country brands distributed or produced by Anheuser-Busch Companies include Leffe and Hoegaarden, while local brands produced by the company include Bass Pale Ale, Bud Light, Busch Beer, Landshark Lager, Michelob, Natural Light, and Shock Top.[2] The company also produces nonalcoholic beverages, malt liquors (such as King Cobra and Hurricane), and flavored malt beverages (e.g. the Bacardi Silver family and Tequiza).[citation needed]
On Dec 22, 2015, it was announced that Anheuser-Busch would purchase up Breckenridge Brewery for an undisclosed sum.[53]
Advertising[edit]

Prior to its acquisition by InBev, the company was known in the United States for its advertising presence, including a sports marketing division which created advertising material for the Super Bowl and many other sporting events. Budweiser has sponsored horse racing events and motor sports including NASCAR, the "Miss Budweiser" racing hydroplane, and the "Budweiser King" championship top fuel dragster of Kenny Bernstein.
Since the acquisition by AB InBev, significant cuts in advertising plans have been rolled out, predicated on the belief that "changing demographics and media habits no longer require spending as much on mainstream sports events".[37]
Controversies[edit]
Spykes Underaged Alcohol Marketing[edit]
In 2007, the company introduced a flavored 12% abv malt liquor under the name Spykes. It was sold in colorful, 2-ounce bottles. Available flavors included mango, lime, melon and chocolate.[54] It was withdrawn in the same year after criticism from alcohol industry watchdog groups that it was being marketed to underage customers, and the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau found that the labeling of Spykes was illegal.[55][56][57]
Environmental Record[edit]
In 2002, the Political Economy Research Institute ranked Anheuser–Busch 40th among the "Toxic 100", a list of U.S. corporations most responsible for air pollution. The study found that Anheuser–Busch released 1,002,786 kg (2,213,657 lbs) of toxic pollutants annually into the air.[58] This is mainly because large amounts of CO2 are released during the process of fermentation.
Anheuser-Busch has received numerous awards for its efforts to reduce its impact on the environment.[59] In 1995 Anheuser-Busch's Baldwinsville brewery won an award for pollution prevention from the New York Governor for its use of a "comprehensive, energy-producing pollution-prevention system – bioenergy recovery – to treat wastewater from the brewing process." The brewery also reduced solid waste by nearly 70 percent from 1990 to 1994. In addition, the Baldwinsville brewery found markets for previous "waste" materials used in the fermentation of Anheuser-Busch beers.[60] The Anheuser-Busch Recycling Corp. recycled more than 27 billion cans in 2006, a number far greater than what was used in its own packaging. Similarly, Anheuser-Busch has set short-term goals to reduce energy consumption 5% and increasing use of renewable fuel from 8 to 15% by 2010. Along with these goals, Anheuser-Busch has succeeded in cutting down its water use by 3% since 2002.[61] Its parent company Anheuser-Busch InBev has recently announced a commitment to secure 100% of the company's purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025.[62][63]
The brewery also operates an environmental outreach program to encourage recycling, energy conservation, and habitat preservation, as well as to prevent littering and water pollution.[64] For past 18 years Anheuser-Busch employees have participated in "Green Week", which focuses on environmental conservation education for employees and their families.[65]
Anheuser-Busch states they do not use animal derived products, artificial ingredients, additives or preservatives at any stage of the brewing process or as part of the packaging in any of their range, with the exception of three Michelob products and two Bud Light products, which contain honey and shellfish respectively, and are marketed as such.[66] All other Anheuser-Busch beers are brewed using water, yeast, barley malt, hops, and additional cereal grains. Anheuser-Busch eliminates the need for isinglass finings by settling and removing particles before fermentation. The beechwood aging process also helps to attract and remove yeast from the brew before the lagering process has ended.[67][68] This only applies to the beers the company brews itself.
Budweiser Bill[edit]
In 2003, after numerous deaths in football stadiums, Brazil passed a law outlawing alcohol sales in stadiums. FIFA demanded that Brazil allow alcohol sales at the 2014 FIFA World Cup because Budweiser, a major World Cup sponsor is the "Official Beer of the FIFA World Cup", a role it has played since 1986.
In response, Brazil passed a law paving the way for alcohol sales in the World Cup, nicknamed the "Budweiser Bill".[69][70]
"Up for Whatever" beer campaign controversy[edit]
In April 2015, Anheuser-Busch, in an effort to target new, younger consumers to buy its products, the company printed a slogan on Bud Light bottles that said "The perfect beer for removing 'no' from your vocabulary for the night. #UpForWhatever."[71] The label triggered a backlash, and the company was immediately criticized by people who charged that it could be interpreted as promoting rape.[72] Alexander Lambrecht, Vice President of Anheuser-Busch, later apologized in a statement for the bottle tagline, saying that the message "missed the mark" and that they would never "condone disrespectful or irresponsible behavior."[73]
Liquor Law Violations in Seattle[edit]
The Washington State Liquor and Cannabis (WSLCB) board issued a $150,000 violation to Anheuser-Busch in May 2016. Investigators determined that Anheuser-Busch entered into an illegal agreement of exclusivity with two concert venues in Seattle – the Showbox and the Showbox SoDo.[74]
2017 Super Bowl Advertising[edit]
In early February 2017, Anheuser-Busch's "Budweiser – Born the Hard Way" Super Bowl commercial was released online, prompting conservative political rebuke over its depiction of the immigration of founder Adolphus Busch from Germany to St. Louis. Although the ad had been conceived eight months before its release, some perceived the ad to be a political statement in opposition to President Donald Trump. A week before the ad's release, public controversy erupted over an executive order prohibiting entry of immigrants, refugees, and re-entry of permanent residents from seven countries into the United States.[75] The script for the advertisement was finalized after the November elections, when Budweiser's internal marketing team settled on the twelfth revision of the script. Shooting for the commercial then took place in January.[76] The ad controversy followed after controversy in May 2016 when then Presidential candidate Donald Trump, was perceived by some to be hijacking Budweiser's 'America' branding campaign for his own political purposes.[77]

Anheuser-Busch Companies, LLC[5] /ˈænhaɪzər ˈbʊʃ/ is a brewing company based in St. Louis, Missouri USA and headquartered in Leuven, Belgium. Since 2008, it has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev)[6] which also has its North American regional management headquarters in St. Louis.[6][7]
The original Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev) was formed through successive mergers of three international brewing groups: Interbrew from Belgium, AmBev from Brazil and Anheuser-Busch. Hence, since 2008, Anheuser-Busch has been a division of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, now the world's largest brewing company.[8]
The company employs over 30,000 people, operates 12 breweries in the United States,[2] and until December 2009, was one of the largest theme park operators in the United States, with ten theme parks through the company's family entertainment division, Busch Entertainment Corporation.[9]
Anheuser-Busch InBev is the largest beer producer in the world.[10]

History[edit]
Beginnings and national expansion[edit]
In 1852, German American brewer and saloon operator George Schneider opened the Bavarian Brewery on Carondelet Avenue (later known as South Broadway) between Dorcas and Lynch streets in South St. Louis.[11] Schneider's brewery expanded in 1856 to a new brewhouse near Eighth and Crittenden streets; however, the following year financial problems forced the sale of the brewery to various owners during the late 1850s.[11] In 1860, the brewery was purchased on the brink of bankruptcy by William D'Oench, a local pharmacist, and Eberhard Anheuser, a prosperous German-born soap manufacturer.[11][12] D'Oench was the silent partner in the business until 1869, when he sold his half-interest in the company.[11] From 1860 to 1875, the brewery was known as E. Anheuser & Co., and from 1875 to 1879 as the E. Anheuser Company's Brewing Association.[11]
Adolphus Busch, a wholesaler who had immigrated to St. Louis from Germany in 1857, married Eberhard Anheuser's daughter, Lilly, in 1861. Following his service in the American Civil War, Busch began working as a salesman for the Anheuser brewery.[13] Busch purchased D'Oench's share of the company in 1869, and he assumed the role of company secretary from that time until the death of his father-in-law.[13]




Anheuser-Busch was one of the first companies to transport beer nationwide using railroad refrigerator cars.


Adolphus Busch was the first American brewer to use pasteurization to keep beer fresh; the first to use mechanical refrigeration and refrigerated railroad cars, which he introduced in 1876; and the first to bottle beer extensively.[1][14][15] By 1877, the company owned a fleet of 40 refrigerated railroad cars to transport beer.[15] Expanding the company's distribution range led to increased demand for Anheuser products, and the company substantially expanded its facilities in St. Louis during the 1870s.[16] The expansions led production to increase from 31,500 barrels in 1875 to more than 200,000 in 1881.[16]
To streamline the company's refrigerator car operations and achieve vertical integration, Busch established the St. Louis Refrigerator Car Company in 1878, which was charged with building, selling, and leasing refrigerator cars; by 1883, the company owned 200 cars, and by 1888 it owned 850.[17] To serve these cars and switch them in and out of their St. Louis brewery, Anheuser-Busch founded the Manufacturers Railway Company in 1887. The shortline operated until 2011 when Anheuser-Busch sought to shut down operations.[18]
During the 1870s, Adolphus Busch toured Europe and studied the changes in brewing methods which were taking place at the time, particularly the success of pilsner beer, which included a locally popular example brewed in Budweis.[12] In 1876, Busch introduced Budweiser, with the ambition of transcending regional tastes.[12] His company's ability to transport bottled beer made Budweiser the first national beer brand in the United States, and it was marketed as a "premium" beer.[12]
The company was renamed Anheuser-Busch Brewing Association in 1879; in 1880, Adolphus Busch became company president upon Anheuser's death.[17][19] The Busch family fully controlled the company through the generations until Anheuser-Busch's sale to InBev in 2008.[20]
During the 1880s and 1890s, Busch introduced a series of advertisements and marketing giveaways for the company, including bottle openers, calendars, corkscrews, pocketknives, postcards, and prints.[21] Among the most well-known of these giveaways was Custer's Last Fight, a lithograph print of a painting by St. Louis artist Cassilly Adams.[21] As a marketing tactic, Busch distributed thousands of copies of the print to bars in 1896,[21] the same year Anheuser-Busch introduced its new "super-premium" brand, Michelob.[22] Eventually more than one million copies of the print were produced, and it became "one of the most popular pieces of artwork in American history."[21]
At the turn of the 20th century, Anheuser-Busch continued to expand its production facilities to keep up with demand.[23] In 1905, the company built a new stockhouse in St. Louis, and by 1907 it produced nearly 1.6 million barrels of beer.[23] As demands for the prohibition of alcohol in the United States grew, Anheuser-Busch began producing non-alcoholic and low-alcoholic beverages (known as near beer); the most successful of these was Bevo, a malt beverage introduced in 1908.[23] After the death of Adolphus Busch in 1913, control of the company passed to his son, August Anheuser Busch, Sr., who continued to combat the rise of prohibitionists.[23] As part of an effort to improve the respectability of drinking, August Busch built three upscale restaurants in St. Louis during the 1910s: the Stork Inn, the Gretchen Inn (now known as the Feasting Fox), and the Bevo Mill.[23]




Anheuser-Busch produced olive-colored Budweiser cans during World War II.


Prohibition Period[edit]
As with all breweries in the country, the Temperance movement and eventual Prohibition in the United States dealt a major blow to the company in the 1910s through the 1930s. Some of the products sold by Anheuser-Busch to survive during Prohibition included brewer's yeast, malt extract, ice cream, and Bevo, a nonalcoholic malt beverage, or "near beer".[19][24]
Prohibition to Acquisition by InBev[edit]
In 1957, Anheuser-Busch became the largest brewer in the United States.
In 1981, Anheuser-Busch International, Inc., was established as a subsidiary responsible for the company's international operations and equity investments. Prior to its 2008 acquisition, Anheuser-Busch operated 15 breweries internationally: 14 in China and one in the United Kingdom.
In 1997, Chinese production of Anheuser-Busch products began after the company's purchase of a local brewery; later, the company operated both Budweiser Wuhan International Brewing Company and Harbin Brewery, which Anheuser-Busch fully acquired in 2004. In the United Kingdom, the Budweiser Stag Brewing Company produced and packaged Budweiser at the Stag Brewery in Mortlake.
At one time, Anheuser-Busch International also held investments in Grupo Modelo in Mexico[25] Tsingtao Brewery in China;[25] Anheuser-Busch also held investments in Redhook Ale Brewery of Seattle, Washington[26] and Widmer Brothers Brewery of Portland, Oregon.[26] After the 2008 acquisition, most international operations were transferred to AB InBev zones where the interests are located.
On June 12, 2008, Belgian-Brazilian brewing company InBev announced that it had made a US$46 billion offer for the company,[27] which if it was accepted would join two of the world's four largest brewing companies (based on revenue) and create a company brewing three of the highest-grossing beers in the world, namely Bud Light, Budweiser, and Skol. InBev also stated that the merger would not result in any U.S. brewery closures and they would attempt to retain management and board members from both companies.[28] On June 25, 2008, Anheuser-Busch officially announced that they would reject InBev's offer and provide a restructuring of the company to maintain shareholders and United States World Headquarters in St. Louis.[29] On July 1, 2008, InBev urged Anheuser-Busch shareholders to vote in favor of the buyout as InBev felt the offer of $65 per share should be considered a reasonable offer in view of the falling stock market. The company had previously filed suit in Delaware, after the rejection of their offer, to ensure that the stockholders could oust Anheuser-Busch's 13 board members.[30] On July 7, 2008, Anheuser-Busch filed a lawsuit against InBev to stop them from soliciting support of shareholders, stating that the company's offer is an illegal scheme. InBev was also accused of concealing that they do business in Cuba, which might have created additional obstacles to their efforts to operate in the United States.[31]
On July 13, 2008, Anheuser-Busch and InBev said they had agreed to a deal, pending shareholder and regulatory approval,[32] for InBev to purchase the American icon at $70 per share, creating a new company to be named Anheuser-Busch InBev. Anheuser-Busch would get two seats on the combined board of directors. The all-cash agreement, almost $52 billion in total equity, created the world's largest brewer, uniting the maker of Budweiser and Michelob with the producer of Beck's, Stella Artois, Hoegaarden, Leffe, Bass, Labatt and Brahma. The two companies had combined yearly sales of more than $36.4 billion, surpassing the current No. 1 brewer, London-based SABMiller.[33][34]
Grupo Modelo took inBev to arbitration for more than a year and a half after the deal was completed over whether they could block the deal.
On October 7, 2009, parent company Anheuser-Busch InBev announced plans to sell the theme parks division to The Blackstone Group for up to $2.7 Billion USD.[35]
In July 2010, a panel decided that the takeover did not violate Anheuser-Busch agreement with Modelo.[36]
Post-acquisition changes[edit]
On November 18, 2008, the hostile takeover was completed, and the parent corporation was renamed Anheuser-Busch InBev; Anheuser-Busch became a wholly owned subsidiary of the new corporation, controlled within the North America zone unit of AB InBev. By early 2009, AB InBev "turned a family-led company that spared little expense into one that is focused intently on cost-cutting and profit margins, while rethinking the way it sells beer."[37] AB InBev focused on reducing costs in the Anheuser-Busch Companies subsidiary and implemented performance-related pay,[37] along with several other changes. They immediately laid off 1,400 employees and 415 contractors,[38] sold Busch Entertainment Corporation and company-owned aircraft, lengthened accounts payable terms, and introduced zero-based budgeting.
For employees, AB InBev ended perquisites such as executive assistants for senior management, company contributions to the salaried employee pension plan, and company-provided life insurance to retirees; it also reduced the number of company-provided cell phones, taking back 1200 Blackberries;[39] and ended tuition reimbursement, and severance packages. These internal changes accompanied changes in its advertising. These cost-cutting measures rapidly reduced AB InBev's debt from $56.6 billion in 2008 to $30.1 billion at the end of 2012. When the restructuring was complete, only three senior-level Anheuser-Busch managers remained.[39]
InBev auctioned off several large assets in an effort to pay off debt to the banks that financed the merger.[40] It sold Anheuser's 27% stake in China's Tsingtao, sold a few beverage can and lid-making plants to Ball Corporation, and sold its own Korean beer business for $1.8 billion to private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis and Roberts & Co.[41]
It put the 10 theme parks in Anheuser's Busch Entertainment Unit, which included its three SeaWorlds locations, up for sale.[40]
The new company caused concern from its suppliers when it announced it would take 120 days to pay its bills rather than 30 days, taking time to use that money for other purposes.[40] The new payment policy often results in longer periods than 120 days, since the 120 days starts from the end of the month in which the invoice is 'approved' internally, which can be many days/months after an invoice is submitted.
Following the merger, perks like free tickets to St. Louis Cardinals baseball games and for Busch Gardens were taken away from employees. Anheuser-Busch stopped providing free beer to its employees and visitors to its theme parks.[40]
InBev signed a 10-year lease on 31,500 square feet of office space on Park Avenue in New York, which led to speculation that they would move Anheuser-Busch InBev North American headquarters from St Louis.[42]
In February 2013, a widely publicized lawsuit accused AB InBev[43] "watering down" products including Budweiser and Michelob. Such beers are intentionally brewed over-strength and then "watered down" to the intended level, creating a product of equal or greater quality.[44][45] The lawsuit was dismissed.[46]
Of Anheuser's top executives, only three remained in their jobs following the acquisition: Dave Peacock as president of the merged company's US division; Gary Rutledge as general counsel for the company's North American business; and Bob Golden, Anheuser's former acquisitions head, as global head of the merged company's mergers and acquisitions effort.[47]
Operations and products[edit]
Anheuser-Busch Companies operates as one of several subsidiaries in the North America zone unit of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (AB InBev) and it produces and distributes hundreds of products from the AB InBev portfolio.
On October 10, 2016 a $100 billion merger between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller closed. The new company is trading as NewbelcoSABMiller.[48]
Corporate leadership[edit]
Since 2014, João Castro Neves has been the President and CEO, North America at Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, the parent company of the U.S. operation.[49]
Previous corporate leaders of Anheuser-Busch include:

1860–1880 Eberhard Anheuser

Brewery operations[edit]




Brewery at St. Louis






The packaging plant in St. Louis


Anheuser-Busch Companies has operated 13 breweries, all located in the United States:

St. Louis, Missouri (opened 1852)
Newark, New Jersey (opened 1951)
Van Nuys, California (opened 1954)
Tampa, Florida (opened 1959)
Houston, Texas (opened 1966)
Columbus, Ohio (opened 1968)
Jacksonville, Florida (opened 1969)
Merrimack, New Hampshire (opened 1970)
Williamsburg, Virginia (opened 1972)
Fairfield, California (opened 1976)
Baldwinsville, New York (opened 1983)
Fort Collins, Colorado (opened 1988)
Cartersville, Georgia (opened 1993)

The St. Louis brewery, which opened in 1852, is a National Historic Landmark District, and includes three buildings listed as National Historic Landmarks. Free public tours of the brewery are given. The tour takes visitors through the complex where they can see beer being made and packaged (not a part of the free tour, but is a part of the $10 Day Fresh Tour) in a working part of the brewery. The company keeps a rotation of its famous Budweiser Clydesdales at its headquarters, and visitors to the brewery can observe the clydesdales in their exercise field and see their places in the carriage house.
The brewery was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966.[50][51] The landmarked area includes 189 structures spread over 142 acres (57 ha), including many red brick Romanesque ones "with square crenelated towers and elaborate details."[50] The Brew House, built in 1891–1892, is particularly notable for its "multi-storied hop chandeliers, intricate iron-work, and utilization of natural light".[50]
Other operations[edit]
Aside from supply operations like brewing and packaging, Anheuser-Busch Companies includes Anheuser-Busch Wholesale Operations Divisions (WOD), Anheuser-Busch Agricultural Operations, Anheuser-Busch Recycling Corporation, Eagle Packaging, and Busch Properties, which manages subsidiary-owned property. Suppliers to Anheuser-Busch Companies include Owens-Illinois, which provides glass bottles to several Anheuser-Busch breweries. Anheuser-Busch also owns glass production facilities, such as the former Longhorn Glass, which provides glass for the Houston brewery. Anheuser-Busch Companies delivers its products to retailers through a network of more than 500 independent wholesalers and 13 wholly owned distributors.[52]
From February 20, 1953, the St. Louis Cardinals major league baseball club was owned by Anheuser-Busch.
On March 21, 1996, the club was sold to a group of private investors.
In 1966, Busch Memorial Stadium was paid for and built by the brewery and opened for business. The stadium was demolished in late 2005 and replaced by a new ballpark in 2006. Anheuser-Busch signed an agreement to retain the "Busch Stadium" name on the new building through 2025.
Up until 2009, Anheuser-Busch was also one of the largest theme park owners/operators in the United States, with ten parks throughout the country through its entertainment division, Busch Entertainment Corporation, including its 3 SeaWorld locations.
Beverage products[edit]
Main article: Anheuser-Busch brands
Anheuser-Busch Companies is responsible for the production, importation and distribution of several AB InBev products, including three company-designated global brands, Budweiser, Stella Artois, and Beck's.[2] Other multi-country brands distributed or produced by Anheuser-Busch Companies include Leffe and Hoegaarden, while local brands produced by the company include Bass Pale Ale, Bud Light, Busch Beer, Landshark Lager, Michelob, Natural Light, and Shock Top.[2] The company also produces nonalcoholic beverages, malt liquors (such as King Cobra and Hurricane), and flavored malt beverages (e.g. the Bacardi Silver family and Tequiza).[citation needed]
On Dec 22, 2015, it was announced that Anheuser-Busch would purchase up Breckenridge Brewery for an undisclosed sum.[53]
Advertising[edit]

Prior to its acquisition by InBev, the company was known in the United States for its advertising presence, including a sports marketing division which created advertising material for the Super Bowl and many other sporting events. Budweiser has sponsored horse racing events and motor sports including NASCAR, the "Miss Budweiser" racing hydroplane, and the "Budweiser King" championship top fuel dragster of Kenny Bernstein.
Since the acquisition by AB InBev, significant cuts in advertising plans have been rolled out, predicated on the belief that "changing demographics and media habits no longer require spending as much on mainstream sports events".[37]
Controversies[edit]
Spykes Underaged Alcohol Marketing[edit]
In 2007, the company introduced a flavored 12% abv malt liquor under the name Spykes. It was sold in colorful, 2-ounce bottles. Available flavors included mango, lime, melon and chocolate.[54] It was withdrawn in the same year after criticism from alcohol industry watchdog groups that it was being marketed to underage customers, and the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau found that the labeling of Spykes was illegal.[55][56][57]
Environmental Record[edit]
In 2002, the Political Economy Research Institute ranked Anheuser–Busch 40th among the "Toxic 100", a list of U.S. corporations most responsible for air pollution. The study found that Anheuser–Busch released 1,002,786 kg (2,213,657 lbs) of toxic pollutants annually into the air.[58] This is mainly because large amounts of CO2 are released during the process of fermentation.
Anheuser-Busch has received numerous awards for its efforts to reduce its impact on the environment.[59] In 1995 Anheuser-Busch's Baldwinsville brewery won an award for pollution prevention from the New York Governor for its use of a "comprehensive, energy-producing pollution-prevention system – bioenergy recovery – to treat wastewater from the brewing process." The brewery also reduced solid waste by nearly 70 percent from 1990 to 1994. In addition, the Baldwinsville brewery found markets for previous "waste" materials used in the fermentation of Anheuser-Busch beers.[60] The Anheuser-Busch Recycling Corp. recycled more than 27 billion cans in 2006, a number far greater than what was used in its own packaging. Similarly, Anheuser-Busch has set short-term goals to reduce energy consumption 5% and increasing use of renewable fuel from 8 to 15% by 2010. Along with these goals, Anheuser-Busch has succeeded in cutting down its water use by 3% since 2002.[61] Its parent company Anheuser-Busch InBev has recently announced a commitment to secure 100% of the company's purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025.[62][63]
The brewery also operates an environmental outreach program to encourage recycling, energy conservation, and habitat preservation, as well as to prevent littering and water pollution.[64] For past 18 years Anheuser-Busch employees have participated in "Green Week", which focuses on environmental conservation education for employees and their families.[65]
Anheuser-Busch states they do not use animal derived products, artificial ingredients, additives or preservatives at any stage of the brewing process or as part of the packaging in any of their range, with the exception of three Michelob products and two Bud Light products, which contain honey and shellfish respectively, and are marketed as such.[66] All other Anheuser-Busch beers are brewed using water, yeast, barley malt, hops, and additional cereal grains. Anheuser-Busch eliminates the need for isinglass finings by settling and removing particles before fermentation. The beechwood aging process also helps to attract and remove yeast from the brew before the lagering process has ended.[67][68] This only applies to the beers the company brews itself.
Budweiser Bill[edit]
In 2003, after numerous deaths in football stadiums, Brazil passed a law outlawing alcohol sales in stadiums. FIFA demanded that Brazil allow alcohol sales at the 2014 FIFA World Cup because Budweiser, a major World Cup sponsor is the "Official Beer of the FIFA World Cup", a role it has played since 1986.
In response, Brazil passed a law paving the way for alcohol sales in the World Cup, nicknamed the "Budweiser Bill".[69][70]
"Up for Whatever" beer campaign controversy[edit]
In April 2015, Anheuser-Busch, in an effort to target new, younger consumers to buy its products, the company printed a slogan on Bud Light bottles that said "The perfect beer for removing 'no' from your vocabulary for the night. #UpForWhatever."[71] The label triggered a backlash, and the company was immediately criticized by people who charged that it could be interpreted as promoting rape.[72] Alexander Lambrecht, Vice President of Anheuser-Busch, later apologized in a statement for the bottle tagline, saying that the message "missed the mark" and that they would never "condone disrespectful or irresponsible behavior."[73]
Liquor Law Violations in Seattle[edit]
The Washington State Liquor and Cannabis (WSLCB) board issued a $150,000 violation to Anheuser-Busch in May 2016. Investigators determined that Anheuser-Busch entered into an illegal agreement of exclusivity with two concert venues in Seattle – the Showbox and the Showbox SoDo.[74]
2017 Super Bowl Advertising[edit]
In early February 2017, Anheuser-Busch's "Budweiser – Born the Hard Way" Super Bowl commercial was released online, prompting conservative political rebuke over its depiction of the immigration of founder Adolphus Busch from Germany to St. Louis. Although the ad had been conceived eight months before its release, some perceived the ad to be a political statement in opposition to President Donald Trump. A week before the ad's release, public controversy erupted over an executive order prohibiting entry of immigrants, refugees, and re-entry of permanent residents from seven countries into the United States.[75] The script for the advertisement was finalized after the November elections, when Budweiser's internal marketing team settled on the twelfth revision of the script. Shooting for the commercial then took place in January.[76] The ad controversy followed after controversy in May 2016 when then Presidential candidate Donald Trump, was perceived by some to be hijacking Budweiser's 'America' branding campaign for his own political purposes.[77]

Anheuser-Busch Companies, LLC[5] /ˈænhaɪzər ˈbʊʃ/ is a brewing company based in St. Louis, Missouri USA and headquartered in Leuven, Belgium. Since 2008, it has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev)[6] which also has its North American regional management headquarters in St. Louis.[6][7]
The original Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev) was formed through successive mergers of three international brewing groups: Interbrew from Belgium, AmBev from Brazil and Anheuser-Busch. Hence, since 2008, Anheuser-Busch has been a division of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, now the world's largest brewing company.[8]
The company employs over 30,000 people, operates 12 breweries in the United States,[2] and until December 2009, was one of the largest theme park operators in the United States, with ten theme parks through the company's family entertainment division, Busch Entertainment Corporation.[9]
Anheuser-Busch InBev is the largest beer producer in the world.[10]

History[edit]
Beginnings and national expansion[edit]
In 1852, German American brewer and saloon operator George Schneider opened the Bavarian Brewery on Carondelet Avenue (later known as South Broadway) between Dorcas and Lynch streets in South St. Louis.[11] Schneider's brewery expanded in 1856 to a new brewhouse near Eighth and Crittenden streets; however, the following year financial problems forced the sale of the brewery to various owners during the late 1850s.[11] In 1860, the brewery was purchased on the brink of bankruptcy by William D'Oench, a local pharmacist, and Eberhard Anheuser, a prosperous German-born soap manufacturer.[11][12] D'Oench was the silent partner in the business until 1869, when he sold his half-interest in the company.[11] From 1860 to 1875, the brewery was known as E. Anheuser & Co., and from 1875 to 1879 as the E. Anheuser Company's Brewing Association.[11]
Adolphus Busch, a wholesaler who had immigrated to St. Louis from Germany in 1857, married Eberhard Anheuser's daughter, Lilly, in 1861. Following his service in the American Civil War, Busch began working as a salesman for the Anheuser brewery.[13] Busch purchased D'Oench's share of the company in 1869, and he assumed the role of company secretary from that time until the death of his father-in-law.[13]




Anheuser-Busch was one of the first companies to transport beer nationwide using railroad refrigerator cars.


Adolphus Busch was the first American brewer to use pasteurization to keep beer fresh; the first to use mechanical refrigeration and refrigerated railroad cars, which he introduced in 1876; and the first to bottle beer extensively.[1][14][15] By 1877, the company owned a fleet of 40 refrigerated railroad cars to transport beer.[15] Expanding the company's distribution range led to increased demand for Anheuser products, and the company substantially expanded its facilities in St. Louis during the 1870s.[16] The expansions led production to increase from 31,500 barrels in 1875 to more than 200,000 in 1881.[16]
To streamline the company's refrigerator car operations and achieve vertical integration, Busch established the St. Louis Refrigerator Car Company in 1878, which was charged with building, selling, and leasing refrigerator cars; by 1883, the company owned 200 cars, and by 1888 it owned 850.[17] To serve these cars and switch them in and out of their St. Louis brewery, Anheuser-Busch founded the Manufacturers Railway Company in 1887. The shortline operated until 2011 when Anheuser-Busch sought to shut down operations.[18]
During the 1870s, Adolphus Busch toured Europe and studied the changes in brewing methods which were taking place at the time, particularly the success of pilsner beer, which included a locally popular example brewed in Budweis.[12] In 1876, Busch introduced Budweiser, with the ambition of transcending regional tastes.[12] His company's ability to transport bottled beer made Budweiser the first national beer brand in the United States, and it was marketed as a "premium" beer.[12]
The company was renamed Anheuser-Busch Brewing Association in 1879; in 1880, Adolphus Busch became company president upon Anheuser's death.[17][19] The Busch family fully controlled the company through the generations until Anheuser-Busch's sale to InBev in 2008.[20]
During the 1880s and 1890s, Busch introduced a series of advertisements and marketing giveaways for the company, including bottle openers, calendars, corkscrews, pocketknives, postcards, and prints.[21] Among the most well-known of these giveaways was Custer's Last Fight, a lithograph print of a painting by St. Louis artist Cassilly Adams.[21] As a marketing tactic, Busch distributed thousands of copies of the print to bars in 1896,[21] the same year Anheuser-Busch introduced its new "super-premium" brand, Michelob.[22] Eventually more than one million copies of the print were produced, and it became "one of the most popular pieces of artwork in American history."[21]
At the turn of the 20th century, Anheuser-Busch continued to expand its production facilities to keep up with demand.[23] In 1905, the company built a new stockhouse in St. Louis, and by 1907 it produced nearly 1.6 million barrels of beer.[23] As demands for the prohibition of alcohol in the United States grew, Anheuser-Busch began producing non-alcoholic and low-alcoholic beverages (known as near beer); the most successful of these was Bevo, a malt beverage introduced in 1908.[23] After the death of Adolphus Busch in 1913, control of the company passed to his son, August Anheuser Busch, Sr., who continued to combat the rise of prohibitionists.[23] As part of an effort to improve the respectability of drinking, August Busch built three upscale restaurants in St. Louis during the 1910s: the Stork Inn, the Gretchen Inn (now known as the Feasting Fox), and the Bevo Mill.[23]




Anheuser-Busch produced olive-colored Budweiser cans during World War II.


Prohibition Period[edit]
As with all breweries in the country, the Temperance movement and eventual Prohibition in the United States dealt a major blow to the company in the 1910s through the 1930s. Some of the products sold by Anheuser-Busch to survive during Prohibition included brewer's yeast, malt extract, ice cream, and Bevo, a nonalcoholic malt beverage, or "near beer".[19][24]
Prohibition to Acquisition by InBev[edit]
In 1957, Anheuser-Busch became the largest brewer in the United States.
In 1981, Anheuser-Busch International, Inc., was established as a subsidiary responsible for the company's international operations and equity investments. Prior to its 2008 acquisition, Anheuser-Busch operated 15 breweries internationally: 14 in China and one in the United Kingdom.
In 1997, Chinese production of Anheuser-Busch products began after the company's purchase of a local brewery; later, the company operated both Budweiser Wuhan International Brewing Company and Harbin Brewery, which Anheuser-Busch fully acquired in 2004. In the United Kingdom, the Budweiser Stag Brewing Company produced and packaged Budweiser at the Stag Brewery in Mortlake.
At one time, Anheuser-Busch International also held investments in Grupo Modelo in Mexico[25] Tsingtao Brewery in China;[25] Anheuser-Busch also held investments in Redhook Ale Brewery of Seattle, Washington[26] and Widmer Brothers Brewery of Portland, Oregon.[26] After the 2008 acquisition, most international operations were transferred to AB InBev zones where the interests are located.
On June 12, 2008, Belgian-Brazilian brewing company InBev announced that it had made a US$46 billion offer for the company,[27] which if it was accepted would join two of the world's four largest brewing companies (based on revenue) and create a company brewing three of the highest-grossing beers in the world, namely Bud Light, Budweiser, and Skol. InBev also stated that the merger would not result in any U.S. brewery closures and they would attempt to retain management and board members from both companies.[28] On June 25, 2008, Anheuser-Busch officially announced that they would reject InBev's offer and provide a restructuring of the company to maintain shareholders and United States World Headquarters in St. Louis.[29] On July 1, 2008, InBev urged Anheuser-Busch shareholders to vote in favor of the buyout as InBev felt the offer of $65 per share should be considered a reasonable offer in view of the falling stock market. The company had previously filed suit in Delaware, after the rejection of their offer, to ensure that the stockholders could oust Anheuser-Busch's 13 board members.[30] On July 7, 2008, Anheuser-Busch filed a lawsuit against InBev to stop them from soliciting support of shareholders, stating that the company's offer is an illegal scheme. InBev was also accused of concealing that they do business in Cuba, which might have created additional obstacles to their efforts to operate in the United States.[31]
On July 13, 2008, Anheuser-Busch and InBev said they had agreed to a deal, pending shareholder and regulatory approval,[32] for InBev to purchase the American icon at $70 per share, creating a new company to be named Anheuser-Busch InBev. Anheuser-Busch would get two seats on the combined board of directors. The all-cash agreement, almost $52 billion in total equity, created the world's largest brewer, uniting the maker of Budweiser and Michelob with the producer of Beck's, Stella Artois, Hoegaarden, Leffe, Bass, Labatt and Brahma. The two companies had combined yearly sales of more than $36.4 billion, surpassing the current No. 1 brewer, London-based SABMiller.[33][34]
Grupo Modelo took inBev to arbitration for more than a year and a half after the deal was completed over whether they could block the deal.
On October 7, 2009, parent company Anheuser-Busch InBev announced plans to sell the theme parks division to The Blackstone Group for up to $2.7 Billion USD.[35]
In July 2010, a panel decided that the takeover did not violate Anheuser-Busch agreement with Modelo.[36]
Post-acquisition changes[edit]
On November 18, 2008, the hostile takeover was completed, and the parent corporation was renamed Anheuser-Busch InBev; Anheuser-Busch became a wholly owned subsidiary of the new corporation, controlled within the North America zone unit of AB InBev. By early 2009, AB InBev "turned a family-led company that spared little expense into one that is focused intently on cost-cutting and profit margins, while rethinking the way it sells beer."[37] AB InBev focused on reducing costs in the Anheuser-Busch Companies subsidiary and implemented performance-related pay,[37] along with several other changes. They immediately laid off 1,400 employees and 415 contractors,[38] sold Busch Entertainment Corporation and company-owned aircraft, lengthened accounts payable terms, and introduced zero-based budgeting.
For employees, AB InBev ended perquisites such as executive assistants for senior management, company contributions to the salaried employee pension plan, and company-provided life insurance to retirees; it also reduced the number of company-provided cell phones, taking back 1200 Blackberries;[39] and ended tuition reimbursement, and severance packages. These internal changes accompanied changes in its advertising. These cost-cutting measures rapidly reduced AB InBev's debt from $56.6 billion in 2008 to $30.1 billion at the end of 2012. When the restructuring was complete, only three senior-level Anheuser-Busch managers remained.[39]
InBev auctioned off several large assets in an effort to pay off debt to the banks that financed the merger.[40] It sold Anheuser's 27% stake in China's Tsingtao, sold a few beverage can and lid-making plants to Ball Corporation, and sold its own Korean beer business for $1.8 billion to private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis and Roberts & Co.[41]
It put the 10 theme parks in Anheuser's Busch Entertainment Unit, which included its three SeaWorlds locations, up for sale.[40]
The new company caused concern from its suppliers when it announced it would take 120 days to pay its bills rather than 30 days, taking time to use that money for other purposes.[40] The new payment policy often results in longer periods than 120 days, since the 120 days starts from the end of the month in which the invoice is 'approved' internally, which can be many days/months after an invoice is submitted.
Following the merger, perks like free tickets to St. Louis Cardinals baseball games and for Busch Gardens were taken away from employees. Anheuser-Busch stopped providing free beer to its employees and visitors to its theme parks.[40]
InBev signed a 10-year lease on 31,500 square feet of office space on Park Avenue in New York, which led to speculation that they would move Anheuser-Busch InBev North American headquarters from St Louis.[42]
In February 2013, a widely publicized lawsuit accused AB InBev[43] "watering down" products including Budweiser and Michelob. Such beers are intentionally brewed over-strength and then "watered down" to the intended level, creating a product of equal or greater quality.[44][45] The lawsuit was dismissed.[46]
Of Anheuser's top executives, only three remained in their jobs following the acquisition: Dave Peacock as president of the merged company's US division; Gary Rutledge as general counsel for the company's North American business; and Bob Golden, Anheuser's former acquisitions head, as global head of the merged company's mergers and acquisitions effort.[47]
Operations and products[edit]
Anheuser-Busch Companies operates as one of several subsidiaries in the North America zone unit of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (AB InBev) and it produces and distributes hundreds of products from the AB InBev portfolio.
On October 10, 2016 a $100 billion merger between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller closed. The new company is trading as NewbelcoSABMiller.[48]
Corporate leadership[edit]
Since 2014, João Castro Neves has been the President and CEO, North America at Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, the parent company of the U.S. operation.[49]
Previous corporate leaders of Anheuser-Busch include:

Brewery operations[edit]




Brewery at St. Louis






The packaging plant in St. Louis


Anheuser-Busch Companies has operated 13 breweries, all located in the United States:

St. Louis, Missouri (opened 1852)
Newark, New Jersey (opened 1951)
Van Nuys, California (opened 1954)
Tampa, Florida (opened 1959)
Houston, Texas (opened 1966)
Columbus, Ohio (opened 1968)
Jacksonville, Florida (opened 1969)
Merrimack, New Hampshire (opened 1970)
Williamsburg, Virginia (opened 1972)
Fairfield, California (opened 1976)
Baldwinsville, New York (opened 1983)
Fort Collins, Colorado (opened 1988)
Cartersville, Georgia (opened 1993)

The St. Louis brewery, which opened in 1852, is a National Historic Landmark District, and includes three buildings listed as National Historic Landmarks. Free public tours of the brewery are given. The tour takes visitors through the complex where they can see beer being made and packaged (not a part of the free tour, but is a part of the $10 Day Fresh Tour) in a working part of the brewery. The company keeps a rotation of its famous Budweiser Clydesdales at its headquarters, and visitors to the brewery can observe the clydesdales in their exercise field and see their places in the carriage house.
The brewery was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966.[50][51] The landmarked area includes 189 structures spread over 142 acres (57 ha), including many red brick Romanesque ones "with square crenelated towers and elaborate details."[50] The Brew House, built in 1891–1892, is particularly notable for its "multi-storied hop chandeliers, intricate iron-work, and utilization of natural light".[50]
Other operations[edit]
Aside from supply operations like brewing and packaging, Anheuser-Busch Companies includes Anheuser-Busch Wholesale Operations Divisions (WOD), Anheuser-Busch Agricultural Operations, Anheuser-Busch Recycling Corporation, Eagle Packaging, and Busch Properties, which manages subsidiary-owned property. Suppliers to Anheuser-Busch Companies include Owens-Illinois, which provides glass bottles to several Anheuser-Busch breweries. Anheuser-Busch also owns glass production facilities, such as the former Longhorn Glass, which provides glass for the Houston brewery. Anheuser-Busch Companies delivers its products to retailers through a network of more than 500 independent wholesalers and 13 wholly owned distributors.[52]
From February 20, 1953, the St. Louis Cardinals major league baseball club was owned by Anheuser-Busch.
On March 21, 1996, the club was sold to a group of private investors.
In 1966, Busch Memorial Stadium was paid for and built by the brewery and opened for business. The stadium was demolished in late 2005 and replaced by a new ballpark in 2006. Anheuser-Busch signed an agreement to retain the "Busch Stadium" name on the new building through 2025.
Up until 2009, Anheuser-Busch was also one of the largest theme park owners/operators in the United States, with ten parks throughout the country through its entertainment division, Busch Entertainment Corporation, including its 3 SeaWorld locations.
Beverage products[edit]
Main article: Anheuser-Busch brands
Anheuser-Busch Companies is responsible for the production, importation and distribution of several AB InBev products, including three company-designated global brands, Budweiser, Stella Artois, and Beck's.[2] Other multi-country brands distributed or produced by Anheuser-Busch Companies include Leffe and Hoegaarden, while local brands produced by the company include Bass Pale Ale, Bud Light, Busch Beer, Landshark Lager, Michelob, Natural Light, and Shock Top.[2] The company also produces nonalcoholic beverages, malt liquors (such as King Cobra and Hurricane), and flavored malt beverages (e.g. the Bacardi Silver family and Tequiza).[citation needed]
On Dec 22, 2015, it was announced that Anheuser-Busch would purchase up Breckenridge Brewery for an undisclosed sum.[53]
Advertising[edit]

1898 magazine ad for Malt-Nutrine.


Prior to its acquisition by InBev, the company was known in the United States for its advertising presence, including a sports marketing division which created advertising material for the Super Bowl and many other sporting events. Budweiser has sponsored horse racing events and motor sports including NASCAR, the "Miss Budweiser" racing hydroplane, and the "Budweiser King" championship top fuel dragster of Kenny Bernstein.
Since the acquisition by AB InBev, significant cuts in advertising plans have been rolled out, predicated on the belief that "changing demographics and media habits no longer require spending as much on mainstream sports events".[37]
Controversies[edit]
Spykes Underaged Alcohol Marketing[edit]
In 2007, the company introduced a flavored 12% abv malt liquor under the name Spykes. It was sold in colorful, 2-ounce bottles. Available flavors included mango, lime, melon and chocolate.[54] It was withdrawn in the same year after criticism from alcohol industry watchdog groups that it was being marketed to underage customers, and the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau found that the labeling of Spykes was illegal.[55][56][57]
Environmental Record[edit]
In 2002, the Political Economy Research Institute ranked Anheuser–Busch 40th among the "Toxic 100", a list of U.S. corporations most responsible for air pollution. The study found that Anheuser–Busch released 1,002,786 kg (2,213,657 lbs) of toxic pollutants annually into the air.[58] This is mainly because large amounts of CO2 are released during the process of fermentation.
Anheuser-Busch has received numerous awards for its efforts to reduce its impact on the environment.[59] In 1995 Anheuser-Busch's Baldwinsville brewery won an award for pollution prevention from the New York Governor for its use of a "comprehensive, energy-producing pollution-prevention system – bioenergy recovery – to treat wastewater from the brewing process." The brewery also reduced solid waste by nearly 70 percent from 1990 to 1994. In addition, the Baldwinsville brewery found markets for previous "waste" materials used in the fermentation of Anheuser-Busch beers.[60] The Anheuser-Busch Recycling Corp. recycled more than 27 billion cans in 2006, a number far greater than what was used in its own packaging. Similarly, Anheuser-Busch has set short-term goals to reduce energy consumption 5% and increasing use of renewable fuel from 8 to 15% by 2010. Along with these goals, Anheuser-Busch has succeeded in cutting down its water use by 3% since 2002.[61] Its parent company Anheuser-Busch InBev has recently announced a commitment to secure 100% of the company's purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025.[62][63]
The brewery also operates an environmental outreach program to encourage recycling, energy conservation, and habitat preservation, as well as to prevent littering and water pollution.[64] For past 18 years Anheuser-Busch employees have participated in "Green Week", which focuses on environmental conservation education for employees and their families.[65]
Anheuser-Busch states they do not use animal derived products, artificial ingredients, additives or preservatives at any stage of the brewing process or as part of the packaging in any of their range, with the exception of three Michelob products and two Bud Light products, which contain honey and shellfish respectively, and are marketed as such.[66] All other Anheuser-Busch beers are brewed using water, yeast, barley malt, hops, and additional cereal grains. Anheuser-Busch eliminates the need for isinglass finings by settling and removing particles before fermentation. The beechwood aging process also helps to attract and remove yeast from the brew before the lagering process has ended.[67][68] This only applies to the beers the company brews itself.
Budweiser Bill[edit]
In 2003, after numerous deaths in football stadiums, Brazil passed a law outlawing alcohol sales in stadiums. FIFA demanded that Brazil allow alcohol sales at the 2014 FIFA World Cup because Budweiser, a major World Cup sponsor is the "Official Beer of the FIFA World Cup", a role it has played since 1986.
In response, Brazil passed a law paving the way for alcohol sales in the World Cup, nicknamed the "Budweiser Bill".[69][70]
"Up for Whatever" beer campaign controversy[edit]
In April 2015, Anheuser-Busch, in an effort to target new, younger consumers to buy its products, the company printed a slogan on Bud Light bottles that said "The perfect beer for removing 'no' from your vocabulary for the night. #UpForWhatever."[71] The label triggered a backlash, and the company was immediately criticized by people who charged that it could be interpreted as promoting rape.[72] Alexander Lambrecht, Vice President of Anheuser-Busch, later apologized in a statement for the bottle tagline, saying that the message "missed the mark" and that they would never "condone disrespectful or irresponsible behavior."[73]
Liquor Law Violations in Seattle[edit]
The Washington State Liquor and Cannabis (WSLCB) board issued a $150,000 violation to Anheuser-Busch in May 2016. Investigators determined that Anheuser-Busch entered into an illegal agreement of exclusivity with two concert venues in Seattle – the Showbox and the Showbox SoDo.[74]
2017 Super Bowl Advertising[edit]
In early February 2017, Anheuser-Busch's "Budweiser – Born the Hard Way" Super Bowl commercial was released online, prompting conservative political rebuke over its depiction of the immigration of founder Adolphus Busch from Germany to St. Louis. Although the ad had been conceived eight months before its release, some perceived the ad to be a political statement in opposition to President Donald Trump. A week before the ad's release, public controversy erupted over an executive order prohibiting entry of immigrants, refugees, and re-entry of permanent residents from seven countries into the United States.[75] The script for the advertisement was finalized after the November elections, when Budweiser's internal marketing team settled on the twelfth revision of the script. Shooting for the commercial then took place in January.[76] The ad controversy followed after controversy in May 2016 when then Presidential candidate Donald Trump, was perceived by some to be hijacking Budweiser's 'America' branding campaign for his own political purposes.[77]

Anheuser-Busch Companies, LLC[5] /ˈænhaɪzər ˈbʊʃ/ is a brewing company based in St. Louis, Missouri USA and headquartered in Leuven, Belgium. Since 2008, it has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev)[6] which also has its North American regional management headquarters in St. Louis.[6][7]
The original Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev) was formed through successive mergers of three international brewing groups: Interbrew from Belgium, AmBev from Brazil and Anheuser-Busch. Hence, since 2008, Anheuser-Busch has been a division of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, now the world's largest brewing company.[8]
The company employs over 30,000 people, operates 12 breweries in the United States,[2] and until December 2009, was one of the largest theme park operators in the United States, with ten theme parks through the company's family entertainment division, Busch Entertainment Corporation.[9]
Anheuser-Busch InBev is the largest beer producer in the world.[10]

History[edit]
Beginnings and national expansion[edit]
In 1852, German American brewer and saloon operator George Schneider opened the Bavarian Brewery on Carondelet Avenue (later known as South Broadway) between Dorcas and Lynch streets in South St. Louis.[11] Schneider's brewery expanded in 1856 to a new brewhouse near Eighth and Crittenden streets; however, the following year financial problems forced the sale of the brewery to various owners during the late 1850s.[11] In 1860, the brewery was purchased on the brink of bankruptcy by William D'Oench, a local pharmacist, and Eberhard Anheuser, a prosperous German-born soap manufacturer.[11][12] D'Oench was the silent partner in the business until 1869, when he sold his half-interest in the company.[11] From 1860 to 1875, the brewery was known as E. Anheuser & Co., and from 1875 to 1879 as the E. Anheuser Company's Brewing Association.[11]
Adolphus Busch, a wholesaler who had immigrated to St. Louis from Germany in 1857, married Eberhard Anheuser's daughter, Lilly, in 1861. Following his service in the American Civil War, Busch began working as a salesman for the Anheuser brewery.[13] Busch purchased D'Oench's share of the company in 1869, and he assumed the role of company secretary from that time until the death of his father-in-law.[13]




Anheuser-Busch was one of the first companies to transport beer nationwide using railroad refrigerator cars.


Adolphus Busch was the first American brewer to use pasteurization to keep beer fresh; the first to use mechanical refrigeration and refrigerated railroad cars, which he introduced in 1876; and the first to bottle beer extensively.[1][14][15] By 1877, the company owned a fleet of 40 refrigerated railroad cars to transport beer.[15] Expanding the company's distribution range led to increased demand for Anheuser products, and the company substantially expanded its facilities in St. Louis during the 1870s.[16] The expansions led production to increase from 31,500 barrels in 1875 to more than 200,000 in 1881.[16]
To streamline the company's refrigerator car operations and achieve vertical integration, Busch established the St. Louis Refrigerator Car Company in 1878, which was charged with building, selling, and leasing refrigerator cars; by 1883, the company owned 200 cars, and by 1888 it owned 850.[17] To serve these cars and switch them in and out of their St. Louis brewery, Anheuser-Busch founded the Manufacturers Railway Company in 1887. The shortline operated until 2011 when Anheuser-Busch sought to shut down operations.[18]
During the 1870s, Adolphus Busch toured Europe and studied the changes in brewing methods which were taking place at the time, particularly the success of pilsner beer, which included a locally popular example brewed in Budweis.[12] In 1876, Busch introduced Budweiser, with the ambition of transcending regional tastes.[12] His company's ability to transport bottled beer made Budweiser the first national beer brand in the United States, and it was marketed as a "premium" beer.[12]
The company was renamed Anheuser-Busch Brewing Association in 1879; in 1880, Adolphus Busch became company president upon Anheuser's death.[17][19] The Busch family fully controlled the company through the generations until Anheuser-Busch's sale to InBev in 2008.[20]
During the 1880s and 1890s, Busch introduced a series of advertisements and marketing giveaways for the company, including bottle openers, calendars, corkscrews, pocketknives, postcards, and prints.[21] Among the most well-known of these giveaways was Custer's Last Fight, a lithograph print of a painting by St. Louis artist Cassilly Adams.[21] As a marketing tactic, Busch distributed thousands of copies of the print to bars in 1896,[21] the same year Anheuser-Busch introduced its new "super-premium" brand, Michelob.[22] Eventually more than one million copies of the print were produced, and it became "one of the most popular pieces of artwork in American history."[21]
At the turn of the 20th century, Anheuser-Busch continued to expand its production facilities to keep up with demand.[23] In 1905, the company built a new stockhouse in St. Louis, and by 1907 it produced nearly 1.6 million barrels of beer.[23] As demands for the prohibition of alcohol in the United States grew, Anheuser-Busch began producing non-alcoholic and low-alcoholic beverages (known as near beer); the most successful of these was Bevo, a malt beverage introduced in 1908.[23] After the death of Adolphus Busch in 1913, control of the company passed to his son, August Anheuser Busch, Sr., who continued to combat the rise of prohibitionists.[23] As part of an effort to improve the respectability of drinking, August Busch built three upscale restaurants in St. Louis during the 1910s: the Stork Inn, the Gretchen Inn (now known as the Feasting Fox), and the Bevo Mill.[23]




Anheuser-Busch produced olive-colored Budweiser cans during World War II.


Prohibition Period[edit]
As with all breweries in the country, the Temperance movement and eventual Prohibition in the United States dealt a major blow to the company in the 1910s through the 1930s. Some of the products sold by Anheuser-Busch to survive during Prohibition included brewer's yeast, malt extract, ice cream, and Bevo, a nonalcoholic malt beverage, or "near beer".[19][24]
Prohibition to Acquisition by InBev[edit]
In 1957, Anheuser-Busch became the largest brewer in the United States.
In 1981, Anheuser-Busch International, Inc., was established as a subsidiary responsible for the company's international operations and equity investments. Prior to its 2008 acquisition, Anheuser-Busch operated 15 breweries internationally: 14 in China and one in the United Kingdom.
In 1997, Chinese production of Anheuser-Busch products began after the company's purchase of a local brewery; later, the company operated both Budweiser Wuhan International Brewing Company and Harbin Brewery, which Anheuser-Busch fully acquired in 2004. In the United Kingdom, the Budweiser Stag Brewing Company produced and packaged Budweiser at the Stag Brewery in Mortlake.
At one time, Anheuser-Busch International also held investments in Grupo Modelo in Mexico[25] Tsingtao Brewery in China;[25] Anheuser-Busch also held investments in Redhook Ale Brewery of Seattle, Washington[26] and Widmer Brothers Brewery of Portland, Oregon.[26] After the 2008 acquisition, most international operations were transferred to AB InBev zones where the interests are located.
On June 12, 2008, Belgian-Brazilian brewing company InBev announced that it had made a US$46 billion offer for the company,[27] which if it was accepted would join two of the world's four largest brewing companies (based on revenue) and create a company brewing three of the highest-grossing beers in the world, namely Bud Light, Budweiser, and Skol. InBev also stated that the merger would not result in any U.S. brewery closures and they would attempt to retain management and board members from both companies.[28] On June 25, 2008, Anheuser-Busch officially announced that they would reject InBev's offer and provide a restructuring of the company to maintain shareholders and United States World Headquarters in St. Louis.[29] On July 1, 2008, InBev urged Anheuser-Busch shareholders to vote in favor of the buyout as InBev felt the offer of $65 per share should be considered a reasonable offer in view of the falling stock market. The company had previously filed suit in Delaware, after the rejection of their offer, to ensure that the stockholders could oust Anheuser-Busch's 13 board members.[30] On July 7, 2008, Anheuser-Busch filed a lawsuit against InBev to stop them from soliciting support of shareholders, stating that the company's offer is an illegal scheme. InBev was also accused of concealing that they do business in Cuba, which might have created additional obstacles to their efforts to operate in the United States.[31]
On July 13, 2008, Anheuser-Busch and InBev said they had agreed to a deal, pending shareholder and regulatory approval,[32] for InBev to purchase the American icon at $70 per share, creating a new company to be named Anheuser-Busch InBev. Anheuser-Busch would get two seats on the combined board of directors. The all-cash agreement, almost $52 billion in total equity, created the world's largest brewer, uniting the maker of Budweiser and Michelob with the producer of Beck's, Stella Artois, Hoegaarden, Leffe, Bass, Labatt and Brahma. The two companies had combined yearly sales of more than $36.4 billion, surpassing the current No. 1 brewer, London-based SABMiller.[33][34]
Grupo Modelo took inBev to arbitration for more than a year and a half after the deal was completed over whether they could block the deal.
On October 7, 2009, parent company Anheuser-Busch InBev announced plans to sell the theme parks division to The Blackstone Group for up to $2.7 Billion USD.[35]
In July 2010, a panel decided that the takeover did not violate Anheuser-Busch agreement with Modelo.[36]
Post-acquisition changes[edit]
On November 18, 2008, the hostile takeover was completed, and the parent corporation was renamed Anheuser-Busch InBev; Anheuser-Busch became a wholly owned subsidiary of the new corporation, controlled within the North America zone unit of AB InBev. By early 2009, AB InBev "turned a family-led company that spared little expense into one that is focused intently on cost-cutting and profit margins, while rethinking the way it sells beer."[37] AB InBev focused on reducing costs in the Anheuser-Busch Companies subsidiary and implemented performance-related pay,[37] along with several other changes. They immediately laid off 1,400 employees and 415 contractors,[38] sold Busch Entertainment Corporation and company-owned aircraft, lengthened accounts payable terms, and introduced zero-based budgeting.
For employees, AB InBev ended perquisites such as executive assistants for senior management, company contributions to the salaried employee pension plan, and company-provided life insurance to retirees; it also reduced the number of company-provided cell phones, taking back 1200 Blackberries;[39] and ended tuition reimbursement, and severance packages. These internal changes accompanied changes in its advertising. These cost-cutting measures rapidly reduced AB InBev's debt from $56.6 billion in 2008 to $30.1 billion at the end of 2012. When the restructuring was complete, only three senior-level Anheuser-Busch managers remained.[39]
InBev auctioned off several large assets in an effort to pay off debt to the banks that financed the merger.[40] It sold Anheuser's 27% stake in China's Tsingtao, sold a few beverage can and lid-making plants to Ball Corporation, and sold its own Korean beer business for $1.8 billion to private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis and Roberts & Co.[41]
It put the 10 theme parks in Anheuser's Busch Entertainment Unit, which included its three SeaWorlds locations, up for sale.[40]
The new company caused concern from its suppliers when it announced it would take 120 days to pay its bills rather than 30 days, taking time to use that money for other purposes.[40] The new payment policy often results in longer periods than 120 days, since the 120 days starts from the end of the month in which the invoice is 'approved' internally, which can be many days/months after an invoice is submitted.
Following the merger, perks like free tickets to St. Louis Cardinals baseball games and for Busch Gardens were taken away from employees. Anheuser-Busch stopped providing free beer to its employees and visitors to its theme parks.[40]
InBev signed a 10-year lease on 31,500 square feet of office space on Park Avenue in New York, which led to speculation that they would move Anheuser-Busch InBev North American headquarters from St Louis.[42]
In February 2013, a widely publicized lawsuit accused AB InBev[43] "watering down" products including Budweiser and Michelob. Such beers are intentionally brewed over-strength and then "watered down" to the intended level, creating a product of equal or greater quality.[44][45] The lawsuit was dismissed.[46]
Of Anheuser's top executives, only three remained in their jobs following the acquisition: Dave Peacock as president of the merged company's US division; Gary Rutledge as general counsel for the company's North American business; and Bob Golden, Anheuser's former acquisitions head, as global head of the merged company's mergers and acquisitions effort.[47]
Operations and products[edit]
Anheuser-Busch Companies operates as one of several subsidiaries in the North America zone unit of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (AB InBev) and it produces and distributes hundreds of products from the AB InBev portfolio.
On October 10, 2016 a $100 billion merger between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller closed. The new company is trading as NewbelcoSABMiller.[48]
Corporate leadership[edit]
Since 2014, João Castro Neves has been the President and CEO, North America at Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, the parent company of the U.S. operation.[49]

Brewery operations[edit]




Brewery at St. Louis






The packaging plant in St. Louis


Anheuser-Busch Companies has operated 13 breweries, all located in the United States:

St. Louis, Missouri (opened 1852)
Newark, New Jersey (opened 1951)
Van Nuys, California (opened 1954)
Tampa, Florida (opened 1959)
Houston, Texas (opened 1966)

Cartersville, Georgia (opened 1993)

The St. Louis brewery, which opened in 1852, is a National Historic Landmark District, and includes three buildings listed as National Historic Landmarks. Free public tours of the brewery are given. The tour takes visitors through the complex where they can see beer being made and packaged (not a part of the free tour, but is a part of the $10 Day Fresh Tour) in a working part of the brewery. The company keeps a rotation of its famous Budweiser Clydesdales at its headquarters, and visitors to the brewery can observe the clydesdales in their exercise field and see their places in the carriage house.
The brewery was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966.[50][51] The landmarked area includes 189 structures spread over 142 acres (57 ha), including many red brick Romanesque ones "with square crenelated towers and elaborate details."[50] The Brew House, built in 1891–1892, is particularly notable for its "multi-storied hop chandeliers, intricate iron-work, and utilization of natural light".[50]
Other operations[edit]
Aside from supply operations like brewing and packaging, Anheuser-Busch Companies includes Anheuser-Busch Wholesale Operations Divisions (WOD), Anheuser-Busch Agricultural Operations, Anheuser-Busch Recycling Corporation, Eagle Packaging, and Busch Properties, which manages subsidiary-owned property. Suppliers to Anheuser-Busch Companies include Owens-Illinois, which provides glass bottles to several Anheuser-Busch breweries. Anheuser-Busch also owns glass production facilities, such as the former Longhorn Glass, which provides glass for the Houston brewery. Anheuser-Busch Companies delivers its products to retailers through a network of more than 500 independent wholesalers and 13 wholly owned distributors.[52]
From February 20, 1953, the St. Louis Cardinals major league baseball club was owned by Anheuser-Busch.
On March 21, 1996, the club was sold to a group of private investors.
In 1966, Busch Memorial Stadium was paid for and built by the brewery and opened for business. The stadium was demolished in late 2005 and replaced by a new ballpark in 2006. Anheuser-Busch signed an agreement to retain the "Busch Stadium" name on the new building through 2025.
Up until 2009, Anheuser-Busch was also one of the largest theme park owners/operators in the United States, with ten parks throughout the country through its entertainment division, Busch Entertainment Corporation, including its 3 SeaWorld locations.
Beverage products[edit]
Main article: Anheuser-Busch brands
Anheuser-Busch Companies is responsible for the production, importation and distribution of several AB InBev products, including three company-designated global brands, Budweiser, Stella Artois, and Beck's.[2] Other multi-country brands distributed or produced by Anheuser-Busch Companies include Leffe and Hoegaarden, while local brands produced by the company include Bass Pale Ale, Bud Light, Busch Beer, Landshark Lager, Michelob, Natural Light, and Shock Top.[2] The company also produces nonalcoholic beverages, malt liquors (such as King Cobra and Hurricane), and flavored malt beverages (e.g. the Bacardi Silver family and Tequiza).[citation needed]
On Dec 22, 2015, it was announced that Anheuser-Busch would purchase up Breckenridge Brewery for an undisclosed sum.[53]
Advertising[edit]

Prior to its acquisition by InBev, the company was known in the United States for its advertising presence, including a sports marketing division which created advertising material for the Super Bowl and many other sporting events. Budweiser has sponsored horse racing events and motor sports including NASCAR, the "Miss Budweiser" racing hydroplane, and the "Budweiser King" championship top fuel dragster of Kenny Bernstein.
Since the acquisition by AB InBev, significant cuts in advertising plans have been rolled out, predicated on the belief that "changing demographics and media habits no longer require spending as much on mainstream sports events".[37]
Controversies[edit]
Spykes Underaged Alcohol Marketing[edit]
In 2007, the company introduced a flavored 12% abv malt liquor under the name Spykes. It was sold in colorful, 2-ounce bottles. Available flavors included mango, lime, melon and chocolate.[54] It was withdrawn in the same year after criticism from alcohol industry watchdog groups that it was being marketed to underage customers, and the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau found that the labeling of Spykes was illegal.[55][56][57]
Environmental Record[edit]
In 2002, the Political Economy Research Institute ranked Anheuser–Busch 40th among the "Toxic 100", a list of U.S. corporations most responsible for air pollution. The study found that Anheuser–Busch released 1,002,786 kg (2,213,657 lbs) of toxic pollutants annually into the air.[58] This is mainly because large amounts of CO2 are released during the process of fermentation.
Anheuser-Busch has received numerous awards for its efforts to reduce its impact on the environment.[59] In 1995 Anheuser-Busch's Baldwinsville brewery won an award for pollution prevention from the New York Governor for its use of a "comprehensive, energy-producing pollution-prevention system – bioenergy recovery – to treat wastewater from the brewing process." The brewery also reduced solid waste by nearly 70 percent from 1990 to 1994. In addition, the Baldwinsville brewery found markets for previous "waste" materials used in the fermentation of Anheuser-Busch beers.[60] The Anheuser-Busch Recycling Corp. recycled more than 27 billion cans in 2006, a number far greater than what was used in its own packaging. Similarly, Anheuser-Busch has set short-term goals to reduce energy consumption 5% and increasing use of renewable fuel from 8 to 15% by 2010. Along with these goals, Anheuser-Busch has succeeded in cutting down its water use by 3% since 2002.[61] Its parent company Anheuser-Busch InBev has recently announced a commitment to secure 100% of the company's purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025.[62][63]
The brewery also operates an environmental outreach program to encourage recycling, energy conservation, and habitat preservation, as well as to prevent littering and water pollution.[64] For past 18 years Anheuser-Busch employees have participated in "Green Week", which focuses on environmental conservation education for employees and their families.[65]
Anheuser-Busch states they do not use animal derived products, artificial ingredients, additives or preservatives at any stage of the brewing process or as part of the packaging in any of their range, with the exception of three Michelob products and two Bud Light products, which contain honey and shellfish respectively, and are marketed as such.[66] All other Anheuser-Busch beers are brewed using water, yeast, barley malt, hops, and additional cereal grains. Anheuser-Busch eliminates the need for isinglass finings by settling and removing particles before fermentation. The beechwood aging process also helps to attract and remove yeast from the brew before the lagering process has ended.[67][68] This only applies to the beers the company brews itself.
Budweiser Bill[edit]
In 2003, after numerous deaths in football stadiums, Brazil passed a law outlawing alcohol sales in stadiums. FIFA demanded that Brazil allow alcohol sales at the 2014 FIFA World Cup because Budweiser, a major World Cup sponsor is the "Official Beer of the FIFA World Cup", a role it has played since 1986.
In response, Brazil passed a law paving the way for alcohol sales in the World Cup, nicknamed the "Budweiser Bill".[69][70]
"Up for Whatever" beer campaign controversy[edit]
In April 2015, Anheuser-Busch, in an effort to target new, younger consumers to buy its products, the company printed a slogan on Bud Light bottles that said "The perfect beer for removing 'no' from your vocabulary for the night. #UpForWhatever."[71] The label triggered a backlash, and the company was immediately criticized by people who charged that it could be interpreted as promoting rape.[72] Alexander Lambrecht, Vice President of Anheuser-Busch, later apologized in a statement for the bottle tagline, saying that the message "missed the mark" and that they would never "condone disrespectful or irresponsible behavior."[73]
Liquor Law Violations in Seattle[edit]
The Washington State Liquor and Cannabis (WSLCB) board issued a $150,000 violation to Anheuser-Busch in May 2016. Investigators determined that Anheuser-Busch entered into an illegal agreement of exclusivity with two concert venues in Seattle – the Showbox and the Showbox SoDo.[74]
2017 Super Bowl Advertising[edit]
In early February 2017, Anheuser-Busch's "Budweiser – Born the Hard Way" Super Bowl commercial was released online, prompting conservative political rebuke over its depiction of the immigration of founder Adolphus Busch from Germany to St. Louis. Although the ad had been conceived eight months before its release, some perceived the ad to be a political statement in opposition to President Donald Trump. A week before the ad's release, public controversy erupted over an executive order prohibiting entry of immigrants, refugees, and re-entry of permanent residents from seven countries into the United States.[75] The script for the advertisement was finalized after the November elections, when Budweiser's internal marketing team settled on the twelfth revision of the script. Shooting for the commercial then took place in January.[76] The ad controversy followed after controversy in May 2016 when then Presidential candidate Donald Trump, was perceived by some to be hijacking Budweiser's 'America' branding campaign for his own political purposes.[77]

Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈɑnɦɔi̯zər ˈbuʃ ˈɪmbɛf]; abbreviated as AB InBev) is a multinational beverage and brewing company with global headquarters in Leuven, Belgium. Additional main offices are located in New York City, São Paulo, St. Louis, London, Mexico City, Johannesburg, Toronto, Buenos Aires and others.[4] The company was enlarged in October 2016 when AB InBev purchased SABMiller and concluded a merger of the two entities. It was the world's largest brewer even before the acquisition of SABMiller and is considered one of the largest fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies in the world. The estimated annual sales for the company in 2017 will be US$55 billion; prior to the merger, ABInBev had realized US$45.5 billion in revenue in 2016.[1] The company is expected to have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5] The company has recently announced a commitment to secure 100% of its purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025.[6][7]
The original AB InBev was formed through successive mergers of three international brewing groups completed in 2008: Interbrew from Belgium, AmBev from Brazil, and Anheuser-Busch from the United States. In October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev announced a successful all-cash bid to acquire multinational competitor SABMiller for £69 billion (US $107 billion). Shareholders for both companies approved the merger on 28 September 2016. The deal closed on 10 October 2016. The new entity has approximately 500 beer brands in 50 countries as of January 2017, up from the 200 that ABInBev had prior to the merger.[1][5][8]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets. The company subsequently sold the former SABMiller's interest in MillerCoors to Molson Coors, sold many of the former SABMiller's European brands to Asahi Breweries and sold much of its Coca-Cola bottling and distribution interests to the Coca-Cola Company.[9][10][11][12]
Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV is a publicly listed company, with its primary listing on the Euronext Brussels. It has secondary listings on Mexican Stock Exchange, Johannesburg Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[13]

History[edit]
AB InBev was formed following the acquisition of American brewer Anheuser-Busch by Belgian-Brazilian brewer InBev, which is a merger of AmBev and Interbrew.

Interbrew was formed in 1987 from a merger of the two largest breweries in Belgium: Artois and Piedboeuf. The Artois brewery, previously known as Den Hoorn, was established by 1366. In 1995, Interbrew expanded by acquiring Labatt Brewing Company (founded 1847), the largest brewer in Canada. In 2002 it acquired Beck's (founded 1873), the maker of the world's top selling German beer.
AmBev (short for Companhia de Bebidas das Américas, or "Beverages Company of the Americas") was created in 1999 with the merger of the two biggest Brazilian brewers, Antarctica (founded in 1880) and Brahma (founded in 1886).
Anheuser-Busch was established in 1852 in St. Louis, Missouri as Anheuser & Co

In 2004, Interbrew and AmBev merged, creating the world's largest brewer, InBev.[14] The deal was valued at $11.5 billion and combined the 3rd largest (Interbrew) and 5th largest (Ambev) brewers into the world's No.1 beermaker. The deal consolidated the top brands from Belgium, Canada, Germany and Brazil.[15]
Anheuser bought Harbin Brewery, the maker of Harbin beer in 2004 and Fujian Sedrin Brewery, the maker of Sedrin beer, in 2006, making AB InBev the No. 3 brewer in China, the world's largest beer market.[16] In 2007, subsidiary Labatt acquired Lakeport in Canada, and InBev increased its shareholding in QUINSA, strengthening the company’s foothold in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.[citation needed]
In 2008, the merger of InBev and Anheuser-Busch was completed, creating Anheuser–Busch InBev, expanding on InBev's previous status as the world's largest brewer, creating one of the top five consumer products companies in the world. Under the terms of the merger agreement, all shares of Anheuser-Busch were acquired for 70 USD per share in cash, for an aggregate of 52 billion USD.[17]
In 2013, Anheuser-Busch InBev joined leading alcohol producers as part of a producers' commitments to reducing harmful drinking.[citation needed]

Interbrew[edit]
Main article: Interbrew
After the merger in 1987, Interbrew acquired a number of local breweries in Belgium. By 1991, a second phase of targeted external growth began outside Belgium. The first transaction in this phase took place in Hungary, followed in 1995 by the acquisition of Labatt, in Canada, and then in 1999 by a joint venture with Sun in Russia.
In 2000, Interbrew acquired Bass and Whitbread in the UK, and in 2001 the company established itself in Germany, with the acquisition of Diebels. This was followed by the acquisition of Beck’s & Co., the Gilde Group and Spaten. Interbrew operated as a family-owned business until December 2000. At this point it organized an Initial Public Offering, becoming a publicly owned company trading on the Euronext stock exchange (Brussels, Belgium).
In 2002, Interbrew strengthened its position in China, by acquiring stakes in the K.K. Brewery and the Zhujiang Brewery.
AmBev[edit]
Main article: AmBev

Anheuser-Busch is the largest brewing company in the United States and employs over 30,000 people. It was the world's largest brewing company based on revenue, but third in brewing volume, before the acquisition by InBev announced 13 July 2008. The division operated 12 breweries in the United States and 17 others overseas.
Anheuser-Busch's best known beers included brands such as Budweiser, the Busch (originally known as Busch Bavarian Beer) and Michelob families, and Natural Light and Ice. The company also produced a number of smaller-volume and specialty beers, nonalcoholic brews, malt liquors (King Cobra and the Hurricane family), and flavored malt beverages (e.g., the Bacardi Silver family and Tequiza).
Anheuser-Busch was also one of the largest theme park operators in the United States with ten parks throughout the United States. In October 2009, AB InBev announced the sale of its Busch Entertainment theme park division to The Blackstone Group for $2.7 billion. The company had been investigating a sale of Busch Entertainment since the merger with AB InBev.[21][22]
InBev[edit]
Main article: InBev
InBev was the second largest brewery company in the world.[23] While its core business is beer, the company also had a strong presence in the soft drink market in Latin America. It employed about 86,000 people and was headquartered in Leuven, Belgium, where Anheuser–Busch InBev is based.
Before the merger with AmBev, Interbrew was the third largest brewing company in the world by volume, Anheuser-Busch was the largest, followed by SABMiller in second place. Heineken International was in fourth place and AmBev was the world's fifth largest brewer.
InBev employed close to 89,000 people, running operations in over 30 countries across the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. In 2007, InBev realized 14.4 billion euro of revenue.
Grupo Modelo[edit]
The company owns Grupo Modelo, Mexico's leading brewer and owner of the Corona brand as of 4 June 2013. This transaction was valued at 20.1 billion USD. To satisfy US anti-trust demands, Grupo Modelo sold its US business, including US brand rights and the Piedras Negras Brewery in Mexico, for approx. 4.75 billion USD to Constellation Brands, a competitor of AB Inbev in some beverage sectors.[24]
Additionally, the group has a 51% controlling stock on Cerveceria Nacional Dominicana through the AmBev division.
Oriental Brewery[edit]
On 1 April 2014, AB Inbev completed the re-acquisition of the Oriental Brewery (OB), which it had sold in July 2009. OB is the largest brewer in South Korea. Its CASS brand is the best-selling beer in South Korea. All beers produced by OB are brewed using rice.[25]
Bud Analytics Lab[edit]
In 2013, AB Inbev opened its Bud Analytics Lab in Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which develops data research and innovation to solve problems ranging from assortment optimization, social media, and market trends to large scale data initiatives.
Acquisition of SABMiller; formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV[edit]
Main article: SABMiller
On 13 October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev made a bid of £70 billion, (US $107 billion when the deal closed), or £44 per share, for its largest rival, SABMiller, which if approved would give the company a third of the global market share for beer sales and a half of the global profit.[26][27] The company had previously offered £38, £40, £42.15, £43.50 per share respectively, but each of these had been turned down.[28][29][30]
SABMiller accepted the bid in principle, but consummation of the deal required antitrust approval by regulatory agencies.[31] In 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had agreed to the deal only on the basis that SABMiller "spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S. — which include both Miller- and Coors-held brands — along with its Miller brands outside the U.S." The entire ownership situation was complicated: "In the United States, Coors is majority owned by MillerCoors (a subsidiary of SABMiller) and minority owned by Molson Coors, though internationally it’s entirely owned by Molson Coors, and Miller is owned by SABMiller."[32]
The merger (A-B InBev acquisition of SABMiller), closed on 10 October 2016. The new company is called Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (AB InBev), based in Leuven, Belgium and listed on Euronext (Euronext: ABI), with secondary listings on the Mexico (MEXBOL: ABI) and South Africa (JSE: ANH) stock exchanges and with American Depositary Receipts on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: BUD).[33]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets and divested itself of its interests in the MillerCoors beer company to Molson Coors.[10][11]
The new AB InBev entity is the world's largest beer company. Estimated annual sales are US$55 billion in and the company will have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5]
As per the agreement with the regulators, the former SABMiller sold to Molson Coors full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico for US$12 billion. Molson Coors also retained "the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd’s and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell." The agreement made Molson Coors the world's third largest brewer.[34]
In Canada, Molson Coors regained the right to make and market Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite from the former SABMiller.[35]
Immediately after the formation of Anheuser Busch Inbev SA/NV (AB InBev), the Company owned over 200 beer brands including Budweiser and Bud Light, Corona, Stella Artois, Beck's, Leffe, Hoegaarden, Skol, Brahma, Antarctica, Quilmes, Victoria, Modelo Especial, Michelob Ultra, Harbin, Sedrin, Klinskoye, Sibirskaya Korona, Chernigivske, Cass and Jupiler. Anheuser Busch Company also owns a soft drinks business that has bottling contracts with PepsiCo through its subsidiary, Ambev.[36] In December 2016, Coca-Cola Co. bought many of the former SABMiller's Coca Cola operations, including those in Africa.[12][37]
As part of the agreements made with regulators before Anheuser-Busch InBev was allowed to acquire SABMiller, the company sold the Peroni, Meantime and Grolsch brands to Asahi on 13 October 2016.[38][39]
After acquiring SABMiller, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV agreed on 21 December 2016 to sell the former SABMiller Ltd. business in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania to Asahi Breweries Group Holdings, Ltd. for US$7.8 billion. The deal includes popular brands such as Pilsner Urquell, Tyskie, Lech, Dreher and Ursus.[40][41]
Management team[edit]
After the formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV on 20 October 2016, the company was to be run by teams of "functional chiefs" and "zone presidents" who report to AB InBev Chief Executive Officer Carlos Brito. All but one of those 19 positions are held by people who were already ABInBev executives before the acquisition of SABMiller.[42][43]
Ownership[edit]
Anheuser-Busch InBev is controlled by Belgian families Vandamme, De Mévius and de Spoelbergh, who as of 2015 owned a combined 28.6% of the company, and billionaire Brazilian investor Jorge Paulo Lemann, Carlos Alberto Sicupira and Marcel Telles, who owned 23 percent through their private investment firm 3G Capital.[44][45]
Brands[edit]
Main article: AB InBev brands
AB InBev's brand portfolio included highly popular beer and soft-drink brands. The company classified its brands as Global Brands, International Brands, and Local Champions. The following are some of the more popular 200 brands for ABInBev prior to the merger with SABMiller on 10 October 2016.[46] The combined ABInBev/SAB Miller entity has approximately 400 beer brands as of January 2017.[5][47]

Controversies[edit]
In October 2015, the company was investigated by the Justice Department for buying beer distributors and preventing them from selling the beers of its competitors.[53]
In May 2017, the company was criticized for reportedly engaging in anti-competitive behavior after purchasing the entire supply of South African hops from SAB Hop Farms, as part of the SABMiller purchase, and making the hops unavailable to any other US craft brewers.[54] Similar anti-competitive claims were also made in association with the company's purchase of Roseville, Minnesota-based Northern Brewer, the biggest homebrew-supply chain in the country, through AB Inbev's venture arm ZX Ventures.[54]
The following month, the company was further criticized for having purchased a stake in the beer rating website RateBeer, leading to concerns that the purchase was a conflict of interest.[55]
In July 2017 the company terminates the lease with the Munich pizza place „Casa mia“, after the politician Ernst Dill vainly tried to persuade the owner to ban Pegida supporters amongst his guests. The year before Anheuser-Busch InBev already bound the owner of Casa mia by contract to interpose at any sign of political activities.[56] Though, regarding the terminated lease a company spokesperson said, that the termination of the lease was announced, timely and not politically motivated.[57]

Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈɑnɦɔi̯zər ˈbuʃ ˈɪmbɛf]; abbreviated as AB InBev) is a multinational beverage and brewing company with global headquarters in Leuven, Belgium. Additional main offices are located in New York City, São Paulo, St. Louis, London, Mexico City, Johannesburg, Toronto, Buenos Aires and others.[4] The company was enlarged in October 2016 when AB InBev purchased SABMiller and concluded a merger of the two entities. It was the world's largest brewer even before the acquisition of SABMiller and is considered one of the largest fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies in the world. The estimated annual sales for the company in 2017 will be US$55 billion; prior to the merger, ABInBev had realized US$45.5 billion in revenue in 2016.[1] The company is expected to have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5] The company has recently announced a commitment to secure 100% of its purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025.[6][7]
The original AB InBev was formed through successive mergers of three international brewing groups completed in 2008: Interbrew from Belgium, AmBev from Brazil, and Anheuser-Busch from the United States. In October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev announced a successful all-cash bid to acquire multinational competitor SABMiller for £69 billion (US $107 billion). Shareholders for both companies approved the merger on 28 September 2016. The deal closed on 10 October 2016. The new entity has approximately 500 beer brands in 50 countries as of January 2017, up from the 200 that ABInBev had prior to the merger.[1][5][8]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets. The company subsequently sold the former SABMiller's interest in MillerCoors to Molson Coors, sold many of the former SABMiller's European brands to Asahi Breweries and sold much of its Coca-Cola bottling and distribution interests to the Coca-Cola Company.[9][10][11][12]
Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV is a publicly listed company, with its primary listing on the Euronext Brussels. It has secondary listings on Mexican Stock Exchange, Johannesburg Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[13]

History[edit]
AB InBev was formed following the acquisition of American brewer Anheuser-Busch by Belgian-Brazilian brewer InBev, which is a merger of AmBev and Interbrew.

Interbrew was formed in 1987 from a merger of the two largest breweries in Belgium: Artois and Piedboeuf. The Artois brewery, previously known as Den Hoorn, was established by 1366. In 1995, Interbrew expanded by acquiring Labatt Brewing Company (founded 1847), the largest brewer in Canada. In 2002 it acquired Beck's (founded 1873), the maker of the world's top selling German beer.
AmBev (short for Companhia de Bebidas das Américas, or "Beverages Company of the Americas") was created in 1999 with the merger of the two biggest Brazilian brewers, Antarctica (founded in 1880) and Brahma (founded in 1886).
Anheuser-Busch was established in 1852 in St. Louis, Missouri as Anheuser & Co

In 2004, Interbrew and AmBev merged, creating the world's largest brewer, InBev.[14] The deal was valued at $11.5 billion and combined the 3rd largest (Interbrew) and 5th largest (Ambev) brewers into the world's No.1 beermaker. The deal consolidated the top brands from Belgium, Canada, Germany and Brazil.[15]
Anheuser bought Harbin Brewery, the maker of Harbin beer in 2004 and Fujian Sedrin Brewery, the maker of Sedrin beer, in 2006, making AB InBev the No. 3 brewer in China, the world's largest beer market.[16] In 2007, subsidiary Labatt acquired Lakeport in Canada, and InBev increased its shareholding in QUINSA, strengthening the company’s foothold in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.[citation needed]
In 2008, the merger of InBev and Anheuser-Busch was completed, creating Anheuser–Busch InBev, expanding on InBev's previous status as the world's largest brewer, creating one of the top five consumer products companies in the world. Under the terms of the merger agreement, all shares of Anheuser-Busch were acquired for 70 USD per share in cash, for an aggregate of 52 billion USD.[17]
In 2013, Anheuser-Busch InBev joined leading alcohol producers as part of a producers' commitments to reducing harmful drinking.[citation needed]

Interbrew[edit]
Main article: Interbrew
After the merger in 1987, Interbrew acquired a number of local breweries in Belgium. By 1991, a second phase of targeted external growth began outside Belgium. The first transaction in this phase took place in Hungary, followed in 1995 by the acquisition of Labatt, in Canada, and then in 1999 by a joint venture with Sun in Russia.
In 2000, Interbrew acquired Bass and Whitbread in the UK, and in 2001 the company established itself in Germany, with the acquisition of Diebels. This was followed by the acquisition of Beck’s & Co., the Gilde Group and Spaten. Interbrew operated as a family-owned business until December 2000. At this point it organized an Initial Public Offering, becoming a publicly owned company trading on the Euronext stock exchange (Brussels, Belgium).
In 2002, Interbrew strengthened its position in China, by acquiring stakes in the K.K. Brewery and the Zhujiang Brewery.
AmBev[edit]
Main article: AmBev
AmBev is a Brazilian beverages company formed by a merger in 1999 between the Brahma and Antarctica breweries. It has a dominant position in South America and the Caribbean region.[18][19][20] The subsidiary is listed on BM&F Bovespa, the São Paulo stock exchange, and on the New York Stock Exchange.
Anheuser-Busch[edit]
Main article: Anheuser-Busch
Anheuser-Busch is the largest brewing company in the United States and employs over 30,000 people. It was the world's largest brewing company based on revenue, but third in brewing volume, before the acquisition by InBev announced 13 July 2008. The division operated 12 breweries in the United States and 17 others overseas.
Anheuser-Busch's best known beers included brands such as Budweiser, the Busch (originally known as Busch Bavarian Beer) and Michelob families, and Natural Light and Ice. The company also produced a number of smaller-volume and specialty beers, nonalcoholic brews, malt liquors (King Cobra and the Hurricane family), and flavored malt beverages (e.g., the Bacardi Silver family and Tequiza).
Anheuser-Busch was also one of the largest theme park operators in the United States with ten parks throughout the United States. In October 2009, AB InBev announced the sale of its Busch Entertainment theme park division to The Blackstone Group for $2.7 billion. The company had been investigating a sale of Busch Entertainment since the merger with AB InBev.[21][22]
InBev[edit]
Main article: InBev
InBev was the second largest brewery company in the world.[23] While its core business is beer, the company also had a strong presence in the soft drink market in Latin America. It employed about 86,000 people and was headquartered in Leuven, Belgium, where Anheuser–Busch InBev is based.
Before the merger with AmBev, Interbrew was the third largest brewing company in the world by volume, Anheuser-Busch was the largest, followed by SABMiller in second place. Heineken International was in fourth place and AmBev was the world's fifth largest brewer.
InBev employed close to 89,000 people, running operations in over 30 countries across the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. In 2007, InBev realized 14.4 billion euro of revenue.
Grupo Modelo[edit]
The company owns Grupo Modelo, Mexico's leading brewer and owner of the Corona brand as of 4 June 2013. This transaction was valued at 20.1 billion USD. To satisfy US anti-trust demands, Grupo Modelo sold its US business, including US brand rights and the Piedras Negras Brewery in Mexico, for approx. 4.75 billion USD to Constellation Brands, a competitor of AB Inbev in some beverage sectors.[24]
Additionally, the group has a 51% controlling stock on Cerveceria Nacional Dominicana through the AmBev division.
Oriental Brewery[edit]
On 1 April 2014, AB Inbev completed the re-acquisition of the Oriental Brewery (OB), which it had sold in July 2009. OB is the largest brewer in South Korea. Its CASS brand is the best-selling beer in South Korea. All beers produced by OB are brewed using rice.[25]
Bud Analytics Lab[edit]
In 2013, AB Inbev opened its Bud Analytics Lab in Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which develops data research and innovation to solve problems ranging from assortment optimization, social media, and market trends to large scale data initiatives.
Acquisition of SABMiller; formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV[edit]
Main article: SABMiller
On 13 October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev made a bid of £70 billion, (US $107 billion when the deal closed), or £44 per share, for its largest rival, SABMiller, which if approved would give the company a third of the global market share for beer sales and a half of the global profit.[26][27] The company had previously offered £38, £40, £42.15, £43.50 per share respectively, but each of these had been turned down.[28][29][30]
SABMiller accepted the bid in principle, but consummation of the deal required antitrust approval by regulatory agencies.[31] In 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had agreed to the deal only on the basis that SABMiller "spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S. — which include both Miller- and Coors-held brands — along with its Miller brands outside the U.S." The entire ownership situation was complicated: "In the United States, Coors is majority owned by MillerCoors (a subsidiary of SABMiller) and minority owned by Molson Coors, though internationally it’s entirely owned by Molson Coors, and Miller is owned by SABMiller."[32]
The merger (A-B InBev acquisition of SABMiller), closed on 10 October 2016. The new company is called Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (AB InBev), based in Leuven, Belgium and listed on Euronext (Euronext: ABI), with secondary listings on the Mexico (MEXBOL: ABI) and South Africa (JSE: ANH) stock exchanges and with American Depositary Receipts on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: BUD).[33]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets and divested itself of its interests in the MillerCoors beer company to Molson Coors.[10][11]
The new AB InBev entity is the world's largest beer company. Estimated annual sales are US$55 billion in and the company will have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5]
As per the agreement with the regulators, the former SABMiller sold to Molson Coors full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico for US$12 billion. Molson Coors also retained "the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd’s and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell." The agreement made Molson Coors the world's third largest brewer.[34]
In Canada, Molson Coors regained the right to make and market Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite from the former SABMiller.[35]
Immediately after the formation of Anheuser Busch Inbev SA/NV (AB InBev), the Company owned over 200 beer brands including Budweiser and Bud Light, Corona, Stella Artois, Beck's, Leffe, Hoegaarden, Skol, Brahma, Antarctica, Quilmes, Victoria, Modelo Especial, Michelob Ultra, Harbin, Sedrin, Klinskoye, Sibirskaya Korona, Chernigivske, Cass and Jupiler. Anheuser Busch Company also owns a soft drinks business that has bottling contracts with PepsiCo through its subsidiary, Ambev.[36] In December 2016, Coca-Cola Co. bought many of the former SABMiller's Coca Cola operations, including those in Africa.[12][37]
As part of the agreements made with regulators before Anheuser-Busch InBev was allowed to acquire SABMiller, the company sold the Peroni, Meantime and Grolsch brands to Asahi on 13 October 2016.[38][39]
After acquiring SABMiller, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV agreed on 21 December 2016 to sell the former SABMiller Ltd. business in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania to Asahi Breweries Group Holdings, Ltd. for US$7.8 billion. The deal includes popular brands such as Pilsner Urquell, Tyskie, Lech, Dreher and Ursus.[40][41]
Management team[edit]
After the formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV on 20 October 2016, the company was to be run by teams of "functional chiefs" and "zone presidents" who report to AB InBev Chief Executive Officer Carlos Brito. All but one of those 19 positions are held by people who were already ABInBev executives before the acquisition of SABMiller.[42][43]
Ownership[edit]
Anheuser-Busch InBev is controlled by Belgian families Vandamme, De Mévius and de Spoelbergh, who as of 2015 owned a combined 28.6% of the company, and billionaire Brazilian investor Jorge Paulo Lemann, Carlos Alberto Sicupira and Marcel Telles, who owned 23 percent through their private investment firm 3G Capital.[44][45]
Brands[edit]
Main article: AB InBev brands
AB InBev's brand portfolio included highly popular beer and soft-drink brands. The company classified its brands as Global Brands, International Brands, and Local Champions. The following are some of the more popular 200 brands for ABInBev prior to the merger with SABMiller on 10 October 2016.[46] The combined ABInBev/SAB Miller entity has approximately 400 beer brands as of January 2017.[5][47]

Controversies[edit]
In October 2015, the company was investigated by the Justice Department for buying beer distributors and preventing them from selling the beers of its competitors.[53]
In May 2017, the company was criticized for reportedly engaging in anti-competitive behavior after purchasing the entire supply of South African hops from SAB Hop Farms, as part of the SABMiller purchase, and making the hops unavailable to any other US craft brewers.[54] Similar anti-competitive claims were also made in association with the company's purchase of Roseville, Minnesota-based Northern Brewer, the biggest homebrew-supply chain in the country, through AB Inbev's venture arm ZX Ventures.[54]
The following month, the company was further criticized for having purchased a stake in the beer rating website RateBeer, leading to concerns that the purchase was a conflict of interest.[55]
In July 2017 the company terminates the lease with the Munich pizza place „Casa mia“, after the politician Ernst Dill vainly tried to persuade the owner to ban Pegida supporters amongst his guests. The year before Anheuser-Busch InBev already bound the owner of Casa mia by contract to interpose at any sign of political activities.[56] Though, regarding the terminated lease a company spokesperson said, that the termination of the lease was announced, timely and not politically motivated.[57]

Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈɑnɦɔi̯zər ˈbuʃ ˈɪmbɛf]; abbreviated as AB InBev) is a multinational beverage and brewing company with global headquarters in Leuven, Belgium. Additional main offices are located in New York City, São Paulo, St. Louis, London, Mexico City, Johannesburg, Toronto, Buenos Aires and others.[4] The company was enlarged in October 2016 when AB InBev purchased SABMiller and concluded a merger of the two entities. It was the world's largest brewer even before the acquisition of SABMiller and is considered one of the largest fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies in the world. The estimated annual sales for the company in 2017 will be US$55 billion; prior to the merger, ABInBev had realized US$45.5 billion in revenue in 2016.[1] The company is expected to have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5] The company has recently announced a commitment to secure 100% of its purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025.[6][7]
The original AB InBev was formed through successive mergers of three international brewing groups completed in 2008: Interbrew from Belgium, AmBev from Brazil, and Anheuser-Busch from the United States. In October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev announced a successful all-cash bid to acquire multinational competitor SABMiller for £69 billion (US $107 billion). Shareholders for both companies approved the merger on 28 September 2016. The deal closed on 10 October 2016. The new entity has approximately 500 beer brands in 50 countries as of January 2017, up from the 200 that ABInBev had prior to the merger.[1][5][8]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets. The company subsequently sold the former SABMiller's interest in MillerCoors to Molson Coors, sold many of the former SABMiller's European brands to Asahi Breweries and sold much of its Coca-Cola bottling and distribution interests to the Coca-Cola Company.[9][10][11][12]
Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV is a publicly listed company, with its primary listing on the Euronext Brussels. It has secondary listings on Mexican Stock Exchange, Johannesburg Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[13]

History[edit]
AB InBev was formed following the acquisition of American brewer Anheuser-Busch by Belgian-Brazilian brewer InBev, which is a merger of AmBev and Interbrew.

Interbrew was formed in 1987 from a merger of the two largest breweries in Belgium: Artois and Piedboeuf. The Artois brewery, previously known as Den Hoorn, was established by 1366. In 1995, Interbrew expanded by acquiring Labatt Brewing Company (founded 1847), the largest brewer in Canada. In 2002 it acquired Beck's (founded 1873), the maker of the world's top selling German beer.
AmBev (short for Companhia de Bebidas das Américas, or "Beverages Company of the Americas") was created in 1999 with the merger of the two biggest Brazilian brewers, Antarctica (founded in 1880) and Brahma (founded in 1886).
Anheuser-Busch was established in 1852 in St. Louis, Missouri as Anheuser & Co

In 2004, Interbrew and AmBev merged, creating the world's largest brewer, InBev.[14] The deal was valued at $11.5 billion and combined the 3rd largest (Interbrew) and 5th largest (Ambev) brewers into the world's No.1 beermaker. The deal consolidated the top brands from Belgium, Canada, Germany and Brazil.[15]
Anheuser bought Harbin Brewery, the maker of Harbin beer in 2004 and Fujian Sedrin Brewery, the maker of Sedrin beer, in 2006, making AB InBev the No. 3 brewer in China, the world's largest beer market.[16] In 2007, subsidiary Labatt acquired Lakeport in Canada, and InBev increased its shareholding in QUINSA, strengthening the company’s foothold in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.[citation needed]
In 2008, the merger of InBev and Anheuser-Busch was completed, creating Anheuser–Busch InBev, expanding on InBev's previous status as the world's largest brewer, creating one of the top five consumer products companies in the world. Under the terms of the merger agreement, all shares of Anheuser-Busch were acquired for 70 USD per share in cash, for an aggregate of 52 billion USD.[17]
In 2013, Anheuser-Busch InBev joined leading alcohol producers as part of a producers' commitments to reducing harmful drinking.[citation needed]

Interbrew[edit]
Main article: Interbrew
After the merger in 1987, Interbrew acquired a number of local breweries in Belgium. By 1991, a second phase of targeted external growth began outside Belgium. The first transaction in this phase took place in Hungary, followed in 1995 by the acquisition of Labatt, in Canada, and then in 1999 by a joint venture with Sun in Russia.
In 2000, Interbrew acquired Bass and Whitbread in the UK, and in 2001 the company established itself in Germany, with the acquisition of Diebels. This was followed by the acquisition of Beck’s & Co., the Gilde Group and Spaten. Interbrew operated as a family-owned business until December 2000. At this point it organized an Initial Public Offering, becoming a publicly owned company trading on the Euronext stock exchange (Brussels, Belgium).
In 2002, Interbrew strengthened its position in China, by acquiring stakes in the K.K. Brewery and the Zhujiang Brewery.
AmBev[edit]
Main article: AmBev
AmBev is a Brazilian beverages company formed by a merger in 1999 between the Brahma and Antarctica breweries. It has a dominant position in South America and the Caribbean region.[18][19][20] The subsidiary is listed on BM&F Bovespa, the São Paulo stock exchange, and on the New York Stock Exchange.
Anheuser-Busch[edit]
Main article: Anheuser-Busch
Anheuser-Busch is the largest brewing company in the United States and employs over 30,000 people. It was the world's largest brewing company based on revenue, but third in brewing volume, before the acquisition by InBev announced 13 July 2008. The division operated 12 breweries in the United States and 17 others overseas.
Anheuser-Busch's best known beers included brands such as Budweiser, the Busch (originally known as Busch Bavarian Beer) and Michelob families, and Natural Light and Ice. The company also produced a number of smaller-volume and specialty beers, nonalcoholic brews, malt liquors (King Cobra and the Hurricane family), and flavored malt beverages (e.g., the Bacardi Silver family and Tequiza).
Anheuser-Busch was also one of the largest theme park operators in the United States with ten parks throughout the United States. In October 2009, AB InBev announced the sale of its Busch Entertainment theme park division to The Blackstone Group for $2.7 billion. The company had been investigating a sale of Busch Entertainment since the merger with AB InBev.[21][22]
InBev[edit]
Main article: InBev
InBev was the second largest brewery company in the world.[23] While its core business is beer, the company also had a strong presence in the soft drink market in Latin America. It employed about 86,000 people and was headquartered in Leuven, Belgium, where Anheuser–Busch InBev is based.
Before the merger with AmBev, Interbrew was the third largest brewing company in the world by volume, Anheuser-Busch was the largest, followed by SABMiller in second place. Heineken International was in fourth place and AmBev was the world's fifth largest brewer.
InBev employed close to 89,000 people, running operations in over 30 countries across the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. In 2007, InBev realized 14.4 billion euro of revenue.
Grupo Modelo[edit]
The company owns Grupo Modelo, Mexico's leading brewer and owner of the Corona brand as of 4 June 2013. This transaction was valued at 20.1 billion USD. To satisfy US anti-trust demands, Grupo Modelo sold its US business, including US brand rights and the Piedras Negras Brewery in Mexico, for approx. 4.75 billion USD to Constellation Brands, a competitor of AB Inbev in some beverage sectors.[24]
Additionally, the group has a 51% controlling stock on Cerveceria Nacional Dominicana through the AmBev division.
Oriental Brewery[edit]
On 1 April 2014, AB Inbev completed the re-acquisition of the Oriental Brewery (OB), which it had sold in July 2009. OB is the largest brewer in South Korea. Its CASS brand is the best-selling beer in South Korea. All beers produced by OB are brewed using rice.[25]
Bud Analytics Lab[edit]
In 2013, AB Inbev opened its Bud Analytics Lab in Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which develops data research and innovation to solve problems ranging from assortment optimization, social media, and market trends to large scale data initiatives.
Acquisition of SABMiller; formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV[edit]
Main article: SABMiller
On 13 October 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev made a bid of £70 billion, (US $107 billion when the deal closed), or £44 per share, for its largest rival, SABMiller, which if approved would give the company a third of the global market share for beer sales and a half of the global profit.[26][27] The company had previously offered £38, £40, £42.15, £43.50 per share respectively, but each of these had been turned down.[28][29][30]
SABMiller accepted the bid in principle, but consummation of the deal required antitrust approval by regulatory agencies.[31] In 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had agreed to the deal only on the basis that SABMiller "spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S. — which include both Miller- and Coors-held brands — along with its Miller brands outside the U.S." The entire ownership situation was complicated: "In the United States, Coors is majority owned by MillerCoors (a subsidiary of SABMiller) and minority owned by Molson Coors, though internationally it’s entirely owned by Molson Coors, and Miller is owned by SABMiller."[32]
The merger (A-B InBev acquisition of SABMiller), closed on 10 October 2016. The new company is called Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (AB InBev), based in Leuven, Belgium and listed on Euronext (Euronext: ABI), with secondary listings on the Mexico (MEXBOL: ABI) and South Africa (JSE: ANH) stock exchanges and with American Depositary Receipts on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: BUD).[33]
SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets and divested itself of its interests in the MillerCoors beer company to Molson Coors.[10][11]
The new AB InBev entity is the world's largest beer company. Estimated annual sales are US$55 billion in and the company will have an estimated global market share of 28 percent, according to Euromonitor International.[5]
As per the agreement with the regulators, the former SABMiller sold to Molson Coors full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico for US$12 billion. Molson Coors also retained "the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd’s and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell." The agreement made Molson Coors the world's third largest brewer.[34]
In Canada, Molson Coors regained the right to make and market Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite from the former SABMiller.[35]
Immediately after the formation of Anheuser Busch Inbev SA/NV (AB InBev), the Company owned over 200 beer brands including Budweiser and Bud Light, Corona, Stella Artois, Beck's, Leffe, Hoegaarden, Skol, Brahma, Antarctica, Quilmes, Victoria, Modelo Especial, Michelob Ultra, Harbin, Sedrin, Klinskoye, Sibirskaya Korona, Chernigivske, Cass and Jupiler. Anheuser Busch Company also owns a soft drinks business that has bottling contracts with PepsiCo through its subsidiary, Ambev.[36] In December 2016, Coca-Cola Co. bought many of the former SABMiller's Coca Cola operations, including those in Africa.[12][37]
As part of the agreements made with regulators before Anheuser-Busch InBev was allowed to acquire SABMiller, the company sold the Peroni, Meantime and Grolsch brands to Asahi on 13 October 2016.[38][39]
After acquiring SABMiller, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV agreed on 21 December 2016 to sell the former SABMiller Ltd. business in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania to Asahi Breweries Group Holdings, Ltd. for US$7.8 billion. The deal includes popular brands such as Pilsner Urquell, Tyskie, Lech, Dreher and Ursus.[40][41]
Management team[edit]
After the formation of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV on 20 October 2016, the company was to be run by teams of "functional chiefs" and "zone presidents" who report to AB InBev Chief Executive Officer Carlos Brito. All but one of those 19 positions are held by people who were already ABInBev executives before the acquisition of SABMiller.[42][43]
Ownership[edit]
Anheuser-Busch InBev is controlled by Belgian families Vandamme, De Mévius and de Spoelbergh, who as of 2015 owned a combined 28.6% of the company, and billionaire Brazilian investor Jorge Paulo Lemann, Carlos Alberto Sicupira and Marcel Telles, who owned 23 percent through their private investment firm 3G Capital.[44][45]
Brands[edit]
Main article: AB InBev brands
AB InBev's brand portfolio included highly popular beer and soft-drink brands. The company classified its brands as Global Brands, International Brands, and Local Champions. The following are some of the more popular 200 brands for ABInBev prior to the merger with SABMiller on 10 October 2016.[46] The combined ABInBev/SAB Miller entity has approximately 400 beer brands as of January 2017.[5][47]

Controversies[edit]
In October 2015, the company was investigated by the Justice Department for buying beer distributors and preventing them from selling the beers of its competitors.[53]
In May 2017, the company was criticized for reportedly engaging in anti-competitive behavior after purchasing the entire supply of South African hops from SAB Hop Farms, as part of the SABMiller purchase, and making the hops unavailable to any other US craft brewers.[54] Similar anti-competitive claims were also made in association with the company's purchase of Roseville, Minnesota-based Northern Brewer, the biggest homebrew-supply chain in the country, through AB Inbev's venture arm ZX Ventures.[54]
The following month, the company was further criticized for having purchased a stake in the beer rating website RateBeer, leading to concerns that the purchase was a conflict of interest.[55]
In July 2017 the company terminates the lease with the Munich pizza place „Casa mia“, after the politician Ernst Dill vainly tried to persuade the owner to ban Pegida supporters amongst his guests. The year before Anheuser-Busch InBev already bound the owner of Casa mia by contract to interpose at any sign of political activities.[56] Though, regarding the terminated lease a company spokesperson said, that the termination of the lease was announced, timely and not politically motivated.[57]
