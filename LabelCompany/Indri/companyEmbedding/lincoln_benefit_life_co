 Annuities

	Enjoy your retirement





A good retirement income plan should generate two to three decades of sustainable income. It can help protect your assets from inflation, market volatility and savings withdrawal rates.
What is an annuity?
An annuity is an insurance product designed for retirement to help protect your financial future and guard against outliving your savings. An annuity pays you periodic income payments for as long as you live in exchange for a premium and it’s designed to be part of an overall retirement strategy. Annuity types offer different features and payment options to help meet your needs and priorities. Compare your options.
Annuities offer many additional benefits to help you prepare for the future, such as:  

No annual contribution limit
Ability to diversify and potentially grow your investments
Tax-deferred investment income until it’s withdrawn
Death benefit protection for beneficiaries
Optional riders (for an additional cost). Review our rider options.

To decide if a variable annuity is right for you, consider that its value will fluctuate; it’s subject to investment risk and possible loss of principal; and there are costs associated.
If you have questions or for more information on annuities, contact an advisor. 
Tax considerations
Annuities allow money to grow tax-deferred until clients begin taking payments. While consumers can’t control state and federal tax rates or policies they can take steps to help protect savings and income from tax erosion, and improve spending power in retirement. 

Find out why tax planning for retirement is so important.

 Life insurance

	Part of a solid financial plan





Life insurance provides protection for you and your loved ones, while also helping preserve your wealth or supplement your retirement income.
Protection as part of your plan 
Taking care of your family and protecting them from unforeseen events should be an important part of any long-term financial plan. We recognize the important role life insurance can play in protecting not just your assets, but also your family. To help secure what matters most to you, we offer a range of solutions that provide choice, flexibility and coverage options:

Term life insurance for temporary coverage
Universal life insurance for more flexible coverage
Variable universal life insurance for flexible coverage with the addition of growth potential

It’s more than just a death benefit
Beyond providing a guaranteed benefit to your family in the event of death, life insurance can also offer you:

Financial protection for your loved ones or business
Income replacement
Supplemental retirement income
Account value growth to use as a financial resource
Tax-deferred asset protection and accumulation
An efficient means of transferring wealth
A source of funding for business owners

   















Have you ever wondered if purchasing life insurance was the right decision for you? Learn how it can provide for your family not only in the future, but throughout your life.

















Learn about all of the benefits that come along with purchasing life insurance sooner rather than later.

Credit Ratings
Lincoln Benefit Life Company (LBL) has an interactive relationship with Standard & Poor’s and A.M. Best rating agencies for financial strength and counterparty credit.
Insurer financial strength ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding the ability of an insurance company to pay obligations under insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms, and are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in LBL.
Credit ratings are opinions of each agency with respect to specific securities and contractual financial obligations and the issuer’s ability and willingness to meet those obligations when due.
Neither insurer financial strength nor credit ratings are statements of fact nor are they recommendations to purchase, hold or sell any security, contract or policy. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
For more information about a particular rating, please visit the website of the relevant rating agency.

About us 
Since 1938, Lincoln Benefit Life has been a strong leader in the life insurance and annuities financial industry. On April 1, 2014 Resolution Life acquired LBL, after receiving all required regulatory approvals. Resolution Life is a specialty U.S. life insurance company with institutional investors, such as life companies and pension funds with a long-term investment outlook.
In connection with the acquisition, LBL obtained direct ownership and control of assets and reserves previously held by its parent company. This allows LBL to fulfill its commitments to its policyholders and remain in compliance with capital requirements under applicable law. LBL will continue to be domiciled in Nebraska and to be regulated by the Nebraska Department of Insurance. LBL also continues to participate in the guaranty association system, which provides an added layer of security to policyholders.
LBL cannot and will not change the terms of your policy or any guaranteed elements. Your contract is still with LBL. Having a customer-focused philosophy means we are committed to providing a high level of service and safeguarding our customers’ investments.
If you have any questions about the sale, please view our Frequently Asked Questions. If after reading the FAQs you still have questions, please contact us.

Lincoln Benefit Life 
Resolution Life has completed the process of acquiring Lincoln Benefit Life Company (“LBL”) from Allstate Life Insurance Company. Ownership of LBL was transferred on April 1, 2014 to Resolution Life after approval was received from the Nebraska Department of Insurance.
Insurance policies and contracts sold by LBL through the independent brokerage channel will remain fully supported by LBL. Those policies and contracts sold through the Allstate Financial agency system will be reinsured to and supported by Allstate Life Insurance Company. In 2006, the variable annuity contracts sold by LBL were reinsured by Prudential Life Insurance Company of America and will continue to be supported by Prudential. More information regarding the regulatory approval process may be found on the following website: Nebraska Department of Insurance.
For more information on Lincoln Benefit Life, see the Frequently Asked Questions.
Policyholders
What does this mean for policyholders?
For the majority of policyholders, very little will change. Policies will continue to be held with LBL and policies that are re-insured back to Prudential or Allstate will be serviced by Prudential or Allstate.
Resolution Life and Allstate Life Insurance Company have agreed to a Transitional Agreement whereby Allstate will continue to provide service to the policyholders for 12-to-18 months. After the transition period, policy service and administration will be provided by industry-leading third-party administrators under the direction of LBL’s management. Before any changes are made, LBL will write to brokers and policyholders.
Will policies be safe?
LBL will continue to be regulated by the Nebraska Department of Insurance. Resolution Life is committed to serving its policyholders and their families with dependable, high-quality service and will comply with all regulatory requirements, such as capital requirements and investment restrictions. LBL will continue to be covered by the same financial guarantee associations as prior to the acquisition.
Will policyholders continue to have privacy protection?
LBL is a U.S.-domiciled insurer and, as such, U.S. privacy laws continue to apply to it. Privacy is very important to Resolution Life and it will maintain safeguards to ensure the privacy of its policyholders.
Will we have a facility to contact? Will we be able to get access to information to service?
Yes, there will be no changes in this regard. LBL will retain its existing name while its parent company will become Resolution Life. The current telephone numbers will also remain the same. If these should change in the future, all agents and policyholders will be advised of the new number.
 
Policyholder Service
Where will in-force business be serviced?
Allstate Life Insurance Company will continue to service in-force LBL business sold through the independent brokerage channel using its current operations in Lincoln and Chicago during the 12-to-18 month transition period when administration is transitioned to Resolution Life.
After this transition period, LBL will provide a similar service through its chosen third-party policyholder service administrator. Resolution Life has committed that much of this will be delivered from Nebraska.
Will we have access to in-force forms and what kind of support will be provided?
You will have online access to forms, as well as be able to contact us by phone and mail during the period when Allstate transitions business to Resolution Life. LBL will provide the same service after the transition period, but  access will be provided via an LBL website rather than via accessallstate.com.
 
Brokers
What does this mean for Independent Brokers?
While brokers will no longer be able to sell LBL products, existing policyholders who purchased policies through the independent brokerage channel will continue to receive the high quality of service to which they are accustomed. As a servicing agent, you can continue to look after your clients’ needs. In addition, current commission arrangements will remain in place.
Will I still be able to access current accounts?
Selling agencies will remain the agent of record and their organizations will continue to have access to policyholder information in the same way they have access today. You will remain a servicing agent for the lifetime of the policies.
What changes can I expect?
During the transitional period, we expect it to be very much business as usual. As we move to our chosen third-party administrator, there may be some changes regarding contact numbers. We will inform you of that change when we have confirmed it.
Will brokers continue to receive the same renewal and commission fees? Will their contracts be the same as they are today?
There will be no change to the renewal commissions. While brokers will no longer be able to sell LBL products, all contractual terms will remain the same.
 
Regulatory
Will LBL be governed by state insurance rules? Will its primary regulator still be the Nebraska Department of Insurance?
LBL is domiciled in Nebraska and is subject to regulation by the Nebraska Department of Insurance. Resolution Life has no intention to re-domesticate LBL to another state. Even though LBL will no longer be selling new policies, LBL intends to maintain its licenses in all states in which it is currently licensed. As a licensed company, LBL will be considered an admitted insurer.
Regulatory approval is required for Resolution Life’s acquisition of LBL. Resolution Life is working with Allstate Life Insurance Company and the Nebraska Department of Insurance and expects the transaction to close following customary regulatory approval.
 
General
Where are Resolution Life’s U.S. offices located?
Resolution Life will have offices in Chicago, IL, Lincoln, NE and Stamford, CT.
Why was Resolution Life chosen to acquire LBL?
When Allstate made the decision to sell LBL, they looked for buyers that demonstrated the following critical criteria: established quality of service, integrity and financial strength, a fair price and demonstrated willingness to work with Allstate during a transition period to ensure there was no gap in product availability for Allstate policyholders. Resolution Life met those criteria.
Please refer to the About Us sections of Resolutionlife.com for further background on Resolution Life.
What is the financial strength of Resolution Life?
Resolution Life has established a permanent capital structure that aligns its long-term commitment to the U.S. market with the investment horizon of its leading institutional investors and the duration of underlying life insurance policies. The company is supported by significant investor commitments.
Lincoln Benefit Life’s capitalization level is subject to regulatory approvals. Resolution Life has engaged in a rating process with at least one major rating agency.

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.

                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'

                            about the business.

All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
