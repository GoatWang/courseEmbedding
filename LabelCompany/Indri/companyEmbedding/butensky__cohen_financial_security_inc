BLACK DIAMOND CLIENT PORTAL FAQ - B&C Financial Advisors
































Javascript must be enabled for the correct page display

Menu

facebookfacebook linkedinin 









BLACK DIAMOND CLIENT PORTAL FAQ What is the difference between NetXInvestor and the Black Diamond Client Portal?
The difference is that the Black Diamond portal will show your account here at B&C in a format that closely mirrors our Quarterly Reports. That is to say the portal is much easier to view, and understand how your money is invested, and also includes historical performance. The portal also has a “Document Vault” where we will upload documents you might need (including Quarterly Reports), and this vault can also be used by you to upload documents to us.
In a nut shell, the Black Diamond Portal is more user-friendly and works on all types of devices (phones, tablets, etc.). The only thing NetXInvestor has that the Portal does not are the monthly brokerage statements, trade confirmations, and end-of-year tax information.
How do I enroll for access to the Black Diamond Client Portal?
You may contact our office by phone or email to info@bandcfinancial.com with your preferred email address. From there, you will receive an email from noreply@bdreporting.com containing your username and a link to complete the setup process. A complete step-by-step tutorial can be found here.
What if I forget my username or password? Will I have to go through the entire setup process again?
On the login screen there will be a link that says, “Trouble logging in?”.  Click on the link and select the appropriate option in the drop-down (Forgot username, Forgot Password). If you forgot your password, you will need to enter your username when prompted and you will then be sent an email to reset your password. If you forgot your username, you will simply enter your email address and you will be sent an email containing your username. Neither of these options will completely reset everything and force you to start over.
Why has my user account been locked? How do I unlock it?
After entering an incorrect username/password combination three times, the user account will be locked as a security precaution. 
Unlocking your account is just as simple as resetting your password. Click on the “Trouble logging in?” link and select the appropriate option in the drop-down (Unlock account). You will then need to enter your username when prompted and you will be sent an email to reset your password.
