Contact Us
Glossary































The future of precision medicine
By pairing companion imaging agents with small molecule drug conjugates (SMDCs), Endocyte can provide a more accurate picture of a patient’s disease status—and treatment prognosis.  Learn more




Endocyte strives for precision in medicine
Our treatment philosophy is based on precision—targeting the right patient, the right disease, and the right cells.  Learn more





Our goal is to identify the patients most likely to benefit from treatment
Our technology allows us to create companion imaging agents intended for use with each of our small molecule drug conjugates (SMDCs.) To create our companion imaging agents, we replace the drug payload of the SMDC with an imaging agent (radionuclide) that can be viewed with widely available nuclear imaging equipment.
Learn More




Endocyte SMDC technology in action
Endocyte’s SMDC technology utilizes a targeted approach to treat cancer, wherein specific receptors on diseased cells are exploited as an uptake and internalization mechanism to effectively deliver highly potent drugs into solid tumors.



Watch video




Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell therapy (CAR T)
The promising CAR T immuno-oncology approach harnesses the therapeutic power of a patient’s own immune system to fight their cancer.  In an effort to improve the application of this strategy, Endocyte is leveraging its SMDC expertise in a unique way to make possible the engineering of a single universal CAR T-cell to treat multiple cancers.  



Watch video




PRO-PBD TAM Killer
Endocyte’s new ProPBD SMDC employs a highly potent DNA-reactive drug to attack cancer from two directions, by targeting not just the cancer cells, but also the cells that have been recruited by the tumor to support its growth.  These supportive cells are known as tumor-associated macrophages, or TAMs, and they allow tumors to form new blood vessels, avoid immune detection, metastasize, and grow.  The high expression of the folate receptor on cancer cells and TAMs provides a targeted therapeutic advantage, and a novel opportunity for a single SMDC to treat cancer with a powerful dual mechanism of action.

Corporate Profile

	Endocyte is a biopharmaceutical company and leader in developing targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer and other serious diseases. Endocyte uses its proprietary drug conjugation technology to create novel SMDCs and companion imaging agents for personalized targeted therapies. The company’s SMDCs actively target receptors that are over-expressed on diseased cells relative to healthy cells. This targeted approach is designed to enable the treatment of patients with highly active drugs at greater doses, delivered more frequently and over longer periods of time than would be possible with the untargeted drug alone. The companion imaging agents are designed to identify patients whose disease over-expresses the target of the therapy and who are therefore more likely to benefit from treatment.

Endocyte technology has the potential for broad application
Our technology has the potential to treat the types of cancers found in over 40% of cancer patients worldwide.1
Using our flexible SMDC technology platform, we are also developing precision therapies for other cancer-cell receptors and diseases. One of our imaging agents, EC0652, is being developed to non-invasively identify tumors that overexpress prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) receptors, and is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 trial for patients with advanced prostate cancer.
An engine for new drug development
With the advent of an innovative form of delivery, more research and development can focus on new potent cytotoxic drugs.
What’s more, our modular technology is being studied with different drugs or a combination of drugs in a variety of diseases, allowing for potential expansion into lower-expressing cancer indications.
Our pipeline and the future of precision medicine
One SMDC is now in a clinical trial and is a prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted drug. Each targeted therapeutic is also paired with an imaging agent that is designed to identify the patients most likely to benefit from treatment.
* The safety and efficacy of these agents have not been established. There is no guarantee that the agents will receive regulatory approval and become commercially available for the uses being investigated.

The Endocyte Drug Development Process
Precision medicine at work
The Endocyte drug-development engine is designed with the goal of producing many precision drugs across disease categories. Our unique drug development process involves three steps designed to maximize development success and reduce clinical risk.










Step 1: Validate the Target Receptor
Our process begins by screening diseased cells for unique receptors. After identifying a receptor, we design a targeting ligand that binds with high affinity to the target receptor. The targeting ligand is then attached to a radionuclide to create a companion imaging agent whose biologic activity can be viewed with widely available nuclear imaging equipment.
The companion imaging agent enables testing in preclinical animal models and humans to find out whether the SMDC targets the diseased cells and not normal cells. Etarfolatide, our folate receptor companion imaging agent, has demonstrated targeting in cancer and other diseases.
Step 2: Build a Pipeline of Precision Therapies
Once the targeting ligand has been validated in humans, a variety of highly active therapeutic molecules are screened. We look for highly active drugs with dose-limiting toxicities.
After a drug is identified, we attach it to the validated targeting ligand and compare it to the free drug in in vitro and in vivo models. If the SMDC is better than the free drug in terms of efficacy and safety, it is advanced into the clinic. By repeating this process for each drug, we aim to build a pipeline of unique precision drugs with potentially superior safety and efficacy.
Step 3: Identify Patients Likely to Respond
The final step is to use companion imaging agents to identify patients likely to respond to a targeted therapy. These companion imaging agents use the same targeting ligands and modular structure as the SMDC and are incorporated into all of our clinical studies to determine whether each patient is an appropriate candidate for the therapeutic drug.

Endocyte stock plummets 30% on news of major workforce reduction; clinical trial changes
Endocyte Inc.  stock plummeted 30.4% in premarket trade Friday after the company said it plans a "strategic restructuring" that includes an about 40% reduction in its workforce and clinical trial changes, including ending enrollment in one trial. The company plans to terminate 47 employees, largely in the third quarter, and said it expects total restructuring costs of about $2.4 million, including severance, clinical trial termination charges and other costs. "The company is continuing to review the potential impact of the restructuring, and is unable to estimate any additional restructuring costs or charges at this time," the company said in its 8-K financial filing on Friday. Endocyte said it is stopping enrollment in a trial for its EC1456 trial, though it will continue to enroll a small number of patients in the compound's ovarian cancer surgical study. The company will also pare down the number of patients in an early-stage trial for its EC1169 compound for taxane-exposed metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, excluding patients who are new to treatment. Endocyte said it will continue developing its chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T-cell) SMDC adaptor platform and its dual-targeted DNA crosslinker drug EC2629. Endocyte shares closed at $2.73 on Thursday. Shares have risen 16.2% over the last three months, compared with a 2% rise in the S&P 500 .

Endocyte stock plummets 30% on news of major workforce reduction; clinical trial changes
Endocyte Inc.  stock plummeted 30.4% in premarket trade Friday after the company said it plans a "strategic restructuring" that includes an about 40% reduction in its workforce and clinical trial changes, including ending enrollment in one trial. The company plans to terminate 47 employees, largely in the third quarter, and said it expects total restructuring costs of about $2.4 million, including severance, clinical trial termination charges and other costs. "The company is continuing to review the potential impact of the restructuring, and is unable to estimate any additional restructuring costs or charges at this time," the company said in its 8-K financial filing on Friday. Endocyte said it is stopping enrollment in a trial for its EC1456 trial, though it will continue to enroll a small number of patients in the compound's ovarian cancer surgical study. The company will also pare down the number of patients in an early-stage trial for its EC1169 compound for taxane-exposed metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, excluding patients who are new to treatment. Endocyte said it will continue developing its chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T-cell) SMDC adaptor platform and its dual-targeted DNA crosslinker drug EC2629. Endocyte shares closed at $2.73 on Thursday. Shares have risen 16.2% over the last three months, compared with a 2% rise in the S&P 500 .

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
