Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Advisory services
Many organizations like yours find it challenging to oversee their portfolio while also managing the day-to-day responsibilities of running their endowment, foundation, or charitable organization. But partnering with a provider who understands your needs can help you better balance these competing priorities.
Partnering with your organization
Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services® (VIAS) offers nonprofits the considerable resources of a large investment firm like Vanguard with the customized service of a specialized boutique. When your organization partners with VIAS, you work with a team of investment professionals that has your objectives and fiduciary responsibilities in mind. VIAS strives to:

Understand your organization's mission, spending needs, and unique situation and offer sophisticated, unbiased advice.
Develop a low-cost portfolio customized to your organization's needs.
Relieve your staff of many of the day-to-day burdens of investment program management.

OCIO: One service, many names


One approach nonprofits are increasingly considering is an outsourced chief investment officer (OCIO). An OCIO service—which is a key offering of Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services—acts as an extension of the board and investment staff. The OCIO determines an asset allocation strategy, selects investment advisors to implement it, and manages its operation and execution. Investment providers and clients call this service a variety of names, including discretionary management, advisory services, and investment management.





Investing and advising
Optimizing your portfolio to meet your long-term investment objectives requires time and skill. VIAS helps you develop a tailored portfolio that ensures your investments are diversified, risk-appropriate, and aligned with your overall strategy.
Our comprehensive advisory services include:









Portfolio construction 

Asset allocation analysis that uses a distinct, proprietary model to deliver solutions based on your portfolio needs.
Investment policy consulting designed to meet the unique investment goals of your organization.
Customized product selection that focuses on low-cost index and active investments.











Portfolio management

Performance reporting to help keep your investment committee informed.
Investment reviews that provide insights into your portfolio and the broader market and economic environment.
Steadfast commitment to risk management and process excellence through ongoing portfolio monitoring and rebalancing.








Research & expertise

Investment expertise and commentary on financial issues that provide context for your decision-making.
Investment committee best practices that are designed to increase your group's effectiveness.





Notes:

Advice services offered through Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services are provided by Vanguard Advisers, Inc., a registered investment advisor.
All investments are subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. 
Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market.

…it’s a small difference that makes all the difference




Mebane Faber,
Chief Investment Officer and Portfolio Manager




Cambria Digital Advisor is not a “roboadvisor.” We’re people-powered.
Most automated investment services rely on passive, buy-and-hold portfolios. While a good start, we believe you can do far better.




That’s why our professionals start with buy-and-hold, but then apply active strategies too.
Historical market data suggests this could help make a substantial difference in your portfolio’s returns, volatility, and drawdowns.

The Trinity Portfolio – An Investing Framework Tailored to You




“Trinity” is the framework for all our Cambria Digital Advisor portfolios.
The name reflects the three pillars of its approach: globally-diversified assets, weightings toward value and momentum investments, and active trend following.
Though all Trinity Portfolios contain each element, we customize the exact amounts to reflect different goals and risk tolerances. It’s exceptional investing on your terms.
So which Trinity Portfolio is right for me?

Better performance starts with The Trinity Portfolio™




Cambria’s “Trinity” portfolio is named for our three core investing strategies:
1) Global market exposure, 2) Weightings toward value investments exhibiting positive momentum, 3) Active trend-following overlays.




While your Trinity Portfolio will contain each element, the specific amount will be customized to your personal goals.
It’s world-class investing on your terms.

What we believe
It’s simple. Our job is to serve you.




At Cambria, we believe everyone should have access to fair and thoughtful investment solutions. We believe fees matter, so we serve you best by helping keep more of your dollars in your own pocket.

How we’re different
Better research. Smarter strategies. Superior investing.





At Cambria, we’re “quants.” This simply means we often spend our days deep in historical market data. We test it, use our findings to create investing models, re-test, improve…
It’s a detailed process, yet one we believe yields better long-term results for our clients. That’s because all our analysis leads to effective, rules-based strategies that eliminate emotional decision-making.





Nearly every investor would agree that emotions are often our own worst enemy. But our rules-based systems provide us valuable protection against those emotions. We believe they’re a framework for good investing, preventing our short-term impulses from derailing our long-term gains.
So what makes Cambria different? The belief that better research and deeper understanding leads to smarter strategies and superior investing.

All About Our Trinity Portfolios
“How many Trinity Portfolios are there? And how do I know which one is right for me?”
Fortunately, the answers are simple.
In order to meet the varying investing preferences of our clients, we offer six unique Trinity Portfolios. You might think of them as sitting along a continuum, ranging from most conservative (Trinity 1) to most aggressive (Trinity 6).
All six portfolios are similar in that they share the same foundational building blocks of our Trinity strategy: 1) assets diversified across a global investment set, 2) tilts toward investments exhibiting value and momentum traits, and 3) exposure to trend following.
The differences between the portfolios stem from how much of each building block you’ll find in each specific portfolio. In other words:

What’s the specific asset mix in any given portfolio?
How much exposure to trend following is in any given portfolio?





The Differences in Our Six Trinity Portfolios
On the conservative end of our continuum (Trinity 1), you’ll find the asset mix dominated by bonds, an asset that, historically, can be less-volatile. As to the second question above, Trinity 1 contains the least exposure to trend following, and instead, is more of a buy-and-hold portfolio.
Investors who prefer Trinity 1 are likely more conservative in nature, focused less on maximizing returns and more on minimizing portfolio volatility.
On the aggressive end of our continuum (Trinity 6), you’ll find the asset mix dominated by stocks, an asset that, historically, can be more volatile yet able to generate greater gains. Trinity 6 also contains the greatest exposure to trend following.
Investors who prefer Trinity 6 are likely more aggressive in nature, preferring to target greater returns even though they may be accompanied by increased portfolio volatility.
Trinity Portfolios 2 – 5 fill in the continuum from conservative to aggressive. The version we highlight in our Trinity Portfolio research paper most closely resembles Trinity 4. (We encourage you to read this paper if you haven’t done so. You can download it by clicking here.)
If you’re interested in additional information on each Trinity portfolio in order to help you make the right investment choice, we’ll provide more data below. But please know that this isn’t a decision you’ll need to make alone.
You see, our sign-up sequence will ask you a handful of questions designed to help us steer you toward the right Trinity portfolio. Additionally, we’ll share a short phone call with you as you open your account to make sure your specific Trinity portfolio matches your investing goals and style.
That said, below are more details explaining the differences between our six Trinity Portfolios; specifically, the approximate allocations we expect over time. Please take into account that these are averages, and since our portfolios are dynamic, the exact amount will shift.
We’ll start with a chart that compares all six Trinity portfolio for easy side-by-side comparison.
Here’s another way of viewing the same information that’s a bit more visual.




The Allocations of Our Six Trinity Portfolios
Below is a graphical breakdown of each Trinity Portfolio’s asset allocation. The stated percentage of “stocks,” “bonds,” and “real assets” represents the amount of each asset class you’ll find in the portfolios on a fixed “buy-and-hold” basis.
Please note that the “Trend Following” category is also comprised of “stocks,” “bonds,” and “real assets.” However, because trend is an active, dynamic strategy, each Trinity portfolio may allocate more or less to the respective asset classes given market conditions. It’s a fluid, responsive allocation. Therefore, for our purposes here, we present only the total percentage of trend-exposed assets you’ll find in each respective Trinity portfolio.








Trinity 1:
Stocks: 10%
Bonds: 66%
Real Assets: 3%
Trend Following: 20%








Trinity 2:
Stocks: 16%
Bonds: 50%
Real Assets: 5%
Trend Following: 30%








Trinity 3:
Stocks: 21%
Bonds: 33%
Real Assets: 6%
Trend Following: 40%








Trinity 4:
Stocks: 25%
Bonds: 17%
Real Assets: 8%
Trend Following: 50%








Trinity 5:
Stocks: 20%
Bonds: 12%
Real Assets: 6%
Trend Following: 61%








Trinity 6:
Stocks: 15%
Bonds: 7%
Real Assets: 4%
Trend Following: 74%

			What is the relationship between Cambria Investment Management and Cambria Digital Advisor?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2016-10-28T15:35:14+00:00		
What is the relationship between Cambria Investment Management and Cambria Digital Advisor?Our company is “Cambria Investment Management.” We’re proud to offer many investing products and services to meet the varying needs of our clients, which include individual investors, institutions, and registered investment advisors. Our “Cambria Digital Advisor” service is our managed investment account service for individual investors. Click here to lean more about a Cambria Digital Advisor account.


			Why did you pick Betterment as your partner?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2016-10-28T15:35:14+00:00		
Why did you pick Betterment as your partner?As a fiduciary, Cambria’s major concern is “how do we best serve our clients?” While we believe our investing approach is the best market strategy for serving our clients, we partnered with Betterment as we believe their operational and technological platforms make trading, rebalancing, and tax loss harvesting simple and efficient. Furthermore, we believe Betterment’s intuitive, beautiful client interface is superior to that of any other current offering.


			But Betterment offers investing portfolios. Does that make them a competitor?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2016-09-01T11:21:18+00:00		
But Betterment offers investing portfolios. Does that make them a competitor?The asset management business is a $30 trillion+ industry, and most of the low-cost automated investment solutions (such as Betterment) are far better than other options on the market today because of their much lower fees. For instance, many mutual funds and advisors still charge over 2% a year.  While our investing philosophy is different than that of Betterment’s, we think both solutions are reasonable. We’ve recommended Betterment in the past and find them to be a great partner.


			Can I move my current Betterment account to Cambria?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2016-10-28T15:35:14+00:00		
Can I move my current Betterment account to Cambria?Sure. Email Betterment support at support@Betterment.com to get the process started.  Since you will not be going through the normal onboarding process, we will send you the Cambria client agreements, ADV Part 2A, and Privacy Policy – no signature needed, just an email confirm that you received them.


			If I move my Betterment account to Cambria, will it be a taxable event?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2016-09-01T11:22:11+00:00		
If I move my Betterment account to Cambria, will it be a taxable event?If your assets with Betterment are held in a taxable account, then yes.


			I’m an independent advisor. Can I invest using the Trinity Portfolio on the Betterment platform?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2017-01-18T10:59:28+00:00		
I’m an independent advisor. Can I invest using the Trinity Portfolio on the Betterment platform?No. However, we are currently working with Envestnet to offer our Trinity portfolios to advisors on its platform.  We expect this offering to be available sometime in Q1 2017, and will send out an announcement when it is available.  Please keep in mind, you can always replicate the six Trinity allocations in your own practice. We publish the underlying assets found in each Trinity portfolio, as well as the specific allocation amount of each holding, here on this website in on our “Our Portfolios” tab.

			If Cambria charges a 0% management fee, how does it make money?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2016-09-01T11:35:45+00:00		
If Cambria charges a 0% management fee, how does it make money?We construct our six Trinity portfolios with what we believe are the best ETFs in the market. Some of these ETFs come from respected providers such as Vanguard, while others are our own (Cambria’s). Whether from Cambria or an outside provider, these ETFs have related expense ratios. Therefore, Cambria generates revenues from the underlying expense ratios of its own ETFs. Cambria’s average underlying ETF fee is 0.54%.


			What is the minimum balance required to open an account?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2016-07-05T12:03:07+00:00		
What is the minimum balance required to open an account?To open an account, we require an initial account balance of $100,000.


			Can your portfolio minimum investment be spread over more than one account?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2016-09-05T11:21:27+00:00		
Can your portfolio minimum investment be spread over more than one account?Yes. The $100,000 minimum is an aggregate amount. You can open accounts with smaller balances as long as your total investment with Cambria across all your accounts totals a minimum of $100,000.


			How do I know which Trinity Portfolio is right for me?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2016-10-28T15:35:14+00:00		
How do I know which Trinity Portfolio is right for me?The right Trinity Portfolio for you will depend primarily upon your investment goals and your personal risk tolerance. Our six unique Trinity portfolios range from most conservative (Trinity 1) to most aggressive (Trinity 6). To read more about each individual Trinity portfolio, just click here. In addition, one of our advisors will share a short phone call with you upon opening your account in order to answer any questions you have, and make sure you’re in the correct Trinity portfolio to match your investing needs.


			How many Trinity Portfolios are there?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2016-07-28T11:05:49+00:00		
How many Trinity Portfolios are there?We offer six different Trinity portfolios, ranging from most conservative (Trinity 1) to most aggressive (Trinity 6). You can read more about the different portfolios by clicking here.


			How do I change my portfolio’s allocation?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2016-10-28T15:35:14+00:00		
How do I change my portfolio’s allocation?We work together with clients to build a strategic asset allocation with which they’re comfortable. If a client wants to discuss their portfolio and any potential changes, we’re happy to schedule a call or meeting for such a review. However, clients cannot alter their portfolio themselves prior to this discussion, as this often allows for emotional behavior that negatively affects returns. (However, a client can always terminate the Cambria Investment account at any time.)


			Can investors outside the United States invest in the new offering?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2016-08-31T16:32:14+00:00		
Can investors outside the United States invest in the new offering?Unfortunately, Betterment is not setup yet for foreign investors.  However, we suggest two options for our international friends:
a) Open an account at Fidelity.  We can implement all of the Trinity portfolios at Fidelity. Unlike Betterment, Fidelity does not charge a platform fee of 0.15%, but does charge their standard commission rates on trades.  Please reach out to sm@cambriainvestments.com if you are interested.  Tax harvesting is not yet available at Fidelity.
b) Simply invest in Cambria ETFs that mimic the Trinity allocations through your local brokerage.


			What are the ETFs you use to build my portfolio?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2016-09-01T15:06:52+00:00		
What are the ETFs you use to build my portfolio?Cambria is consistently reviewing all ETF offerings for best of breed funds based on methodology and pricing.  Currently, our portfolios consist of approximately 13 ETFs. They come from eight different respected providers such as Vanguard and iShares, as well as Cambria’s own suite of ETFs.


			Should I buy Cambria’s ETFs or open a Cambria Digital Advisor account?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2016-10-28T15:35:14+00:00		
Should I buy Cambria’s ETFs or open a Cambria Digital Advisor account?Many investors prefer to invest on their own. In such cases, investing in Cambria’s ETFs would be an appropriate course of action. However, many other investors prefer the convenience of opening an investment account, as well as the confidence that comes with knowing experts are behind all market decisions. For these investors, a Cambria Investment account is preferable. Opening an account effectively outsources the trading and rebalancing efforts, so clients can spend their time elsewhere. An account also offers the benefit of giving clients access to an advisor whenever they have questions about their portfolio, the strategy, or the market.


			How do I confirm my checking account?		


Morningtide 


			2016-10-28T15:35:14+00:00		
How do I confirm my checking account?To add a checking account, we need to make sure you own that account by having you confirm two random deposits/withdrawals we put into that account. After entering your bank account information, you will then complete the following steps to confirm your bank account with Cambria:

Log into your checking account at your bank.
Find the two small random amounts under $1.00 we have deposited and immediately withdrawn from your account – please note, you may have to wait up to two business days to see these deposits.
Log into your account at CambriaInvestments.com.
On the Transfer tab, in the Confirm Two Small Deposits window, tell us the values of the two random deposits in your account.
That’s it, you’re ready to start investing!



			How do I add or delete a linked checking account?		


Morningtide 


			2016-06-30T15:17:34+00:00		
How do I add or delete a linked checking account?To change your linked account online, click your name at the top right hand side of your profile, and click “Settings”. You can change your bank account under the “Bank Account” section of the page.
At this time, our customers can only have one active checking account at a time linked to their Cambria account. Multiple linked bank accounts may be something we provide in the future.
Please Note: Because electronic transfer is the primary way to move money to and from your Cambria account, you will not be able to delete the link to your checking account unless you add a new one.


			How do taxes work with Cambria Digital Advisor accounts?		


Morningtide 


			2016-07-27T14:04:21+00:00		
How do taxes work with Cambria Digital Advisor accounts?Individual (“Personal”) or Joint Taxable Accounts
With taxable investment accounts, you generally owe taxes each year on the dividends and other distributions paid to you that year.  You may also owe taxes when you sell shares, depending on whether or not you’ve realized capital gains on the investment.
Taxation of Dividends
Most ETFs pay dividends, reported on Form 1099-DIV. These are generally taxable, typically at your ordinary marginal tax rate (0-39.6%, Federal). For high earners, an additional 3.8% “net investment income tax” applies. Certain ETFs that hold stocks may distribute “qualified” dividends, which are potentially subject to lower tax rates (Box 1b). Some ETFs hold municipal bonds, which pay dividends that are partially or wholly exempt from federal and/or state tax (Box 10 of 1099-DIV).
Other Distributions
Some ETFs make distributions parts of which are not taxed as dividends, but rather as capital gains, or return of capital. Capital gains distributed are reported on Form 1099-DIV as well (Box 2a).   Return of capital is rare, but could apply, for example, to real estate ETFs that sell some of their holdings, and is reported in Box 3, 8 or 9 (See IRS Pub 17 for details).
Foreign Tax Paid
For ETFs with non-US holdings, the 1099-DIV can indicate foreign tax paid. This could happen when such ETFs have already paid foreign taxes on distributions made by companies in foreign jurisdictions, before passing them on to U.S. shareholders. To mitigate double taxation on the same income, the U.S. rules potentially allow for a deduction or tax credit for these amounts (Box 6).
Taxation of Capital Gains
At Cambria Investments, we sell shares on your behalf whenever you withdraw funds, change your allocation, or we rebalance, harvest losses, or assess our fee. When you sell shares that have appreciated, you realize capital gains tax. If the investment has depreciated in value, you realize a capital loss, which is used to offset other gains that you realized that year, and any excess loss may be deductible from your earned income, up to a threshold set by the IRS.  Losses not used that year may be carried forward to future years.  The amount of capital gains tax you owe depends on your net gains (including losses carried over from prior years) and how long you held your investments before selling.  Short-term capital gains tax applies if you sell shares you held for one year or less. The federal short-term capital gains tax rate is the same rate as your income tax rate (0-39.6%). Long-term capital gains tax applies if you sold shares you held longer than a year, and ranges from 0-20%. For high earners, an additional 3.8% “net investment income tax” is added for both. For each ETF across your portfolio, Cambria’s TaxMin algorithm automatically sells losses first (starting with shares which have the highest cost) and if realizing gains is unavoidable, it prefers long-term over short-term, which is likely to reduce your tax burden. All sales, including sale price, cost basis, and holding period, are reported on Form 1099-B.
Traditional IRA or SEP IRA
Traditional and SEP IRAs may afford a deduction against your ordinary income in the tax year during which you contribute funds, if you qualify based on your income.  Any dividends you receive are automatically reinvested by Cambria Investments, and grow tax-free until withdrawal.  When you withdraw from the account, taxes are generally due at your ordinary income tax rate applicable at that time, both on earnings and on all contribution amounts that were previously deducted.  Penalties may also be due if you don’t meet the withdrawal qualifications (e.g., you withdraw before age 59.5).  Read more from the IRS on IRAs and SEP IRAs.
Roth IRA
Roth IRA contributions are made with dollars you’ve already been taxed on — you don’t get a deduction.  However, at retirement, as long as you’ve held the account for at least five years and met the other qualified withdrawal criteria, none of the amount withdrawn is taxed.  Any dividends you receive are automatically reinvested by Cambria Investments, grow tax-free, and are also withdrawn tax-free.  Read more from the IRS on Roth IRAs.

			When will my tax forms be available?		


Morningtide 


			2016-10-28T15:35:14+00:00		
When will my tax forms be available?Your 1099 tax forms are automatically imported to your Cambria Investments account in mid-February, in both CSV and PDF formats. We will notify you via email when these are ready. We will also integrate with Turbo Tax, H&R Block, and TaxACT. Unlike other online advisors, we make our forms in-house, with clear summaries provided.
To see tax forms from previous years, please review your Activity page, and then click the “Tax Forms” tab.
The forms are not available prior to February due to the 30-day window related to certain TLH+ requirements, which carry through the end of January. Additionally, we need final confirmations on distributions from fund providers regarding their dividend payout classifications. Cambria Investments strives to provide tax forms well in advance of the Feb. 16, 2016 deadline when possible.


			How should I interpret the information on my 1099-DIV?		


Morningtide 


			2016-06-30T15:18:07+00:00		
How should I interpret the information on my 1099-DIV?Your 1099-DIV is a record of all dividends and distributions earned in your Cambria Investments account during 2015. It includes taxable dividends and distributions as well as exempt-interest dividends paid by municipal bond ETFs. There are multiple boxes on your 1099-DIV, each of which reports a different piece of information which must be included in your tax return:
Box 1a Total Ordinary Dividends: The total amount of dividends and short-term capital gain distributions paid in 2015.
Foreign tax paid (reported separately in Box 6) is added to the dividends and distributions reported in Box 1a as well. If you had foreign tax paid in 2015, the total amount reported in Box 1a will be higher than the amount actually received. For more information on foreign tax, please refer to IRS Publication 514.
Tax-exempt dividends (reported separately in Box 10) are not included in Box 1a. If you received tax-exempt dividends in 2015, the total amount reported in Box 1a will be lower than the amount actually received.
Box 1b Qualified Dividends: The amount of dividends included in Box 1a that are subject to applicable long-term capital gains rates.
Box 2a Total Capital Gain Distributions: The total long-term capital gain distributions paid to you in 2015. These differ from long-term sales reported on your 1099-B, and instead come from the distributions paid by some ETFs.
Box 6 Foreign Tax Paid: The total foreign income taxes paid in 2015 on income from the ETFs’ investments in foreign securities. Federal tax law can permit U.S. taxpayers to take either a deduction or credit for these taxes; for more information please refer to IRS Publication 514 or consult with a tax professional.
Box 10 Exempt-Interest Dividends: The total amount of tax-exempt dividends paid by municipal bond ETFs in 2015.
Please note that Cambria Investments is not a tax advisor and the information provided should not be construed as tax advice, but should be used for informational purposes only. Please consult a qualified tax professional or the IRS to determine the rules that apply to your individual tax situation.


			How long does it take to transfer money?		


Morningtide 


			2016-06-30T15:18:19+00:00		
How long does it take to transfer money?Electronic deposits from your bank to Cambria Investments typically invest the following business day for deposits made before 11PM EST. This includes requests made on Saturday and Sunday. The only exception is auto-deposits that fall on weekends. If your auto-deposit falls on the weekend, it will invest on Tuesday (assuming that Monday is not a market holiday).
Electronic withdrawals from Cambria Investments to your bank generally take 4-5 business days due to the required sale and settlement of securities. For example, if you made a withdrawal on Monday morning, you can expect your funds the following Monday (assuming that there are no market or bank holidays in the interim). Note that your withdrawal time may also be impacted if you have made recent deposits within the previous 5 business days.
Deposits must be initiated by 11PM EST to be invested by the next business day. Withdrawals must be initiated 30 minutes before the stock market closes at 3:30PM EST to be transacted that day. Trade requests initiated after these cutoff times, or during weekends and holidays, will be processed the next business day.
Cambria Investments does not guarantee specific execution timelines. We avoid trading on or around market open or close, as markets have historically been more volatile during this time. Pending wait times are imposed by banking and market rules and cannot be sped up by Cambria Investments.


			How much can I contribute to an IRA?		


Morningtide 


			2016-06-30T15:18:28+00:00		
How much can I contribute to an IRA?The annual limits for 2015 IRA contributions are $5,500 for individuals under 50 years old, and $6,500 for those who are 50 and over. These contribution limits remain the same for 2016.  The limit is assessed across all of your accounts, so if you have reached the limit with one provider you are not allowed to contribute to another account.
There are additional contribution limits to a Roth IRA, and deduction limits to a Traditional IRA, based on your income and other factors. Please speak with your tax advisor.


			What is tax loss harvesting?		


Morningtide 


			2016-06-30T15:18:37+00:00		
What is tax loss harvesting?Tax loss harvesting is selling a security that has experienced a loss—and then buying a similar asset to replace it. The switch does two things: it allows the investor to realize, or “harvest”, a valuable loss while keeping the portfolio balanced at the desired allocation.
Capital losses can lower your tax bill by offsetting other gains or ordinary income up to certain levels.  But the only way to realize a loss is to sell the asset that has experienced a loss. However, in a well-allocated portfolio, each asset plays an essential role in providing a piece of total market exposure. For that reason, an investor should not want to give up the expected returns associated with each asset just to realize a loss.


			How will Tax Loss Harvesting+ affect my tax returns?		


Morningtide 


			2016-06-30T15:18:50+00:00		
How will Tax Loss Harvesting+ affect my tax returns?You will receive a 1099-B corresponding to any tax loss harvests that occur in your account during the year (as harvests involve a sale in order to realize a loss). This is in addition to non-TLH related investment sales generally (e.g. money withdrawals, allocation changes, or portfolio rebalances).


			How do I turn on Tax Loss Harvesting?		


Morningtide 


			2016-10-28T15:35:15+00:00		
How do I turn on Tax Loss Harvesting?To turn on Tax Loss Harvesting+, first log in to your Cambria Investments account. On the Summary tab, click “Get Started” in the Tax Loss Harvesting+ part of the overview section. As part of the enablement process, you will answer a couple questions to ensure you are eligible. Once you have enabled TLH+, it can take up to one business day for your portfolio to transition and for harvest checks to begin.


			What are ETFs?		


Morningtide 


			2016-06-30T15:19:06+00:00		
What are ETFs?An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a security that tracks an index, a commodity or a basket of assets just like an index fund, but trades like a stock on an exchange. ETFs track fairly closely to the indexes that they follow, such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average. ETFs are bought and sold like stocks throughout the day, and therefore experience continually changing prices. Cambria Funds uses ETFs in both our stock and bond portfolios because of the liquidity, diversification, and low management fees they provide.


			What do I need to know about ETF versus mutual fund costs?		


Morningtide 


			2016-06-30T15:19:14+00:00		
What do I need to know about ETF versus mutual fund costs?When you are thinking about buying an ETF, the Expense Ratio is pretty much all you need to know. ETF managers make money by deducting the annual expenses from the dividends they pay out through the year, and they tell you in advance how much that will be. There are no costs to buy or sell ETFs, and no hidden expenses. If you trade through a broker, the broker will charge you a commission to execute the transaction for you. Cambria Investments covers these transactions for you.
Open-end mutual funds have purchase and redemption fees. These fees range from 0.25 percent to 2 percent and are charged by the fund to buy shares or to sell shares within a specified (usually short) period of time. Purchase and redemption fees differ from a commission because the money goes back into the fund rather than to a broker. These fees are meant to discourage short-term market-timing.
Mutual funds also have internal trading fees which are not disclosed on top of the stated fee. They are estimated to range from 0.11% of assets to 2%, with an average of 1.44%. The Wall Street Journal has a good primer on this issue. Many passive index mutual funds’ undisclosed trading fees are likely quite low, but they are non-zero, so that’s something to consider when doing a pure cost comparison.

What is a joint account?Cambria Investments joint accounts enable two people to share and progress toward investment goals together. Both holders of the joint account have full access to the joint account and are able to create goals, transfer funds from the linked checking account, change allocations, and view the account.
Two customers in a joint account have joint ownership of the assets in the account. Upon death of one of the joint account owners, the assets are transferred to the surviving account holder.
Note: At this time goals and assets held in a personal (individual) account are displayed separately from goals and assets held in a joint account. You can switch between your joint and personal accounts by logging into your account and then selecting the account you wish to view from the “Welcome” drop down menu on the upper right.

			2016-07-29T11:58:24+00:00		
What is SmartDeposit?SmartDeposit is another wonderful feature created by our friends at Betterment. It’s an automated cash investment tool that puts more of your money to work by investing your excess cash. That means no more manually figuring out how much to invest each month or stressing over whether you are saving enough to reach your Cambria Investments goals. And, you have total control over the entire process with the liquidity you need. Here’s how it works:

You tell us the maximum amount you need in your bank account.
You set how much we invest at a time.
At least once a week, we automatically invest any excess cash up to the amount you set.
You will receive notifications before any transfers, so you can modify or cancel.
You can access your money at any time, with no Cambria Investments fees. Please keep in mind that there may be tax implications when selling your securities.



			How is SmartDeposit different than auto-deposits?

Market Strategies








The Trinity Portfolio
Does market uncertainty have you concerned about your wealth? If so, you’re not alone.
Many investors today are anxious because they lack a cohesive plan. Their investments are more an assortment of unrelated assets than deliberately-chosen pieces of a unified strategy. Unfortunately, this can leave their wealth exposed.
Our Trinity Portfolio offers a different approach. It’s a holistic investing framework, sturdy, as it’s rooted in respected, wealth-building investment principles, yet also strategic, able to adapt to all sorts of market conditions. The result is a unified framework that we believe can help relieve investors of the anxiety of “what’s the right strategy right now?”
Do you want help generating real investing wealth with less anxiety? Read how the Trinity Portfolio can help.

Think Income and Growth Don’t Exist in this Market? Think Again.
Are you have the following argument with yourself?
“I need an investment that’s going to provide me not only income, but growth too. Unfortunately, investors have been piling into dividend funds for years now in their search for yield. I’m worried that this has left me few reasonably-valued opportunities. If I invest in a potentially overvalued dividend fund today and this 8-year bull market finally runs out of steam tomorrow, then I’m risking serious losses. On the other hand, keeping my money on the sidelines is returning me zero. Is there an answer?”
As I’m about to show you in this paper, yes, I believe there is an answer – and a good one. Income and growth are still possible, even in this market, though admittedly, harder to find.

Meb Faber’s Books








Invest With The House
Hacking The Top Hedge Funds
by Meb Faber
Picking stocks is hard—and competitive. The most talented investors in the world play this game, and if you try to compete against them, it’s like playing against the house in a casino. Luck can be your friend for a while, but eventually the house wins. But what if you could lay down your bets with the house instead of against it? In the stock market, the most successful large investors—particularly hedge fund managers—represent the house. These managers like to refer to their top investments as their “best ideas.” In this book, you will learn how to farm the best ideas of the world’s top hedge fund managers. You will learn who they are, how to track their funds and stock picks, and how to use that information to help guide your own portfolio. In essence, you will learn how to play more like the house in a casino and less like the sucker relying on dumb luck.

Global Asset Allocation
A Survey of the World’s Top Investment Strategies
by Meb Faber
With all of our focus on assets – and how much and when to allocate them – are we missing the bigger picture? Our book begins by reviewing the historical performance record of popular assets like stocks, bonds, and cash. We look at the impact inflation has on our money. We then start to examine how diversification through combining assets, in this case a simple stock and bond mix, works to mitigate the extreme drawdowns of risky asset classes. But we go beyond a limited stock/bond portfolio to consider a more global allocation that also takes into account real assets. We track 13 assets and their returns since 1973, with particular attention to a number of well-known portfolios, like Ray Dalio’s All Weather portfolio, the Endowment portfolio, Warren Buffett’s suggestion, and others. And what we find is that, with a few notable exceptions, many of the allocations have similar exposures. And yet, while we are all busy paying close attention to our portfolio’s particular allocation of assets, the greatest impact on our portfolios may be something we fail to notice altogether…

The Ivy Portfolio
How to Invest Like The Top Endowments and Avoid the Bear Markets
by Meb Faber
A do-it-yourself guide to investing like the renowned Harvard and Yale endowments. The Ivy Portfolio shows step-by-step how to track and mimic the investment strategies of the highly successful Harvard and Yale endowments. Using the endowment Policy Portfolios as a guide, the authors illustrate how an investor can develop a strategic asset allocation using an ETF-based investment approach. The Ivy Portfolio also reveals a novel method for investors to reduce their risk through a tactical asset allocation strategy to protect them from bear markets. The book will also showcase a method to follow the smart money and piggyback the top hedge funds and their stock-picking abilities. With readable, straightforward advice, The Ivy Portfolio will show investors exactly how this can be accomplished—and allow them to achieve an unparalleled level of investment success in the process. With all of the uncertainty in the markets today, The Ivy Portfolio helps the reader answer the most often asked question in investing today – “What do I do”?

Global Value
How to Spot Bubbles, Avoid Market Crashes, and Earn Big Returns in the Stock Market
by Meb Faber
Investment bubbles and speculative manias have existed for as long as humans have been involved in markets. Is it possible for investors to identify emerging bubbles and then profit from their inflation? Likewise, can investors avoid the bursting of these bubbles, and the extreme volatility and losses found in their aftermath to survive to invest another day? Over 70 years ago, Benjamin Graham and David Dodd proposed valuing stocks with earnings smoothed across multiple years. Robert Shiller later popularized this method with his version of the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio in the late 1990s and correctly issued a timely warning of poor stock returns to follow in the coming years. We apply this valuation metric across more than 40 foreign markets and find it both practical and useful. Indeed, we witness even greater examples of bubbles and busts abroad than in the United States. We then create a trading system to build global stock portfolios, and find significant outperformance by selecting markets based on relative and absolute valuation.

Shareholder Yield
A Better Approach to Dividend Investing
by Meb Faber
Shareholder Yield: A Better Approach to Dividend Investing shows step-by-step how to find returns in a low yield world. Investors have flocked to dividend stocks in search of yield; however, fewer companies are paying out less in dividends due to legal, tax, and structural changes in the US markets. Dividend payments are only one use of a company’s free cash flow; other uses of cash include: share repurchases, debt paydown, reinvestment in the business, and mergers and acquisitions. Consequently, investors in the 21st century must look to all of the direct and indirect ways in which companies distribute their cash to shareholders, a metric commonly referred to as “Shareholder Yield”. In this book, we analyze portfolios based on the various cash flow metrics and find that portfolios of companies with high shareholder yields outperform both broad market indices and high dividend yield portfolios by a substantial margin. With all of the uncertainty in the markets today, Shareholder Yield helps the reader answer one of the most often asked question in investing today – “Where do I find yield”?

Meb Faber’s White Papers








A Quantitative Approach to Tactical Asset Allocation
In this paper we update our 2006 white paper “A Quantitative Approach to Tactical Asset Allocation” with new data from the 2008-2012 period. How well did the purpose of the original paper – to present a simple quantitative method that improves the risk-adjusted returns across various asset classes – hold up since publication? Overall, we find that the models have performed well in real-time, achieving equity like returns with bond like volatility and drawdowns. We also examine the effects of departures from the original system including adding more asset classes, introducing various portfolio allocations, and implementing alternative cash management strategies.
Download







Relative Strength Strategies for Investing
The purpose of this paper is to present simple quantitative methods that improve risk-adjusted returns for investing in US equity sectors and global asset class portfolios. A relative strength model is tested on the French-Fama US equity sector data back to the 1920s that results in increased absolute returns with equity-like risk. The relative strength portfolios outperform the buy and hold benchmark in approximately 70% of all years and returns are persistent across time. The addition of a trend-following parameter to dynamically hedge the portfolio decreases both volatility and drawdown. The relative strength model is then tested across a portfolio of global asset classes with supporting results.

Global Value: Building Trading Models with the 10 Year CAPE
Over seventy years ago Benjamin Graham and David Dodd proposed valuing securities with earnings smoothed across multiple years. Robert Shiller popularized this method with his version of this cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio (CAPE) in the late 1990s, and issued a timely warning of poor stock returns to follow in the coming years. We apply this valuation metric across over thirty foreign markets and find it both practical and useful, and indeed witness even greater examples of bubbles and busts abroad than in the United States. We then create a trading system to build global stock portfolios based on valuation, and find significant outperformance by selecting markets based on relative and absolute valuation.

Where the Black Swans Hide & the 10 Best Days Myth
Below we examine market outliers in financial markets. How much effect do these outliers have on long term performance? Can the investor prepare for these anomalies, or are they truly ‘black swans’ that cannot be managed? In this issue we examine numerous global financial markets on daily and monthly time frames. We find that these rare outliers have a massive impact on returns. However, these outliers tend to cluster and the majority of both good and bad outliers occur once markets have already been declining. We critique the “missing the 10-best-days” argument proffered by advocates of buy and hold investing, demonstrating that a significant majority of the 10 best days and the 10 worst days occur in declining markets. We continue to advocate that investors attempt to avoid declining markets where most of the volatility lies, and conclude that market timing and risk management is indeed possible, and beneficial to the investor.

Learning to Love Investment Bubbles: What if Sir Isaac Newton had been a Trendfollower?
Investment manias and financial bubbles have likely existed for as long as humans have been involved in financial markets. In this research piece we take a look at some of the more famous market bubbles in history and the extreme volatility and drawdowns they experienced. We then examine a simple trendfollowing approach investors could use to manage their risk. Across twelve market bubbles we find that a trendfollowing system would have improved return while reducing volatility. Most importantly, it would have reduced drawdowns significantly leading to the most important rule in all of investing – surviving to invest another day.

Finding Yield in a 2% World
Many investors are surprised to learn that the largest asset class in the world is foreign debt. US investors often allocate very little to foreign bonds, and when they do, it is through capitalization weighted indexes. These indexes allocate the highest weighting to countries with the most debt outstanding. Is there a better way to invest in global bonds? We examine a simple value approach applied to global sovereign bonds and find that it works well across decades. In a world of very low and even negative yields, a value approach could potentially add a well needed source of income to a diversified portfolio.

Learning to Play Offense and Defense: Combining Value and Momentum from the Bottom Up, and the Top Down
Sorting stocks based on value and momentum factors historically has led to outperformance over the broad US stock market. However, any long-only strategy is subject to similar volatility and drawdowns as the S&P 500. Drawdowns of 50%, or even 60-90% make implementation of a stock strategy very challenging. Is there a way to add value on stock selection, but also reduce volatility and drawdowns of a long only strategy with hedging techniques? In this paper we examine the possibility of following a strategy that combines aggressive offense and smart defense to target outsized returns with manageable risk and drawdowns.

What if 8% is Really 0%? Pension Funds Investing with Fingers-Crossed and Eyes Closed
It is well known that pension funds in the United States are underfunded even if they achieve their projected 8% rate of return. The scope of pension underfunding increases to an astonishing level when more probable future rates are employed. A reduction in the future rate of return from 8% to the more reasonable risk-free rate of approximately 4% causes the liabilities to explode by trillions of dollars. As bond yields declined over the past twenty years, pension funds moved toward more aggressive equity-based portfolios in an attempt to reach for this 8% return. By investing in a portfolio with uncertain outcomes, pension funds could experience increasingly volatile and even negative returns. Paradoxically, in an effort to chase the universal 8% rate, pension funds may be laying the groundwork for returns even lower than the risk free rate. In an effort to offer an empirical basis for this possibility, we conclude the paper with a relevant comparison – the return of a hypothetical Japanese pension for the past two decades. We believe that pension funds need to at least prepare for the unfathomable: 0% returns for 20 years. Most pension funds, regrettably, have not adequately stress tested their portfolios for these scenarios.
Download







Global CAPE Model Optimization
We use the Shiller CAPE Model proposed by Mebane Faber as a template for the exploration of a variety of portfolio optimization methods. By virtue of the Model’s systematic allocation to the ‘cheapest’ markets with the highest theoretical risk premia, the model has the potential to extract high costs from ‘behavioural taxes’ related to the model’s extreme volatility and drawdown character. We apply several portfolio optimization techniques with the objective of maximizing portfolio Sharpe ratios and minimizing drawdowns, including dynamic volatility weighting, risk parity, target risk and minimum variance. Consistent with recent published research on robust portfolio optimization, return to risk ratios improve broadly, with the greatest impact achieved from procedures that manage positions and/or portfolios to an ex ante target volatility. A theoretical framework is also proposed.

Politics and Profit: Combining the Presidential Cycle and the January Effect
Does the intersection of two market anomalies set the stage for outsized performance? The first is what is known as the Presidential Cycle. This theory goes that equity returns during the third and fourth years of a President’s term are more favorable than the first two years. A second market bias is the large outperformance of small cap stocks in January. Historically small caps outperformed large caps in 80% of all Januaries by 3 percentage points per year. Historically across the 48 months in the four year cycle the January of Year 3 is the single biggest outperformer with median returns since 1927 of nearly 8% a month for small caps. Does this mean that January is guaranteed to be great? Again, nothing is guaranteed – Year 3 Januaries have varied from 27% to down 10%. While many of these tendencies are just that, investors can view them as head or tailwinds that could give bulls and bears pause.

Applicants' Representations
1. The Trust is registered as an open-end management investment company under the Act and is a statutory trust organized under the laws of Delaware. The Trust will initially offer an actively-managed series, Cambria Shareholder Yield ETF (the “Initial Fund”). The investment objective of the Initial Fund will be to seek to preserve and grow capital by investing in domestic equity securities and in particular in companies that will generate investment returns through the payment of dividends and through the appreciation of their share price.
2. Cambria, a California limited partnership, will be the investment adviser to the Initial Fund. Cambria is and any other Adviser (as defined below) is or will be registered as an “investment adviser” under section 203 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”). The Adviser may enter into sub-advisory agreements with investment advisers to act as sub-advisers with respect to the Funds (each, a “Subadviser”). Any Subadviser will be registered under the Advisers Act or not subject to such registration. A registered broker-dealer under the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), which may be an affiliate of the Adviser, will act as the distributor and principal underwriter of the Funds (“Distributor”).
3. Applicants request that the order apply to the Initial Fund and any future series of the Trust or of other existing or future open-end management companies that may utilize active management investment strategies (“Future Funds”). Any Future Fund will (a) be advised by Cambria or an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Cambria (each such entity and any successor thereto included in the term “Adviser”) [2] 
          , and (b) comply with the terms and conditions of the application.[3] 
           The Initial Fund and Future Funds together are the “Funds”. Each Fund will operate as an exchange-traded fund (“ETF”). In addition to the instruments described above, each Fund reserves the right to invest in other instruments, including short sales (“Short Positions”). Each Fund will consist of a portfolio of securities (including fixed income securities and/or equity securities) and/or currencies traded in the U.S. or in non-U.S. markets, assets, and other positions (“Portfolio Instruments”). To the extent consistent with other investment limitations, the Funds may invest in ETFs as well as shares of certain exchange-traded products that are not registered investment companies,[4] 
           cash and cash equivalents, mortgage- or asset-backed securities, including “to-be-announced transactions” (“TBA Transactions”) [5] 
          , and may engage in forward commitment transactions,[6] 
           forward foreign currency contracts, options contracts, futures contracts or swap agreements.[7] 
           Funds may also invest in “Depositary Receipts”.[8] 
           A Fund will not invest in any Depositary Receipts that the Adviser, or Subadviser as applicable, deems to be illiquid or for which pricing information is not readily available. The Funds might include one or more ETFs which invest in other open-end and/or closed-end investment companies and/or ETFs.[9] 

4. Applicants also request that any exemptions under section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act from sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (B) apply to: (1) Any Fund that is currently or subsequently part of the same “group of investment companies” as the Initial Fund within the meaning of section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the Act as well as any principal underwriter for the Fund and any Brokers selling Shares of a Fund to an Investing Fund, as defined below; and (2) each management investment company or unit investment trust registered under the Act that is not part of the same  “group of investment companies” as the Funds, and that enters into a FOF Participation Agreement (as defined below) with a Fund (such management investment companies are referred to herein as “Investing Management Companies,” such unit investment trusts are referred to herein as, “Investing Trusts,” and Investing Management Companies and Investing Trusts together are referred to herein as “Investing Funds”).[10] 
           Investing Funds do not include the Funds.
5. Applicants anticipate that a Creation Unit will consist of at least 25,000 Shares and the price of a Share will range from $20 to $200. All orders to purchase Creation Units must be placed with the Distributor by or through a party (“Authorized Participant”) that has entered into a participant agreement with the Distributor and the transfer agent of the Trust with respect to the creation and redemption of Creation Units. An Authorized Participant is either: (a) A broker or dealer registered under the Exchange Act (“Broker”) or other participant in the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation (“NSCC”), a clearing agency registered with the Commission and affiliated with the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”); or (b) a participant in the DTC (such participant, “DTC Participant”). Shares of the Funds will be purchased and redeemed in Creation Units and generally on an “in-kind” basis. Except where the purchase or redemption will include cash under the limited circumstances specified below, purchasers will be required to purchase Creation Units by making an in-kind deposit of specified instruments (“Deposit Instruments”), and shareholders redeeming their Shares will receive an in-kind transfer of specified instruments (“Redemption Instruments”).[11] 
           On any given Business Day[12] 

          , the names and quantities of the instruments that constitute the Deposit Instruments and the names and quantities of the instruments that constitute the Redemption Instruments will be identical, and these instruments may be referred to, in the case of either a purchase or a redemption, as the “In-kind Basket.” In addition, the In-kind Basket will correspond pro rata to the positions in the Fund's portfolio (including cash positions),[13] 
           except: (a) In the case of bonds, for minor differences when it is impossible to break up bonds beyond certain minimum sizes needed for transfer and settlement; (b) for minor differences when rounding is necessary to eliminate fractional shares or lots that are not tradeable round lots;[14] 
           or (c) TBA  Transactions, Short Positions[15] 
           or other positions that cannot be transferred in kind[16] 
           will be excluded from the In-kind Basket.[17] 
           If there is a difference between the net asset value attributable to a Creation Unit and the aggregate market value of the In-kind Basket exchanged for the Creation Unit, the party conveying instruments with the lower value will pay to the other an amount in cash equal to that difference (the “Balancing Amount”).
6. Purchases and redemptions of Creation Units may be made in whole or in part on a cash basis, rather than in kind, solely under the following circumstances: (a) To the extent there is a Balancing Amount, as described above; (b) if, on a given Business Day, the Fund announces before the open of trading that all purchases, all redemptions or all purchases and redemptions on that day will be made entirely in cash; (c) if, upon receiving a purchase or redemption order from an Authorized Participant, the Fund determines to require the purchase or redemption, as applicable, to be made entirely in cash;[18] 

           (d) if, on a given Business Day, the Fund requires all Authorized Participants purchasing or redeeming Shares on that day to deposit or receive (as applicable) cash in lieu of some or all of the Deposit Instruments or Redemption Instruments, respectively, solely because: (i) Such instruments are not eligible for transfer through either the NSCC Process or DTC Process; or (ii) in the case of Funds holding non-U.S. investments (“Global Funds”), such instruments are not eligible for trading due to local trading restrictions, local restrictions on securities transfers, or other similar circumstances; or (e) if the Fund permits an Authorized Participant to deposit or receive (as applicable) cash in lieu of some or all of the Deposit Instruments or Redemption Instruments, respectively, solely because: (i) Such instruments are, in the case of the purchase of a Creation Unit, not available in sufficient quantity; (ii) such instruments are not eligible for trading by an Authorized Participant or the investor on whose behalf the Authorized Participant is acting; or (iii) a holder of Shares of a Global Fund would be subject to unfavorable income tax treatment if the holder receives redemption proceeds in kind.[19] 

7. Each Business Day, before the open of trading on the national securities exchange as defined in section 2(a)(26) of the Act (“Stock Exchange”) upon which its Shares are listed and traded, the Fund will cause to be published through the NSCC the names and quantities of the instruments comprising the In-kind Basket, as well as the estimated Balancing Amount (if any), for that day. The published In-kind Basket will apply until a new In-kind Basket is announced on the following Business Day, and there will be no intra-day changes to the In-kind Basket, except to correct errors in the published In-kind Basket. The Stock Exchange will disseminate every 15 seconds throughout the trading day through the facilities of the Consolidated Tape Association an amount representing, on a per Share basis, the sum of the current value of the Portfolio Instruments that were publicly disclosed prior to the commencement of trading in Shares on the Stock Exchange.
8. An investor purchasing or redeeming a Creation Unit from a Fund may be charged a fee (“Transaction Fee”) to protect existing shareholders of the Funds from the dilutive costs associated with the purchase and redemption of Creation Units.[20] 
           All orders to purchase Creation Units will be placed with the Distributor by or through an Authorized Participant and the Distributor will transmit all purchase orders to the relevant Fund. The Distributor will be responsible for delivering a prospectus (“Prospectus”) to those persons purchasing Creation Units and for maintaining records of both the orders placed with it and the confirmations of acceptance furnished by it.
9. Shares will be listed and traded at negotiated prices on the Stock Exchange and traded in the secondary market. Applicants expect that the Stock Exchange specialists (“Specialists”) or market makers (“Market Makers”) will be assigned to Shares. The price of Shares trading on the Stock Exchange will be based on a current bid/offer market. Transactions involving the purchases and sales of Shares on the Stock Exchange will be subject to customary brokerage commissions and charges.
10. Applicants expect that purchasers of Creation Units will include arbitrageurs. Specialists or Market Makers, acting in their unique role to provide a fair and orderly secondary market for Shares, also may purchase Creation Units for use in their own market making activities.[21] 
           Applicants expect that secondary market purchasers of Shares will include both institutional and retail investors.[22] 
           Applicants expect that arbitrage opportunities created by the ability to continually purchase or redeem Creation Units at their net asset value per common Share (“NAV”) should ensure that the Shares will not trade at a material discount or premium in relation to their NAV.
11. Shares may be redeemed only if tendered in Creation Units. Redemption requests must be placed by or through an Authorized Participant. As discussed above, redemptions of Creation Units will generally be made on an in-kind basis, subject to certain specified exceptions under which redemptions may be made in whole or in part on a cash basis, and will be subject to a Transaction Fee.
12. Neither the Trust nor any Fund will be marketed or otherwise held out as a “mutual fund.” Instead, each Fund will be marketed as an “actively-managed exchange-traded fund.” Any  advertising material where features of obtaining, buying or selling Creation Units are described or where there is reference to redeemability will prominently disclose that Shares are not individually redeemable and that owners of Shares may acquire Shares from a Fund and tender those Shares for redemption to a Fund in Creation Units only.
13. The Funds' Web site, which will be publicly available prior to the public offering of Shares, will include the Prospectus and additional quantitative information updated on a daily basis, including, on a per Share basis for each Fund, the prior Business Day's NAV and the market closing price or mid-point of the bid/ask spread at the time of the calculation of such NAV (“Bid/Ask Price”), and a calculation of the premium or discount of the market closing price or Bid/Ask Price against such NAV. On each Business Day, before commencement of trading in Shares on the Stock Exchange, the Fund will disclose on its Web site the identities and quantities of the Portfolio Instruments held by the Fund that will form the basis for the Fund's calculation of NAV at the end of the Business Day.[23] 

Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Applicants request an order under section 6(c) of the Act for an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 5(a)(1), 22(d) and 22(e) of the Act and rule 22c-1 under the Act, under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act for an exemption from sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(2) of the Act, and under section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act for an exemption from sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (B) of the Act.
2. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class of persons, securities or transactions from any provisions of the Act, if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section 17(a) of the Act if evidence establishes that the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, and the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of the registered investment company and the general provisions of the Act. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions, from any provision of section 12(d)(1) if the exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.
Sections 5(a)(1) and 2(a)(32) of the Act
3. Section 5(a)(1) of the Act defines an “open-end company” as a management investment company that is offering for sale or has outstanding any redeemable security of which it is the issuer. Section 2(a)(32) of the Act defines a redeemable security as any security, other than short-term paper, under the terms of which the holder, upon its presentation to the issuer, is entitled to receive approximately a proportionate share of the issuer's current net assets, or the cash equivalent. Because Shares will not be individually redeemable, applicants request an order that would permit the Trust and any Fund to register as an open-end management investment company and redeem Shares in Creation Units only. Applicants state that investors may purchase Shares in Creation Units from each Fund and redeem Creation Units from each Fund. Applicants further state that because the market price of Creation Units will be disciplined by arbitrage opportunities, investors should be able to sell Shares in the secondary market at prices that do not vary materially from their NAV.
Section 22(d) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 Under the Act
4. Section 22(d) of the Act, among other things, prohibits a dealer from selling a redeemable security that is currently being offered to the public by or through a principal underwriter, except at a current public offering price described in the prospectus. Rule 22c-1 under the Act generally requires that a dealer selling, redeeming, or repurchasing a redeemable security do so only at a price based on its NAV. Applicants state that secondary market trading in Shares will take place at negotiated prices, not at a current offering price described in the Prospectus, and not at a price based on NAV. Thus, purchases and sales of Shares in the secondary market will not comply with section 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c-1 under the Act. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) from these provisions, to permit Shares to trade at negotiated prices.
5. Applicants assert that the concerns sought to be addressed by section 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c-1 under the Act with respect to pricing are equally satisfied by the proposed method of pricing Shares. Applicants maintain that while there is little legislative history regarding section 22(d), its provisions, as well as those of rule 22c-1, appear to have been designed to (a) prevent dilution caused by certain riskless-trading schemes by principal underwriters and contract dealers, (b) prevent unjust discrimination or preferential treatment among buyers resulting from sales at different prices, and (c) assure an orderly distribution system of investment company shares by eliminating price competition from Brokers offering shares at less than the published sales price and repurchasing shares at more than the published redemption price.
6. Applicants believe that none of these purposes will be thwarted by permitting Shares to trade in the secondary market at negotiated prices. Applicants state that (a) secondary market trading in Shares does not involve the Funds as parties and cannot result in dilution of an investment in Shares, and (b) to the extent different prices exist during a given trading day, or from day to day, such variances occur as a result of third-party market forces, such as supply and demand. Therefore, applicants assert that secondary market transactions in Shares will not lead to discrimination or preferential treatment among purchasers. Finally, applicants contend that the proposed distribution system will be orderly because arbitrage activity should ensure that the differences between the market price of Shares and their NAV remain immaterial.
Section 22(e) of the Act
7. Section 22(e) of the Act generally prohibits a registered investment company from suspending the right of redemption or postponing the date of payment of redemption proceeds for more than seven days after the tender of a security for redemption. Applicants observe that settlement of redemptions of Creation Units of Global Funds is contingent not only on the settlement cycle of the U.S. securities markets but also on the delivery cycles present in foreign markets in which those Funds invest. Applicants have been advised that, under certain circumstances, the delivery cycles for transferring Portfolio Instruments to redeeming investors, coupled with local market holiday schedules, will require a delivery  process of up to 14 calendar days. Applicants therefore request relief from section 22(e) in order to provide payment or satisfaction of redemptions within the maximum number of calendar days required for such payment or satisfaction in the principal local markets where transactions in the Portfolio Instruments of each Global Fund customarily clear and settle, but in all cases no later than 14 calendar days following the tender of a Creation Unit. With respect to Future Funds that are Global Funds, applicants seek the same relief from section 22(e) only to the extent that circumstances exist similar to those described in the application.[24] 

8. Applicants submit that Congress adopted section 22(e) to prevent unreasonable, undisclosed or unforeseen delays in the actual payment of redemption proceeds. Applicants state that allowing redemption payments for Creation Units of a Fund to be made within a maximum of 14 calendar days will not lead to unreasonable, undisclosed or unforeseen delays in the redemption process and would not be inconsistent with the spirit and intent of section 22(e). Applicants state the statement of additional information (“SAI”) will disclose those local holidays (over the period of at least one year following the date of the SAI), if any, that are expected to prevent the delivery of redemption proceeds in seven calendar days and the maximum number of days, up to 14 calendar days, needed to deliver the proceeds for each affected Global Fund. Except as disclosed in the SAI for a Fund, deliveries of redemption proceeds for Global Funds are expected to be made within seven days. Applicants are not seeking relief from section 22(e) with respect to Global Funds that do not effect creations or redemptions in-kind.
Section 12(d)(1) of the Act
9. Section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Act prohibits a registered investment company from acquiring securities of an investment company if the securities represent more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of the acquired company, more than 5% of the total assets of the acquiring company, or, together with the securities of any other investment companies, more than 10% of the total assets of the acquiring company. Section 12(d)(1)(B) of the Act prohibits a registered open-end investment company, its principal underwriter, or any other broker or dealer from selling its shares to another investment company if the sale will cause the acquiring company to own more than 3% of the acquired company's voting stock, or if the sale will cause more than 10% of the acquired company's voting stock to be owned by investment companies generally.
10. Applicants request relief to permit Investing Funds (as defined below) to acquire Shares in excess of the limits in section 12(d)(l)(A) of the Act and to permit the Funds, their principal underwriters and any Brokers to sell Shares to Investing Funds in excess of the limits in section 12(d)(l)(B) of the Act. Applicants submit that the proposed conditions to the requested relief are designed to address the concerns underlying the limits in section 12(d)(1), which include concerns about undue influence, excessive layering of fees and overly complex structures.
11. Applicants submit that their proposed conditions address the concerns regarding the potential for undue influence. To limit the control that an Investing Fund may have over a Fund, applicants propose a condition prohibiting the adviser of an Investing Management Company (“Investing Fund Advisor”), sponsor of an Investing Trust (“Sponsor”), any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Investing Fund Advisor or Sponsor, and any investment company or issuer that would be an investment company but for sections 3(c)(l) or 3(c)(7) of the Act that is advised or sponsored by the Investing Fund Advisor, the Sponsor, or any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Investing Fund Advisor or Sponsor (“Investing Fund's Advisory Group”) from controlling (individually or in the aggregate) a Fund within the meaning of section 2(a)(9) of the Act. The same prohibition would apply to any sub-adviser to an Investing Management Company (“Investing Fund Subadviser”), any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Investing Fund Subadviser, and any investment company or issuer that would be an investment company but for sections 3(c)(l) or 3(c)(7) of the Act (or portion of such investment company or issuer) advised or sponsored by the Investing Fund Subadviser or any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Investing Fund Subadviser (“Investing Fund's Subadvisory Group”).
12. Applicants propose a condition to ensure that no Investing Fund or Investing Fund Affiliate [25] 
           (except to the extent it is acting in its capacity as an investment adviser to a Fund) will cause a Fund to purchase a security in an offering of securities during the existence of an underwriting or selling syndicate of which a principal underwriter is an Underwriting Affiliate (“Affiliated Underwriting”). An “Underwriting Affiliate” is a principal underwriter in any underwriting or selling syndicate that is an officer, director, member of an advisory board, Investing Fund Advisor, Investing Fund Subadviser, employee or Sponsor of the Investing Fund, or a person of which any such officer, director, member of an advisory board, Investing Fund Advisor or Investing Fund Subadviser, employee or Sponsor is an affiliated person. An Underwriting Affiliate does not include any person whose relationship to the Fund is covered by section 10(f) of the Act.
13. Applicants propose several conditions to address the concerns regarding layering of fees and expenses. Applicants note that the board of directors or trustees of any Investing Management Company, including a majority of the directors or trustees who are not “interested persons” within the meaning of section 2(a)(19) of the Act (“disinterested directors or trustees”), will be required to find that the advisory fees charged under the contract are based on services provided that will be in addition to, rather than duplicative of, services provided under the advisory contract of any Fund in which the Investing Management Company may invest. In addition, an Investing Fund Advisor, trustee of an Investing Trust (“Trustee”) or Sponsor, as applicable, will waive fees otherwise payable to it by the Investing Fund in an amount at least equal to any compensation (including fees received pursuant to any plan adopted by a Fund under rule 12b-1 under the Act) received from a Fund by the Investing Fund Advisor, Trustee or Sponsor or an affiliated person of the Investing Fund Advisor, Trustee or Sponsor, other than any advisory fees paid to the Investing Fund Advisor, Trustee or Sponsor or its affiliated person by a Fund, in connection with  the investment by the Investing Fund in the Fund. Applicants also propose a condition to prevent any sales charges or service fees on shares of an Investing Fund from exceeding the limits applicable to a fund of funds set forth in NASD Conduct Rule 2830.[26] 

14. Applicants submit that the proposed arrangement will not create an overly complex fund structure. Applicants note that a Fund will be prohibited from acquiring securities of any investment company or company relying on sections 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act in excess of the limits contained in section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Act, except to the extent permitted by exemptive relief from the Commission permitting the Fund to purchase shares of other investment companies for short-term cash management purposes.
15. To ensure that the Investing Funds understand and comply with the terms and conditions of the requested order, any Investing Fund that intends to invest in a Fund in reliance on the requested order will be required to enter into a participation agreement (“FOF Participation Agreement”) with the Fund. The FOF Participation Agreement will include an acknowledgment from the Investing Fund that it may rely on the order only to invest in the Funds and not in any other investment company.
Sections 17(a)(1) and (2) of the Act
16. Section 17(a) of the Act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company, or an affiliated person of such a person (“second tier affiliate”), from selling any security to or purchasing any security from the company. Section 2(a)(3) of the Act defines “affiliated person” to include any person directly or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding with power to vote, 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the other person and any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, the other person. Section 2(a)(9) of the Act defines “control” as the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company and provides that a control relationship will be presumed where one person owns more than 25% of another person's voting securities. Each Fund may be deemed to be controlled by an Adviser and hence affiliated persons of each other. In addition, the Funds may be deemed to be under common control with any other registered investment company (or series thereof) advised by an Adviser (an “Affiliated Fund”).
17. Applicants request an exemption under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act from sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(2) of the Act to permit in-kind purchases and redemptions of Creation Units by persons that are affiliated persons or second tier affiliates of the Funds solely by virtue of one or more of the following: (a) Holding 5% or more, or in excess of 25% of the outstanding Shares of one or more Funds; (b) having an affiliation with a person with an ownership interest described in (a); or (c) holding 5% or more, or more than 25% of the Shares of one or more Affiliated Funds.[27] 
           Applicants also request an exemption in order to permit a Fund to sell its Shares to, and purchase its Shares from, an Investing Fund and to engage in any accompanying in-kind transactions with certain Investing Funds of which the Funds are affiliated persons or a second-tier affiliates.[28] 

18. Applicants assert that no useful purpose would be served by prohibiting such affiliated persons from making in-kind purchases or in-kind redemptions of Shares of a Fund in Creation Units. Both the deposit procedures for in-kind purchases of Creation Units and the redemption procedures for in-kind redemptions will be effected in exactly the same manner for all purchases and redemptions, regardless of size or number. Absent the circumstances discussed in section I.E.1.a of the application, on each Business Day the Deposit Instruments and Redemption Instruments available for a Fund will be the same for all purchasers and redeemers, respectively, and will correspond pro rata to the Fund's Portfolio Instruments. Applicants state that the method of valuing Portfolio Instruments held by a Fund is the same as that used for calculating the value of in-kind purchases or redemptions and therefore, creates no opportunity for affiliated persons or the Applicants to effect a transaction detrimental to other holders of Shares of that Fund. Applicants note that any consideration paid for the purchase or redemption of Shares directly from a Fund (including for any affiliated person and including any Investing Fund) will be based on the NAV of the Fund in accordance with policies and procedures set forth in the Fund's registration statement.[29] 
           Applicants do not believe that in-kind purchases and redemptions will result in abusive self-dealing or overreaching of the Fund.
19. Applicants also submit that the sale of Shares to and redemption of Shares from an Investing Fund meets the standards for relief under sections 17(b) and 6(c) of the Act. Applicants also state that the proposed transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the Act and appropriate in the public interest.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants agree that any order of the Commission granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
A. Actively-Managed Exchange-Traded Fund Relief
1. As long as a Fund operates in reliance on the requested order, the Shares of the Fund will be listed on a Stock Exchange.
2. Neither the Trust nor any Fund will be advertised or marketed as an open-end investment company or a mutual fund. Any advertising material that describes the purchase or sale of Creation Units or refers to redeemability will prominently disclose that the Shares are not individually redeemable and that owners of the Shares may acquire those Shares from the Fund and tender those Shares for redemption to the Fund in Creation Units only.
3. The Web site for the Funds, which is and will be publicly accessible at no charge, will contain, on a per Share basis, for each Fund the prior Business Day's NAV and the market closing price or Bid/Ask Price, and a calculation of the premium or discount of the market closing price or Bid/Ask Price against such NAV.
4. On each Business Day, before commencement of trading in Shares on  the Stock Exchange, the Fund will disclose on its Web site the identities and quantities of the Portfolio Instruments held by the Fund that will form the basis for the Fund's calculation of NAV at the end of the Business Day.
5. The Adviser or any Subadviser, directly or indirectly, will not cause any Authorized Participant (or any investor on whose behalf an Authorized Participant may transact with the Fund) to acquire any Deposit Instrument for the Fund through a transaction in which the Fund could not engage directly.
6. The requested relief to permit ETF operations will expire on the effective date of any Commission rule under the Act that provides relief permitting the operation of actively managed exchange-traded funds.
B. Section 12(d)(1) Relief
1. The members of the Investing Fund's Advisory Group will not control (individually or in the aggregate) a Fund within the meaning of section 2(a)(9) of the Act. The members of the Investing Fund's Subadvisory Group will not control (individually or in the aggregate) a Fund within the meaning of section 2(a)(9) of the Act. If, as a result of a decrease in the outstanding voting securities of a Fund, the Investing Fund's Advisory Group or the Investing Fund's Subadvisory Group, each in the aggregate, becomes a holder of more than 25 percent of the outstanding voting securities of a Fund, it will vote its Shares of the Fund in the same proportion as the vote of all other holders of the Fund's Shares. This condition does not apply to the Investing Fund's Subadvisory Group with respect to a Fund for which the Investing Fund Subadviser or a person controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Investing Fund Subadviser acts as the investment adviser within the meaning of section 2(a)(20)(A) of the Act.
2. No Investing Fund or Investing Fund Affiliate will cause any existing or potential investment by the Investing Fund in a Fund to influence the terms of any services or transactions between the Investing Fund or an Investing Fund Affiliate and the Fund or a Fund Affiliate.
3. The board of directors or trustees of an Investing Management Company, including a majority of the disinterested directors or trustees, will adopt procedures reasonably designed to assure that the Investing Fund Advisor and any Investing Fund Subadviser are conducting the investment program of the Investing Management Company without taking into account any consideration received by the Investing Management Company or an Investing Fund Affiliate from a Fund or a Fund Affiliate in connection with any services or transactions.
4. Once an investment by an Investing Fund in Shares of a Fund exceeds the limit in section 12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, the board of the Fund (“Board”), including a majority of the disinterested Board members, will determine that any consideration paid by the Fund to the Investing Fund or an Investing Fund Affiliate in connection with any services or transactions: (i) Is fair and reasonable in relation to the nature and quality of the services and benefits received by the Fund; (ii) is within the range of consideration that the Fund would be required to pay to another unaffiliated entity in connection with the same services or transactions; and (iii) does not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned. This condition does not apply with respect to any services or transactions between a Fund and its investment adviser(s), or any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with such investment adviser(s).
5. The Investing Fund Advisor, or Trustee or Sponsor, as applicable, will waive fees otherwise payable to it by the Investing Fund in an amount at least equal to any compensation (including fees received pursuant to any plan adopted by a Fund under rule 12b-1 under the Act) received from a Fund by the Investing Fund Advisor, or Trustee or Sponsor, or an affiliated person of the Investing Fund Advisor, or Trustee or Sponsor, other than any advisory fees paid to the Investing Fund Advisor, or Trustee, or Sponsor, or its affiliated person by the Fund, in connection with the investment by the Investing Fund in the Fund. Any Investing Fund Subadviser will waive fees otherwise payable to the Investing Fund Subadviser, directly or indirectly, by the Investing Management Company in an amount at least equal to any compensation received from a Fund by the Investing Fund Subadviser, or an affiliated person of the Investing Fund Subadviser, other than any advisory fees paid to the Investing Fund Subadviser or its affiliated person by the Fund, in connection with the investment by the Investing Management Company in the Fund made at the direction of the Investing Fund Subadviser. In the event that the Investing Fund Subadviser waives fees, the benefit of the waiver will be passed through to the Investing Management Company.
6. No Investing Fund or Investing Fund Affiliate (except to the extent it is acting in its capacity as an investment adviser to a Fund) will cause a Fund to purchase a security in an Affiliated Underwriting.
7. The Board of a Fund, including a majority of the disinterested Board members, will adopt procedures reasonably designed to monitor any purchases of securities by the Fund in an Affiliated Underwriting, once an investment by an Investing Fund in the securities of the Fund exceeds the limit of section 12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, including any purchases made directly from an Underwriting Affiliate. The Board will review these purchases periodically, but no less frequently than annually, to determine whether the purchases were influenced by the investment by the Investing Fund in the Fund. The Board will consider, among other things: (i) Whether the purchases were consistent with the investment objectives and policies of the Fund; (ii) how the performance of securities purchased in an Affiliated Underwriting compares to the performance of comparable securities purchased during a comparable period of time in underwritings other than Affiliated Underwritings or to a benchmark such as a comparable market index; and (iii) whether the amount of securities purchased by the Fund in Affiliated Underwritings and the amount purchased directly from an Underwriting Affiliate have changed significantly from prior years. The Board will take any appropriate actions based on its review, including, if appropriate, the institution of procedures designed to assure that purchases of securities in Affiliated Underwritings are in the best interest of shareholders.
8. Each Fund will maintain and preserve permanently in an easily accessible place a written copy of the procedures described in the preceding condition, and any modifications to such procedures, and will maintain and preserve for a period of not less than six years from the end of the fiscal year in which any purchase in an Affiliated Underwriting occurred, the first two years in an easily accessible place, a written record of each purchase of securities in Affiliated Underwritings once an investment by an Investing Fund in the securities of the Fund exceeds the limit of section 12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, setting forth from whom the securities were acquired, the identity of the underwriting syndicate's members, the terms of the purchase, and the information or materials upon which the Board's determinations were made.
9. Before investing in a Fund in excess of the limits in section 12(d)(1)(A), an Investing Fund will  execute a FOF Participation Agreement with the Fund stating that their respective boards of directors or trustees and their investment advisers, or Trustee and Sponsor, as applicable, understand the terms and conditions of the order, and agree to fulfill their responsibilities under the order. At the time of its investment in shares of a Fund in excess of the limit in section 12(d)(1)(A)(i), an Investing Fund will notify the Fund of the investment. At such time, the Investing Fund will also transmit to the Fund a list of the names of each Investing Fund Affiliate and Underwriting Affiliate. The Investing Fund will notify the Fund of any changes to the list as soon as reasonably practicable after a change occurs. The Fund and the Investing Fund will maintain and preserve a copy of the order, the FOF Participation Agreement, and the list with any updated information for the duration of the investment and for a period of not less than six years thereafter, the first two years in an easily accessible place.
10. Before approving any advisory contract under section 15 of the Act, the board of directors or trustees of each Investing Management Company, including a majority of the disinterested directors or trustees, will find that the advisory fees charged under such contract are based on services provided that will be in addition to, rather than duplicative of, the services provided under the advisory contract(s) of any Fund in which the Investing Management Company may invest. These findings and their basis will be recorded fully in the minute books of the appropriate Investing Management Company.
11. Any sales charges and/or service fees charged with respect to shares of an Investing Fund will not exceed the limits applicable to a fund of funds as set forth in NASD Conduct Rule 2830.
12. No Fund relying on this section 12(d)(1) relief will acquire securities of any investment company or company relying on section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act in excess of the limits contained in section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Act, except to the extent permitted by exemptive relief from the Commission permitting the Fund to purchase shares of other investment companies for short-term cash management purposes.

 
For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority.
Kevin M. O'Neill,
Deputy Secretary.

        Back to Citation
      


3.
     All entities that currently intend to rely on the order are named as applicants. Any entity that relies on the order in the future will comply with the terms and conditions of the application. An Investing Fund (as defined below) may rely on the order only to invest in Funds and not in any other registered investment company.

4.
     The Funds may invest in exchange-traded products that invest primarily in commodities or currency but otherwise operate in a manner similar to ETFs. The Funds may also invest in exchange-traded notes.

        Back to Citation
      


7.
     If a Fund invests in derivatives: (a) The Board periodically will review and approve (i) the Fund's use of derivatives and (ii) how the Fund's investment adviser assesses and manages risk with respect to the Fund's use of derivatives; and (b) the Fund's disclosure of its use of derivatives in its offering documents and periodic reports will be consistent with relevant Commission and staff guidance.

        Back to Citation
      


8.
     Depositary Receipts are typically issued by a financial institution, a “depositary”, and evidence ownership in a security or pool of securities that have been deposited with the depositary. No affiliated persons of applicants, any Adviser, Subadviser or the Funds will serve as the depositary bank for any Depositary Receipts held by a Fund.

        Back to Citation
      


9.
     In no case, however, will such a Fund rely on the exemption from Section 12(d)(1) being requested in the application.

        Back to Citation
      


10.
     Applicants anticipate that there may be Investing Funds that are not part of the same group of investment companies as the Funds, but are subadvised by an Adviser.

        Back to Citation
      


11.
     The Funds must comply with the federal securities laws in accepting Deposit Instruments and satisfying redemptions with Redemption Instruments, including that the Deposit Instruments and Redemption Instruments are sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act. In accepting Deposit Instruments and satisfying redemptions with Redemption Instruments that are restricted securities eligible for resale pursuant to rule 144A under the Securities Act, the Funds will comply with the conditions of rule 144A.

        Back to Citation
      


12.
     “Business Day” is defined to include any day that the Trust is open for business as required by Section 22(e) of the Act.

        Back to Citation

14.
     A tradeable round lot for a security will be the standard unit of trading in that particular type of security in its primary market.

        Back to Citation
      


15.
     To the extent required by section 18(f) of the Act, Portfolio Instruments and/or cash held in a Fund's portfolio will be segregated to cover Short Positions in such portfolio. See, Securities Trading Practices of Registered Investment companies, Investment company Act Rel. No. 10666 (Apr. 18, 1979).

        Back to Citation
      


16.
     This includes instruments that can be transferred in kind only with the consent of the original counterparty to the extent the Fund does not intend to seek such consents.

        Back to Citation
      


17.
     Because these instruments will be excluded from the In-kind Basket, their value will be reflected in the determination of the Balancing Amount (defined below).

        Back to Citation
      


18.
     In determining whether a particular Fund will sell or redeem Creation Units entirely on a cash or in-kind basis (whether for a given day or a given order), the key consideration will be the benefit that would accrue to the Fund and its investors. Purchases of Creation Units either on an all cash basis or in-kind are expected to be neutral to the Funds from a tax perspective. In contrast, cash redemptions typically require selling portfolio holdings, which may result in adverse tax consequences for the remaining Fund shareholders that would not occur with an in-kind redemption. As a result, tax considerations may warrant in-kind redemptions.

        Back to Citation
      


19.
     A “custom order” is any purchase or redemption of Shares made in whole or in part on a cash basis in reliance on clause (e)(i) or (e)(ii).

        Back to Citation
      


20.
     Where a Fund, as described in section I.E.1.a, permits an in-kind purchaser or redeemer to deposit or receive cash in lieu of one or more Deposit or Redemption Instruments, the purchaser or redeemer may be assessed a higher Transaction Fee to offset the transaction cost to the Fund of buying or selling those particular Deposit or Redemption Instruments.

        Back to Citation
      


21.
     Applicants state that unlike other Stock Exchanges where a Specialist may oversee trading in Shares, on NASDAQ, numerous Market Makers buy and sell Shares for their own accounts. If Shares are listed on NASDAQ, no Specialist will be contractually obligated to make a market in Shares. Rather, under NASDAQ's listing requirements, two or more Market Makers will be registered in Shares and required to make a continuous, two-sided market or face regulatory sanctions. No Market Maker or Specialist will be an affiliated person, or an affiliated person of an affiliated person, of the Funds, except within Section 2(a)(3)(A) or (C) of the Act due to ownership of Shares, as described below.

        Back to Citation
      


22.
     Shares will be registered in book-entry form only. DTC or its nominee will be the record or registered owner of all outstanding Shares. Beneficial ownership of Shares will be shown on the records of DTC or DTC Participants.

        Back to Citation
      


23.
     Applicants note that under accounting procedures followed by the Funds, trades made on the prior Business Day will be booked and reflected in NAV on the current Business Day. Accordingly, the Funds will be able to disclose at the beginning of the Business Day the portfolio that will form the basis for the NAV calculation at the end of the Business Day.

        Back to Citation
      


24.
     Applicants acknowledge that no relief obtained from the requirements of section 22(e) will affect any obligations that they have under rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act. Rule 15c6-1 requires that most securities transactions be settled within three business days of the trade date.

        Back to Citation
      


25.
     An “Investing Fund Affiliate” is defined as the Investing Fund Advisor, Investing Fund Subadviser, Sponsor, promoter and principal underwriter of an Investing Fund, and any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with any of these entities. A “Fund Affiliate” is defined as an investment adviser, promoter or principal underwriter of a Fund and any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with any of these entities.

        Back to Citation
      


26.
     Any references to NASD Conduct Rule 2830 include any successor or replacement rule to NASD Conduct Rule 2830 that may be adopted by FINRA.

        Back to Citation
      


27.
     Applicants are not seeking relief from section 17(a) for, and the requested relief will not apply to, transactions where a Fund could be deemed an affiliated person, or an affiliated person of an affiliated person, of an Investing Fund because an investment adviser to the Funds is also an investment adviser to an Investing Fund.

        Back to Citation
      


28.
     Applicants expect most Investing Funds will purchase Shares in the secondary market and will not purchase Creation Units directly from a Fund. To the extent that purchases and sales of Shares occur in the secondary market and not through principal transactions directly between an Investing Fund and a Fund, relief from section 17(a) would not be necessary. However, the requested relief would apply to direct sales of Shares in Creation Units by a Fund to an Investing Fund and redemptions of those Shares. The requested relief is also intended to cover any in-kind transactions that may accompany such sales and redemptions.

        Back to Citation
      


29.
     Applicants acknowledge that the receipt of compensation by (a) an affiliated person of an Investing Fund, or an affiliated person of such person, for the purchase by the Investing Fund of Shares of the Fund or (b) an affiliated person of a Fund, or an affiliated person of such person, for the sale by the Fund of its Shares to an Investing Fund, may be prohibited by section 17(e)(1) of the Act. The FOF Participation Agreement also will include this acknowledgment.

Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
