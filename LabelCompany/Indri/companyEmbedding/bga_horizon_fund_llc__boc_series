Has this affected your positioning in the banking sector?We think that concerns on non-performing loan from local government financing platform are overdone. There are potential bad debts from those vehicles in the coming years but the Chinese banking sector has enough liquidity and provisions to cover them. In addition, the cash-rich Chinese government has capacity to absorb the losses therefore the systematic risk is very low. While we seem to have a very big exposure to the financials sector, this is mainly in insurance and property, our actual exposure to commercials lenders in China is 19% as at end June. We are underweight Chinese banks despite their attractive valuations because there is a lack of any near term catalyst and there is clearly a near term overhang as China tries to resolve the local government debt problem.Inflation hit a 3-year high of 6.4% in June*, where do you see it heading?June’s CPI figure was within market expectations. Of the 6.4% CPI growth in June, 3.7%* were contributed by the carryover effect of price increases last year (i.e. inflation not due to actual price increases but on price increases in the previous year). According to China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the carryover effect peaked in June and new factors that push up prices have been under the government's control. Regarding the outlook of inflation, we think that CPI may have peaked near-term and inflation may start weakening over the next two months driven by the government's anti-inflation measures, tighter liquidity and as global commodity prices cool. Food supply is also improving, with the exception of pork which will also help ease inflation pressure. However, given increasing wage pressures, inflation may stay elevated after peaking out in the near term.China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), an indicator of growth, fell further to 50.9%* in June, does this raise concerns about China’s growth?A reading above 50 indicates that the economy is still in expansion mode and despite the tightening policies, China’s Q2 GDP growth announced on 14 July came in at 9.5%**. We think that an imminent hard landing is highly unlikely because even against the backdrop of monetary tightening, there are indications that the government is loosening their stance on targeted areas of the economy to support growth. The authorities are stepping up on social housing construction efforts in the second half of the year in order to meet their target of beginning construction of 10 million subsidized homes by the end of October. They have also finalised a series of income tax reforms on 30 June this year that is a boost to the consumption story in the long run.What is the impact of the income tax reform?On the back of proposed tax reforms effective September 2011, China’s personal income tax exemption threshold will be lifted from RMB2,000/mth to RMB3,500/mth. According to China’s Ministry of Finance, this is expected to reduce the number of personal income tax payers from 84 million to 24 million. The tax reform should benefit the lower-middle income group and soften the impact of inflationary pressure. Medium to longer term, there could also be a mild positive impact on the consumer sector, certainly it is beneficial towards China’s aim to narrow income inequality and boost consumption in China in the long term. On the fiscal side, the new tax code is expected to reduce fiscal revenue in 2011 by just 0.5% and will have little or no impact on China’s fiscal spending plans.Inflation, domestic tightening and growth concerns have weighed on Chinese equities for the first half of the year, what is your outlook for the second half?Market sentiment remains fragile for now given the long-drawn battle with inflation and the uncertainty in growth outlook. However we think that investors can look forward to a more upbeat second half in light of a more positive inflation outlook. Fixed asset investment growth will be supported by massive efforts to begin construction of 10 million units of social housing this year and consumption remains robust. We expect ongoing tightening will be carried forward less aggressively as well as policymakers remain cautious about the negative impact of aggressive rate hikes. China's economy is only slowing gently and is still seen growing by more than 9% in 2011. Therefore despite the noise in the market, we believe that there is room for optimism in Chinese equities especially at the current levels (11.2x 2011 P/E***) they are trading at.How is the Henderson Horizon Fund – China Fund positioned at the moment?We increased our overweight to consumer discretionary stocks from 12% in May to 22.7% in June having participated in Prada’s IPO as we like their exposure to the booming luxury goods consumption story in Asia and also see potential for further operating margin improvement in their business. We also raised our stake in Brilliance China Automotive, BMW’s manufacturer in China for the same reason. Another new holding is in GOME Electrical, post restructuring the company is re-focusing on store expansion, driving growth and margin improvement.In terms of the other sectors, the Fund’s biggest exposure is to financials, though mainly in insurance and property, we are underweight banks as mentioned earlier. We continue to like materials as strong fixed asset investment growth provides solid support to earnings, one of our bigger bets in this sector is in BBMG, a building materials manufacturer, which stands to benefit from the massive social housing projects. Our biggest shorts remain in Hong Kong utilities and telecoms companies that are overvalued for their earnings growth prospects.Will you consider reducing the Fund’s long exposure or buying put options at this point?We are unlikely to do so given the current valuations. While market sentiment is fragile, Chinese equities have been range bound and close to flat for nearly 2 years. We think that over the near term, especially in view of a more subdued inflation outlook, the possibility of further upside outweighs the risks of a hefty correction in the market.Temasek Holdings recently reduced their stakes in Bank of China (BOC) and China Construction Bank (CCB), what do you think prompted that move?We would not try to read too much from Temasek’s disposal. We do not think it is because they have a particularly bearish view on the Chinese banking sector and it seemed more like an investment decision to rebalance their portfolio. After trimming their stakes in the two lenders for US$3.6 billion, Temasek still holds about US$14 billion of CCB's shares and about US$3 billion of BOC's stock. In a statement that was made during a press briefing later, Temasek re-iterated that “we have faith in the policies of the Chinese government in the long term and we are bullish on China in the long term.” About 20% of the Temasek’s portfolio is still invested in China.Why are you short in MTR?The company’s core railway operation is steady and defensive, however this accounts for less than 60% of its net asset value (NAV). The rest of its NAV is contributed by its property development and property investment businesses which contributed to a significant portion of the company’s earnings in the past. Earnings growth will however be adversely affected by a weak project pipeline going forward. Even though the company is trading at a 20-30% discount to its NAV and 18x 2011 consensus PE***, we see limited upside on its share price as most conglomerates are trading at a 20% discount at least. Note: Reference to individual companies should not be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell the same and does not purport to represent or warrant the outcome of any investment strategy, program or product.*Source: China’s NBS, as at 10 July 2011**Source: China’s NBS, as at 14 July 2011***Source: Henderson Global Investors, Bloomberg, as at 12 July 2011Key investment risks to be considered before investingThe Fund primarily invests in equity securities and equity instruments of companies listed in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan and may also invest in companies incorporated elsewhere that have significant assets, business, production, trading activity or other interests in China, Hong Kong or Taiwan.The Fund may invest a substantial amount of its assets in companies in China (emerging market) which may involve a higher concentration of risk and also may experience higher risks of economic, political, regulatory and social development changes. Investments in emerging market may be less liquid and more volatile than funds that invest in developed and more geographically diversified markets. The Fund uses trading strategies that use financial derivative instruments (“FDI”) which may be unsuccessful due to a number of reasons; including volatile market conditions, imperfect correlation between the movements in securities on which derivatives are based, lack of liquidity within markets and counterparty default risk. The Fund typically holds long and short positions mainly through the use of FDI combining with direct investments and its total gross market exposure may exceed 100%. Such investment strategy and the use of FDI are inherently volatile and depending on market condition, the Fund could potentially be exposed to additional risk and costs should the market move against it and incur losses consequently.Investments in the Fund involve varying degree of investment risks (eg. market, legal, financial, interest rate, currency, etc). In extreme market conditions, you may lose your entire investment in the Fund.Note: The above investment risks summary may not have set out all the risks and other significant aspects involved in investing in the Fund. You are advised to read the Prospectus of the Fund for more details of the investment risks.Past performance is not a guide to future performance. The value of an investment and the income from it can fall as well as rise and you may not get back the amount originally invested.The information in this article does not qualify as an investment recommendation.ShareAndrew MattockFollowUnfollow101Following
