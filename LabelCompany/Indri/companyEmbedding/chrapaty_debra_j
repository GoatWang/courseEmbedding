Cisco welcomes Debra Chrapaty, new SVP of Collaboration Software Group
David McCulloch - December 4, 2009 - 5 Comments      					




You may have caught the rumor a few weeks back that former E*TRADE, Microsoft and NBA executive, Debra Chrapaty, was about to join Cisco. Well, we can confirm on The Platform today that the rumor was true and that Debra did in fact join us just before Cisco’s recent Collaboration Summit in San Francisco.

Debra has taken over the reins of Cisco’s Collaboration Software Group (the home of our WebEx Collaboration Suite) with no smaller mission than to transform the way we all work.
I caught up with the former Information Week ‘Chief of the Year’ as she marked her one month anniversary at Cisco. I asked her what brought her to us; what Cisco’s recent collaboration announcements tell us about the future strategy of her group, and how that strategy will fit into Cisco’s broader collaboration solutions portfolio as we drive to deliver even more value to our customers.

Property Data + People Data
Our reports include the traditional info you’d expect to find about a property (ownership, deeds, tax info, etc.), but we dig deeper and offer background records on people too.
Find criminal background records on owners, registered sex offenders in the neighborhood, and more.










The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.



Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"
