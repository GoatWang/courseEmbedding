			Edward J. DiPaolo, age 63, has served as director for Evolution since 2004. He currently serves as our Lead Independent Director, Chairman of our Nominating Committee, and as a member of our Audit and Compensation Committees. Mr. DiPaolo has been a Senior Advisor at Duff & Phelps Securities, LLC since 2011. Prior to that, he was an Energy Partner at Growth Capital Partners, L.P. for eight years following his 27 years at Halliburton Company, where he last served as Group Senior Vice President of Global Business Development. Prior roles at Halliburton included North American Regional Vice President and Far East Regional Vice President. In those roles, he was responsible for overall operations of Halliburton Energy Services' North America and Far East regions. Mr. DiPaolo currently serves as Chairman of the Board for Seventy Seven Energy, Inc. and as a Director for Willbros Group Inc., both of which are public companies, as well as on several private company boards. He previously served as a director and Interim Chairman of the Board of Directors of Boots and Coots, Inc. prior to its sale to Halliburton; as a director of Superior Well Services, Inc. prior to its sale to Nabors Industries, Inc; and as a director of Inncore Subsurface Technologies prior to its sale to BJ Services Company. Mr. DiPaolo received his undergraduate degree in Agricultural Engineering from West Virginia University in 1976 and currently serves on the Advisory Board for the West Virginia University College of Engineering. We believe Mr. DiPaolo's extensive experience in oilfield service, corporate advisory roles, education and Executive and Board of Director service to public and private companies qualifies Mr. DiPaolo to serve on our Board, his assigned Committees and as our Lead Independent Director.
