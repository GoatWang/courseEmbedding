Job Details

(Nasdaq: BDCV) is a closed-end fund (regulated as a business development company, or BDC, under the Investment Company Act of 1940) that specializes in making pre-IPO investments in emerging growth companies that are committed to and capable of becoming public. We provide investors with the ability to participate in a publicly traded fund that allows our stockholders to share in the potential value accretion that we believe typically occurs once a company transforms from private to public status, or what we refer to as the private to public valuation arbitrage. Our investment strategy can be summarized as: buy privately, sell publicly, capture the difference.
