Biography
Paul Goddard is an agile coach with experience of working with several scrum teams and projects, and is a keen practitioner and trainer of scrum and agile delivery.
Starting as one of the first practicing ScrumMasters within BT (formerly British Telecom), he now acts as an independent coach for teams new to scrum and agile techniques. His coaching skills have been used on some of the largest agile transformation projects in the world to date, including multiple geographically dispersed teams using an offshore model. Paul's experience with enterprise scrum was widened while acting as a ScrumMaster for Nokia where he was involved with both applying, teaching and coaching scrum. 
As an independent coach and trainer, Paul has aided several other companies on their agile journeys in a variety of industries ranging from small independent holiday travel companies through to multi-national technology and consultancy providers.
His first book Improv-ing Agile Teams: Using Creativity To Unlock Creativity brings together two of his passions; coaching agile teams and improvisational theatre. The principles and practices are so closely linked, he uses them every day of his working and personal life. A regular speaker at agile conferences worldwide, Paul is also a long-standing member and contributor to the agile community in the UK and Europe.
You can contact Paul through www.agilify.co.uk.

Articles I've written
An Inside Job
External consultants bring a wealth of experience and an objective perspective to the classroom. However, we have been experimenting with running internal certified ScrumMaster courses ourselves. Bringing the training in-house has resulted in some significant benefits but has also brought some significant challenges.The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Scrum
Paul Goddard explores the parallels between agile development and music composition and performance. 
Ouija Board Estimation
During a recent training course I ran, one of the delegates made a joke about the nature of agile estimation in Scrum teams resembling a "séance"; whereby the team gathers around the table and stares at a number of user story cards expecting something unnatural to happen. How true!  This gave me an idea for a different type of iterative estimation that I tried in practice with ‘Team Woodstock’.Ouija Board Estimation

About the Course
Agenda
Audience
Certification





This fun two–day interactive course shows you how to leverage Scrum to optimise value creation and customer satisfaction.  Learn how customers and business partners can use Scrum to help drive results. This course covers the fundamentals of the Scrum framework for agile project management, with more emphasis on the role of the Product Owner. Certified Scrum Product Owner is the ultimate guide to becoming an effective Product Owner.
This course is aimed at those likely to be undertaking that role on a Scrum project, or those looking to improve their skill as a practising Product Owner and is popular for clients who need closer collaboration between the customer and the delivery team, in order to focus on priority work and sustain high quality solutions.
Delegates will benefit from a balanced blend of theory and practical exercises which promote the importance of the Product Owner role in the Scrum team.
As Certified Scrum Trainers we are approved by the Scrum Alliance; we have experienced Scrum implementations of all sizes and have faced and resolved many barriers to Scrum along the way. 



 


What is Scrum?
Product Backlogs
Release Planning
Product Visioning
User Stories
Personas
Prioritisation Techniques
Estimation Theory
The Product Owner Role
Reporting & Release Management
 

Product Managers, project managers, account managers, sales teams, programme managers, client representatives etc. As this course focusses on the Product Owner role, those with direct customer engagment and budget responsibilities will gain most from this course. 
Scrum is defined completely in the Scrum Guide by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland, the originators of Scrum. We recommend you read the Scrum Guide prior to attending this course. 


Following successful completion of the course, you will be registered as a Certified Scrum Product Owner, which includes a one-year membership in the Scrum Alliance, where additional material and information is available. 
SEUs: This course qualifies as 16 Scrum Educational Units (SEUs) toward the 70 required to become a Certified Scrum Professional (CSP).
PMPs: This course counts for 15 Professional Development Units (PDUs).
This course also counts as 15 of the 21 contact hours needed of Agile Project Management Training to be eligible for the PMI Agile Certified Practitioner (PMI-ACP) certification.
