1: Operating profit is a non-GAAP measure and excludes the impact of the Ogden exceptional charge of £475 million before tax.  2: 2016 and 2015 exclude the impact from an outward quota share reinsurance agreement written in 2015 and completed in 2016 in Aviva Insurance Limited (AIL).  3: Includes a notional reset of transitional measures to reflect interest rates at 31 December 2016, the impact of the disposal of Antarius and changes to UK tax rules.  4: Calculated based on a shareholder view which excludes the equal contribution to own funds and SCR of fully ring-fenced with-profit funds and staff pension schemes in surplus.

Aviva acquires HPI Group Holdings Ltd in the UK







Aviva acquires HPI Group Holdings Ltd in the UK













16 Aug 2004
Aviva plc ("Aviva") announces that Norwich Union Insurance
("NUI"), its UK general insurance business, has acquired the entire
share capital of HPI Group Holdings Ltd ("HPI") from Phoenix Equity
Partners for Ł118.5 million in cash and Ł1.5 million in loan
notes.
HPI is the UK’s leading provider of vehicle status checks
for used-car purchasers in the UK with around 60% market share. In
2003, there were 6.8 million used-car transactions in the UK of
which 60% were checked.
The acquisition will provide NUI with an access point to capture
new customers at a key stage of their purchasing decision –
buying a new car is the second biggest trigger point for people to
change their insurer. The deal will also help HPI to leverage its
existing business plan as part of the UK’s largest general
insurer. In particular, it will aim to develop its position in
relation to private car sales where only 5% of the 2.9 million
used-car sales per annum are checked.
This acquisition also supports NUI’s objective of
extending its service offering and increasing its level of
non-insurance income.
HPI’s sales grew by 36% to Ł22.5 million in the two years
to March 2004 and pre-tax trading profit for the calendar year 2004
is estimated to be Ł10 million. The estimated fair value of
HPI’s net assets is Ł6 million.
Patrick Snowball, chief executive, Norwich Union Insurance and
an executive director of Aviva plc, said: "HPI is fast growing with
significant opportunities to expand its own business, whilst
providing a key access point for Norwich Union Insurance to capture
new insurance customers."

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating.

Aviva Life Insurance Bags 'Product of the Year 2017' - for Aviva Heart Care, India's First Heart Insurance for Couples
BusinessWire India
New Delhi, Delhi, India, May 24, 2017



Aviva Heart Care voted as Product of the Year 2017, for Product Innovation in the Insurance Category
Product of the Year is awarded to the winners selected through a consumer research conducted by Neilson across the country
Product of the Year operates in 37 countries and is an International Standard of Consumer Recognition
Aviva Heart Care, ‘2 Hearts, 1 Plan’ – is a unique joint coverage policy for couples 

Aviva Heart Care, a premium product of Aviva Life Insurance, one of India’s leading private insurance companies, has been voted the ‘ 
 Product of the Year 2017’ by Product of the Year (POY) India. Aviva Heart Care was voted winner for 
 Product Innovation in the 
  Insurance Category 2017. 
 
 Product of the Year (POY) is selected through a consumer research conducted by 
 Neilson across India to identify innovation through a 
 100% face to face consumer voting via an in-depth survey. POY is an 
 International Standard of Consumer Recognition and celebrates the best product innovations across categories in 37 countries. This research is the direct outcome of the pulse of consumers in India and follows a robust methodology. 
 
 The inception of 
 Aviva Heart Care was rooted in the Aviva philosophy of 
 Defy Uncertainty in the lives of their customers. This product addressed an 
 innovative insight into customers’ lives, where they felt vulnerable against cardiac disease given its high incidence in India. A customer focused approach coupled with the core idea of addressing the needs of today’s rapidly evolving customers, made this product fill this need gap. Aviva Heart Care as a product not only brought heart health to the fore but also encouraged couples to secure their hearts together, 
 the first of a kind health insurance plan for couples in India. And the fact that customers themselves recognized and appreciated the importance of this innovative relevant proposition in their lives is significant. 
 
 Commenting on bagging the prestigious accolade, 
 Ms. Anjali Malhotra, Chief Customer Marketing and Digital Officer, Aviva Life Insurance said, “Winning this accolade is certainly a proud moment for us, as our customers have borne testimony to it being a unique concept that they have loved! This is what 
 Good Customer Outcomes are all about! We are truly making a difference to the lives of real customers around us with an idea that is relevant and unique, and that has found a resonance in their lives.”

About Product of the Year (POY)

 Product of the Year is the only consumer product award that rewards innovation and is voted on by real consumers.

Backed by the votes of 60,000 consumers, the Product of the Year accepts entries every year that demonstrate innovation and were launched within the previous year. Entered products are then placed into specific categories such as insurance, food, beverages, personal care, household care, etc. with a product then being chosen as a winner in its category through a nationally representative online study conducted by Neilson.
