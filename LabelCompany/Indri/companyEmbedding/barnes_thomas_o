In 1950's Boston, the Irish Republican Army is running guns and killing witnesses. Cal and Dante are committed to stopping them.When a body is discovered at the Charlestown locks--tarred, feathered and shot to death--it appears to be a gangland killing, and is almost immediately dismissed. However, Cal O'Brien's cousin, Boston PD detective Owen Lackey, recognizes the murder style as the typical retribution for IRA informers. Combined with a tip-off about a boat coming into Boston weighed down with stolen guns and ammunition, the body in the locks hints that much more may be at stake than a one-off hit.Serpents in the Cold introduced us to Cal and Dante, whose previous investigation brought them to the highest ranks of Boston's political elite. This time, Cal and Dante descend into the city's shadowy underbelly--a world of packed dance halls, Irish wakes, and funeral parlors. There they discover a terrorist plot that will shake the city to its core and bring them head-to-head not only with Cal's past, but with the IRA Army Council itself.

Editorial Reviews


Publishers Weekly
04/04/2016It’s June 1954, and an oppressive heat entombs Boston in O’Malley and Purdy’s well-written if bleak sequel to 2015’s Serpents in the Cold. Their broken antiheroes, Dante Cooper and Cal O’Brien, have each recently suffered a personal loss, and those losses are keenly felt throughout the novel. Heroin addict Dante has a fingertip hold on sobriety, while ex-cop Cal struggles to keep his security business afloat. Both answer the call, though, when Det. Owen Mackey, Cal’s policeman cousin, asks for their help in his pursuit of IRA sympathizers who are running guns and murdering suspected informers. The Irish club scene of the time has a role in the story, as does Dante’s skill at the piano, but the unforgiving temperatures, easy violence, and grim state of the South Boston neighborhoods overwhelm any joy that the bright lights and dance floors might impart. More than one bloody killing will catch readers by surprise. Agent: Richard Abate, 3 Arts Entertainment. (June)

From the Publisher
"Well-written . . . Written with verve . . . Strikingly visual with a very readable style."Benjamin Boulden, Mystery Scene"This brilliant second entry in the Boston Saga sizzles . . . This stunning narrative will enrapture fans of James Crumley and the astonishingly deep and dark Sara Gran."Booklist (starred review)"The authors deliver noir done well in dark-city descriptions and a cast of damaged characters."Kirkus ReviewsPRAISE FOR SERPENTS IN THE COLD:"In the best noir tradition, these co-authors shine a smoky light on lives often lived in the shadows."Carol Iaciofano, WBUR"Like Sara Gran's Dope, Serpents in the Cold lovingly revisits the hardboiled noir. From the dives of Dorchester to the Locke-Ober Café, John Garfield and Richard Widmark would feel right at home in O'Malley and Purdy's bygone, fallen Boston."Stewart O'Nan, author of West of Sunset

Library Journal
05/01/2016In 1950s Boston, a body is discovered tarred and feathered at the Charlestown locks in a fashion typical of a local gang. However, police detective Owen Mackey recalls that the Irish Republican Army (IRA) meted out similar punishment to informants when they ruled the city's underworld before World War II. In addition, Mackey learns that a boat with ties to the IRA recently entered Boston Harbor transporting contraband firearms and ammunition. Mackey enlists O'Brien, his cousin and an ex-cop, and O'Brien's friend Dante Cooper to perform reconnaissance for him. When Mackey is slain, O'Brien and Cooper redouble their efforts to avenge their friend. VERDICT The authors' second installment (after Serpents in the Cold) is a solid addition to the noir genre. Their coarse depictions of Boston will appeal to fans of Dennis Lehane and Robert Parker's Jesse Stone series. New readers should begin with the first book. [See Prepub Alert, 12/14/16.]—Russell Michalak, Goldey-Beacom Coll. Lib., Wilmington, DE

Kirkus Reviews
2016-03-17Tough guys in a tough town as the Irish Republican Army wages war in 1950s Boston. O'Malley and Purdy's sequel to Serpents in the Cold (2015) picks up several years after Cal O'Brien lost his wife in a firebombing, and his mental scars are still deep and raw. He's a former cop, now a private investigator, and recruits his piano-playing, reformed junky pal, Dante Cooper, to help the police in Irish Boston. Owen Mackey, Cal's cousin and a police detective, senses that his case is not just a bizarre murder and asks for their eyes and ears in the Irish neighborhoods of the city. Boston suffers in a heat wave and bodies start showing up. One, tarred and feathered, sends a signal that this is bigger than local gangs at play. In Galway, Sean "the General" Mullen is managing a gun and ammunition trade from Boston to the homeland for the IRA and sends his soldiers to fix the problem of a stalled shipment. The war of Republicans and Royalists is imported to Boston Harbor. It's hard not to compare this novel with its predecessor, especially with an overabundance of references to the back story. But this one drags. Although O'Malley and Purdy do violence extremely well, the suspense in this story is anemic—an endless watch of sitting in cars and drinking, sitting in bars and drinking, Cal and Dante each wallowing in flashbacks to life before trauma. The story starts well as the mystery builds on the body count, but once the reader knows who's on the killing end and who's trying to take control of the missing boatload of guns, it becomes predictable. One good outnumbered shootout to close the loop and the novel ends with a fizzle. This book feels like a place holder for the next. The authors deliver noir done well in dark-city descriptions and a cast of damaged characters but fall short on delivering a thrill.

Bristol based Barnes Group celebrates 160 years in business
Posted on 07/16/2017  by Roundup Contributor  in Bristol Roundup


Wallace Barnes
Bristol based Barnes Group Inc., a global industrial and aerospace manufacturer and service provider, announced that its Chairman of the Board, Thomas O. Barnes, and its President and Chief Executive Officer, Patrick J. Dempsey, will ring the closing bell of the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, July 19, 2017, in celebration of the Company’s 160thyear in operation. In addition, members of the Company’s Board of Directors and senior management will be present to celebrate the occasion.
Barnes Group’s success is based on its ability to adapt to the changing needs of the global marketplace. Originally established by Wallace Barnes in 1857 as a metal parts shop in Bristol, the Company began as a manufacturer of hoop-skirt springs and clock springs.
Today, Barnes Group has evolved into an enterprise of 5,000 global employees whose highly engineered products, differentiated industrial technologies, and innovative solutions are employed in transportation, manufacturing, healthcare products, and technology applications throughout the world.
“This year we celebrate Barnes Group’s longevity and rich history of growth and innovation,” said Patrick J. Dempsey. “From our modest beginning in Connecticut, to our present day worldwide operations, the Company’s transformational journey continues to reshape the organization in ways that provide advanced solutions and innovative products to our customers, career growth opportunities to our employees, and financial rewards to our shareholders.”
Thomas O. Barnes, a fifth generation Barnes family leader of the Company, added, “We look forward to the opportunities of the future, with the goal of sustaining profitable growth, fostering the development of our global employees, and further supporting the communities in which we work and live.”
Founded in 1857, Barnes Group Inc. is a global industrial and aerospace manufacturer and service provider, serving a wide range of end markets and customers.

MORE NEWS FROM WORDPRESS PARTNER: FOX 61The Stan Simpson Show: Unions propose concessions to offset state deficit
