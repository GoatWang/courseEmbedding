Details



No scientific quest is as compelling as the search for the key to understand the universe the elusive unified Theory of Everything a theory so concise it could fit on a T-shirt.Lively and thought-provoking, Universe on a T-Shirt tells the fascinating story of the search for the Holy Grail of physics.Dan Falk places this intriguing story in its historical context, tracing the quest from ancient Greece to the breakthroughs of Newton, Maxwell, and Einstein, to the excitement over string theory and today s efforts to merge quantum theory with general relativity.With as much emphasis on history as on science, Falk s accessible approach is ideal for anyone intrigued by the advances in modern physics but still wondering what theoretical physicists are searching for, and why.Today s physicists use sophisticated methods, but their goal the search for simplicity has not changed since the time of the ancient Greeks.Universe on a T-Shirt is filled with quirky personalities, brilliant minds, and bold ideas high science and high drama. "An admirably concise and comprehensive overview of cosmology . . . [that] offers intriguing insights into the philosophic and personal outlooks motivating the scientists involved, from the ancient Greeks through Newton and Einstein . . . [and] Stephen Hawking and Ed Witten. Booklist"

GET DETAILSClickFIND A STOREIn Search Of Time: The History, Physics And Philosophy Of Timeby Falk, DanTime surrounds us. It defines our experience of the world; it echoes through our every waking hour. Time is the very foundation of conscious experience. Yet as familiar as it is, time is also deeply mysterious. We cannot see, hear, smell, taste, or touch it. Yet we do feel it--or at least we think we feel it. No wonder poets, writers, philosophers, and scientists have grappled with time for centuries.In his latest book, award-winning science writer Dan Falk chronicles the story of how humans have come to understand time over the millennia, and by drawing from the latest research in physics, psychology, and other fields, Falk shows how that understanding continues to evolve. In Search of Time begins with our earliest ancestors' perception of time and the discoveries that led--with much effort--to the Gregorian calendar, atomic clocks, and &quot;leap seconds.&quot; Falk examines the workings of memory, the brain's remarkable &quot;bridge across time,&quot; and asks whether humans are unique in their ability to recall the past and imagine the future. He explores the possibility of time travel, and the paradoxes it seems to entail. Falk looks at the quest to comprehend the beginning of time and how time--and the universe--may end. Finally, he examines the puzzle of time's &quot;flow,&quot; and the remarkable possibility that the passage of time may be an illusion.Entertaining, illuminating, and ultimately thought provoking, In Search of Timereveals what some of our most insightful thinkers have had to say about time, from Aristotle to Kant, from Newton to Einstein, and continuing with the brightest minds of today.TimeCondition: Used - GoodHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

October 10, 2013 06:11 PM Eastern Daylight Time



MILWAUKEE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rexnord introduces its newest product offering, Falk® Targeted Life™ 
      Gear Sets, engineered for applications when the life of a mill or mine 
      site is expected to be less than 25 years. The customized offering is 
      suited for gears less than 24 feet (7.3 meters) in diameter, especially 
      within the mining, cement and power industries.
    


      “The Targeted Life Gear Set offering can be advantageous, saving up to 
      20 percent of the cost of a standard gear set in many cases,” says 
      William Quinn, Business Development Lead, Mill Products, Rexnord. Cost 
      savings come from within Rexnord engineering processes and design 
      criteria for each custom-made set. “What’s unique about this offering is 
      the product line specifically targets the expected life of a site. For 
      example, if a mine site has a life expectancy of nine years and needs a 
      gear set, the Targeted Life Gear Set is a lower cost alternative to 
      investing in a gear set with a traditional 25-year plus lifespan.”
    

      Targeted life gears are also manufactured as an option to serve as a 
      spare gear set, supporting risk management initiatives to help reduce 
      downtime potential.
    

      Targeted Life Gear Sets are designed utilizing the American Gear 
      Manufacturers Association (AGMA) standards, have an industry-leading 
      warranty up to 36 months, and are optimized through use of predicted and 
      actual duty cycles subjective to each customer.
    

      Rexnord gear engineers are experts in applying the design requirements 
      outlined in AGMA standards. Rexnord has installed more than 5,000 Falk 
      operating ring gears worldwide.
    

      For more information on Falk Targeted Life Gear Sets, email william.quinn@rexnord.com.
