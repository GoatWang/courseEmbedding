TMCnet Contributor


	A newly structured technology leadership team, comprising a chief information officer and a chief technology officer, has been announced by Cincinnati Financial Corporation.




	On March 29, 2010, John Kellington will join the Cincinnati Insurance Companies as senior vice president and chief information officer where he will directly report to the chief executive officer.

	In his new profile, he will be responsible for developing, planning and implementing an enterprise strategic technology vision and for all activities of the company's information technology department.

	The role of chief technology officer will be assumed by Craig W. Forrester (News - Alert), CLU, senior vice president of information technology since 2002. He will report to the chief information officer. He will be responsible to focus on monitoring new technologies and their potential to become new products or services, as well as managing the company's computer and hardware environment.

	Since 2007, Kellington was senior vice president of ACORD Corporation and he was responsible for developing global insurance standards relating to life insurance and annuities, property casualty insurance and reinsurance. For ACORD, he managed information technology, corporate finance and membership.

	Additionally, he was senior vice president and chief information officer of the Ohio Casualty Group from 2001 to 2007. Some of his major accomplishments included replacement of legacy policy processing systems, implementation of an enterprise data warehouse, and development of a strategic IT plan that leveraged common software components across multiple applications and operational areas.

	Kellington has also worked as chief architect and principal of the National Insurance Practice for IBM (News - Alert) Global Services and various marketing and technical positions for IBM Corporation.

	“Working together, John and Craig have the opportunity to make our technology a strategic advantage,” said Kenneth W. Stecher, president and CEO. “We have successfully accelerated our major projects to more quickly bring efficiencies to our operations and to our agency customers. Now, by leveraging John's proven leadership and broad experience in insurance technology and Craig's knowledge of our business, we will build on that achievement, providing our agency customers with the systems, solutions and services that support their success.”Deepika Mala is a contributing editor for TMCnet.
