      What's New in Version 6.5
    
Excited to bring the latest DJI SDK to this release. You'll notice improved performance with Flight Deck, and we now support the latest DJI models -- including the Spark!Another cool new feature that we've brought to Flight Deck is FPV mode. Check it out and let us know what you think.To Flight Deck, we've also worked with the team at AirMap to bring you "anonymous" telemetry. Now you can privately and securely share telemetry with airports and aircraft around you, while also seeing real-time aircraft in your area in return.Along the way, we made some improvements and squashed a few bugs for taking pictures with autofocus, local store and offline sync bugs and more controls for media upload (for those of you enjoying unlimited photo storage).We've also packed in some really cool aircraft data features. Along with adding the Spark to Flight Deck capabilities, we added the Spark into our templates for quickly adding drones. You'll also notice lifetime stats for your aircraft, with data around total flight time, distance traveled, max height, and average satellites to name a few. Feel free to nerd out. We did.Another data improvement is that we're now patching and updating your battery info after flights, include battery health and cycles with information that we get directly from the drone and battery(s).Last, we fixed a display bug, where there was an​ axis label issue in some of our new animated telemetry charts. We squared that away for the smaller devices, so let us know if that did the trick.More cool stuff coming out soon. Appreciate the feedback and amazing support. This Kittyhawk community is unique, elite, and rad to build products for.Happy flying,team@kittyhawk.io

    Out of all the drone management services out there Kittyhawk is the most complete offering. I'd recommend it just for the preflight dashboard. If/when I get a commercial certificate the Plus plan is next on my list. The team provides top-tier support.

    You're discriminating by adding only DJI. Are you getting a bonus? Otherwise it's good for what I can use it for. Either rename the app or add more manufacturers

We're building Kittyhawk as the platform of record for drones -- meaning individual pilots and teams can track their flights, drones, assets.  And with all of that info, we layer in a ton of predictive intelligence such as KP weather alerts, TFRs from the FAA.

Basically there is a ton being built around drones while you're flying.  Kittyhawk is for the other hours in the day before you fly, after you've flown, and when you're thinking about flying. 3Share·2 years agoWould you recommend Kittyhawk 2.0 to a friend?😡 NO🤔 MAYBE😍 YESHunterHEric WillisMakersMJoshua ZieringMjonathanDiscussionYou need to become a Contributor to join the discussion - Find out how.Ben Tossell@bentossell · Community Lead, Product HuntAir traffic control for drones?

@joshuaziering tell us the story here :) 4Share·2 years agojonathanMaker@hegranes · Maker / Founder @kittyhawkio@bentossell We're building Kittyhawk as a way for pilots to show their history and their status as a drone pilot.  While you, as a pilot, are logging flights -- we also give you a way to track all of your assets and locations.  And similar to Github, you can join and create multiple teams.

Drone pilots as a profession is growing, and Kittyhawk is an agnostic platform to participate in this field. 2Share·2 years agoJoshua ZieringMaker@joshuaziering · Founder, Kittyhawk.io@bentossell Hi PH! Kittyhawk came from an internal asset we were building out at QuiQui. Obviously doing drone delivery was going to require a TON of compliance work to make sure everything remained safe and sound. Now, we're helping folks with exemptions to handle their data and making sure they don't overlook things like space weather and TFR's from the FAA. We make it easy for commercial operators to keep track of all the important bits for the government. 4Share·2 years agoLeo Moravtchik@moravtchik · CEO, diggidiWaiting for the story. Starting to think this can be an official tool used by FCC and other authorities to start supervising Drone flight plans\trajectories. MUCH NEEDED. 3Share·2 years agojonathanMaker@hegranes · Maker / Founder @kittyhawkio@moravtchik that's not on our immediate road map, but really like the idea.  Drone operations are on a path similar to airplanes, including coordination with authorities.  As the platform of record for drones, Kittyhawk will be in a place to coordinate the needs and wants of both pilots and regulators. 1Share·2 years agoJoshua ZieringMaker@joshuaziering · Founder, Kittyhawk.io@moravtchik Leo, that's a great idea but probably a little ahead of it's time right now. We're collecting data after the flights happen to make sure the craft and equipment remain airworthy. From the data we collect we can make some good suggestions about maintenance and pilot skills =) 1Share·2 years agojonathanMaker@hegranes · Maker / Founder @kittyhawkioHowdy PH.

We may share information with third parties.
We will share information with our vendors. These are third parties who perform services on our behalf or who help us to improve our website, apps and products. For example, we may share information with vendors who send emails for us.
We will share information if we think we have to in order to comply with the law or to protect ourselves. For example, we will share information to respond to a court order or subpoena. We may share it if a government agency (e.g., FAA) or investigatory body requests. We might share information when we are investigating potential fraud.
We may share information with any successor to all or part of our business. For example, if part of our business was sold, we may share information as part of that transaction.
We may share information for other reasons we may describe to you.
You have certain choices about sharing and marketing practices.
You can opt out of receiving our marketing emails. To stop receiving our promotional emails, follow the instructions in any promotional message you get from us. Even if you opt out of getting marketing messages, we will still send you transactional messages. These include responses to your questions.
You can control cookies and tracking tools. Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies or other tracking tools. How you do so depends on the type of tool. Certain browsers can be set to reject browser cookies. To control flash cookies, which we may use on certain websites from time to time, you can go here. Why? Because flash cookies cannot be controlled through your browser settings.
Our Do Not Track Policy: Some browsers have “do not track” features that allow you to tell a website not to track you. These features are not all uniform. We do not currently respond to those signals. If you block cookies, certain features on our sites may not work. If you block or reject cookies, not all of the tracking described here will stop.
You can control tools on your mobile devices. For example, you can turn off the GPS locator or push notifications on your phone.
