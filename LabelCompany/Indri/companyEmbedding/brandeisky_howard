John B. Sanfilippo & Son, Inc. Appoints Howard Brandeisky 
      as Vice President Global Marketing and Innovation






June 09, 2010 09:03 AM Eastern Daylight Time



ELGIN, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Howard Brandeisky, a CPG marketing veteran, has joined John B. 
      Sanfilippo & Son, www.jbssinc.com 
      (NASDAQ: JBSS) as Vice President Global Marketing and Innovation. In 
      this new role, Brandeisky will lead marketing and innovation for the 
      company’s Fisher, Orchard Valley Harvest and Sunshine Country Brands as 
      well as Private Brands across all channels in which the company competes.
    


      Brandeisky brings a diverse background to JBSS along with a track record 
      of growing established businesses and launching successful new products. 
      He spent over 20 years at Kraft Foods in a variety of brand management, 
      new product development, strategy, and finance roles.
    

      “JBSS has a great history and track record of success. The company is a 
      leader in its industry, with exciting plans for the future” Brandeisky 
      says. “I’m excited about the opportunity to develop consumer driven 
      marketing initiatives and product innovations that will drive future 
      growth.”
    

      Brandeisky’s appointment is part of an aggressive growth strategy at 
      JBSS. A key element of the strategy is to build programs in the consumer 
      channel through marketing initiatives and product innovation. 
      Opportunities exist in the foodservice and export channels as well. In 
      2007, as part of its expansion, JBSS consolidated its corporate 
      headquarters in a new one-million-square-foot building that also houses 
      processing and packing operations and research and development 
      facilities.
    

      “We are delighted to have Howard on board,” says JBSS Chief Executive 
      Officer Jeffrey Sanfilippo. “His wide range of experience in marketing 
      and strategic product development adds enormous value to our Management 
      team. We know we have a great leader who inspires his teams. His people 
      skills are excellent and his understanding of consumer-driven growth is 
      finely tuned. Howard’s business acumen aligns well with our direction 
      during a period of great innovation and growth at JBSS.”
    

      Brandeisky’s achievements during his career at Kraft include the 
      successful launches of the California Pizza Kitchen frozen pizza 
      and the South Beach Diet lines of food. In addition to his new 
      product experience, he provided marketing and business leadership on 
      such notable consumer brands as Maxwell House coffee, Kraft 
      salad dressing, and the Back to Nature line of natural and 
      organic foods. Brandeisky also has foodservice marketing experience, 
      having led the beverage category for Kraft in that channel. Following 
      his tenure at Kraft, Brandeisky was a marketing and strategy consultant, 
      primarily working with a major industry retailer on their private brand 
      strategy.

Lakeside 2065 Creation Express Mobile Stainless Steel Cooking Cart with 1 Induction Burner and 1 Filtration Unit - 22 x 34 x 40 1/2



                    Whether you're running a hotel breakfast bar and are looking to add a made-to-order omelet station or require a mobile solution for bringing display cooking to different locations within your business, this Lakeside 2065 Creation Express™ mobile stainless steel cooking cart will get the job                    
                     done! Featuring a single 13 1/4 x 12 1/2 induction burner with an output of 1800W, this unit allows you to saute vegetables, brown meat, or cook omelets with less energy than traditional gas and electric burners, while its lack of an open flame promotes safety among your staff. This unit also has a built-in down draft filtration system that slides out of the interior compartment for easy changing and maintenance. This 350W, three stage filtration system includes a washable baffle prefilter to remove grease, dust, and other particulates, a rigid cell filter to remove smoke and fine particulates, and finally, a carbon absorption filter to remove fumes and odors. Thanks to its LED control panel, the temperature of the burner is easy to view and control. It has both a cook/power mode with a range from 1-20 and a temperature mode with a range from 90 to 440 degrees Fahrenheit for complete customization to the food you're cooking. This cooking cart's welded stainless steel cabinet is compact for simple transport and setup, while its heat-resistant stainless steel top and tempered glass burners are easy to wipe clean at the end of a demonstration. In addition, this unit has four 5 swivel, No-Mark® polyurethane casters, two with brakes, making it easy to maneuver throughout your hotel, upscale buffet, or college dining hall. This cooking cart requires a 120V electrical connection and has an output of 1800W. Overall Dimensions: Width: 34 Depth: 22 Height: 40 1/2 2065 From Lakeside

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
