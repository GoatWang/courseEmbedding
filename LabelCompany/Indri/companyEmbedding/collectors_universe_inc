While I only ended up with an Echo, I also ended up with a starter position in Collectors Universe (CLCT). The stock fell about 6.5% without an explicit news event, and I think shares look reasonably attractive. Let’s take a look at performance, valuation, and what I think returns can look like from current levels. Q3 Results – Slower Growth but still Solid I covered Q2 extensively, but, unfortunately, I have not yet reviewed Q3 for Seeking Alpha, which I will discuss briefly here. After Q2 was marked by a substantial increase in revenue from CLCT’s new Chinese operations that drove total revenue up 41% y/y, Q3 saw a slight y/y decline in China. As a result, total revenue grew only 7%. However, with the OUS business virtually flat, I think the 7% increase in Q3 sales that was driven exclusively by the United States was relatively impressive. Revenue was a quarterly record of $18.6 million driven by a 7% y/y increase in coins and an 11% y/y increase in cards and autographs. The most interesting insight into Q3 revenue was undoubtedly China. Although the company anticipates the business to grow over time, the quarterly revenue timing could be hard to predict. Ultimately, this could translate into more quarterly volatility, but as long as the long-term story remains intact, I do not care. Operating income was also up 7% y/y, though, if we adjust for last year’s non-cash benefit of $0.7 million, operating income actually increased 27% y/y as the firm benefited greatly from operating leverage. In Q3, EPS increased to $0.35 per share, driving YTD EPS of $0.87, an increase of nearly 32%. Even if EPS is flat y/y in Q4, earnings per share for FY17 will come in at $1.19 per share, which would represent an increase of ~34% y/y. While this would not appear to cover the dividend of $1.40 per share, I anticipate the cash burn for FY17 will be close to $2-3 million, as opposed to the $5.3 million cash burn in FY16. Recall, that cash flow is mostly a timing issue, and if you look at the annual free cash flow since 2013, the dividend coverage isn’t as bad as an EPS/DPS ratio would appear.
     2016 2015 2014 2013   Cash from Operating Activities $8.7 $10.6 $12.1 $9.1   Capital Expenditures $2.1 $1.3 $1.4 $1.1   FCF $6.7 $9.3 $10.7 $7.9   Total Cash Dividends Paid $12.0 $11.4 $10.7 $10.8   FCF Coverage 56% 82% 100% 74%   Source: DB, Company filings Valuation Based on a modest projection of Q4 EPS growth of 6%, I believe shares are currently trading at about 19.7x FY17 earnings. With FCF generating capabilities of around $10M, shares are trading at a similar ~19-21x FCF. While these metrics are certainly not cheap, I think they represent a reasonable price for a company with a solid moat, decent incremental returns available for global expansion, and strong underlying growth in its core business. Per my previous note, I continue to have a DCF value of $27-32 per share. At the low end, this implies a discount of 12%. Couple that margin of safety with a 5.9% yield, and I believe Collectors Universe can return nearly 18% over the next year.

Collectors Universe, Inc., incorporated on February 3, 1999, provides authentication and grading services to dealers and collectors of coins, trading cards, event tickets, autographs and historical and sports memorabilia (collectibles). The Company operates through three segments: coins, trading cards and autographs, and other collectibles. The Company is engaged in the authentication, grading, publication and Web-based advertising, subscription-based business and product sales. The other collectibles segment includes the Certified Coin Exchange (CCE) subscription business, the Coinflation.com business and its collectibles conventions business. The Company is also engaged in selling of printed publications and collectibles price guides and advertising in such publications; selling of membership subscriptions in its Collectors Club; selling of subscriptions to its CCE dealer-to-dealer Internet bid-ask market for certified coins and to its CoinFacts Website, which offers a source for historical numismatic information and content in the United States, and conducting collectibles trade shows and conventions. The Company is also engaged in selling collectibles inventory, which primarily consists of collectible coins that it has purchased under its coin grading warranty program.The Company has developed brands, such as PCGS (Professional Coin Grading Service), which is the brand name for its independent coin authentication and grading service; PSA (Professional Sports Authenticator), which is the brand name for its independent sports and trading cards authentication and grading service, and PSA/DNA (PSA/DNA Authentication Services), which is the brand name for its independent authentication and grading service for vintage autographs and memorabilia.

The Company's vintage autograph authentication service involves the rendering of an opinion of authenticity based on an analysis of the signed object, such as the signed document or autographed item of memorabilia, to confirm its consistency with similar materials or items that existed during the signer's lifetime; a comparison of the signature submitted for authentication with exemplars of such signatures, and a handwriting analysis. As of June 30, 2016, the CCE Website features over 100,000 bid and ask prices for certified coins at www.certifiedcoinexchange.com.The Company publishes authoritative price guides, rarity reports and other collectibles data.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
