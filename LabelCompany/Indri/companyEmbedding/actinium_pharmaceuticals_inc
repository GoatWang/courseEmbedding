Company Overview




Download

Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (www.actiniumpharma.com) is a New York-based biopharmaceutical company developing innovative targeted payload immunotherapeutics for the treatment of advanced cancers. Actinium's targeted radiotherapy products are based on its proprietary delivery platform for the therapeutic utilization of alpha-emitting actinium-225 and certain beta emitting radiopharmaceuticals in conjunction with monoclonal antibodies. The Company's lead radiopharmaceutical product candidate, Iomab-B, is designed to be used, upon approval, in preparing patients for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), commonly referred to as bone marrow transplant (BMT). The Company is conducting a single, pivotal, multicenter Phase 3 clinical study of Iomab-B in refractory and relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients over the age of 55 with a primary endpoint of durable complete remission. The Company's second product candidate, Actimab-A, is continuing its clinical development in a Phase 2 trial for newly diagnosed AML patients over the age of 60 in a single-arm multicenter trial.

	About
 


About
Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSE MKT:ATNM) is a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company developing innovative targeted therapies for patients with cancers lacking effective treatment options. Actinium's proprietary technology platform utilizes monoclonal antibodies to deliver radioisotopes directly to cells of interest in order to kill those cells both safely and effectively.
Actinium's lead product candidate, Iomab-B, is licensed from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and is designed to be used, upon approval, in preparing patients for a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, commonly referred to as bone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant is often the only potential cure for patients with blood-borne cancers but the current standard preparation for a transplant requires chemotherapy and/or total body irradiation that result in significant toxicities. We believe Iomab-B will enable a faster and less toxic preparation of patients seeking a bone marrow transplant, leading to increased transplant success and survival rates. We are currently conducting a single pivotal 150-patient, multicenter Phase 3 clinical study of Iomab-B in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) age 55 and older. Learn more about Iomab-B and bone marrow transplant for AML here.
Actinium is also developing Actimab-A, our lead alpha-particle drug candidate. Actimab-A is currently in a multicenter open-label, 53-patient Phase 2 trial for patients newly diagnosed with AML age 60 and over. Actimab-A is being developed to induce remissions in elderly patients with AML who lack effective treatment options and often cannot tolerate the toxicities of standard frontline therapies. Learn more about Actimab-A here.
In addition, Actinium has expanded its alpha-particle approach to include newly created drug candidate Actimab-M, which is being studied in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in a Phase 1 clinical trial. Learn more about Actimab-M and the multiple myeloma trial here.
Actinium is also utilizing its alpha-particle immunotherapy (APIT) technology platform to generate new drug candidates based on antibodies linked to the element actinium-225 that are directed at various blood-borne or solid cancers. To learn more about Actinium's APIT or to explore a potential collaboration using this powerful technology please visit the Technology page.
Actinium Pharmaceuticals is based in New York, NY. 




Bone Marrow Transplant Induction and Conditioning in One
Iomab-B, Actinium’s lead asset, is in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial as an induction and conditioning agent in patients over the age of 55 with relapsed or refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) prior to receiving a bone marrow transplant (BMT), also known as a hematopoietic stem cell transplant or HSCT.

Robust Pipeline
Actinium Pharmaceuticals' drug development pipeline features Iomab-B, which is in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, Actimab-A, which is in a Phase 2 clinical trial, and Actimab-M currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial. Actinium is focused on continuing to expand its drug development pipeline by leveraging its APIT technology platform and domain expertise. View Pipeline

  Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ATNM: NYSE MKT) is a public biopharmaceutical company specialized in the development of cancer drugs. The Company’s product candidates are based on its patented technology co-developed with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) for combining the cancer targeting precision of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) for targeting specific types of cells with the power of alpha emitting radioisotopes, the most potent cancer killing agents in existence. ATNM’s first drug for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been administered to 49 patients with promising results and the second generation drug candidate is currently in clinical trials with 28 patients treated to date. In addition to leukemia drugs, ATNM’s technology has been used to produce drug candidates for treatment of metastatic colorectal and prostate cancers, antiangiogenesis (prevention of blood supply to and growth of many solid cancers) and bone marrow ablation, part of a curative treatment for leukemias, lymphomas and multiple myeloma. Company intends to develop its products through Phase II clinical trials and it then intends to partner each drug for completion of development and commercialization with an appropriate third party. ATNM expects that its revenues will be derived from upfront payments, milestone payments and royalty payments, which payments comprise a standard structure of such partnering deals. In some markets, ATNM may seek to retain commercial rights and derive additional revenue from sales of its products. ATNM’s largest shareholder is AHLB Holdings, LLC, which is wholly owned by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. ATNM’s second largest shareholder is a subsidiary of Merck and Co.                   APIT Platform     ATNM TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM ATNM’s Alpha Particle Immunotherapy (APIT) platform is a highly potent and selective form of targeted radiotherapy.  It is based on attaching powerful alpha emitting radioisotopes Actinium 225 or Bismuth 213 to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) which are large molecules capable of binding specifically to cancer cells.  By virtue of carrying alpha emitters, mAbs bring them directly to cancer cells where alpha emitters can selectively kill the targeted cell.  Figure below presents a schematic of a drug based on the Company’s APIT technology. APIT based drug construct and its components        The power of alpha emitters is best understood when compared to beta emitters, an alternative form of radioisotope used in cancer drugs.  The killing power of a radioactive particle is directly proportional to its energy and inversely proportional to its range.  Alpha particle carries the most energy but travels the shortest path, while beta particle has less energy but goes farther in the body. Comparison between α and β irradiation’s effect on cancer cells and healthy tissues        Being 100 times more powerful than beta particles, alpha therapy is effective in cancers that are not sensitive to beta irradiation.  Prime examples are the past and current clinical trials in AML.  APIT has demonstrated extremely high cancer cell kill levels even though AML is not considered particularly radiosensitive and radiotherapy is not used in treating the disease.  Based on these inherent isotope traits, the Company and Dr. David Scheinberg, Chairman of the Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), ATNM’s key scientific collaborator, developed alpha particles as an ideal payload for targeted cancer radiotherapy.  While their potency is 100-fold higher than beta’s and cytotoxins’ significantly increases the killing power of alpha particle drugs against targeted tumor cells, their extremely short range limits any damage inflicted on healthy tissues. In addition to its potency and range of emission, there are other key considerations for evaluating the suitability of particular radioisotopes for medical use.  Among them are half-life of the isotope, which is an indication of the period over which it remains radioactive, and its pharmacokinetics, i.e. its distribution in the body and its eventual elimination from it.  For these reasons, Actinium 225 (Ac-225) and the isotope derived from it, Bismuth 213 (Bi-213), were selected as lynchpins of the Company’s technology.  Both isotopes have relatively short half-lives and favorable and controllable pharmacokinetics.  However, for efficacy, logistics and cost reasons ATNM has decided to focus its efforts on Actinium 225 which has a 10 day half life versus Bismuth-213’s half life of 46 minutes.     Overview   Actinium Pharmaceuticals Drug Development Status       HSCT stands for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, a procedure in which cells capable of reconstituting normal bone marrow function are transplanted to a patient. 	ATNM has decided to discontinue development of Bismab-A at this time for supply, logistics and cost reasons. Actimab-A is the second generation drug of Bismab-A. 	Properties of Actinium 225 are uniquely suited for Antiangiogenesis and API is considering options for further development in that area. 	Antiangiogenesis therapies starve cancerous tumors by choking off blood supply to them.        Development Plan & Market Potential Breakthrough Therapy Potential in Multiple Billion Dollar Markets Over time, the biggest market potential for Actinium lies in the fact that its highly patented platform technology could be used to target a wide variety of cancers. Preclinical and clinical work has already focused on Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL), brain cancer, bladder cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and a number of other cancer related indications. Actinium intends to develop its product candidates through phase 2 clinical trials, and then plans to partner each drug for completion of development and commercialization with an appropriate third party. Revenues will be derived from upfront payments, milestone payments and royalty payments, which payments comprise a standard structure of such partnering deals. In some markets, Actinium may seek to retain commercial rights and derive additional revenue from sales of its products.  The compelling advantages of the Actinium's platform should continue to draw attention from the healthcare and investor communities. The company’s technology further illustrates the immense licensing and acquisition potential inherent in the company's high-momentum product pipeline. In fact its closest technology competitor, Algeta, which is about 3-4 years ahead from a market perspective, was just acquired by Bayer for $2.9 billion.    Market Potential of Product Pipeline   Actimab-A     Phase I Trial with single dose of Actimab-A In collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) we are conducting a first-in-man Phase I dose escalation trial to determine the safety, pharmacology, and biological activity of Actimab-A in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).  Eighteen patients (median age, 64 yrs; range, 45–80 yrs) with relapsed/refractory AML were treated to date.  Patients received a single infusion of Actimab-A at doses of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, or 4 µCi/kg (µCi –microCurie; total dose, 23–390 µCi).  No acute toxicities were seen.  Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was suppression of the entire bone marrow lasting over 35 days and consequent death due to sepsis.  It occurred in one patient treated with 3 µCi/kg and in both patients receiving 4 µCi/kg.  Toxicities outside of the target organ (bone marrow) were limited to transient grade 2/3 liver function abnormalities.  With follow-up from 1–24 months (median, 2 months), no evidence of damage to kidneys due to radiation was seen.  Peripheral blood blasts (leukemia cells) were eliminated in 10 of 16 evaluable patients who received a full treatment dose.  Bone marrow blast reductions of over 33% were seen in 10 of 15 evaluable patients at 4 weeks, including 3 patients with 5 percent or fewer blasts.  Actimab-A is tolerable at doses less than 4 µCi/kg and has antileukemic activity. Acute Myeloid Leukemia is characterized by very high numbers of immature cancerous white blood cells of certain kind that are similar to normal young blood cells and all immature white blood cells are called blasts.  It is not normal for a person to have any blasts circulating in peripheral blood (peripheral blasts) and to have more than 5 percent of blasts in the bone marrow. Phase I/II AML Trial with two consecutive fractionated doses of Actimab-A After receiving clearance from the FDA the Company started Phase I/II multi-center AML trial with fractionated doses of Actimab-A.  ATNM has concluded contracts with and provided training to 6 participating trial centers (Baylor University Medical Center, MSKCC, Johns Hopkins Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Health System, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center and University of MD Andersen Cancer Center).  The Phase I (dose escalating) portion of the trial is ongoing. The Company estimates that it will take approximately 3-6 months to complete the Phase I portion of the trial and an additional 1- 1.5 years to complete the Phase II portion of the trial.  For the proposed Phase I/II study, patients are eligible if they have previously untreated newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia according to World Health Organization criteria, are age 60 years or older, and are unfit for or decline intensive chemotherapy, or are 70 years or older with newly diagnosed AML.  This target population has had better outcomes than relapsed and refractory patients who have been most of the patients in ATNM’s previous trials. Maximum enrollment in the Phase I portion of the trial is 21 patients in dose escalating cohorts of 3 patients each with the goal of determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for Actimab-A.  There is a six week interval between dose levels.  Once MTD has been determined, it will be used as the dose level for the Phase II portion of the trial which will enroll up to 53 patients.  There are 4 planned dose levels in the Phase I portion of the trial.            Iomab-B     Iomab-B for Hematopoietic Stem Cells Transplantation: Iomab-B (BC8-I-131 construct) has already been successfully used as a myeloconditioning/myeloablative agent in over 250 patients with incurable blood cancers. In both Phase I and Phase II trials Iomab-B has led to effective cures in patients with no options left. The only potentially curative treatment option for those patients is bone marrow transplantation (BMT), also known as a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), but vast majority of patients over the age of 50 are either ineligible for myeloablative conditioning due to concomitant conditions or have a high burden and/or very resistant disease that makes reduced dose conditioning futile. BC8-I-131 has demonstrated ability to successfully prepare such patients for bone marrow transplants when no other treatment was indicated. ATNM intends to develop Iomab-B through a regulatory approval via a pivotal registration trial in AML refractory/relapsing patients. That would allow for a relatively quick path to the market and provide a potentially curative treatment to patients who currently have little or no chance of achieving even a temporary remission, let alone a cure. The targeting part of the Iomab-B construct is a monoclonal antibody that targets CD45, an antigen widely expressed on hematopoietic cells but not other tissues. Due to this broad expression, Iomab-B has demonstrated utility in other groups of patients and other indications as well, including Myelodysplastic Syndrome, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Hodgkin’s Disease and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. These are follow-on indications which could be pursued simultaneously or delayed, for cash conservation, and financed from commercial revenues. The company is already preparing a program for replacing iodine 131 with Actinium 225 to create a second generation drug that would enable a significant expansion of use, described below as Actimab-B, Iomab-B was invented by researchers at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC), ATNM’s key collaborator on this program from whom ATNM obtained rights for all the commercial uses. FHCRC played a pivotal role in developing the entire field of bone marrow transplantation and the lead Hutchinson researcher, Dr. E. Donnall Thomas received the 1990 Nobel Prize in physiology/medicine for work in this area.

Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like advancements in personalized medicine and immunotherapy – and it's coming faster than we can imagine.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.

This is the most exciting time in the history of medicine. Millions of people around the world are benefiting from breakthrough treatments that save, extend and improve life.
Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.
