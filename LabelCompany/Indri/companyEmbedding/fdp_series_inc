FDP Design Guide



        VTI's  Fused Distribution Panel (FDP) is designed to provide
        electrical power distribution in applications requiring high-speed clearing
            of branch-circuit load faults from the supply source.  The FDP is available for
        single-phase and three-phase input voltages and can accomodate single, double,
        or three pole switches, up to 42 pole positions per
        unit (or more by special order).  Each branch switch output feeds a high-speed, sub-cycle clearing
        fuse which in turn feeds the load.
        

        The VTI Fused Distribution Panel is supplied with UL or
        CUL labels.  They are engineered, assembled and tested at
        our factory to your specifications, and then are shipped to the customer's
        site ready for installation. The net result is a completely self-contained, easy
        to order, and easy to install fused power distribution panel meeting
        OSHA and NEC electrical standards.
        

Product News Bulletin
Change to Panelboard Configuration
Sep 29 2008

                  VTI standardized on using Square D panelboards in our
                  Unitized Distribution Substations (UDSs) and the Fused
                  Distribution Panels (FDPs) back in the 1980s. Please be
              advised that Square D is discontinuing the type NQOD
              panelboard. The new panelboard will be Square D’s type NQ.
              

              The type NQ panelboard is functionally interchangeable with NQOD and will use
                  all of the same branch circuit breakers. The most significant change in the new
                  type NQ panelboard is the number of pole spaces available on the 100 amp single
                  phase and the 100 amp 3 phase panelboards. Square D is offering only 18
                  circuits and 30 circuits in the 100 amp configuration of the NQ panelboard.
              

              For VTI products this change will only affect the Fused Distribution Panels.
              The 20 circuit single phase FDP and the 24 circuit 3 phase FDPs will no longer
                  be available. Both the single phase and the 3 phase panelboards will now be 18
                  circuits. If 18 circuits are insufficient for your requirements then use the 30
                  circuit panelboard and VTI will only populate the number of circuits you
                  require.
                

                Please contact VTI if you need clarification or have any questions.

Applications


Fuse, Circuit Breaker, and UPS Coordination Curve [click for detail]

Close-up of UL 30A 600V fuse holder with NEC Midget semiconductor protection type fuse. Available from 0.1 to 30 Amps



        Typical applications include power distribution from an uninterruptable
            power supply, where standard thermomagnetic breakers are too slow to
        coordinate with the automatic transfer bypass circuit in a UPS.
        During a branch circuit fault, the UPS transfers back to the utility source to
        clear the fault. After the fault is cleared, the UPS transfers back to the UPS
        output. This transfer takes place because the UPS has limited short circuit
        capacity and cannot produce enough short circuit current to cause an ordinary
        branch breaker to reach its instantaneous trip level. On occasion you can drop
        the load during the transfer cycle or worse case, have the UPS transfer to the
        utility voltage source that is not there. The solution is to incorporate the
        Fused Distribution Panel (FDP) into your system
        network. Select the proper high-speed fuse with appropriate
        clearing time curve and current rating (from 0.1A to 30A).
        

        The FDP is also useful for power distrubution to multiple small electrical
            loads such as electronic instruments, where fuses can be sized down to
        0.1Amps for precise load protection for sensitive instruments. This
        offers an advantage over a standard panelboard where the smallest breaker is 10
        Amps).
        

        The FDP-DC is also available for DC power applications.
