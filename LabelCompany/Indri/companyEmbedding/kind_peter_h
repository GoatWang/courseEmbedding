Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Stage Stores Credit Card


                                            I was charged fees then late fees then fees. So $28.22 balance appeared out of thin air without any purchase. I moved while opening the credit card account so I did not receive statements on time (or maybe they did not send it to me). Called and got $17 back. As for the rest, I...show more

Amazon.com Store Card


                                            IF I COULD GIVE IT A ZERO I WOULD! Amazon/Synchrony Bank will cut your limit out of no where, even when making monthly payments. I've spent almost a year trying to pay off a card THEY maxed out and now they have sent to collections AS IM PAYING IT! DO NOT APPLY FOR THIS CARD!

Amazon.com Store Card


                                            While the card offers nice perks, just like every other crappy card, there are hidden fees. I purchased 1400 dollars worth of stuff, and believing I had 12 months to pay off, I didn't worry about it for the first two months. The next time I looked they had hit me with 100$...show more

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Product Description▼▲
Grouping the General, or Catholic, Epistles together, Peter Davids finds in them a common view of Christology, sin, and eschatology. He opens up the contours of the great themes, then compares them to other portions of Scripture. Enables one to see the forest, without getting lost in the individual trees. 13-session DVD.

Publisher's Description▼▲
In A Theology of James, Peter, and Jude, A Video Study top New Testament scholar Peter Davids offers a comprehensive study of the General or Catholic Epistles, which are often insufficiently covered in more general New Testament introductions, theologies, and surveys. The lessons offer a thorough exploration of the theology of each book, including introductory issues and major themes, and shows how each book relates to the broad picture of New Testament theology. Before discussing a theology of each of the four letters, Davids deals with their common aspects - their shared background in the Greco-Roman world and similar Christology, view of the source of sin, and eschatology - thus justifying their being treated together. Davids then embarks upon a theological reading of each letter informed by its social-rhetorical understanding - what it meant in the context of its original cultural settings - that includes a survey of recent scholarship, a discussion of relevant introductory issues, thematic commentary, treatment of important theological themes, and a discussion of the place of each letter in the biblical canon. A Theology of James, Peter, and Jude, A Video Study is part of The Zondervan Beyond the Basics Video Series, which is dedicated to bringing expert teaching from world's best biblical scholars and theologians directly to interested learners. A Theology of James, Peter, and Jude, A Video Study offers the chance to learn about some of the Bible's most neglected biblical books from one of today's premier New Testament scholars.
