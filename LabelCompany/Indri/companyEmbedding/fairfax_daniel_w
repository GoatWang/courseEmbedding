Amazing food, knowledgable staff, awesome atmosphere.Neighborhood bar but so much more! I can't find anything on the menu I don't love. Since the remodel and change of ownership this place has redefined itself, completely for the better!

Best shop in the area, extremely helpful and trustworthy. They have had multiple opportunities to charge me huge sums of money for extra parts and labor, but have  cut me breaks and kept the labor charges to a minimum. I recommend them to everyone!!!

There are a few things this place does extremely well, and Peruvian food is one of them. If you've never had it before give it a try! I promise you won't regret it. Imagine the best grilled chicken you've ever had in your life, this is better. The chicken is extremely well seasoned and cooked, very juicy and tender. I've never had anything I was disappointed with, besides the chicken I strongly recommend the carna asada!!Staff is very friendly, service is quick, and the restaurant is clean and very has an excellent atmosphere.





Half Chicken!! Amazing!!!
