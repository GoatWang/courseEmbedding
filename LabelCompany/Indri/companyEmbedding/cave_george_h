Biography


British gardener and botanic garden curator in India. George Cave began his career as a gardener at Studely Castle, Warwickshire, before joining Kew in 1894. Two years later he was appointed to an assistant position at the Botanic Gardens in Calcutta. Here he married his wife, Katherine, with whom he raised a family. He moved on from Calcutta to work at the government cinchona plantations at Mungpoo (1900), before in 1904 taking up the post of curator at the Lloyd Botanic Garden, Darjeeling. He remained at this hill station garden for 24 years and during this period, in addition to keeping the gardens in first class condition, he made plant collecting trips into Nepal, Sikkim and other places. He established a large herbarium from the material gathered.Cave was thoroughly engrossed by the Himalayan region, learning to speak several dialects of Tibetan and Bhutanese. As a volunteer with the North Bengal Mounted Rifles for 25 years, he was decorated with their long service medal. His services were also recognised by the Dalai Lama, who gave him a gift of a Tibetan teacup. Cave retired to England in 1925, in which year he was awarded the MBE He revisited India aged 75.Sources:Anon., 1966, Journal of the Kew Guild, 8: 708-709.
