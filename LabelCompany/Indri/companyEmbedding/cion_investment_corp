5 Reasons ITLL May Be the Most Profitable Stock Play of 2017












OWCP - 9,900%


In 2017, cell phones are as vital to us as the air we breathe. Between both old and young, from personal users to businesses and now even hospitals, mobile phones have become an essential part of the modern eco system. Without one, people have difficulty finding employment and leave themselves negatively exposed to emergencies. The vast majority of American adults - 95% - now own a cell phone. This has resulted in the massive growth of businesses supplying and supplementing this market. Of which ITLL is now becoming a key player. 








With such immense growth in the industry and corporate giants dominating the arena, we frequently see small companies either grow exponentially or get bought out before they become a threat. This is where OTC: ITLL comes into play. Their goal is to deliver market disruptive products and pricing to the millions of consumers who are looking for better deals in the mobile phone and application space. Since ITLL is a public company, we believe this is an excellent opportunity for savvy investors to capitalize on the booming industry. We’ve done some digging and have laid out 6 reasons why we believe ITLL may be the most profitable stock play of 2017. Breaking News: ITLL Successfully Closes Acquisition with Completion of Definitive Agreements.


OWCP - 63,900%













Massive telecom acquisitions are happening all the time. They're so common in fact, we barely notice the billions of dollars that are flying between these massive corporations, month after month. For example, in 2017 alone, we've already seen several major acquisitions. Telecom service provider GTT Communications announced in June that it plans to buy network connectivity provider Global Capacity for $100 million in cash and 1.85 million shares of GTT common stock. We also saw that in April, Windstream announced its plan to acquire cloud-based unified communications provider Broadview Networks in an all-cash transaction worth $228 million. And if that isn't enough, in March, Zayo Group Holdings, Inc. closed its $1.42 billion acquisition of Electric Lightwave, the company formerly known as Integra Telecom. All of this happened in just the last few months!All this makes you wonder why this is happening and whether ITLL has what it takes to dance with the big guys. Well, it is our belief that the telecom giants scoop up the smaller, competitive companies because they are a danger to their business model. Big companies like Verizon are making money hand over fist - why stop when you can just scoop up the competition and keep business going as usual?ITLL has made it clear that their goal is to be affordable and disruptive. A similar situation took place in Canada some years ago, when a company named Wind Mobile came into play. Over a few short years Wind grew a massive user base simply because their plans were significantly cheaper than the competition. Recently, Shaw bought them out for $1.6 billion. As a result of all this, our opinion of the ITLL business model is excellent.








1. We've seen this business model work before. 


5.	QB Status and 3 stars from Morningstar. 


This is a statement that often attracts negativity from skeptics and self-pronounced market professionals. And frankly, it's understandable; it seems too good to be true. We always encourage our readers to do their own due-diligence and this is one of those scenarios. Dig through message boards, scanners and blogs and you'll quickly realize that stocks are making major moves like this on a regular basis. This isn't some mythical unicorn - once again, stocks do this on a regular basis. Below, you can see some examples of movements like this, but believe us when we say there are many, many more. 








3. One trade can make profits of 2,000% or more. 


BLDV - 5,600%










At the time of writing this article, ITLL is sitting at 80 cents. We believe that this is an extremely attractive price for a company of this caliber. As was observed above, acquisitions in this industry often come in at hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. In addition to this, 80 cents is an excellent place for traders and investors to turn quicker profits. It is much easier for a stock to double or triple at these prices, in a very short period of time. "It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price” - Warren Buffet





2. The stock is priced right. Better than right.

The OTCQB is an elite tier of the over the counter markets. These are companies that have audited financials available, are current in their reporting, have verified management and shareholders and additional disclosure requirements to meet. All in all, this signifies that ITLL is on the ball and doing business the right way. Morningstar rates OTC:ITLL at an excellent 3 stars, meaning it is of fair value. The rating is determined by three factors: a stock's current price, Morningstar's estimate of the stock's fair value, and the uncertainty rating of the fair value. The bigger the discount, the higher the star rating. Once again, an excellent omen for savvy investors!Breaking News: ITLL Successfully Closes Acquisition with Completion of Definitive Agreements

When going up against telecom giants, a company has to hold a competitive edge to stand out. Through our due diligence, we have found this to be undoubtedly true for ITLL. The cornerstone to every customer seeking a cell provider is the smartphones that they have available. Smartphones are expensive for your average consumer, as many flagship phones sit around the $1000 mark. ITLL has seemed to solve this problem by partnering up with the smartphone manufacturer, Leagoo. These phones have everything that the typical consumer wants at a fraction of the cost. They are well built, stylish, powerful and power through daily functions like taking photographs and browsing the web on par with phones that are five times the price. All of this seems consistent with ITLL's commitment to lower prices and maintain their competitive edge. In addition to this, they are offering all subscribers a premium mastercard, no questions asked! We believe that many consumers will find this to be an irresistible offer, making the growth potential for ITLL very attractive. 





4. The most competitive tech and phones on the market.

The Terms of Service for American Tech Report is entered into and shall be deemed wholly performed from July 24th 2017 to August 18th 2017 and shall in all respects be governed by and construed in accordance exclusively with the laws of Belize applicable to contracts made and to be entirely performed therein without regard to principles of conflicts of law. The parties specifically agree that the courts of the Caribbean Court of Justice, shall have personal and subject matter jurisdiction and exclusive venue with respect to any and all disputes in connection herewith.
American Tech Report is owned and operated by Public Ventures Of America Corp, which is a Belize based corporation. We are paid advertisers, also known as stock touts or stock promoters, who disseminate favorable information (the “Information”) about publicly traded companies (the “Profiled Issuers”).
We publish the Information on our website, americantechreport.com and in newsletters, text message alerts, audio services, live interviews, featured “research” reports, on message boards and in email communications for specific time periods that are agreed upon between us and the Profiled Issuer and / or third party paying us. Our publication of the Information is known as a “Campaign”. This information may be sent to potential investors at different times that are minutes, hours, days or even weeks apart. Typically, the trading volume and price of a Profiled Issuer’s securities increases after the information is provided to the first group of investors. Therefore, the later an investor receives the Information, the more likely it is that he will suffer trading losses if they purchase the securities of a Profiled Issuer late in a Campaign. We are paid to advertise the Profiled Issuers, Intelligent Cloud Resources, Inc. American Tech Report has been hired by a third party, Golden Island Investments Ltd., for a period beginning on July 24th 2017 and is scheduled to end on August 18th 2017 to publicly disseminate information about (ITLL) via website and email. We expect to be paid three hundred thousand dollars via a series of bank wire transfers over this period. We will update any changes to our compensation. We own zero shares of (ITLL).

Third Parties paying us to market the Profiled Issuer we believe intend to sell their shares they hold while we tell investors to purchase during the Campaign. Intelligent Cloud Resources Inc. is a penny stock that was illiquid (little to no trading volume) prior to our Campaign, and therefore these securities are subject to wide fluctuations in trading price and volume. During the Campaign the trading volume and price of the securities of each Profile Issuer will likely increase significantly because of the media exposure. When the Campaign ends, the volume and price of the Profiled Issuer will likely decrease dramatically. As a result, investors who purchase during the Campaign and hold shares of the Profiled Issuer when the Campaign ends will probably lose most, if not all, of their investment.

The Information we publish in the Campaign is only a snapshot that provides only positive information about the Profiled Issuers. The Information consists of only positive content. We do not and will not publish any negative information about the Profiled Issuers; accordingly, investors should consider the Information to be one-sided and not balanced, complete, accurate, truthful and / or reliable. We do not verify or confirm any portion of the Information. We do not conduct any due diligence, nor do we research any aspect of the Information including the completeness, accuracy, truthfulness and / or reliability of the Information. We do not review the Profiled Issuers’ financial condition, operations, business model, management or risks involved in the Profiled Issuer’s business or an investment in a Profiled Issuer’s securities.

All information in our Campaign is publicly available information from 3rd party sources and / or the Profiled Issuers and/or the 3rd parties that hire us. We may also obtain the Information from publicly available sources such as the OTC Markets, Google, NASDAQ, NYSE, Yahoo, Bing, the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Edgar database or other available public sources.

We select the stocks we profile and / or pick as we are compensated to advertise them. If an investor relies solely on the Information in making an investment decision it is highly probable that the investor will lose most, if not all, of his or her investment. Investors should not rely on the Information to make an investment decision.

The source of our compensation varies depending upon the particular circumstances of the Campaign. In certain cases, we are compensated by the Profiled Issuers, third party shareholders, and / or other parties related to the Profiled Issuers such as officers and/or directors who will derive a financial or other benefit from an increase in the trading price and/or volume of a Profiled Issuer’s securities.
We make no warranty and / or representation about the Information, including its completeness, accuracy, truthfulness or reliability and we disclaim, expressly and implicitly, all warranties of any kind, including whether the Information is complete, accurate, truthful, or reliable and as such, your use of the Information is at your own risk. The Information is provided as is without limitation.

We are not, and do not act in the capacity of any of the following; as such, you should not construe our activities as involving any of the following: an independent adviser or consultant; a fortune teller; an investment adviser or an entity engaging in activities that would be deemed to be providing investment advice that requires registration either at the federal and / or state level; a broker-dealer or an individual acting in the capacity of a registered representative or broker; a stock picker; a securities trading expert; a securities researcher or analyst; a financial planner or one who engages in financial planning; a provider of stock recommendations; a provider of advice about buy, sell or hold recommendations as to specific securities; or an agent offering or securities for sale or soliciting their purchase.


There are numerous risks associated with each Profiled Issuer and investors should undertake a full review of each Profiled Issuer with the assistance of their financial, legal, and tax advisers prior to purchasing the securities of any Profiled Issuer.
We are not objective or independent and have multiple conflicts of interest. The Profiled Issuers and parties hiring us have conflicts of interest. Third parties that have hired us and own shares will sell these shares while we tell investors to purchase, and this selling of the Profiled Issuer’s securities will likely cause investors to suffer losses.

Our publication of the Information involves actual and material conflicts of interest including but not limited to the fact that we receive monetary compensation in exchange for publishing the (favorable) Information about the Profiled Issuers; and we do not publish any negative information, whatsoever, about the Profiled Issuers; in addition to the fact that while we do not own the Profiled Issuer’s securities, the third parties that hired us do, and intend to sell all of these securities during the Campaign while we publish favorable information that instructs investors to purchase, and this selling of the Profiled Issuer’s securities will likely cause investors to suffer losses.

We are not responsible or liable for any person’s use of the Information or any success or failure that is directly or indirectly related to such person’s use of the Information because we have specifically stated that the information is not reliable and should not be relied upon for any purpose. We are not responsible for omissions and / or errors in the Information and we are not responsible for actions taken by any person who relies upon the Information.
We urge Investors to conduct their own in-depth investigation of the Profiled Issuers with the assistance of their legal, tax and / or investment adviser(s). An investor’s review of the Information should include but not be limited to the Profiled Issuer’s financial condition, operations, management, products and / or services, trends in the industry and risks that may be material to the profiled Issuer’s business and other information he and his advisers deem material to an investment decision. An investor’s review should include, but not be limited to a review of available public sources and information received directly from the Profiled Issuers or from websites such as Google, Yahoo, Bing, OTC Markets, NASDAQ, NYSE, www.sec.gov or other available public sources.

We are providing you with this disclaimer because we are publishing advertisements about penny stocks. Because we are paid to disseminate the Information to the public about securities, we are required by the securities laws including Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), to specifically disclose my compensation as well as other important information, This information includes that we may hold, as well as purchase and sell, the securities of a Profiled Issuer before, during and after we publish favorable Information about the Profiled Issuer. We may urge investors to purchase the securities of a Profiled Issuer while we sell my own shares. The anti-fraud provisions of federal and state securities laws require us to inform you that we may engage in buying and selling of Profiled Issuer’s securities before, during and after the Campaigns.

Any investment in the Profiled Issuers involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty. The securities may be subject to extreme volume and price volatility, especially during the Campaigns. Favorable past performance of a Profiled Issuer does not guarantee future results. If you purchase the securities of the Profiled Issuers, you should be prepared to lose your entire investment. Some of the risks involved in purchasing securities of the Profiled Issuers include, but are not limited to the risks stated below.

We do not endorse, independently verify or assert the truthfulness, completeness, accuracy or reliability of the Information. We conduct no due diligence or investigation whatsoever of the Information or the Profiled Issuers and we do not receive any verification from the Profiled Issuer regarding the Information we disseminate.

If we publish any percentage gain of a Profiled Issuer from the previous day close in the Information, it is not and should not be construed as an indication that the future stock price or future operational results will reflect gains or otherwise prove to be advantageous to your investment.
The Information may contain statements asserting that a Profiled Issuer’s stock price has increased over a certain period of time which may reflect an arbitrary period of time, and is not predictive or of any analytical quality; as such, you should not rely upon the (favorable) Information in your analysis of the present or future potential of a Profiled Issuer or its securities.
The Information should not be interpreted in any way, shape, form or manner whatsoever as an indication of the Profiled Issuer’s future stock price or future financial performance.

You may encounter difficulties determining what, if any, portions of the Information are material or non-material, making it all the more imperative that you conduct your own independent investigation of the Profiled Issuer and its securities with the assistance of your legal, tax and financial advisor.
When 3rd parties that hire us acquire, purchase and / or sell the securities of the Profiled Issuers, it may (a) cause significant volatility in the Profiled Issuer’s securities; (b) cause temporary but unrealistic increases in volume and price of the Profiled Issuer’s securities; (c) if selling, cause the Profiled Issuer’s stock price to decline dramatically; and (d) permit themselves to make substantial profits while investors who purchase during the Campaign experience significant losses.

The securities of the Profiled Issuers are high risk, unstable, unpredictable and illiquid which may make it difficult for investors to sell their securities of the Profiled Issuers.

We may hire third party service providers and stock promoters to electronically disseminate live news regarding the Profiled Issuers, yet we have no control over the content of and do not verify the information that the Profiled Issuers and/or third party service providers publish. These third party service providers are likely compensated for providing positive information about the Issuer and may fail to disclose their compensation to you.
If a Profiled Issuer is a SEC reporting company, it could be delinquent (not current) in its periodic reporting obligations (i.e., in its quarterly and annual reports), or if it is an OTC Markets Pink Sheet quoted company, it may be delinquent in its Pink Sheet reporting obligations, which may result in OTC Markets posting a negative legend pertaining to the Profiled Issuer at www.otcmarkets.com, as follows: (i) “Limited Information” for companies with financial reporting problems, economic distress, or that are unwilling to file required reports with the Pink Sheets; (ii) “No Information,” which characterizes companies that are unable or unwilling to provide any disclosure to the public markets, to the SEC or the Pink Sheets; and (iii) “Caveat Emptor,” signifying buyers should be aware that there is a public interest concern associated with a company’s illegal spam campaign, questionable stock promotion, known investigation of a company’s fraudulent activity or its insiders, regulatory suspensions or disruptive corporate actions.

If the Information states that a Profiled Issuer’s securities are consistent with the future economic trends or even if your independent research indicates that, you should be aware that economic trends have their own limitations, including: (a) that economic trends or predictions may be speculative; (b) consumers, producers, investors, borrowers, lenders and/or government may react in unforeseen ways and be affected by behavioral biases that we are unable to predict; (c) human and social factors may outweigh future economic trends that we state may or will occur; (d) clear cut economic predictions have their limitations in that they do not account for the fundamental uncertainty in economic life, as well as ordinary life; (e) economic trends may be disrupted by sudden jumps, disruptions or other factors that are not accounted for in economic trends analysis; in other words, past or present data predicting future economic trends may become irrelevant in light of new circumstances and situations in which uncertainty becomes reality rather than predicted economic outcome; or (f) if the trend predicted involves a single result, it ignores other scenarios that may be crucial to make a decision in the event of unknown contingencies.
The Information is presented only as a brief snapshot of the Profiled Issuer and should only be used, at most, and if at all, as a starting point for you to conduct a thorough investigation of the Profiled Issuer and its securities. You should consult your financial, legal or other adviser(s) and avail yourself of the filings and information that may be accessed at www.sec.gov, www.otcmarkets.com or other electronic media, including: (a) reviewing SEC periodic reports (Forms 10-Q and 10-K), reports of material events (Form 8-K), insider reports (Forms 3, 4, 5 and Schedule 13D); (b) reviewing Information and Disclosure Statements and unaudited financial reports filed with the OTCMarkets.com; (c) obtaining and reviewing publicly available information contained in commonly known search engines such as Google; and (d) consulting investment guides at www.sec.gov and www.finra.org. You should always be cognizant that the Profiled Issuers may not be current in their reporting obligations with the SEC and the OTC Markets and/or have negative legends and designations at otcmarkets.com.

All-Channel Trend Report>Alt Investments BDCs: Good for the Broker, Bad for the Client


    In the wake of the implosion of many non-traded REITs, non-traded business development companies (BDCs) have emerged as a relatively new structure that is getting a lot of attention. But with high up-front fees and limited liquidity, some say they’re not good for the client.  

Diana Britton | Jul 25, 2012




































	In the world of investing, product departments are constantly putting new spins on old ideas, confident there will always be investors looking for the next best thing that will provide outsized yield. Most of those new ideas are meant to make lots of money for the people who sell them. Less often, they make money for the investors who buy them.  In the wake of the implosion of many non-traded REITs, non-traded business development companies (BDCs) have emerged as a relatively new structure that is getting a lot of attention. But with high up-front fees, limited liquidity and sometimes a reliance on leverage to goose returns, buyer beware.

	“In my opinion, brokers should not be selling private anything—private placement, private REIT, private business development corporation—because it limits the flexibility, it limits liquidity, it limits transparency, and it almost always means higher fees internal,” said Joshua Brown, vice president of Investments at Fusion Analytics Investment Partners. “The only reason [non-traded BDCs] get sold is because it’s product and it’s sexy and it’s a way for a broker to get a higher fee for the same dollars that they would put into a public version.”

	According to Tony Chereso, president and CEO of FactRight, the front-end loads on BDCs are fairly similar to non-traded REITs, which are high - typically around 11.5 to 12 percent. On top of that, BDCs also typically have an incentive structure of "two and twenty," charging two percent of assets in management fees and 20% of capital gains, based on performance.

	“The downside is, it’s a huge hurdle just to get back to even,” because of the up-front fees, Brown said. “Do you know how hard it is to generate 11 percent in this day and age? With flat stock markets and Treasuries yielding 1.5 percent?”

	Non-traded BDCs are pitched as high-yield vehicles, Brown said, so that’s their sex appeal. But they also exist in the public markets, "so why would you look for one outside of that? Is the yield going to be that much better? Probably not.”

New Players in the Market

	Whenever a lot of new players jump on a trend and new assets are gathered, losses often follow. And lately, BDCs—the non-traded variety—are gaining a lot of new traction and interest from advisors and product developers.  

	“If they find that the trend is moving towards a new structure other than the non-traded REITs, I think you might see a groundswell in that direction by some people that are just taking advantage of clients looking for more non-traditional alternative investments that are maybe not subject to the same volatility that the stock market has,” said Gordon Dunne, managing director at The Financial Services Network, an OSJ of LPL Financial.

	According to FactRight, BDCs have registered approximately $7.5 billion in total equity offerings. In the first quarter of this year alone, BDCs raised $655 million, up from $233 million raised in the first quarter 2011, according to data by Robert A. Stanger & Company, Shrewsbury N.J.-based investment-banking firm.

	As of April, there were four non-traded BDCs available for investment and another six funds in registration. Franklin Square was the first to launch a non-traded BDC in 2008, but many players new to the space have launched funds recently, including CNL Securities, which uses Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. as subadvisor; ICON Investment, which uses Apollo Investment Management as subadvisor; and American Realty Capital. All three firms have a background in non-traded REITs.

	These new players are hoping to leverage off of the success of Franklin Square, Chereso said. Franklin Square now has $3.5 billion in AUM and three BDCs, the first of which was closed in May.

	“I worry about firms that are in the real estate business, then all of a sudden they’re in the business of doing what Franklin Square does,” Dunne said. “Do you really understand credit? Do you have the wherewithal internally? Do you have a relationship with firms that have a long track record of making loans to private companies? I just hope that the BDC concept doesn’t get confused.”

	Dunne’s firm invested $30 million in Franklin Square’s first BDC, FS Investment Corporation.

	Just as small, inexperienced managers entered the REIT space over the last decade, Dunne fears the same thing could happen in the BDC space.

	“There have been quite a few firms that have gravitated to this investment structure,” said Chereso. “Some of them have some direct experience,” such as on the publicly traded side of BDCs.

	But if a firm’s core competency is in another area, such as energy or real estate, and they don’t understand credit or credit underwriting, “That causes some concerns,” Chereso said.

	Many of these firms launching BDCs have strong financial positions and resources, but the question is whether they have the depth of talent and capability to manage these strategies effectively, he said.  

	“My biggest concern is there are lots of folks that are jumping into the space, particularly the sponsors, who don’t have a lot, if any, experience in corporate credit in writing BDCs,” Michael Forman, CEO of Franklin Square.

The Structure of BDCs

	BDCs provide financing to small and mid-sized businesses. In recent years, they’ve sought to capitalize on the relative lack of debt capital in these markets, as banks restricted lending to build their capital reserves, Stanger says.

	BDCs use a structure similar to non-traded REITs in that capital is raised in a continuous private offering, but BDCs are regulated under the 1940 Act that governs mutual funds. The big difference is that they’re valued quarterly, while non-traded REITs are required to publish their valuations no later than 18 months after the conclusion of the offering. (See chart below comparing other aspects of BDCs and REITs.)

	“I think there’s a lot of concern and skepticism with respect to the REITs, and they look at us as being different,” said Forman. “I think we’ve kind of forced the REITs to have to change their business model a little bit.”

	But they are private vehicles, so they don’t have the daily liquidity that comes with the public markets. “When you have the opacity and you’re away from the public market, your filing requirements are different, you don’t have to disclose as much financial metrics as you would if you were public; it gives you the opportunity to fudge numbers, prolong taking of losses, prolong taking of marks in the portfolio," Brown said.

Illiquid BDCs demand scrutiny
Desirable yields from this alternative to traditional income sources carry risks






Apr 21, 2013 @ 12:01 am
By 
	Bruce Kelly























+ Zoom




      Along with potential for attractive yields, nontraded business development companies come with a number of risks that financial advisers need to understand fully before selling them to clients, according to regulators, analysts and industry participants. Illiquid BDCs are an increasingly popular alternative investment for clients in need of income in a zero-interest-rate environment. They are sold almost exclusively through independent-contractor broker-dealers.  BDCs are typically closed-end investment companies that invest in debt and equity of private companies. Yields can be attractive due to BDCs' exposure to high credit risks that is amplified by leverage, according to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Inc.
				





SENSITIVE TO ECONOMY



+ Zoom

Keating

“The biggest issue [facing nontraded BDCs] is if we hit a rough patch in the economy,” said Tim Keating, chief executive of Keating Capital Inc., a publicly traded BDC that was listed in 2011 after six months of raising equity. BDCs buy debt of companies that have junk or non-investment-grade credit ratings and thus are extremely sensitive to the overall strength of the economy, he said. Questions that arise include the potential default rates on the loans, the risk of  defaults and whether the loans are repaid to the lender in cash or in kind, meaning by issuing more securities, he said. “This is not anything specific to the BDC vehicle,” Mr. Keating said. “That's the underlying risk to the asset class. Do advisers and investors fully understand risks associated with non-investment-grade credit?” BDC risks were highlighted by securities regulators and a leading analyst earlier this year. Illiquid BDCs have high expenses that can limit investor returns, as well as potentially lower expected returns based on lower yields, according to a report by Jonathan Bock, a senior analyst at Wells Fargo Securities LLC. The historic returns of the companies — because they are relatively new — have been limited to net asset value plus dividend appreciation. That has limited an investors' ability to buy company stock below NAV and experience appreciation, Mr. Bock noted. There also could be a sell-off in the stock of the company when it is listed and begins trading on an exchange, he wrote. In January, Finra underscored the risks of nontraded BDCs in its annual list of regulatory and exam priorities. Those risks include a lack of liquidity, Finra noted. “Due to the illiquid nature of nontraded BDCs, investors' exit opportunities may be limited only to periodic share repurchase by the BDC at high discounts,” Finra warned. It also highlighted BDCs' market, credit and leverage risks. In spite of the risks, the nontraded-BDC space is growing. From 2007 to the end of last year, nontraded BDCs raised roughly $3.4 billion in total equity, Mr. Bock reported. He counts seven such closed-end funds in operation: BDC of America, CION Investment Management, Corporate Capital Trust Inc., FS Investment Corp., FS Investment Corp. II, HMS Income Fund and the Sierra Income Corp. One broad criticism of the products is that well-known managers of nontraded real estate investment trusts, such as CNL Financial Group Inc. and Hines, have brought BDC products to market while acting only as distributors. Those dealer-managers counter that the subadvisers of the BDCs are well-qualified to invest in the private-loan arena. For example, CNL's nontraded BDC, Corporate Capital Trust, is subadvised by legendary private-equity manager KKR & Co. LP. Indeed, investors in nontraded BDCs received some encouraging news this month. Over the next nine to 18 months — perhaps sooner — the first-to-market nontraded BDC, the $2.5 billion FS Investment Corp., plans to complete a “liquidity event,” signaling the return of capital to investors. FS had an offering price of $10.80 per share and its NAV was $9.97 at the end of last year, according to a company filing with the�Securities and Exchange Commission. It has returned $5.80 per share in distributions or dividends to shareholders who bought the BDC when it was launched in 2009. It stopped raising equity capital last year. The liquidity event most likely will be a listing on a national securities exchange, FS chief executive Michael Forman told investors in a conference call this month. To increase yield and distribution before a listing, its portfolio will transition to higher-yielding investments, he said. In his report, Mr. Bock also noted that nontraded BDCs have merits compared with traded BDCs. One advantage is less fluctuation of the BDC's value. “As a result of the offering price being a function of NAV, the nontraded-BDC model allows investors to see lower volatility in their investments,” he wrote. Nontraded BDCs also have the ability to raise capital and invest at opportune times, Mr. Bock wrote. “The way a private BDC is structured, it is consistently able to raise capital in both good times and bad,” he wrote. “This eliminates the largest issue of public BDC capital-raising activities, which is that it is difficult to tap the equity market when spreads are widest.” That ability to raise capital in a steady manner is a plus for nontraded BDCs, one industry executive said. “A public BDC raises money in a big lump,” due to regulatory requirements, said Bob Grunewald, chief investment officer of BDC of America and a veteran of the traded BDC industry. “With nontraded BDCs, the quality of assets is potentially better because they are raising capital on a consistent basis.”

Fitch Downgrades Apollo Investment Corp. to 'BBB-'; Maintains Negative Outlook | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Downgrades Apollo Investment Corp. to 'BBB-'; Maintains Negative 
      Outlook
    





March 09, 2016 03:18 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has downgraded the Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR), 
      secured debt rating, and unsecured debt rating for Apollo Investment 
      Corporation (Apollo) to 'BBB-' from 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook has been 
      maintained at Negative. Today's rating actions have been taken as part 
      of Fitch's periodic peer review of Business Development Companies 
      (BDCs), which comprises 10 publicly rated firms.
    

      BDC INDUSTRY OUTLOOK
    

      Fitch's outlook for the BDC sector is negative; reflecting competitive 
      underwriting conditions, earnings pressure, underperforming energy 
      investments, unsustainable asset quality metrics, increased activist 
      pressure, and limited access to growth capital. While some firms are 
      better positioned, given their more conservative financial profiles and 
      portfolio characteristics, others are likely to see rating pressure over 
      the outlook horizon.
    

      BDCs are heavily dependent on the equity markets to fund portfolio 
      growth, but access to the market has been almost non-existent over the 
      last 18 months as share prices continue to trade at steep discounts to 
      net asset value (NAV). At March 7, 2016, rated BDCs were trading at an 
      18.3% average discount to NAV, thus preventing most from issuing stock 
      without significantly diluting existing shareholders. While the 
      reduction in portfolio growth is viewed favorably by Fitch, given tough 
      underwriting conditions, some firms may struggle to close the trading 
      gap, leaving them at a competitive disadvantage if and when investment 
      opportunities arise.
    

      The decline in commodity prices has yielded the first notable crack in 
      asset quality performance for BDCs. More broadly, asset quality metrics 
      remain at unsustainably low levels, in Fitch's opinion. While strong 
      portfolio company performance has been supported by an improving 
      economic environment, low interest rates are likely masking some 
      potential underlying company-specific issues, as issuers have been able 
      to refinance themselves out of trouble rather easily in recent years. 
      Fitch believes asset quality metrics are likely to deteriorate over the 
      near term; however, the pace of deterioration will be somewhat dependent 
      upon the rate of change in interest rates, the backdrop of the broader 
      economic environment, differing sector exposures, and the integrity of 
      individual firms' underwriting.
    

      Fitch has not observed a marked increase in leverage levels for the 
      sector, with average leverage for investment grade-rated BDCs of 
      approximately 0.74x at year-end 2015 compared to 0.60x at year-end 2014. 
      However, there is a wide dispersion of leverage around the average, and 
      those with the most energy exposure often also have the highest leverage 
      ratios. Share repurchase activity has also increased in the sector in 
      recent quarters, which could inflate leverage ratios further. Fitch 
      believes that BDCs heavily focused on maximizing leverage run the risk 
      of having less dry powder to deploy if and when underwriting conditions 
      improve, thus weakening earnings upside.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      IDRs AND SENIOR DEBT
    

      The downgrade of Apollo's ratings and the maintenance of the Negative 
      Rating Outlook are driven by the firm's continued outsized exposure to 
      oil & gas investments, which remain pressured by depressed commodity 
      prices, in addition to large exposures to aircraft financing and 
      structured investments, in combination with, what Fitch believes to be, 
      relatively high leverage levels, particularly given the risk profile of 
      the portfolio. Realized and unrealized losses on the portfolio have 
      increased over the last 12 months, as has the proportion of the 
      portfolio on non-accrual status. Fitch believes further portfolio 
      valuation declines are likely, given market volatility and commodity 
      price movements, which will pressure already high leverage levels. 
      Dividend coverage could decline, given contraction in the 
      interest-bearing portfolio, lower origination volume, and the potential 
      for additional investments to be placed on non-accrual, although will 
      likely by cushioned by management fee waivers and offsets and an 
      interest expense benefit.
    

      Despite these challenges, Apollo maintains a solid BDC platform, 
      leveraging its relationship with the parent company of its manager, who 
      has a strong track record in the credit space.
    

      Oil & gas investments accounted for 12.9% of the portfolio at Dec. 31, 
      2015, according to Fitch's calculations, which is the highest for the 
      rated peer group. In the first six months of fiscal 2016, Apollo 
      recorded realized and unrealized losses on oil & gas investments, 
      including Miller Energy Resources, Inc. (Miller Energy), Osage 
      Exploration & Development, Inc. (Osage), and Spotted Hawk Development, 
      LLC. Further market movements or company-specific challenges could 
      result in incremental valuation hits in coming quarters and eventual 
      credit losses, particularly if oil prices remain at depressed levels.
    

      Fitch recently conducted a stress test on BDC energy exposures and 
      believes Apollo's leverage ratio is one of the most vulnerable in the 
      peer group, given its outsized exposure to energy overall, and oil & gas 
      more specifically. A stress on the overall energy book, based on Sept. 
      30, 2015 balances, yielded a 12 basis point increase in Apollo's 
      already-high leverage ratio.
    

      Exposure to aviation amounted to 15.2% of the portfolio at Dec. 31, 
      2015, consisting solely of the firm's investment in Merx Aviation 
      Finance, LLC, which owns a diverse portfolio of used, current generation 
      aircraft. Apollo holds a first lien investment in Merx, with a 12% 
      coupon, in addition to 100% of Merx's common equity. Fitch views the 
      entire investment as a levered equity position, as Apollo is the 
      majority owner. Fitch believes this investment is outsized, which in 
      combination with the cyclical nature of the aviation industry, 
      introduces more valuation volatility than a portfolio of first lien 
      positions that are diversified by obligor and industry.
    

      Structured product investments, consisting largely of middle market CLOs 
      and credit-linked notes, accounted for 10.7% of the portfolio at Dec. 
      31, 2015, which is above the peer average. While Fitch recognizes that a 
      portion of these investments are driven by strategic partnerships, like 
      with Madison Capital, where Apollo has full view of the collateral in 
      the structures, the firm remains in the junior position of relatively 
      highly levered vehicles, which exposes the firm to more valuation 
      volatility and potential loss.
    

      Further, exposure to preferred and other equity securities represented 
      13.3% of the portfolio at Dec. 31, 2015, consisting of investments in 
      renewables, shipping, and the ownership interest in Merx, amongst other 
      equity investments. While Fitch believes the broader Apollo platform has 
      experience investing in these industries, these investments are 
      relatively new to the BDC platform, and it will take some time to 
      observe their credit performance, earnings, and contribution to 
      valuation volatility, given their categorization as equity exposures.
    

      Investments on non-accrual accounted for 7.4% of the debt portfolio at 
      cost and 3.3% of the debt portfolio at fair value, at Dec. 31, 2015, 
      which is above the peer average. A second lien investment in Miller 
      Energy and a first lien investment in Magnetation, LLC and Osage account 
      for the vast majority of the non-accrual exposure and are oil & gas and 
      metals & mining investments. Fitch believes Apollo's non-accruals could 
      increase over the near-term, given continued pressure on commodity 
      prices.
    

      Apollo's leverage target is 0.75 times (x) at the upper bound. At Dec. 
      31, 2015, leverage was 0.8x at par, which is above the peer average. 
      Fitch believes Apollo's leverage is high, particularly given the firm's 
      outsized exposure to aviation, oil & gas, and structured products, 
      combined with limited access to the equity markets and the potential for 
      incremental portfolio depreciation given market volatility and oil price 
      declines. Additionally, the average underlying portfolio company 
      leverage was 5.4x at quarter-end, which is modestly above the 
      peer-average. The recognition of additional unrealized depreciation 
      and/or credit losses would increase leverage, thus pressuring asset 
      coverage ratios.
    

      Since the establishment of the share repurchase program in August 2015 
      through Feb. 8, 2016, Apollo has repurchased approximately $62.4 million 
      of stock, representing 4.5% of initial shares outstanding. This has 
      yielded $0.07 of per share accretion to NAV. While Fitch appreciates the 
      motivation for the stock buyback, meaningful share repurchases are 
      viewed unfavorably given the firm's current leverage levels. Fitch would 
      view a reduction in debt, via portfolio proceeds, favorably.
    

      Fitch believes Apollo has been successful improving its funding 
      flexibility in recent years, and 61% of its total debt was unsecured as 
      of Dec. 31, 2015. However, this is expected to decline to 46.5%, on a 
      pro forma basis, following the refinancing of $200 million of 
      convertible notes with secured revolver borrowings, which occurred in 
      January 2016. Apollo has another $29 million of secured term notes due 
      in September 2016, which Fitch believes will be refinanced with secured 
      revolver borrowings and/or portfolio proceeds. Borrowing capacity on the 
      corporate revolver will decline from approximately $798.5 million at 
      year-end 2015, given the convertible note maturity mentioned above.
    

      Apollo's core operating performance is under pressure and expected to 
      remain so over the remainder of calendar 2016. Interest income declined 
      in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 with a reduction in the size of 
      the interest-bearing portfolio, an increase in non-accrual levels, and a 
      decline in prepayment fees. This dynamic is likely to continue as energy 
      investments remain under pressure and leverage levels limit growth 
      prospects. Apollo's earnings yields remain in-line with the peer group, 
      but are benefiting from the management and incentive fee waivers that 
      have been in place since April 2012. Further benefits will be realized 
      from lower interest costs, given the refinancing of fixed cost debt on 
      the corporate revolver, and from management fee offsets related to the 
      adviser's sub-advisory agreement with CION Investment Corporation.
    

      Net investment income per share continues to exceed dividends declared, 
      and, in 2016, will benefit from the refinancing of higher-cost debt on 
      the corporate revolver ($0.06 per share annually), but revenues are 
      likely to remain under pressure given current leverage levels and the 
      potential for increased non-accruals, particularly in energy. 
      Additionally, cash earnings coverage of the dividend is likely to 
      decline, as non-cash income, like paid-in-kind interest, is elevated 
      compared to peers and could increase further with portfolio company 
      strain. Furthermore, dividend coverage on a taxable income basis is 
      considered weak, given the amount of realized losses recognized by the 
      firm, aggregating to nearly $1.2 billion since 2005.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      IDRs AND SENIOR DEBT
    

      Apollo's ratings could be downgraded should leverage ratios not decline 
      to a level commensurate with the risk of the portfolio. A weakening 
      liquidity profile, deterioration in asset quality (particularly in 
      non-energy investments), material expansion of sector (eg aircraft 
      leasing, structured product) or industry (eg oil & gas) concentrations, 
      and/or an inability to cover dividends with core earnings could also 
      result in a ratings downgrade.
    

      A revision of the Outlook to Stable will be dependent upon the 
      management of leverage at a more appropriate level, the absence of 
      material losses (realized or unrealized) or credit deterioration, 
      particularly in the oil & gas portfolio, structured products, equity 
      investments, and 2013-2015 portfolio vintages, which have been 
      originated in a more challenging market environment. A reduction in 
      portfolio concentrations, improved operating performance, and an 
      improvement in dividend coverage on a taxable income basis could also 
      yield positive rating momentum.
    

      Headquartered in New York, NY, Apollo is an externally managed BDC, 
      organized on Feb. 2, 2004. As of Dec. 31, 2015, the company had 
      investments in 95 portfolio companies amounting to approximately $3.1 
      billion.
    

      Fitch has downgraded the following ratings:
    

      Apollo Investment Corporation
    

      --Long-term IDR to 'BBB-' from 'BBB';
    

      --Senior Secured Debt to 'BBB-' from 'BBB'; and
    

      --Senior Unsecured Debt to 'BBB-' from 'BBB'.
    

      The Rating Outlook is Negative.

5 Reasons ITLL May Be the Most Profitable Stock Play of 2017












OWCP - 9,900%


In 2017, cell phones are as vital to us as the air we breathe. Between both old and young, from personal users to businesses and now even hospitals, mobile phones have become an essential part of the modern eco system. Without one, people have difficulty finding employment and leave themselves negatively exposed to emergencies. The vast majority of American adults - 95% - now own a cell phone. This has resulted in the massive growth of businesses supplying and supplementing this market. Of which ITLL is now becoming a key player. 








With such immense growth in the industry and corporate giants dominating the arena, we frequently see small companies either grow exponentially or get bought out before they become a threat. This is where OTC: ITLL comes into play. Their goal is to deliver market disruptive products and pricing to the millions of consumers who are looking for better deals in the mobile phone and application space. Since ITLL is a public company, we believe this is an excellent opportunity for savvy investors to capitalize on the booming industry. We’ve done some digging and have laid out 6 reasons why we believe ITLL may be the most profitable stock play of 2017. Breaking News: ITLL Successfully Closes Acquisition with Completion of Definitive Agreements.


OWCP - 63,900%













Massive telecom acquisitions are happening all the time. They're so common in fact, we barely notice the billions of dollars that are flying between these massive corporations, month after month. For example, in 2017 alone, we've already seen several major acquisitions. Telecom service provider GTT Communications announced in June that it plans to buy network connectivity provider Global Capacity for $100 million in cash and 1.85 million shares of GTT common stock. We also saw that in April, Windstream announced its plan to acquire cloud-based unified communications provider Broadview Networks in an all-cash transaction worth $228 million. And if that isn't enough, in March, Zayo Group Holdings, Inc. closed its $1.42 billion acquisition of Electric Lightwave, the company formerly known as Integra Telecom. All of this happened in just the last few months!All this makes you wonder why this is happening and whether ITLL has what it takes to dance with the big guys. Well, it is our belief that the telecom giants scoop up the smaller, competitive companies because they are a danger to their business model. Big companies like Verizon are making money hand over fist - why stop when you can just scoop up the competition and keep business going as usual?ITLL has made it clear that their goal is to be affordable and disruptive. A similar situation took place in Canada some years ago, when a company named Wind Mobile came into play. Over a few short years Wind grew a massive user base simply because their plans were significantly cheaper than the competition. Recently, Shaw bought them out for $1.6 billion. As a result of all this, our opinion of the ITLL business model is excellent.








1. We've seen this business model work before. 


5.	QB Status and 3 stars from Morningstar. 


This is a statement that often attracts negativity from skeptics and self-pronounced market professionals. And frankly, it's understandable; it seems too good to be true. We always encourage our readers to do their own due-diligence and this is one of those scenarios. Dig through message boards, scanners and blogs and you'll quickly realize that stocks are making major moves like this on a regular basis. This isn't some mythical unicorn - once again, stocks do this on a regular basis. Below, you can see some examples of movements like this, but believe us when we say there are many, many more. 








3. One trade can make profits of 2,000% or more. 


BLDV - 5,600%










At the time of writing this article, ITLL is sitting at 80 cents. We believe that this is an extremely attractive price for a company of this caliber. As was observed above, acquisitions in this industry often come in at hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. In addition to this, 80 cents is an excellent place for traders and investors to turn quicker profits. It is much easier for a stock to double or triple at these prices, in a very short period of time. "It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price” - Warren Buffet





2. The stock is priced right. Better than right.

The OTCQB is an elite tier of the over the counter markets. These are companies that have audited financials available, are current in their reporting, have verified management and shareholders and additional disclosure requirements to meet. All in all, this signifies that ITLL is on the ball and doing business the right way. Morningstar rates OTC:ITLL at an excellent 3 stars, meaning it is of fair value. The rating is determined by three factors: a stock's current price, Morningstar's estimate of the stock's fair value, and the uncertainty rating of the fair value. The bigger the discount, the higher the star rating. Once again, an excellent omen for savvy investors!Breaking News: ITLL Successfully Closes Acquisition with Completion of Definitive Agreements

When going up against telecom giants, a company has to hold a competitive edge to stand out. Through our due diligence, we have found this to be undoubtedly true for ITLL. The cornerstone to every customer seeking a cell provider is the smartphones that they have available. Smartphones are expensive for your average consumer, as many flagship phones sit around the $1000 mark. ITLL has seemed to solve this problem by partnering up with the smartphone manufacturer, Leagoo. These phones have everything that the typical consumer wants at a fraction of the cost. They are well built, stylish, powerful and power through daily functions like taking photographs and browsing the web on par with phones that are five times the price. All of this seems consistent with ITLL's commitment to lower prices and maintain their competitive edge. In addition to this, they are offering all subscribers a premium mastercard, no questions asked! We believe that many consumers will find this to be an irresistible offer, making the growth potential for ITLL very attractive. 





4. The most competitive tech and phones on the market.

We publish the Information on our website, americantechreport.com and in newsletters, text message alerts, audio services, live interviews, featured “research” reports, on message boards and in email communications for specific time periods that are agreed upon between us and the Profiled Issuer and / or third party paying us. Our publication of the Information is known as a “Campaign”. This information may be sent to potential investors at different times that are minutes, hours, days or even weeks apart. Typically, the trading volume and price of a Profiled Issuer’s securities increases after the information is provided to the first group of investors. Therefore, the later an investor receives the Information, the more likely it is that he will suffer trading losses if they purchase the securities of a Profiled Issuer late in a Campaign. We are paid to advertise the Profiled Issuers, Intelligent Cloud Resources, Inc. American Tech Report has been hired by a third party, Golden Island Investments Ltd., for a period beginning on July 24th 2017 and is scheduled to end on August 18th 2017 to publicly disseminate information about (ITLL) via website and email. We expect to be paid three hundred thousand dollars via a series of bank wire transfers over this period. We will update any changes to our compensation. We own zero shares of (ITLL).

Third Parties paying us to market the Profiled Issuer we believe intend to sell their shares they hold while we tell investors to purchase during the Campaign. Intelligent Cloud Resources Inc. is a penny stock that was illiquid (little to no trading volume) prior to our Campaign, and therefore these securities are subject to wide fluctuations in trading price and volume. During the Campaign the trading volume and price of the securities of each Profile Issuer will likely increase significantly because of the media exposure. When the Campaign ends, the volume and price of the Profiled Issuer will likely decrease dramatically. As a result, investors who purchase during the Campaign and hold shares of the Profiled Issuer when the Campaign ends will probably lose most, if not all, of their investment.

The Information we publish in the Campaign is only a snapshot that provides only positive information about the Profiled Issuers. The Information consists of only positive content. We do not and will not publish any negative information about the Profiled Issuers; accordingly, investors should consider the Information to be one-sided and not balanced, complete, accurate, truthful and / or reliable. We do not verify or confirm any portion of the Information. We do not conduct any due diligence, nor do we research any aspect of the Information including the completeness, accuracy, truthfulness and / or reliability of the Information. We do not review the Profiled Issuers’ financial condition, operations, business model, management or risks involved in the Profiled Issuer’s business or an investment in a Profiled Issuer’s securities.

All information in our Campaign is publicly available information from 3rd party sources and / or the Profiled Issuers and/or the 3rd parties that hire us. We may also obtain the Information from publicly available sources such as the OTC Markets, Google, NASDAQ, NYSE, Yahoo, Bing, the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Edgar database or other available public sources.

We select the stocks we profile and / or pick as we are compensated to advertise them. If an investor relies solely on the Information in making an investment decision it is highly probable that the investor will lose most, if not all, of his or her investment. Investors should not rely on the Information to make an investment decision.

The source of our compensation varies depending upon the particular circumstances of the Campaign. In certain cases, we are compensated by the Profiled Issuers, third party shareholders, and / or other parties related to the Profiled Issuers such as officers and/or directors who will derive a financial or other benefit from an increase in the trading price and/or volume of a Profiled Issuer’s securities.
We make no warranty and / or representation about the Information, including its completeness, accuracy, truthfulness or reliability and we disclaim, expressly and implicitly, all warranties of any kind, including whether the Information is complete, accurate, truthful, or reliable and as such, your use of the Information is at your own risk. The Information is provided as is without limitation.

We are not, and do not act in the capacity of any of the following; as such, you should not construe our activities as involving any of the following: an independent adviser or consultant; a fortune teller; an investment adviser or an entity engaging in activities that would be deemed to be providing investment advice that requires registration either at the federal and / or state level; a broker-dealer or an individual acting in the capacity of a registered representative or broker; a stock picker; a securities trading expert; a securities researcher or analyst; a financial planner or one who engages in financial planning; a provider of stock recommendations; a provider of advice about buy, sell or hold recommendations as to specific securities; or an agent offering or securities for sale or soliciting their purchase.


There are numerous risks associated with each Profiled Issuer and investors should undertake a full review of each Profiled Issuer with the assistance of their financial, legal, and tax advisers prior to purchasing the securities of any Profiled Issuer.
We are not objective or independent and have multiple conflicts of interest. The Profiled Issuers and parties hiring us have conflicts of interest. Third parties that have hired us and own shares will sell these shares while we tell investors to purchase, and this selling of the Profiled Issuer’s securities will likely cause investors to suffer losses.

Our publication of the Information involves actual and material conflicts of interest including but not limited to the fact that we receive monetary compensation in exchange for publishing the (favorable) Information about the Profiled Issuers; and we do not publish any negative information, whatsoever, about the Profiled Issuers; in addition to the fact that while we do not own the Profiled Issuer’s securities, the third parties that hired us do, and intend to sell all of these securities during the Campaign while we publish favorable information that instructs investors to purchase, and this selling of the Profiled Issuer’s securities will likely cause investors to suffer losses.

We are not responsible or liable for any person’s use of the Information or any success or failure that is directly or indirectly related to such person’s use of the Information because we have specifically stated that the information is not reliable and should not be relied upon for any purpose. We are not responsible for omissions and / or errors in the Information and we are not responsible for actions taken by any person who relies upon the Information.
We urge Investors to conduct their own in-depth investigation of the Profiled Issuers with the assistance of their legal, tax and / or investment adviser(s). An investor’s review of the Information should include but not be limited to the Profiled Issuer’s financial condition, operations, management, products and / or services, trends in the industry and risks that may be material to the profiled Issuer’s business and other information he and his advisers deem material to an investment decision. An investor’s review should include, but not be limited to a review of available public sources and information received directly from the Profiled Issuers or from websites such as Google, Yahoo, Bing, OTC Markets, NASDAQ, NYSE, www.sec.gov or other available public sources.

We are providing you with this disclaimer because we are publishing advertisements about penny stocks. Because we are paid to disseminate the Information to the public about securities, we are required by the securities laws including Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), to specifically disclose my compensation as well as other important information, This information includes that we may hold, as well as purchase and sell, the securities of a Profiled Issuer before, during and after we publish favorable Information about the Profiled Issuer. We may urge investors to purchase the securities of a Profiled Issuer while we sell my own shares. The anti-fraud provisions of federal and state securities laws require us to inform you that we may engage in buying and selling of Profiled Issuer’s securities before, during and after the Campaigns.

Any investment in the Profiled Issuers involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty. The securities may be subject to extreme volume and price volatility, especially during the Campaigns. Favorable past performance of a Profiled Issuer does not guarantee future results. If you purchase the securities of the Profiled Issuers, you should be prepared to lose your entire investment. Some of the risks involved in purchasing securities of the Profiled Issuers include, but are not limited to the risks stated below.

We do not endorse, independently verify or assert the truthfulness, completeness, accuracy or reliability of the Information. We conduct no due diligence or investigation whatsoever of the Information or the Profiled Issuers and we do not receive any verification from the Profiled Issuer regarding the Information we disseminate.

If we publish any percentage gain of a Profiled Issuer from the previous day close in the Information, it is not and should not be construed as an indication that the future stock price or future operational results will reflect gains or otherwise prove to be advantageous to your investment.
The Information may contain statements asserting that a Profiled Issuer’s stock price has increased over a certain period of time which may reflect an arbitrary period of time, and is not predictive or of any analytical quality; as such, you should not rely upon the (favorable) Information in your analysis of the present or future potential of a Profiled Issuer or its securities.
The Information should not be interpreted in any way, shape, form or manner whatsoever as an indication of the Profiled Issuer’s future stock price or future financial performance.

You may encounter difficulties determining what, if any, portions of the Information are material or non-material, making it all the more imperative that you conduct your own independent investigation of the Profiled Issuer and its securities with the assistance of your legal, tax and financial advisor.
When 3rd parties that hire us acquire, purchase and / or sell the securities of the Profiled Issuers, it may (a) cause significant volatility in the Profiled Issuer’s securities; (b) cause temporary but unrealistic increases in volume and price of the Profiled Issuer’s securities; (c) if selling, cause the Profiled Issuer’s stock price to decline dramatically; and (d) permit themselves to make substantial profits while investors who purchase during the Campaign experience significant losses.

The securities of the Profiled Issuers are high risk, unstable, unpredictable and illiquid which may make it difficult for investors to sell their securities of the Profiled Issuers.

We may hire third party service providers and stock promoters to electronically disseminate live news regarding the Profiled Issuers, yet we have no control over the content of and do not verify the information that the Profiled Issuers and/or third party service providers publish. These third party service providers are likely compensated for providing positive information about the Issuer and may fail to disclose their compensation to you.
If a Profiled Issuer is a SEC reporting company, it could be delinquent (not current) in its periodic reporting obligations (i.e., in its quarterly and annual reports), or if it is an OTC Markets Pink Sheet quoted company, it may be delinquent in its Pink Sheet reporting obligations, which may result in OTC Markets posting a negative legend pertaining to the Profiled Issuer at www.otcmarkets.com, as follows: (i) “Limited Information” for companies with financial reporting problems, economic distress, or that are unwilling to file required reports with the Pink Sheets; (ii) “No Information,” which characterizes companies that are unable or unwilling to provide any disclosure to the public markets, to the SEC or the Pink Sheets; and (iii) “Caveat Emptor,” signifying buyers should be aware that there is a public interest concern associated with a company’s illegal spam campaign, questionable stock promotion, known investigation of a company’s fraudulent activity or its insiders, regulatory suspensions or disruptive corporate actions.

If the Information states that a Profiled Issuer’s securities are consistent with the future economic trends or even if your independent research indicates that, you should be aware that economic trends have their own limitations, including: (a) that economic trends or predictions may be speculative; (b) consumers, producers, investors, borrowers, lenders and/or government may react in unforeseen ways and be affected by behavioral biases that we are unable to predict; (c) human and social factors may outweigh future economic trends that we state may or will occur; (d) clear cut economic predictions have their limitations in that they do not account for the fundamental uncertainty in economic life, as well as ordinary life; (e) economic trends may be disrupted by sudden jumps, disruptions or other factors that are not accounted for in economic trends analysis; in other words, past or present data predicting future economic trends may become irrelevant in light of new circumstances and situations in which uncertainty becomes reality rather than predicted economic outcome; or (f) if the trend predicted involves a single result, it ignores other scenarios that may be crucial to make a decision in the event of unknown contingencies.
The Information is presented only as a brief snapshot of the Profiled Issuer and should only be used, at most, and if at all, as a starting point for you to conduct a thorough investigation of the Profiled Issuer and its securities. You should consult your financial, legal or other adviser(s) and avail yourself of the filings and information that may be accessed at www.sec.gov, www.otcmarkets.com or other electronic media, including: (a) reviewing SEC periodic reports (Forms 10-Q and 10-K), reports of material events (Form 8-K), insider reports (Forms 3, 4, 5 and Schedule 13D); (b) reviewing Information and Disclosure Statements and unaudited financial reports filed with the OTCMarkets.com; (c) obtaining and reviewing publicly available information contained in commonly known search engines such as Google; and (d) consulting investment guides at www.sec.gov and www.finra.org. You should always be cognizant that the Profiled Issuers may not be current in their reporting obligations with the SEC and the OTC Markets and/or have negative legends and designations at otcmarkets.com.

The board of directors also will draft bylaws for the corporation Bylaws are basically written protocols that define the way that the corporation will be governed. Corporations are required to hold annual meetings for both the shareholders and the board of directors. The annual meetings are held to discuss and decide on important decisions that are faced by the corporation.

Commonly Asked Questions for starting a C Corporation




 Are Non-U.S. Residents Allowed to Own a Corporation or LLC?

There are no citizenship or residence requirements for ownership of a C Corporation or an LLC. The S-Corporation however does not allow nonresident aliens to be shareholders (owner), but any US citizen or resident alien may be a shareholder (owner). You would, of course, require an in state street address for the state to forward official legal and tax correspondence including service of process, known as the registered agent address, but neither residency nor citizenship is required for ownership of a C Corporation or an LLC.



 In What State Should I Form my LLC or Corporation?

Unless you plan on having a large, multi-state operation, it is generally best to form your company in the state in which it is located.Generally speaking, most states will expect you to be registered with them if there is substantial ongoing business and/or a physical presence in that state. If you do form your company in a state other than the one in which your company is located, you may ultimately need to register your company as a foreign (out of state) company with your home state, which will subject you to all of the fees, taxes, and regulations of that state.



 What are the Differences Between Officers, Directors and Shareholders?

A corporation consists of all three: officers, directors and shareholders. Shareholders are the owners of the corporation and elect the directors. Directors guide and are involved in the fundamental decisions of the corporation on behalf of the shareholders. Officers are selected by the directors and run the day-to-day operations of the corporation. These do not need to be separate people. Any person can fill all three positions. In small businesses, one person can be the only shareholder, the only director, and the only officer.





 What is a C Corporation?


A C Corporation is a completely separate tax and legal entity from its owners, and owners who work in the business are treated and taxed as employees of the corporation (Note: The "C" in C Corporation refers to a sub chapter of the tax code; C Corporations are one of the most common forms of corporations, and they are frequently referred to generically as corporations).
C Corporations are subject to corporate income taxes separate from the owners, where most other forms of business entity allow for the company profits to "pass-through" to the personal income tax statements of the owners. As such, C Corporations are the most formal business entity and they have greater tax reporting responsibilities than other business entities. C Corporations allow for profits to be retained in the business, if desired, and frequently these profits can be taxed at a lower rate than personal income. C Corporations can also pay out after tax profits to its owners in the form of dividends, but this can also lead to double taxation.



 What is Stock Par Value?

Par value is a nominal dollar amount given to corporate shares. It doesn't necessarily reflect their real value, and is typically set at a low value (i.e. one dollar or one cent). The par value of a share is the minimum price at which it may be sold to shareholders, and the par value must be the same for all shares of the same class. The shares can be sold to the initial shareholders, at par value or more, but the price must be the same for each share. Not all states require a par value. Unless you specify otherwise, IncFile will authorize 1500 shares (this is due to the fact that 1500 is easily divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) with a par value of one cent, or at no par value if not required by your state.



 What are Bylaws?

The bylaws of a corporation are an internal document that contains rules for holding corporate meetings and carrying out other formalities according to state corporate laws. Bylaws are not filed with the state.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
