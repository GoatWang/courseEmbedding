Objectives
•
Define basic principles of toxicology as they 
apply to both ecological and physiological 
systems
•
Evaluate sources, effects, and fates of toxins 
in individual components of ecosystems
•
Promote understanding of how toxic effects 
are integrated within ecosystems and on a 
global scale
•
Increase knowledge of current issues in 
environmental toxicology









Toxicology
•
Toxicology is the study of the 
adverse effects of hazardous 
substances on living systems, 
the mechanisms underlying 
those effects and the 
conditions under which they 
are likely to occur.

History of Toxicology: 
Paracelsus
“What is there that is not poison? All 
things are poison and nothing (is) 
without poison. Solely the dose 
determines that a thing is not a poison” 
Pracelsus (1493-1541).









Toxicology
•
What is a Toxin?
Toxic substances produced naturally. A 
toxin is any poisonous substance of microbial (bacteria or 
other tiny plants or animals), vegetable, or synthetic 
chemical origin that reacts with specific cellular 
components to kill cells, alter growth or development, or 
kill the organism.

Toxicology
•
What is a Toxicant? Toxic substances that are 
produced by or are a by-product of human-made 
activities.
•
dioxin (2,3-7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-
p
-dioxin {TCDD}), 
produced as a by-product of certain chlorinated chemicals
•
arsenic, a toxic metal, may occur as a natural contaminant of 
groundwater or may contaminate groundwater as a by-
product of industrial activities. If the second case is true, 
such toxic substances are referred to as toxicants, rather 
than toxins. 









Toxicology
•
Environmental Toxicology is the 
study of the effects of exposure of 
organisms and ecosystems to 
toxins/toxicants in the environment 
(air, water, soil and food).
