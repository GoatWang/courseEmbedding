Bob Evans Farms, Inc. Announces Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year Ended April 28, 2017; Provides Consolidated Earnings Guidance for the Fiscal Year 2018
Jun 15 17
Bob Evans Farms, Inc. announced unaudited consolidated earnings results for the fourth quarter and full year ended April 28, 2017. For the quarter, the company reported, on a GAAP basis, net income of $108.9 million, or $5.39 per diluted share, compared with net income of $0.6 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in the corresponding period last year. Non-GAAP consolidated net income was $12.2 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, compared with non-GAAP net income of $9.5 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, in the corresponding period last year.  Adjusted net sales were $99,923,000 against $95,274,000 a year ago. Net sales from continuing operations were $99.9 million, a decrease of $2.5 million, or 2.4%, compared to $102.4 million in the corresponding period last year. GAAP operating income from continuing operations was $9.5 million, compared to $10.3 million in the corresponding period last year. Non-GAAP operating income from continuing operations was $13.8 million, compared to $11.3 million in the corresponding period last year, an improvement of $2.5 million. The improvement was due primarily to the aforementioned increase in pounds sold and the favorable sales mix of higher-margin side-dish items; partially offset by higher production costs, and increased freight expense resulting from increased pounds sold. 

For the year, the company reported net sales from continuing operations were $394.8 million, an increase of $7.2 million, or 1.9%, compared to $387.6 million in the prior year. GAAP operating income from continuing operations was $30.1 million, compared to $33.1 million in the prior year. Non-GAAP operating income from continuing operations was $53.0 million, compared to $37.7 million in the prior year, an improvement of $15.3 million.  Non-gaap net income from continuing operations was $33,083,000 or $1.64 per diluted share against $19,343,000 or $0.90 per diluted share a year ago. Adjusted net sales were $394,842,000 against $380,496,000 a year ago. The improvement was due primarily to the aforementioned increase in pounds sold and the favorable sales mix of higher-margin side-dish items, partially offset by a $4.9 million increase in trade spending net of lower sow costs, lower average net selling prices and higher production costs and increased freight expense resulting from increased pounds sold. Purchase of property, plant and equipment was $65,768,000 against $65,694,000 a year ago. Net cash provided by operating activities was $73,558,000 against $123,636,000 a year ago.


For the fiscal 2018, Net sales is expected to be in between $464 to $476 million, EBITDA is expected to be in between $102 to $108 million, GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in between $2.06 to $2.24, Capital expenditures is expected to be in between $25 to $30 million, Net interest expense is expected to be in between $3.8 to $4.3 million and GAAP tax rate is expected to be in between 34.5% to 35.5%.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Bob Evans Farms, Inc. has received 3.75 out of 5 stars based on 10 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Early life and career[edit]
Evans was born on May 30, 1918, to Elizabeth Lewis and Stanley L. Evans in Sugar Ridge, Ohio,[1] located in Center Township in Wood County, Ohio, where his father and uncle farmed on rented land.[2]
The family moved to Gallia County, Ohio in 1929 to be near relatives. The family settled in Gallipolis, Ohio where his father owned and managed a grocery store.[3] Evans attended public schools in Gallipolis and graduated with honors in 1937 from the Greenbrier Military School, a boys-only private military boarding high school in Lewisburg, West Virginia. He attended The Ohio State University School of Veterinary Medicine from 1937 to 1939.[4]
Evans married Jewell Waters in June 1940. They moved to Gallipolis, where he bought a restaurant named the Malt Shop in the early 1940s. When Evans was inducted into the Army in 1943, he sold his interest in the restaurant to a friend.
Bob Evans Farms got its start when Evans began making sausage on his southeastern Ohio farm to serve at a 12-stool diner he owned in nearby Gallipolis in 1948. Evans could not find a source of satisfactory sausage, so he began making his own, slaughtering his own hogs and using the best parts of the hog. The building where he made the sausage was built with open ends, at the suggestion of his father, so it could be used as a machinery shed if the sausage business failed. In 1953, a group of friends and family recognized the growing demand for Evans's sausage and became his business partners by establishing Bob Evans Farms. The original Bob Evans Restaurant on the farm was called The Sausage Shop. Although it started with 12 stools, today the restaurant can seat 134.
Bob Evans Restaurants[edit]
In 1953, the business was incorporated as Bob Evans Farms Inc. By 1957, the company opened a total of four sausage plants to keep up with demand. In 1963, Bob Evans Farms Inc. was listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange with an original issue of 160,000 shares. Evans served as a director and president of the company until his retirement on December 31, 1986.
Local restaurants weren't willing to buy Evans' sausage, so Evans started his own, with the first opening on his farm in 1962. These restaurants were designed in a red and white color "Steamboat Victorian" style. The first of these "new" Bob Evans Restaurants was located in Chillicothe, Ohio, but by the early 1970s, the restaurants had expanded throughout Ohio. Expansion into other states was started in the late 1970s. As of 2012, Bob Evans Farms, Inc. was a $1.7 billion restaurant and retail food products company that has restaurants in 19 states.[5]
In a bid to consolidate profits the company closed 27 stores nationwide starting in April 2016. This has affected approximately 1100 workers who were offered termination benefits if relocation was not possible.[6]
Accomplishments and community support[edit]
Although Evans retired from the company in 1986, he remained actively involved in his community and with numerous causes. Evans encouraged local farmers to use more efficient livestock grazing techniques that are better for the environment.
The only person in Ohio to be honored three times by the National Wildlife Federation, Evans spent more than 40 years preserving wildlife. He also planted seeds for the future of the agricultural industry through his support of youth organizations such as 4-H and FFA and his involvement in higher education. He was a former member of the Ohio Board of Regents, the state's public higher education governing board. He also worked with college students at The Ohio State University's College of Food, Agricultural and Environmental Sciences. He also supported many community organizations, including the Heart Fund, Ohio Society for the Prevention of Blindness, Arthritis Foundation and Easter Seals.
In 2005, Evans was honored by FAO as an inaugural "I'm a Child of Appalachia" honoree for his philanthropic efforts, entrepreneurial success, and support of improved access to higher education in the region. The "I'm a Child of Appalachia" campaign uses individual success stories to promote greater investment in the region to increase student access to post-secondary education.[7]
Death and burial[edit]
Bob Evans died in 2007 while being treated at the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, from complications of a stroke. He was recuperating from pneumonia when he suffered the fatal cerebrovascular accident.[8] Bob Evans is buried in Mound Hill Cemetery in Gallipolis, Ohio.[1]

Early life and career[edit]
Evans was born on May 30, 1918, to Elizabeth Lewis and Stanley L. Evans in Sugar Ridge, Ohio,[1] located in Center Township in Wood County, Ohio, where his father and uncle farmed on rented land.[2]
The family moved to Gallia County, Ohio in 1929 to be near relatives. The family settled in Gallipolis, Ohio where his father owned and managed a grocery store.[3] Evans attended public schools in Gallipolis and graduated with honors in 1937 from the Greenbrier Military School, a boys-only private military boarding high school in Lewisburg, West Virginia. He attended The Ohio State University School of Veterinary Medicine from 1937 to 1939.[4]
Evans married Jewell Waters in June 1940. They moved to Gallipolis, where he bought a restaurant named the Malt Shop in the early 1940s. When Evans was inducted into the Army in 1943, he sold his interest in the restaurant to a friend.
Bob Evans Farms got its start when Evans began making sausage on his southeastern Ohio farm to serve at a 12-stool diner he owned in nearby Gallipolis in 1948. Evans could not find a source of satisfactory sausage, so he began making his own, slaughtering his own hogs and using the best parts of the hog. The building where he made the sausage was built with open ends, at the suggestion of his father, so it could be used as a machinery shed if the sausage business failed. In 1953, a group of friends and family recognized the growing demand for Evans's sausage and became his business partners by establishing Bob Evans Farms. The original Bob Evans Restaurant on the farm was called The Sausage Shop. Although it started with 12 stools, today the restaurant can seat 134.
Bob Evans Restaurants[edit]
In 1953, the business was incorporated as Bob Evans Farms Inc. By 1957, the company opened a total of four sausage plants to keep up with demand. In 1963, Bob Evans Farms Inc. was listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange with an original issue of 160,000 shares. Evans served as a director and president of the company until his retirement on December 31, 1986.
Local restaurants weren't willing to buy Evans' sausage, so Evans started his own, with the first opening on his farm in 1962. These restaurants were designed in a red and white color "Steamboat Victorian" style. The first of these "new" Bob Evans Restaurants was located in Chillicothe, Ohio, but by the early 1970s, the restaurants had expanded throughout Ohio. Expansion into other states was started in the late 1970s. As of 2012, Bob Evans Farms, Inc. was a $1.7 billion restaurant and retail food products company that has restaurants in 19 states.[5]
In a bid to consolidate profits the company closed 27 stores nationwide starting in April 2016. This has affected approximately 1100 workers who were offered termination benefits if relocation was not possible.[6]
Accomplishments and community support[edit]
Although Evans retired from the company in 1986, he remained actively involved in his community and with numerous causes. Evans encouraged local farmers to use more efficient livestock grazing techniques that are better for the environment.
The only person in Ohio to be honored three times by the National Wildlife Federation, Evans spent more than 40 years preserving wildlife. He also planted seeds for the future of the agricultural industry through his support of youth organizations such as 4-H and FFA and his involvement in higher education. He was a former member of the Ohio Board of Regents, the state's public higher education governing board. He also worked with college students at The Ohio State University's College of Food, Agricultural and Environmental Sciences. He also supported many community organizations, including the Heart Fund, Ohio Society for the Prevention of Blindness, Arthritis Foundation and Easter Seals.
In 2005, Evans was honored by FAO as an inaugural "I'm a Child of Appalachia" honoree for his philanthropic efforts, entrepreneurial success, and support of improved access to higher education in the region. The "I'm a Child of Appalachia" campaign uses individual success stories to promote greater investment in the region to increase student access to post-secondary education.[7]
Death and burial[edit]
Bob Evans died in 2007 while being treated at the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, from complications of a stroke. He was recuperating from pneumonia when he suffered the fatal cerebrovascular accident.[8] Bob Evans is buried in Mound Hill Cemetery in Gallipolis, Ohio.[1]

Expansion into other states was started in the late 1970s. As of 2012, Bob Evans Farms, Inc. was a $1.7 billion restaurant and retail food products company that has restaurants in 19 states.[5]
In a bid to consolidate profits the company closed 27 stores nationwide starting in April 2016. This has affected approximately 1100 workers who were offered termination benefits if relocation was not possible.[6]
Accomplishments and community support[edit]
Although Evans retired from the company in 1986, he remained actively involved in his community and with numerous causes. Evans encouraged local farmers to use more efficient livestock grazing techniques that are better for the environment.
The only person in Ohio to be honored three times by the National Wildlife Federation, Evans spent more than 40 years preserving wildlife. He also planted seeds for the future of the agricultural industry through his support of youth organizations such as 4-H and FFA and his involvement in higher education. He was a former member of the Ohio Board of Regents, the state's public higher education governing board. He also worked with college students at The Ohio State University's College of Food, Agricultural and Environmental Sciences. He also supported many community organizations, including the Heart Fund, Ohio Society for the Prevention of Blindness, Arthritis Foundation and Easter Seals.
In 2005, Evans was honored by FAO as an inaugural "I'm a Child of Appalachia" honoree for his philanthropic efforts, entrepreneurial success, and support of improved access to higher education in the region. The "I'm a Child of Appalachia" campaign uses individual success stories to promote greater investment in the region to increase student access to post-secondary education.[7]
Death and burial[edit]
Bob Evans died in 2007 while being treated at the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, from complications of a stroke. He was recuperating from pneumonia when he suffered the fatal cerebrovascular accident.[8] Bob Evans is buried in Mound Hill Cemetery in Gallipolis, Ohio.[1]
Upon learning of his death Ohio governor Ted Strickland remarked: "Bob Evans was a true original. His life's work was bringing the warmth, hospitality and good food of Ohio to rest of the nation. We here in Ohio are all proud of him and we are all deeply saddened by his passing." [9]
Bob Evans Farm[edit]
Main article: Wood Old Homestead
Bob and Jewell Evans purchased the Niamiah Woods farm near Rio Grande, Ohio from Rio Grande College in 1952. They lived in the farmhouse for nearly twenty years. Now the old homestead is called Bob Evans Farm and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The house is the home of the Homestead Museum about Bob Evans and his company. The Bob Evans Farm Festival, featuring crafts, antiques, demonstrations, and entertainment, is held every year at the farm in Rio Grande during the second weekend of October.[10]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
