Timberland

BTG Pactual Timberland Investment Group (“TIG”) brings more than 35 years of experience to the management of over 1.8 million acres of commercial timberlands in Latin America, the USA, Europe and Africa, representing assets and commitments of nearly US$ 3 billion.
The Timberland team applies a tremendous depth of expertise across the value chain, from portfolio design and investment management to timberland operations and asset sales. We offer our clients exposure to attractive risk-adjusted returns through timberland portfolios diversified by geography, species, product type, and end markets. We leverage the extensive industry networks of the TIG team and the broader networks of the BTG Pactual platform to source compelling investment opportunities in targeted markets.
Our current strategies focus on large assets in mature timberland markets that offer inflation-resistant returns, capital appreciation, and strong annual cash yields, as well as diversified assets in rapidly developing emerging markets where higher growth rates and strong domestic demand may offer higher returns.
