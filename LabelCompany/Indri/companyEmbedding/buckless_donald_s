McDonald's (MCD) Buckles Up for Q2 Earnings: A Beat in Store?HomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets close in 53 mins.S&P 5002,478.43+1.30 (+0.05%)Dow 3021,703.86+90.43 (+0.42%)Today's ChartsWhy Facebook earnings could show a big surprise to the upsideMcDonald's (MCD) Buckles Up for Q2 Earnings: A Beat in Store?Zacks Equity ResearchZacksJuly 21, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareWe expect burger giant, McDonald's Corp. MCD, to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 numbers on Jul 25, before the opening bell.Last quarter, McDonald's pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 11.36%. In fact, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last eleven quarters, with a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 7.01%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.McDonald's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise McDonald's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | McDonald's Corporation QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that McDonald's is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: McDonald's has an Earnings ESP of +1.24% because the Most Accurate estimate is $1.64, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $1.62. A favorable Earnings ESP serves as a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: McDonald's currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of McDonald's favorable Zacks Rank and positive Earnings ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.What is Driving Better-than-Expected Earnings?Global comps at McDonald’s have been positive for the last seven quarters, marking a trend that is likely to continue in the second quarter as well. This appears to be the result of the company’s strategic efforts to boost sales.In sync with these efforts, the company has been focusing on operational excellence, product innovation, undertaking efficient marketing and promotions, offering a value menu, and rolling out more limited-time offerings to improve guest count – which remains the company’s top priority – and drive the top line.Moreover, efforts to enhance digital capabilities, increased focus on delivery and accelerated deployment of Experience of the Future restaurants in the U.S. might further propel the quarter’s results.However, a slowdown in emerging markets and the prevailing challenging restaurant environment in the domestic space are likely to hurt sales. Meanwhile, higher labor costs along with currency headwinds might dent the quarter’s profits.Other Stocks to ConsiderMcDonald's is not the only company looking up this earnings season. Here are some other companies to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Yum! Brands, Inc. YUM has an Earnings ESP of +1.64% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Whole Foods Market, Inc. WFM has an Earnings ESP of +2.94% and a Zacks Rank #3.The Priceline Group Inc. PCLN has an Earnings ESP of +2.31% and a Zacks Rank #3.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.Read MoreSee This Ticker Free >>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
