History

Global Citizenship


History

CarVal Investors was founded in 1987.  As a value investor, CarVal grew rapidly and established a firm foundation in the wake of the United States’ financial crisis of the early 1990’s.  In the years that followed, CarVal expanded to Europe, Asia and Latin America as investment opportunities developed from ever-changing credit market cycles.
In 2006, CarVal Investors became an independent subsidiary of Cargill, allowing the firm to expand more broadly as a fund manager.
Today, with an experienced senior team of investment professionals and dedicated operations, tax and legal teams across the globe, CarVal Investors is a leading alternative investment fund manager.
CarVal Investors’ reputation is its most valuable asset. No investment, no employee, no relationship is more important to the organization than its reputation for the highest ethical conduct.


  The photography on this website features The Niña, a full-size replica of the great caravel ship sailed by Christopher Columbus in 1492. Like the caravel ship, CarVal Investors strives to maintain speed, agility, strength and integrity.
