What are analysts saying about AXT stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about AXT stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "AXT, Inc., designs, develops, manufactures and distributes high-performance compound semiconductor substrates, as well as opto-electronic semiconductor devices such as high-brightness light emitting devices, and vertical cavity surface emitting lasers.   " (6/27/2017)
2. Needham & Company LLC analysts commented, "Before market open, AXTI announced that a fire at its Beijing manufacturing facility on the evening of March 15 has halted wafer production, impacting revenue for the current quarter. Luckily no one was injured but AXTI reduced 1Q17 revenue guidance by $1.5-2.0 million as a result. Clearly, this operational issue has no long-term impact on AXTI, and we continue to believe AXTI is well positioned to leverage growth in the optical space driven by demand for InP and the potential opportunity around 3D sensing. With meaningful top and bottom-line growth ahead, we would be a buyer on any weakness related to this news." (3/16/2017)

Consensus Ratings for AXT (NASDAQ:AXTI) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?)

Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 4 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.80)Consensus Price Target: $8.50 (11.84% upside)

What are analysts saying about AXT stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about AXT stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "AXT, Inc., designs, develops, manufactures and distributes high-performance compound semiconductor substrates, as well as opto-electronic semiconductor devices such as high-brightness light emitting devices, and vertical cavity surface emitting lasers.   " (6/27/2017)
2. Needham & Company LLC analysts commented, "Before market open, AXTI announced that a fire at its Beijing manufacturing facility on the evening of March 15 has halted wafer production, impacting revenue for the current quarter. Luckily no one was injured but AXTI reduced 1Q17 revenue guidance by $1.5-2.0 million as a result. Clearly, this operational issue has no long-term impact on AXTI, and we continue to believe AXTI is well positioned to leverage growth in the optical space driven by demand for InP and the potential opportunity around 3D sensing. With meaningful top and bottom-line growth ahead, we would be a buyer on any weakness related to this news." (3/16/2017)

Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations.

Caxton Associates is a global macro hedge fund founded by Bruce Kovner in 1983 and is headquartered in New York City.[3][4] The firm also has offices in London, Sydney, and Princeton, New Jersey. Caxton Associates identifies investments according to their research of global markets and analysis of worldwide economic trends.[5]
Caxton Associates went through a major generational transition in 2008 when Bruce Kovner stepped back from trading and appointed Andrew Law as Chief Investment Officer.[6] In 2011, Law was appointed as the Chairman, CEO and controlling general partner of Caxton Associates, following the retirement of Kovner.[7]

History[edit]
Caxton was founded in 1983 by Bruce Kovner.[2] Kovner trained under Michael Marcus at Commodities Corporation (now part of Goldman Sachs International), before embarking on his own with the founding of Caxton.[8]
In 1992, Caxton closed its fund to new investors.[8] The fund then opened and closed intermittently, and most recently reopened to new investors in August 2013.[9]
It was reported that at the end of the 1990s Caxton Global Investments volatility fell substantially along with the funds returns.[4]
In 2003 concern at Caxton Associates around the potential future impact on their historical rate of return due to their fund's size resulted in 20 percent of investors' capital being returned.[10] Assets under management post 20% were $9.5 billion.[10]
On December 21, 2007, Caxton-Iseman Capital, a joint investment partnership Caxton Associates and Frederick Iseman announced that it had completed its spin-off from Caxton Associates. Caxton-Iseman Capital will change its name to CI Capital Partners LLC.[11]
In 2008, Bruce Kovner stepped back from trading and appointed Andrew Law as Caxton’s Chief Investment Officer. In 2011, Law was appointed as the Chairman, CEO and controlling general partner of Caxton Associates, following the retirement of Kovner.[6] Law joined the London office in 2003 from Goldman Sachs, where he was Managing Director and head of FICC proprietary trading in London.[7]
2008 Financial Crisis[edit]
During the 2008 financial crisis Caxton Associates did not erect gates freezing investor capital in their Caxton Global Investments fund.[12] As reported the fund saw client redemptions totalling 27% of assets under management through 2008–2009—while returning 13% for the year.[12] The redemptions were reportedly born out of cash strapped clients many of whose asset allocations were gated and frozen at other investment management companies: two years later the firm had fallen from No. 16 to No. 51.[12]
In 2010 it was reported that since 1983 Caxton Associates had returned $12.8 billion to clients whilst managing $6 billion; ranking second amongst managers who have returned more than they currently manage.[13][14]
Company[edit]
Caxton Associates' offices are in New York, London's Mayfair district, Sydney, and Princeton, NJ.[15]
Investments[edit]
Caxton Associates is a global macro hedge fund and has made more than $13bn for its clients - according to LCH Investments - this is roughly 14 per cent annually, with half the volatility of the S&P 500.[7]
According to an interview with Andrew Law in the Financial Times in October 2013, Caxton has “three core principles”: “One is listen to the markets, a second one is politics and policy matters and the third one is risk control.”[7]
Investment vehicles[edit]
The firm's flagship fund was reported in August 2011 to account for $7 billion of Caxton Associates assets under management.[5]

History[edit]
Caxton was founded in 1983 by Bruce Kovner.[2] Kovner trained under Michael Marcus at Commodities Corporation (now part of Goldman Sachs International), before embarking on his own with the founding of Caxton.[8]
In 1992, Caxton closed its fund to new investors.[8] The fund then opened and closed intermittently, and most recently reopened to new investors in August 2013.[9]
It was reported that at the end of the 1990s Caxton Global Investments volatility fell substantially along with the funds returns.[4]
In 2003 concern at Caxton Associates around the potential future impact on their historical rate of return due to their fund's size resulted in 20 percent of investors' capital being returned.[10] Assets under management post 20% were $9.5 billion.[10]
On December 21, 2007, Caxton-Iseman Capital, a joint investment partnership Caxton Associates and Frederick Iseman announced that it had completed its spin-off from Caxton Associates. Caxton-Iseman Capital will change its name to CI Capital Partners LLC.[11]
In 2008, Bruce Kovner stepped back from trading and appointed Andrew Law as Caxton’s Chief Investment Officer. In 2011, Law was appointed as the Chairman, CEO and controlling general partner of Caxton Associates, following the retirement of Kovner.[6] Law joined the London office in 2003 from Goldman Sachs, where he was Managing Director and head of FICC proprietary trading in London.[7]
2008 Financial Crisis[edit]
During the 2008 financial crisis Caxton Associates did not erect gates freezing investor capital in their Caxton Global Investments fund.[12] As reported the fund saw client redemptions totalling 27% of assets under management through 2008–2009—while returning 13% for the year.[12] The redemptions were reportedly born out of cash strapped clients many of whose asset allocations were gated and frozen at other investment management companies: two years later the firm had fallen from No. 16 to No. 51.[12]
In 2010 it was reported that since 1983 Caxton Associates had returned $12.8 billion to clients whilst managing $6 billion; ranking second amongst managers who have returned more than they currently manage.[13][14]
Company[edit]
Caxton Associates' offices are in New York, London's Mayfair district, Sydney, and Princeton, NJ.[15]
Investments[edit]
Caxton Associates is a global macro hedge fund and has made more than $13bn for its clients - according to LCH Investments - this is roughly 14 per cent annually, with half the volatility of the S&P 500.[7]
According to an interview with Andrew Law in the Financial Times in October 2013, Caxton has “three core principles”: “One is listen to the markets, a second one is politics and policy matters and the third one is risk control.”[7]
Investment vehicles[edit]
The firm's flagship fund was reported in August 2011 to account for $7 billion of Caxton Associates assets under management.[5]
