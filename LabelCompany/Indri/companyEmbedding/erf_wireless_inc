Critical Communications Solutions
When You Need Them
ERF Wireless was founded in 2004 as a “Critical Communications Infrastructure” public company with the express objective of applying advanced wireless broadband technology and other communications technology to a select suite of enterprise, commercial and retail critical communications needs in order to build shareholder value. Since that time, the company’s strategic business plan has been to buy the “best of breed” Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs) providing broadband services in rural areas and increase their profits exponentially. This has been accomplished by offering high-speed wireless broadband products and services to traditional WISP commercial and residential customers and then overlaying that traditional customer base with a number of specialized vertical markets, each with its own specialized critical communications needs, such as oil and gas, healthcare and education.
This strategy has not only allowed ERF Wireless to become one of the largest WISPs in the U.S., it has also successfully positioned the company as the nation’s leading provider of secure terrestrial wireless networks for the oil and gas industry as well as for the regional banking industry. In addition, ERF Wireless has recently increased its focus on using these same networks to provide terrestrial wireless broadband to regional healthcare facilities and education institutions.
Today, the company is continuing to aggressively build and operate wireless broadband networks throughout North America, utilizing a combination of acquisitions, strategic partnerships and new network construction.
ERF Wireless is a fully reporting public corporation with four divisions supplying wireless broadband product and services: Enterprise Network Services (Banks, Educational Institutions, Healthcare Facilities), Bundled Wireless Services (WISP), Network Operations (Overall Operational Support) and Wireless Messaging Services (Product Manufacturing and Maintenance). The company also has a wholly owned subsidiary, Energy Broadband, Inc. (Oil & Gas).

Critical Communications Solutions
When You Need Them
ERF Wireless was founded in 2004 as a “Critical Communications Infrastructure” public company with the express objective of applying advanced wireless broadband technology and other communications technology to a select suite of enterprise, commercial and retail critical communications needs in order to build shareholder value. Since that time, the company’s strategic business plan has been to buy the “best of breed” Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs) providing broadband services in rural areas and increase their profits exponentially. This has been accomplished by offering high-speed wireless broadband products and services to traditional WISP commercial and residential customers and then overlaying that traditional customer base with a number of specialized vertical markets, each with its own specialized critical communications needs, such as oil and gas, healthcare and education.
This strategy has not only allowed ERF Wireless to become one of the largest WISPs in the U.S., it has also successfully positioned the company as the nation’s leading provider of secure terrestrial wireless networks for the oil and gas industry as well as for the regional banking industry.

Network Operations


















 















Network Operations
The services provides by the Network Operations Division are conducted from the state-of-the-art Network Operations Center (NOC) corporate facility located at the ERF Wireless headquarters in League City, Texas. Not only does the NOC have the capability to quickly locate the source of a network problem in any ERF Wireless or customer network, it is also tasked with the responsibility of working with other organizations within ERF Wireless and dispatches ERF Wireless maintenance technicians or local area subcontractor technicians when maintenance or service requirements dictate.
The objective of the Network Operations Division is to detect network weaknesses or malfunctions before they become major problems and to alert either the Wireless Bundled Services technical staff, the Energy Broadband technical staff or the Enterprise Network Services staff, depending on whether it is a Wireless Bundled Services, Energy Broadband or Enterprise Network Services network. The Network Operations Division also serves as a focal point of communications as the respective network is repaired by the responsible field service engineers and technicians. Finally, once the network is repaired and fully functional, the Network Operations personnel complete the service process by notifying the appropriate ERF Wireless division or subsidiary that the network is fully repaired and operational and that it is being returned to full monitoring status.
The Network Operations Division is also responsible for generating periodic network status and usage reports for all of the networks it monitors. These reports are available to ERF Wireless management as well as to bank network and other third party customers.
In addition to its support function of all ERF Wireless divisions and subsidiary networks, the Network Operations Center maintains all of the ERF Wireless internal IT infrastructure and is a profit center for company. It provides maintenance and monitoring services for a variety of commercial enterprise customers that are acquired through the sales efforts of the company’s other divisions.

Banking


















 















Bank Networks
As the leading provider of secure wireless networks for the regional banking industry in the U.S., Enterprise Network Services (ENS) offers next generation, bank-to-bank, data connectivity solutions through high-speed wireless telecommunications networks that allow financial institutions to own their own networks instead of signing expensive long-term leases with telecom providers. ERF Wireless networks are presently being used by more than 100 banking locations in the central and southern United States.
With the demand for innovative retail banking products, fast disaster recovery, item imaging and bank security on the rise, regional financial institutions must remain competitive. A custom designed and built private wireless network through ENS will enable financial institutions to:
• Reduce network operating costs by replacing expensive Telco T1s with secure high-speed wireless broadband networks
• Increase network performance with broadband speeds up to 150MB to each branch that facilitate Voice over IP, video conferencing and complex application technologies
• Increase additional revenue streams by reselling excess wireless bandwidth through ERF Wireless Bundled Services’ WiNet partner program
• Utilize 24/7 network monitoring and maintenance programs provided by ERF Enterprise Network Services
• Achieve complete network security using ERF Enterprise Network Services’ patented proprietary CryptoVue® technology that allows wireless networks to securely transmit private financial information in full compliance with all Federal regulations
• Create effective business continuity and disaster recovery strategies that allow a faster response to re-establishing critical services lost during natural disasters

FAQ


















 









 












Frequently Asked Questions
Question: Why is ERF Wireless still acquiring wireless broadband businesses in addition to building its own wireless networks?
Answer: Although ERF Wireless is continuing to construct a portion of its existing footprint in selected regions, in many cases it’s more economical and time-efficient to acquire large blocks of wireless broadband coverage than to construct a similar footprint. In addition, the acquisitions eliminate potential competitors in the geographical areas where they are acquired.
​
Question: Where will ERF Wireless find wireless broadband companies to acquire?
Answer: ERF Wireless continues to compile a database of wireless broadband companies and their demographics that are strategic to the ERF Wireless strategic plan of providing “critical communications infrastructure communications” services to the enterprise rural broadband vertical market sector of North America. This database continues to be refined and is the basis for selecting specific acquisition targets.
​
Question: Why would a potential acquisition target have an interest in selling its company to ERF Wireless?
Answer: Most wireless broadband networks are privately funded and have a few hundred or, at most, a few thousand customers. Most of these companies have not grown to the size where the economies of scale are possible for all of their overhead functions and, therefore, still require some cash infusion by their investors. These investors are locked into their investment and have no near-term path to liquidity without selling to ERF Wireless or someone doing a similar rollup. By combining a number of these networks and utilizing the network infrastructure to serve a number of vertical market enterprise customers in the same area, ERF Wireless can reach the economies of scale that produce positive cash flow and profitability. In this case, one plus one can actually equal three.
​
Question: Since ERF Wireless has its corporate headquarters located near Houston, Texas, will the acquisition strategy initially focus on the southern United States?
Answer: Not necessarily, although many of the broadband networks in the southern U.S. are more familiar to ERF Wireless and offer excellent acquisition opportunities. As of January 2012, ERF Wireless has acquired sixteen companies and now has the largest terrestrial broadband wireless network covering oil and gas territories in North America.
​
Question: What wireless broadband technology does ERF Wireless primarily utilize in its national wireless broadband footprint?
Answer: ERF Wireless utilizes a combination of high-capacity, point-to-point, proprietary wireless technology, plus industry standard, point-to-multipoint technology, including Wi-Fi, WiMax and Meshing Technology. Both licensed and un-licensed technology is utilized throughout the networks.
​
Question: How is ERF Wireless currently financed?
Answer: ERF Wireless currently has as customers a large number of major oil and gas and energy companies, financial institutions, healthcare facilities, educational institutions, as well as almost 3,000 wireless commercial and residential customers throughout Texas, New Mexico, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Colorado, Wyoming, North Dakota and Louisiana. These recurring-revenue customers provide much of the operating overhead cash flow needed by ERF Wireless. Additional operational and growth cash needs are also provided by private investment from various individuals, institutional investors and other entities.
​
Question: Will ERF Wireless do an IPO in the future?
Answer: ERF Wireless cannot do an IPO in the future since it is already a fully reporting public company. However, ERF Wireless does plan to move from trading on the NASDAQ Bulletin Board Exchange to a larger national exchange, such as the NASDAQ Small Cap Exchange or the American Stock Exchange, as soon as it achieves all of the listing requirements.
​
Question: Does ERF Wireless utilize public or private financing to fund its acquisition and growth campaigns?
Answer: ERF Wireless is utilizing public financing. In addition, ERF Wireless is receiving private financing from high-net-worth individuals who recognize the potential from an investment in ERF Wireless before the acquisition and growth activity is fully reflected in the ERF Wireless stock pricing.
​
Question: When ERF Wireless issues stock in a Private Placement to raise capital, will the stock that is issued be immediately tradable?
Answer: No. Any new public stock issued as part of a Private Placement must first be issued as SEC Rule 144 restricted stock. It will then either be registered by the company or the holder may sell under Rule 144 after holding the stock for six months.

About Us












 



 






















About Us
ERF Wireless, Inc. is a fully reporting public corporation headquartered in League City, Texas. The company is a “Critical Infrastructure Communications Service Company”, primarily operating in the enterprise vertical market sector of North American rural broadband. The company provides secure, high-capacity wireless and other communications products and services to a broad spectrum of customers in underserved rural and suburban areas. We provide high quality broadband services, as well as basic communications services to residential, commercial, oil and gas, banking, healthcare and educational customers in those areas that are traditionally unable to receive such services. We are also a comprehensive solutions provider to other enterprise customers, providing them with a wide array of communications services, including high-speed broadband and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephone and facsimile service.
The company’s principals have experience in network integration, triple-play Fiber-To-The-Home (FTTH), IPTV content delivery, and Internet banking and encryption technology. They have been instrumental in developing encrypted, wireless broadband networks, fiber-to-the-home projects, and a number of secure Internet solutions. The founders of ERF Wireless, Inc. also have extensive experience in building and managing private and public companies, having founded more than twenty companies over the past thirty years.
The company has four operating divisions and a wholly owned subsidiary that provide solutions and services to different segments of the wireless industry.
Energy Broadband utilizes the wireless broadband expertise, project management skills, wireless network coverage footprint, monitoring and maintenance capabilities, proprietary security technology and the resources of the other divisions of ERF Wireless to provide a unique wireless broadband product and service offering to the major oilfield producers and service providers, including secure, cost-effective data transmission to and from drilling rigs and production wells throughout North America. The data transmission capabilities of Energy Broadband are extremely cost-effective and much more robust than any of the existing sources of data transmission utilized by the oil and gas industry.
The Enterprise Network Services Division provides banks and financial institutions with secure, next generation data connectivity. This division is also structured to provide the turnkey design and implementation of secure wireless broadband networks for enterprise-class applications, including healthcare facilities, educational institutions, cities and unincorporated municipalities.
The Wireless Bundled Services Division provides wireless broadband Internet connectivity, VoIP telephone service and a number of other traditional ISP services. Currently, the Wireless Bundled Services Division owns and operates one of the largest wireless broadband networks in the U.S. and is expected to grow significantly over the next few years through a combination of acquisitions and internal growth.
The Network Operations Division provides the overall day-to-day maintenance and 24/7 monitoring of all wireless broadband networks that the company constructs, acquires, maintains and administers. It also provides project-level wireless broadband system design, construction and implementation.

                                ERF Wireless progresses into new oil and gas territories amid growing demand for wireless broadband solutions
            


            April 29, 2010
        






















ERF Wireless, a provider of enterprise-class wireless broadband products and services, announced that the company’s Oil & Gas Services Division has recently taken delivery of the first unit in a family of new mobile broadband trailers that are proprietary to ERF Wireless and that are equipped with 100-foot deployable towers. These giant mobile broadband towers (MBTs) are unique to the industry as compared to the more common 50-foot MBTs currently being used across most ERF Wireless networks. These new 100-foot MBTs were specifically designed and developed for the tall forested regions of certain oil and gas drilling regions where even VSAT communications with much lower bandwidth have trouble transmitting beyond the 80- to 90-foot tree canopies surrounding the drilling rigs. In particular, new ERF Wireless network coverage initiatives into areas such as recently announced Haynesville Shale region would not be possible without this new 100-foot MBT.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
