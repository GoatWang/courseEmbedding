      Terminals LP, a leading independent operator of petroleum and refined 
      product terminals. Arc Terminals operates petroleum product terminals in 
      eight states, with an aggregate storage capacity of 3.6 million barrels.
    

      “Our partnership with GE and investment in Gulf LNG Energy underscore 
      our desire to make strategic investments in the U.S. energy logistics 
      and infrastructure sector,” said Vince Cubbage, CEO of Lightfoot 
      Capital. “We feel strongly that GE’s financial backing and expertise 
      within the energy sector will allow us to accelerate our growth strategy 
      within our existing markets as well as related energy logistics asset 
      classes.”
    

      “Our investment in Lightfoot Capital reflects our strategy of working 
      with experienced management in areas we know well and pursuing growth 
      platforms in critical US energy infrastructure,” said Dan Castagnola, a 
      Managing Director at GE Energy Financial Services in Houston.

GE Expands Critical US Energy Infrastructure Investment Portfolio by Acquiring Majority Stake in Petroleum Products Storage Operator









TEXAS, US, Oct 24, 2011 — 
GE Energy Financial Services, a unit of GE (NYSE: GE), is deploying its capital in critical US infrastructure and expanding into petroleum product terminals by investing $85 million to become a majority owner of Lightfoot Capital Partners, LP ("Lightfoot Capital").
GE Energy Financial Services purchased a 58 percent interest in New York–based Lightfoot Capital from an investment vehicle managed by an affiliate of Magnetar Capital ("Magnetar Capital"). Lightfoot Capital, in turn, is the majority–owner of Arc Terminals, which operates petroleum product terminals in eight states.
"Our investment in Lightfoot Capital reflects our strategy of pursuing growth platforms in critical US energy infrastructure, working with experienced management in areas we know well," said Dan Castagnola, a managing director at GE Energy Financial Services in Houston. "We are deploying our capital, expertise and potentially some additional assets to support Lightfoot Capital's transition into a successful Master Limited Partnership."
GE Energy Financial Services already holds an interest in a Master Limited Partnership, Regency Energy Partners, LP (NASDAQ: RGP), a midstream natural gas services provider. By investing in Lightfoot Capital, GE Energy Financial Services is expanding beyond midstream to petroleum product terminals, diversified across regions, sites, customers and products.
"GE Energy Financial Services' acquisition of a majority interest in Lightfoot Capital significantly expands our ability to both source and complete attractive acquisitions, and accelerates our growth strategy," said Vince Cubbage, the CEO of Lightfoot Capital.
In addition to GE, Lightfoot Capital's investors are Atlas Energy, LP (NYSE: ATLS), Magnetar Capital, Tortoise Capital Resources Corp. (NYSE: TTO) and Triangle Peak Partners Private Equity, LP, as well as funds and accounts under management by BlackRock Investment Management, LLC.
GE Energy Financial Services' current midstream equity and debt portfolio totals approximately $2.4 billion. It has invested in gas storage assets, a LNG regasification terminal and 40,000 miles of gas pipelines. GE Energy Financial Services is also involved in oil and gas production, from partnerships that own reserves to production platforms.
About GE
GE (NYSE: GE) is an advanced technology, services and finance company taking on the world's toughest challenges. Dedicated to innovation in energy, health, transportation and infrastructure, GE operates in more than 100 countries and employs about 300,000 people worldwide.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/type.object.type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
