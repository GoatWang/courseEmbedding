Shari Burgess is Vice President and Treasurer of Lear Corporation, where she is responsible for global corporate financing activities, including capital structure, capital markets, commercial/investment banking and rating agency relationships, as well as global insurance, cash and risk management. In her 20 years with Lear, Burgess has had the unique opportunity to be part of the leadership team that grew and transitioned a private .4 billion North American seat assembly supplier into a public  billion global Fortune 250 Tier I automotive supplier.
Burgess' positions at Lear, together with her prior experience as Audit Manager with Ernst & Young, have provided her with a diverse professional background, which includes treasury/investment banking, corporate finance and financial planning & analysis, M&A, investor relations, SEC reporting and accounting. Her leadership responsibility or direct participation in all elements of critical corporate level transactions demonstrates an in-depth understanding of business strategy, capital markets, stakeholder value creation and corporate governance. She has led several acquisitions (both private and public) in multiple countries.
Burgess was named "one of the 100 leading women in the North American automotive business" by Automotive News in 2010, "one of Detroit's most influential women" by Crain's Detroit Business in 2007 and was recognized in Treasury and Risk Magazine's 2011 Women in Finance List. She is the Immediate-Past Chair of Inforum Center for Leadership, a not-for-profit organization that provides leadership programming and other support to advance women into positions of leadership. She was also a founding member of the steering committee for the launch of the United Way Women's Initiative to promote early childhood literacy.
She received a bachelor's degree in Professional Management and Economics from Albion College in Albion, Michigan, and a master's degree in Business Administration from the University of Michigan. She is a Certified Public Accountant in the State of Michigan.
Burgess was appointed to the HAP Board in 2012.
