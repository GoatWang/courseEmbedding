                  Nice guy, horrible teacher. Hw/discussions/review sessions not relevant to exams. Got tested only on the book. Only given 45 mins to finish final. Asked for more time to ensure I understood/work through the questions and said it wasnt necessary. Told us not to go back to change our answers. Interesting material, horrible class.

                  Great professor. Material was not easy, but the tests are fair and he is great at explaining the concepts in auditing. gives Great tips for CPA exam. i believe his tests resemble the CPA portion of AUD. He also tells pretty interesting stories and makes sure we remember the concepts through these stories.

                  Great Professr, not a difficult course- his tests are very reflective of the outlines that he does in lecture.  SO NICE TOO!!  He really cares about his students and wants to make sure you understand the material.  He is a good connection to have too if you are looking into going into accounting as a career

                  if you are a person who likes to go over the textbook, and does not rely on lecture, he's okay. He basically go overs the homework on a really really slow pace. His test was not impossible, but he reviews the stuff that we haven't even learned.. I barely recommend him although he is a great person( accountant), he is not the best professor

                  He is a quite boring professor, but he really cares about his students and loves answering questions you might have, so don't be shy to ask questions, even stupid questions. He is nice and helpful! I will take his class next time for sure!

                  This guy is pretty easy. You only have to go to class five times, once for the midterm and the final and the other three times to turn in the HW. The final and midterm took me about 25 minutes each, all mc and true/false. All you have to do is the prac problems and u will get an A. He rounded the midterm average up to an 89. Ya, he is that easy.

                  He is pretty straightforward of what you must learn in this class. His exams are multiple choice and based on the textbook. His lectures are straight from the textbook. He is a good professor.

                  He reads out of the textbook during lectures and can take a very long time to explain simple things so most people skip class.  The book is a lot better than his notes.  He cares for his students but unfortunately he is so bad at writing tests that knowing everything doesn't necessarily guarantee and A.

                  Simply the worst professor I've had at UCSD. Class is pretty much useless, exams are not impossible but hard, especially because he doesn't curve and only gives two short exams, which means if you miss a point on one of them you lose like 4%. AVOID THIS GUY!

                  He likes to talk about random story during lecture, does not curve, does not give + and - for grade, and bases class on 2 exams and a couple homework assignments which accounts for about 8% of the grade. Make sure you don't make mistake on the exams since each questions you get wrong will cause you a chunk of your grade

                  Ok so basically attending class is a serious waste of time, just don't go because he spends time going through what's on the book at a very slow pace (you could do it faster on your own in the library); he also pauses to tell not so relevant stories and some bad jokes. His tests are not the fairest, and also he doesn't curve.

                  I'm sure he's a great accountant, but he can't teach for crap. During class he just tells you to open your book and look at the diagrams. When he does put up examples on the board, they don't relate to the homework at all. I'd avoid this professor.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Florida:













Does Anderson John Charles carry a valid contracting license?



If you pay someone to construct a building or a structure, make structural alterations to load bearing walls, or perform services such as plumbing or air conditioning work, that person must have a state contractor's license.











How important is contractor licensing in Florida?



The Florida Construction Industry License Board maintains high standards for contractor licensing. Prior to receiving their license, Florida contractors are required to prove four years of relevant work experience or education; pass a board examination and prove financial solvency.











Your liability risk when hiring Anderson John Charles



In Florida, licensed contractors with employees are required to carry workers' compensation insurance and attest they have obtained public liability and property damage insurance in the amounts determined by the Board.











Financial recourse when hiring Anderson John Charles



Florida maintains a recovery fund, called the Florida Homeowners' Construction Recovery Fund, which is available to a natural person who has suffered monetary damages by the financial mismanagement or misconduct of a contractor, and who has exhausted all other sources of payment. The Board makes the determination of eligibility for an award. Florida contractors are not required to carry an active bond.











What else should I know before hiring Anderson John Charles



As of 2007, the Florida DBPR began requiring license applicants to submit their fingerprints, which are used to run a criminal background check with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. In addition, they are required to provide a credit report during the license application process to demonstrate financial stability. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Florida Construction Industry License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

John Charles AndersonJuly 1, 1950 ~ May 18, 2008 AROMAS, CA – John Charles Anderson, 57, passed away on May 18, 2008 of a heart attack. Born on July 1, 1950, in Nashville, TN, he resided in Aromas at the time of his death.  He worked at the Salinas Valley State Prison as a registered nurse in the department of mental health.
