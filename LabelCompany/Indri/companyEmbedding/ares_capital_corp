These 3 Dividend Stocks Could Slash Their Payouts


July 15, 2017, 08:40:00 AM EDT
By Jordan Wathen, Motley Fool










































 Shareholders of   Triangle Capital    (NYSE: TCAP) ,   Ares Capital    (NASDAQ: ARCC) , and   Hercules Capital    (NYSE: HTGC) should look at these stocks' sky-high yields with   skepticism. As business-development companies (BDCs), these   stocks reward investors with high yields, thanks to a requirement   that they distribute 90% of their income to shareholders. BDCs   can be thought of as   closed-end funds    that make loans and equity investments in small, private   companies around the United States. Recently, the yields BDCs can earn on new investments have   come down, and loan losses have increased. It's likely that these   three companies will have to cut their dividends to align their   payouts with their true earnings power.   Gravity is working against these three companies' lofty     payouts to investors. Image source: Getty Images. Triangle Capital In 2012, Triangle Capital was flying high as one of the most   richly valued BDCs on the market. It rapidly issued stock to   deploy new capital, but time has shown that it grew by   sacrificing lending standards rather than by finding a new pool   of vast opportunity. In the third quarter of 2014, cracks began to appear when the   company wrote down investments by $0.79 per share in a single   quarter. It papered over the loss with a large equity offering,   which helped the company show an increased book value on a   per-share basis, but it was a warning sign of what was to come.   The company ultimately slashed its regular quarterly dividend   from $0.54 per share to $0.45 per share starting in the second   quarter of 2016. That cut may not have gone deep enough.   Image source: Author. Triangle Capital has recently failed to earn its dividend from   operating income, reporting $0.42 in net investment income in   each of the last three quarters against a dividend rate of $0.45   per quarter. On a recent conference call, executives explained   that the shortfall was partially because Triangle isn't operating   at capacity, pointing out that it has $500 million of dry powder   to make new loans and equity investments. This could,   theoretically, generate about $0.07 to $0.08 in additional   operating income per share on a quarterly basis if it were   deployed in full. I buy their math, but I'm not buying that it will be easy for   Triangle to responsibly grow its portfolio fast enough for income   to rise to meet the dividend. Over $120 million of investments at   fair value will come due by the end of 2018. Add its dry powder   of $500 million to repayments of $120 million and you have $620   million of investments that Triangle Capital needs to make in the   next 18 months to become fully invested, an amount that doesn't   include any unexpected repayments or future loan losses. Loan   losses are the wild card; it seems likely that we have yet to see   the full brunt of losses from investments made during its rapid   expansion period. Lenders can generally grow quickly, or grow responsibly, but   only rarely can they do both simultaneously. In the past,   Triangle's rapid loan growth led to large losses, as the company   prioritized growth over underwriting quality. Given this, cutting   the dividend by 10% to 15% to give it ample dividend coverage in   the here and now is perhaps the most responsible thing to do. Ares Capital Corporation The bellwether of the BDC industry grew larger when it closed   on its   acquisition of American Capital    at the beginning of 2017, growing its equity base by roughly 40%.   But that acquisition may have been untimely, if only because it   gave Ares Capital excess capacity to underwrite new loans, just   as yields were plummeting. Like Triangle, Ares Capital has   substantial capacity to underwrite new loans and equity   investments, but yields are much less attractive than they were   just a few short quarters ago. Based on my analysis of its most recent quarterly filing, the   company has about $961 million of investments that will mature by   the end of 2018, plus another $1.9 billion of capital that will   come back as it winds down a relationship with a subsidiary of GE   Capital. Management looked at its capital differently on the conference   call, suggesting that it has about $3 billion of total capital to   rotate into new investments, a figure that includes $1.1 billion   of low-yielding assets it acquired from American Capital, plus   the $1.9 billion coming back from the unwinding of its   partnership with GE Capital.   Image source: Author. But no matter how I slice and dice the amount of capital that   Ares Capital has to invest, it's my view that the   math simply doesn't work    . I calculate that Ares Capital needs a 10% yield on its entire   investment portfolio to maintain its dividend, a return that it   hasn't been able to achieve. And any loan losses only add to the   required-return hurdle. A blue sky loss assumption of 1% of loans   -- which would be remarkable, given where we are in the credit   cycle -- would put the required return Ares needs closer to   11%. Even for the industry's largest company, $3 billion is a lot   of money to rotate into new investments, equal to roughly   one-fourth of its asset base. Furthermore, Ares Capital is on   borrowed time. A fee waiver that adds about $0.10 to annual   operating income on a per-share basis is only in effect for 10   quarters. A combination of lower yields on available investment   opportunities, temporary earnings support from fee waivers, and a   need to deploy $3 billion of capital, makes it likely that Ares   Capital will cut its dividend in the not-so-distant future. Hercules Capital This business-development company lost a lot of luster when it   proposed a change    to its operating model. At issue was how its employees are   compensated. Under the current model, Hercules pays employees   directly. Under the proposed model, Hercules Capital's employees   would go to work for a management company owned by Hercules'   current CEO, and Hercules would pay a fee, based on the size of   its assets and its returns, to the management company. Shareholders voted on the proposal with their feet. After   trading at roughly 1.6 times book value, shares cratered, and   have found a new valuation range between 1.3 and 1.4 times book,   reflecting the lost trust between Hercules and its   shareholders.       HTGC Price to Tangible Book Value    data by   YCharts.  Although the plan was scuttled when it became clear that   management lacked the votes necessary to approve externalizing   its management team, it's my view that the issue will come up   again in the future. Hercules' CEO Manuel Henriquez said on a   conference call that followed its announcement that he had   "spent nearly four years working on this project" to externalize   the management team. Rarely are big plans allowed to die so   easily. Henriquez has a huge incentive to push the issue. He owns just   over 2% of the company -- thus he receives roughly 2% of the   value created by its low-cost internal-management structure. If   externalized, his newly created management company would   effectively collect 100% of the value created. It's fair to   characterize the externalization proposal as a complicated payday   for Henriquez. Compensation appears to be the crux of the issue. Henriquez   stated on a conference call following the announcement that the   effort to externalize the management team was "there to hopefully   retain and encourage those valuable employees to continue to   remain at the asset manager and continue to develop value for our   shareholders." There are multiple ways for managers to extract value from a   business development company -- externalizing is only one   way. I'm left to believe that if Hercules cannot externalize   its management team, compensation expenses will likely trend   higher. Hercules' expenses will go up, and earnings will go down.   With operating income of $0.28 recently failing to cover its   dividend distributions of $0.31 per quarter, and management   dreaming up plans to extract more value from the BDC, I think   this 9% yield is living on borrowed time.   10 stocks we like better than Ares Capital       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

SoundCloud, the ‘YouTube for audio’, cuts 173 jobs, closes San Francisco, London offices

HBO and Cinemax come to Hulu, but you’ll need the new app to watch












Some rough news today for SoundCloud, the audio streaming site whose content is largely based around uploads from its 175 million users in 190 countries. The company has announced that it is laying off 173 employees, and it is closing offices in San Francisco and London. The moves are being described as cost cutting measures “to ensure our path to long-term, independent success,” in the words of co-founder and CEO Alex Ljung, who revealed the news in a blog post. The startup, which was founded in Berlin in 2008, will continue to have offices in Berlin and New York.
The news comes after a rough period for SoundCloud. After entering into talks but never closing two potential acquisitions, first to Twitter and then to Spotify, Soundcloud arranged a $70 million credit line in March of this year to help the business continue to operate as it worked on closing a round of funding believed to be in the region of $100 million.
Today’s news could mean one of two things: either the funding never closed and/or investors who are considering it have laid down some cost-cutting conditions in order to see it go through. The fact that there is no funding round being announced today makes me guess that the round has yet to close.
SoundCloud — which was co-founded by Ljung and Eric Wahlforss — to date has raised around $193 million. Its current investors include Universal, Sony and Warner Music — who all took stakes as part of the company’s efforts to move away from a strong issue around licensing for tracks uploaded to its platform.
Other backers include as a number of VCs and others including GGV, Index, IVP, KPCB, Twitter (who invested about two years after the acquisition deal fell through) and Union Square Ventures.
At the time of the credit line, the company told us in a statement that it was expecting 2.5-times year-on-year growth at the company:
“We are pleased to have secured a flexible $70 million credit line from Ares Capital, Kreos Capital and Davidson Technology that is ideally structured for a company with our strong credit rating and in our stage of growth,” a spokesperson for the company said in a statement. “This new funding will enable SoundCloud to strategically grow our technology and personnel resources to fuel our expected 2.5 times year-over-year growth in 2017, while building a financially sustainable platform on which our connected community of creators, listeners and curators can thrive for years to come.”
In today’s blog post by Ljung, he noted that revenue has “more than doubled” (notably leaving out the 2.5x figure). But in any case, those revenues are not massive: in the company’s last UK filings, a condition of operating in the UK, it noted that 2015 revenues were at €21.1 million, or $24 million, implying fiscal year 2016 revenues of about €50 million.
But at the same time, SoundCloud’s losses have continued to grow: 2015’s net loss was just over €51 million.
In addition to funding and financial issues, there are questions about what direction the actual business is taking.
SoundCloud has been making a lot of efforts to build out revenue-generating services, currently focused mainly around subscription tiers for premium content for users; special tiers for content creators; and advertising. However, it’s not at all clear how many users it has picked up in these areas, or how well the ad play is working as the company has never disclosed numbers.
It has also faced a lot of changes in its personnel. Most recently, the company parted ways with its chief content officer, Stephen Bryan. It’s chief revenue officer, Alison Moore, who joined last year, appears to still be with the company.
The bigger picture has been a somewhat grim one for the digital music industry: although digital has overtaken recorded, physical music as the primary way that people “purchase” and consume music today, the economics of the business have never added up. Pandora and Spotify, the two biggest streaming companies today, are both operating at a loss. Pandora recently picked up a new investor, Sirius XM, but it appeared to come at its own cost: the company also sold off its Ticketfly ticketing business, parted ways with its iconic CEO and closed its small international operations.
Spotify, meanwhile, is still inching its way to an IPO, but you can see why the company is taking it slow: given the number of casualties and challenges in the digital music industry, I’m guessing the company wants to build up as large of a business as it can, both in terms of users and revenue-generating services, as it can before debuting in the unforgivable public markets.
I wouldn’t write off SoundCloud just yet, though. The company has a massive user base and, for now, at a time when video continues to be what everyone focuses on, occupies a unique place in the market as a platform for creators to share their audio work. Whether that gets superceded by others with bigger pockets, is one big question; as is the other of whether SoundCloud finally figures out a winning formula from making money out of this still-popular format.

About Ares Capital Corp




About Ares Capital
Experienced Leadership. One-Stop Financing. Dependable Partner.



Ares Capital Corporation ("Ares Capital" or "ARCC") is a leading specialty finance company that provides one-stop solutions to meet the distinct and underserved financing needs of private middle-market companies across diverse industries. Our flexibility, structuring expertise and self-origination capabilities enable us to invest across the capital structure and to meet the full spectrum of our clients' financing needs. As a patient, long-term investor with permanent capital, we have developed a reputation for the flexibility of our approach, a willingness to hold large positions and the ability to offer sponsors and management teams increased certainty of execution. We provide flexible debt capital to middle-market companies and, on a lesser scale, to (i) power generation projects and (ii) early stage and emerging growth companies backed by venture capital firms. 
 
We have elected to be regulated as a business development company ("BDC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Our common stock is publicly traded on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol "ARCC". Ares Capital is the largest BDC by both market capitalization and total assets with approximately $12.0 billion of total assets as of March 31, 2017. On January 3, 2017, Ares Capital closed its acquisition of American Capital, Ltd. (NASDAQ: ACAS), enhancing ARCC's position as a leading direct lender to U.S. middle market companies. The partners and investment committee members for Ares Capital's investment adviser possess an average of more than 24 years of relevant experience.
 
Ares Capital is externally managed by Ares Capital Management LLC ("Ares Capital Management"), a subsidiary of Ares Management, L.P. (NYSE:ARES) ("Ares"), a publicly traded, leading global alternative asset manager with offices located across the U.S., Europe and Asia. Ares Capital Management is able to leverage the power of the broader Ares platform to access resources, relationships and significant capital markets, trading and research expertise to provide ARCC with attractive investment opportunities.
 
Ares Capital's portfolio company, Ivy Hill Asset Management, L.P. ("IHAM"), an SEC registered investment adviser, manages 22 vehicles and serves as the sub-manager or sub-servicer for two other vehicles as of March 31, 2017. In conjuction with the completion of the acquisition on January 3, 2017, American Capital Asset Management, LLC ("ACAM"), a wholly owned portfolio company of ACAS, merged with and into IHAM, a wholly owned portfolio company of Ares Capital, with IHAM remaining as the surviving entity as a wholly owned portfolio company of Ares Capital. IHAM is the external manager of American Capital Senior Floating, Ltd., (NASDAQ:ACSF), a non-diversified closed-end investment management company that invests primarily in first lien and second lien floating rate loans to large market, U.S. based companies and invest in equity tranches of collateralized loan obligations.

About Ares Management
Ares History



Ares History
Credit Origins. Strategic Expansion. Proven Results.
Our history and track record highlight our deep expertise and strong fundamentals, with thoughtful, strategic expansion creating cross-platform synergies for our investors.




Credit Beginnings
In 1997, Ares was founded by a veteran team of investment professionals to pursue investment activities in leveraged loans, high yield bonds, private debt, private equity and other types of investments. After becoming an independent firm in 2002, the Firm raised its first dedicated private equity and private debt funds in 2003 and 2004, respectively. The development of our Private Equity and Credit Groups significantly benefited from our senior professionals' deep middle market experience and the reputation of our Credit Group in the investment community.
In 2004, Ares created a specialty finance company, Ares Capital Corporation ("ARCC") for corporate lending activities (NASDAQ: ARCC), which is now the largest business development company by market capitalization and total assets. ARCC further enhanced its leadership position in U.S. middle market direct lending with the strategic acquisition of American Capital, Ltd. in January 2017.
Our European direct lending business has also continued to grow. We closed ACE III, our third European direct lending fund, in June 2016 at its hard cap of €2.5 billion, above its initial target of €2.0 billion.
Expansion and Diversification
From 2007-2009, Ares significantly expanded, investing heavily in back office infrastructure, seeding new investment products and entering Europe with capital markets and private debt investing activities. In 2010, ARCC acquired Allied Capital, creating the largest business development company by market capitalization. Our Private Equity Group expanded into Asia in 2010 with the launch of its first China growth fund. Ares continued its regional expansion and product diversification in 2011 with the strategic additions of Indicus Advisors, a top tier investment manager in European leveraged finance and global asset-backed credit, and Wrightwood, a lender to the U.S. commercial real estate sector.
In 2012, Ares Real Estate Group formed a specialty finance company, Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation (NYSE:ACRE). ACRE is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that provides one-stop solutions designed to meet the distinct and underserved financing needs of middle-market commercial real estate. Ares further enhanced its Real Estate Group in 2013 with the strategic acquisition of AREA Property Partners, L.P. ("AREA"), a top-tier real estate investment management firm with a 20-year track record and 50 investment professionals in the U.S. and Europe.
Scaling Our Platform and Infrastructure
In recent years, we have expanded into new and adjacent products, as well as continued to grow our core offerings and infrastructure.
Initial Public Offering:
Ares became a publicly traded partnership in May 2014. Its common units trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "ARES."
Credit Expansion:
Ares expanded into commercial finance and asset-based lending through the acquisition of Keltic Financial Services LLC and Keltic Financial Partners II, LP in June 2014. In addition, an Ares fund acquired the asset-based lending portfolio of First Capital Holdings, Inc. in 2015, adding additional asset based lending capabilities.
Private Equity Expansion:
Ares expanded its Private Equity Group in January 2015 through a subsidiary's strategic acquisition of Energy Investors Funds (“EIF”), a leading asset manager in the U.S. power and energy industry. Ares EIF focuses on identifying long-term, stable cash-flowing investments in the power generation, transmission and midstream sectors. We closed ACOF V, our fifth global flexible capital private equity fund, in April 2016 at its hard cap of $7.85 billion of total commitments, compared to ACOF IV at $4.7 billion.

					Full Description



Ares Capital Corporation, incorporated on April 16, 2004, is a specialty finance company. The Company operates as a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. The Company's investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. It invests primarily in the United States middle-market companies. The Company may from time to time invest in larger or smaller (in particular, for investments in early-stage and/or venture capital-backed) companies. It invests primarily in first lien senior secured loans (including unitranche loans, which are loans that combine both senior and mezzanine debt, generally in a first lien position), second lien senior secured loans, and mezzanine debt, which in some cases includes an equity component. First and second lien senior secured loans generally are senior debt instruments that rank ahead of subordinated debt of a given portfolio company. Mezzanine debt is subordinated to senior loans and is generally unsecured. The Company also makes preferred and/or common equity investments.The first and second lien senior secured loans in which the Company invests generally have stated terms of 3 to 10 years and the mezzanine debt investments in which it invests generally have stated terms of up to 10 years, but the expected average life of such first and second lien loans and mezzanine debt is generally between 3 and 7 years. It may invests in loans and securities with any maturity or duration. The Company invests in various industries, such as aerospace and defense, automotive services, business services, consumer products, containers and packaging, education, environmental services, financial services, food and beverage and healthcare services.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
