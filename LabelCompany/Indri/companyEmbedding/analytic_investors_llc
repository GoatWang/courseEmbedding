I, after working there and seeing the ins and outs of how Analytic works, could not with a clear conscience recommend them and told them such. They have since moved on to another company and are very happy with their decision. I would never in a million years recommend this company to a friend or a foe.Advice to ManagementNone of the managers have the skill sets for their jobs. Managers FOR the managers need to be brought in stat or the company will go down in flames sooner rather than later.

There are two different world, investment and operations. People will walk to the other person's desk to discuss issues. Close relationship between coworkers and many people stay with company for many years. Very good benefit and life work balance. Compensation is fair.ConsYou won't get chance to move up, unless you are the favorite. A few favorites always get opportunities to learn new skill and attend training, but the rest are ignored. People stayed are out of options or have family concerns, not because of they like the job. If you want to move up, you need to look at somewhere else.Advice to ManagementBe open minded and be fair to everyone.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (3) Analytic Investors Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Analytic Investors 2011-06-07 09:53 PDT Oct 5, 2009 Helpful (7)"Think Twice- The nice location doesn't make it a nice place to work at."StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Los Angeles, CAFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Los Angeles, CADoesn't RecommendProsBreath taking Office View. Decent benefit package.ConsFrom experience& from talking to other employees, the company does not promote from within unless you are a "favorite" (so your hardwork is rarely recognized). An employee who had been there for 6+ years told me: "people who have wanted to move up, have done it by moving to a different company". Unfortunately favoritism/office politcs is a HUGE thing at this office & the tone is set by the top, who is also a micromanager of every department (or the office favorites will be on duty doing the micromanaging). Some top exec's also have a very bad demeaning attitude towards a lot of their employees. Again, the tone is set from the top down. Most people that work here can't wait for the weekends... and that speaks volumes. I've worked in various company cultures, but by far, this was the worst.Advice to ManagementPromote your employees. And promote those employees on the basis of their job excellence, not on their ability to be office busy bodies. The other Management directors need to step up to the plate and actually manage & speak up for their teams, rather than let the office favorites boss them around. Due to this, there is also a huge communication problem in the company when it comes to upper management. There needs to be a clear line as to who the managers are & who the teams actually report to (do they report to the managers, or the office "favorites"?)...

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 11, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Analytic Investors LLC, a leader in disciplined quantitative investment solutions to individuals and institutions, today announced a management buyback of the firm from Old Mutual Asset Management.  
The transaction will enable Analytic Investors to continue offering investment solutions as an independent, employee-owned firm with the same management team, investment philosophy and commitment to outstanding client service. Founded in 1970, Analytic Investors has more than $6 billion in assets under management as of June 30, 2012 and serves institutional and mutual fund investors in the U.S., Canada, Japan, Australia and Europe.
"This is a new chapter in the firm's long and successful history," said Harin de Silva, President of Analytic Investors. "As a stand-alone boutique, we have an opportunity to build on our culture of success at Analytic, invest more in talent, and focus on developing a new generation of innovative products. The transaction provides Analytic Investors with greater flexibility to fulfill its long-term vision, and we believe it will be very beneficial to both our clients and employees."
The definitive agreement announced today with U.S.-based Old Mutual Asset Management will allow the management team to acquire the firm and its existing business. The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2012. Terms of the transaction were not discussed.
"As an independent firm, we will have more capabilities in seeking to deliver what our clients want – standout performance and great ideas," de Silva said. "We will now have the significant advantage of complete control over our destiny, greater latitude to hire and reward investment and research staff, and more freedom to pursue market opportunities."
