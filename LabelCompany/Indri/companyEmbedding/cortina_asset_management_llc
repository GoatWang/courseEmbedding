What are analysts saying about Graphic Packaging Holding Company stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Graphic Packaging Holding Company stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "GRAPHIC PACKAGING CORPORATION, headquartered in Marietta, Georgia, is a leading provider of paperboard packaging solutions for a wide variety of products to food, beverage and other consumer products companies. Graphic Packaging's customers include some of the most widely recognized companies in the world.   " (7/14/2017)
2. KeyCorp analysts commented, "We are reducing our 2017 adjusted EBITDA estimate from $777 million to $770 million (in line with implied guidance), which implies 1% growth (all of which is coming from acquisitions). There is some risk to GPK’s 2017 EBITDA guidance and our estimate considering that the Company is not baking in the potential negative impact of the highly unusual surge in U.S. OCC prices in February. GPK’s organic EBITDA declined in 2016 and appears likely to be flattish in 2017. We are assuming an improvement in trends in 2018, such that we have EBITDA up $20 million or 2%. An investor doing a bridge from 2017 to 2018 can get to as much as $60 million of EBITDA growth by assuming $70 million of productivity growth (the midpoint of GPK’s targeted annual range), an incremental ~ $15 million of CRB pricing (assuming GPK’s price increase attempt is fully successful, which admittedly is a major assumption), and an offsetting $20 million-$25 million of labor inflation. We are not inclined to assume business conditions get that much better given the Company’s recent history, so we are instead assuming $20 million of growth." (2/7/2017)
3. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "While we believe GPK is one the best managed companies in our coverage, we are downgrading the stock to Hold and believe the stock is fairly valued and will be range bound. With demand remaining weak and rising input costs, we are cutting our 2017 estimates (4% below consensus) and expect muted EPS growth and anticipate pushback on the CRB price increase." (1/20/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Graphic Packaging Holding Company (NYSE:GPK) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Hold Ratings, 8 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.80)Consensus Price Target: $15.76 (14.75% upside)

Small Cap Opportunity Strategy 

Product Highlights





Employs a time-tested “Franchise Investing” approach to stock selection


Favors unique, defendable companies with established growth profiles and advantageous industry positioning


Qualitative and quantitative business model analysis is performed with intensive reviews during company meetings Franchise companies aren’t easily captured through quantitative screening


Throughout all market conditions, our consistent investment discipline drives decision making. Market timing is not employed




Investment Strategy



The Small Cap Opportunity Strategy seeks long-term investments in companies with strong business models that will consistently produce industry leading earnings and cash flow growth. Exceptional business models are often found where a company has established a differentiated franchise or where a secular trend creates favorable supply and demand imbalances. Franchise companies are unique and often misunderstood or unacknowledged during the formative stage of a company’s life cycle. As a result, such companies often sell below their intrinsic value, even though they are likely growing faster than the overall market and generating high levels of free cash flow. Correctly assessing the duration of a company’s franchise advantage or favorable secular trend is absolutely critical; very few businesses ultimately stand the test of time over several decades or even years.


Investment Process



Our four-phase process to research and investment encompasses Discovery, Analysis, Investment, and Exit. The first stage of the investment process is Discovery, where various methods are simultaneously employed to uncover potential investments. Ideas are generated from in-person management meetings, industry conferences, occasional database screening, Wall Street analyst contacts and industry channel checks. Cortina analysts and portfolio managers hold more than 1,000 private meetings each year with small cap companies. Analysis, the second phase, involves an in-depth examination of a company’s business and its competitive positioning. The primary focus is an operational and financial assessment of the company, which builds the foundation for the stock price valuation. Increasing operating margins, high levels of free cash flow, and rising return on equity are specifically targeted. In many cases, we construct financial models to forecast earnings and cash flow growth. After identifying an attractive portfolio candidate, the Investment is closely monitored. Frequent meetings with company officials, as well as an independent analysis of the latest business fundamentals, permit continual assessment of the risk and rewards of the security. Quarterly earnings reports, industry conferences, and channel checks provide regular data points for tracking a company’s progress against our expectations. The final stage in the research process is the Exit. Whether the price objective was reached or the fundamental story changed along with the security’s valuation, a stock is sold when the risk/reward ratio becomes unfavorable. The portfolio managers employ a 10% peak pullback rule and a strict price decline rule to capture strong investment returns while limiting capital losses.


Franchise Investing



Regardless of market capitalization, the best performing stocks over time are those with the highest level of free cash flow generation. The driver of exceptionally high cash flow generation is almost always a company’s unique positioning within an industry, as well as favorable industry dynamics that permit such success. Since all industries and sectors ultimately cycle through good and bad periods, the ability for one company to surpass all others in cash flow generation is often due to unique “franchise” characteristics. These companies exploit their niche instead of hoping to someday invent one; these companies run circles around their larger peers instead of running from them.

Disclosures



Cortina Asset Management, LLC (“Cortina”) is an independent investment management firm established in 2004. Cortina manages small cap equity assets in the U.S. The firm has no subsidiaries or related asset management firms.
 
Cortina Asset Management claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®).
 
To receive a complete list and description of composites and/or a compliant presentation that adheres to the GIPS®, please call 414-225-7399.
 
The Cortina Small Cap Opportunity composite numbers consist of all fully discretionary, fee-paying accounts greater than $1 million invested in our Small Cap Opportunity Strategy. This composite was created in June of 2004. Prior to October 1, 2009 the minimum threshold for composite inclusion was $5 million. The decrease in account minimum explains the significant increase in the number of accounts in the Small Cap Opportunity composite for 2009.
 
Returns are calculated on a total return basis, including all dividends and interest, realized and unrealized gains or losses, and are net of all brokerage commissions, execution costs and without provision for federal and state income taxes. Securities transactions are accounted for on trade date. Cash and equivalents are included in performance returns. Composite returns are calculated daily. Quarterly returns are calculated by geometrically linking the daily returns for each day in the quarter and annual returns are calculated by geometrically linking the daily returns for each day in the year. All returns presented are calculated using U.S. Dollars.
 
Gross returns are presented before management and custodial fees and include dividends and interest, realized and unrealized gains or losses, and transaction costs. Net returns are presented after actual management fees, but include dividends and interest, realized and unrealized gains or losses, and transactions costs. A client’s returns will be reduced by the management fees and other expenses it may incur in the management of the account. For example, an actively managed account of $20 million with an annual rate of return of 10% compounded over a 10-year period that was charged a management fee of 1%, would achieve a net-of-fee return of 136.7%; compared to a gross-of-fee return of 159.4% based on the same assumptions.
 
The benchmark for the Cortina Small Cap Opportunity Composite is the Russell 2000 Index. The Russell 2000 Index measures the performance of the small cap segment of the U.S. equity universe. The Russell 2000 Index is a subset of the Russell 3000 Index representing approximately 10% of the total market capitalization of that index. It includes approximately 2000 of the smallest securities based on a combination of their market cap and current index membership. The Russell 2000 Index is constructed to provide a comprehensive and unbiased small cap barometer and is completely reconstituted annually to ensure larger stocks do not distort the performance and characteristics of the true small cap opportunity set. Benchmark returns are not covered by the report of independent verifiers.
