Redefining networks in the age of on-demand

Best-of-breed, open options and a consultative approach. It’s a powerful combination. And it’s transforming networks. We’re powering connections between people, content, places, and things—from down the street to around the world.





What is OPn? It’s choice. It’s control. It’s our commitment that we’ll embrace openness in our technology so you can more simply operate your network.




Empowering the future
Since its introduction in 2012, OPn has not remained static. It’s a dynamic philosophy that evolves as network needs evolve—delivering the capabilities to meet and enable networks of the future.





Redefining openness
OPn works best in an ego-free zone—working with partners, other technology providers, open APIs, and more—to make networks the best that they can be.





Delivering programmability
Programmability is powerful. And when combined with openness, it’s unstoppable. Customize your network’s capabilities, and do it yourself with our DevOps tools. It’s your choice.

Ciena's Liquid Spectrum combines highly instrumented, programmable hardware with advanced software applications, allowing you to tune, control, and dynamically adjust optical capacity in real time.  Consistent with Ciena's OPn networking philosophy, Liquid Spectrum utilizes APIs and standard interfaces to support your requirements for an accessible, open architecture.

History[edit]
Ciena was founded by David Huber, Kevin Kimberlin, and Optelecom to find ways to increase the capacity to design optical networking tech anagogic communication.[6][7][8] In 1994, Sevin Rosen invested $3.3 million in Ciena's Series A Venture financing.[9]
In late 1994, during the transition of the first high-speed optical backbone from public sector control of the National Science Foundation to private companies, Ciena began working with Sprint – an earlier carrier of Internet traffic – to develop "high-capacity fiber optic transmission systems called dense wave division multiplexing (DWDM)." [10] The outcome of their effort was the first commercial dense wave division multiplexing system. With it, the capacity increased "Sprint's nationwide, all-digital fiber-optic network by a stunning 1,600 percent."[8] Sprint therefore became the world's largest carrier of Internet traffic. With success from Sprint and others, Ciena's "first-year sales were the highest ever recorded by a start-up."[11]
In February 1997 Ciena pulled off the biggest initial public offering of a startup company ever, with a first-day valuation of $3.4 billion.[9] Subsequently, Goldman Sachs, in a research note, commented on the records set by Ciena: "1) steepest revenue ramp for any company in history, 2) most profitable company ever in its first year of product shipments, and 3) largest market capitalization of any new IPO."[12] By 2001, Ciena had achieved annual revenues of $1.6 billion and a marketing capitalization of nearly $30 billion.[13]
Despite setbacks along the way, Ciena continued to grow over the next few years, by both introducing new products and by acquiring companies such as Lightera (optical switches) and Omnia (local access equipment). With a broader product line, Ciena's customer base had grown from a small handful to 27 companies as network operators continued building their systems.[14]
In 2000, Ciena announced the MultiWave Metro optical transport solution, which allowed metropolitan area networks to deliver particular frequencies to individual customer premises. By June 2000, Ciena's stock had soared to $120 per share, giving it a market capitalization exceeding $30 billion. Sales of the company's new line of products prompted the investor optimism, though some analysts were beginning to wonder whether the U.S. fiber optic network had been overbuilt. The customer list continued to grow as it approached 50 names.[14]
Market downturn and diversification[edit]
During 2001, the telecommunications market went through a severe downturn, and the segment that included Ciena's optical networking equipment fell by nearly 2/3 to $9.1 billion and in 2002, Ciena's revenues had declined 80% to $361 million.[15] To address the firm's challenges, Gary Smith, previously president and head of sales, was named CEO in May 2001, and Patrick Nettles, CEO since 1994, became executive chairman.




Gary Smith, Ciena CEO


Over the next few years, Ciena re-grouped by expanding its product portfolio to include a broader range of advanced networking solutions, including optical switching, new generation hybrid gear and Ethernet technologies.
Ciena accomplished its diversification effort with internal development as well as a series of acquisitions and strategic partnerships. By 2004 Ciena had purchased a total of 11 firms (half prior to the downturn) with an aggregate value of over $3.3 billion.[16] With a broader range of offerings, Ciena was able both to offer its existing customers a wider range of solutions as well as compete for new customers in additional segments and regions.
"The network specialist"[edit]
In late 2004 Ciena refreshed its branding with the tag-line "the network specialist"[14] to reflect additional capabilities in optical transport and switching. Ciena's diversification strategy and numerous acquisitions were accompanied by its ability to integrate new products and technology advances. This success was in contrast to many of its rivals, such as Nortel, Alcatel Lucent and others that struggled.[16]

Ciena Corporation is a United States-based global supplier of telecommunications networking equipment, software and services that support the delivery and transport of voice, video and data service. Its products are used in telecommunications networks operated by telecommunications service providers, cable operators, governments and enterprises.[1] The company was founded in 1992[2] and is headquartered in Hanover, Maryland.[3]
Ciena sells products and services across four segments: Converged Packet Optical, Packet Networking, Optical Transport, and Software & Services.[4] Key current platforms include the 6500 Packet-Optical Platform, 5430 Reconfigurable Switching System, CoreDirector Multiservice Optical Switch, 3000 family of service delivery switches, and the 4200 Advanced Services Platform. It also offers the Ciena One integrated network and service management software suite, consulting and support services, deployment services, maintenance and support services, spares and logistics management.[5]

History[edit]
Ciena was founded by David Huber, Kevin Kimberlin, and Optelecom to find ways to increase the capacity to design optical networking tech anagogic communication.[6][7][8] In 1994, Sevin Rosen invested $3.3 million in Ciena's Series A Venture financing.[9]
In late 1994, during the transition of the first high-speed optical backbone from public sector control of the National Science Foundation to private companies, Ciena began working with Sprint – an earlier carrier of Internet traffic – to develop "high-capacity fiber optic transmission systems called dense wave division multiplexing (DWDM)." [10] The outcome of their effort was the first commercial dense wave division multiplexing system. With it, the capacity increased "Sprint's nationwide, all-digital fiber-optic network by a stunning 1,600 percent."[8] Sprint therefore became the world's largest carrier of Internet traffic. With success from Sprint and others, Ciena's "first-year sales were the highest ever recorded by a start-up."[11]
In February 1997 Ciena pulled off the biggest initial public offering of a startup company ever, with a first-day valuation of $3.4 billion.[9] Subsequently, Goldman Sachs, in a research note, commented on the records set by Ciena: "1) steepest revenue ramp for any company in history, 2) most profitable company ever in its first year of product shipments, and 3) largest market capitalization of any new IPO."[12] By 2001, Ciena had achieved annual revenues of $1.6 billion and a marketing capitalization of nearly $30 billion.[13]
Despite setbacks along the way, Ciena continued to grow over the next few years, by both introducing new products and by acquiring companies such as Lightera (optical switches) and Omnia (local access equipment). With a broader product line, Ciena's customer base had grown from a small handful to 27 companies as network operators continued building their systems.[14]
In 2000, Ciena announced the MultiWave Metro optical transport solution, which allowed metropolitan area networks to deliver particular frequencies to individual customer premises. By June 2000, Ciena's stock had soared to $120 per share, giving it a market capitalization exceeding $30 billion. Sales of the company's new line of products prompted the investor optimism, though some analysts were beginning to wonder whether the U.S. fiber optic network had been overbuilt. The customer list continued to grow as it approached 50 names.[14]
Market downturn and diversification[edit]
During 2001, the telecommunications market went through a severe downturn, and the segment that included Ciena's optical networking equipment fell by nearly 2/3 to $9.1 billion and in 2002, Ciena's revenues had declined 80% to $361 million.[15] To address the firm's challenges, Gary Smith, previously president and head of sales, was named CEO in May 2001, and Patrick Nettles, CEO since 1994, became executive chairman.




Gary Smith, Ciena CEO


Over the next few years, Ciena re-grouped by expanding its product portfolio to include a broader range of advanced networking solutions, including optical switching, new generation hybrid gear and Ethernet technologies.
Ciena accomplished its diversification effort with internal development as well as a series of acquisitions and strategic partnerships. By 2004 Ciena had purchased a total of 11 firms (half prior to the downturn) with an aggregate value of over $3.3 billion.[16] With a broader range of offerings, Ciena was able both to offer its existing customers a wider range of solutions as well as compete for new customers in additional segments and regions.
"The network specialist"[edit]
In late 2004 Ciena refreshed its branding with the tag-line "the network specialist"[14] to reflect additional capabilities in optical transport and switching. Ciena's diversification strategy and numerous acquisitions were accompanied by its ability to integrate new products and technology advances. This success was in contrast to many of its rivals, such as Nortel, Alcatel Lucent and others that struggled.[16]

Ciena downgraded a week before earnings, stock sinks
Shares of Ciena Corp.  sank 4.8% in active morning trade Wednesday, after Deutsche Bank downgraded the optical networking company a week before it's scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter results. Analyst Vijay Bhagavath cut his rating to hold from buy on concerns the stock will be range bound in the near term given expectations of that weak margin trends and sales in Europe and Latin America will be balanced with strong results from its cloud business. He cut his stock price target to $23 from $28. "Prudent to stay on the sidelines on this 'volatile' optical story," Bhagavath wrote in a note to clients. The stock has averaged a one-day post-earnings move of 13.2% over the past six quarters, including an average 12% gain on the three up days and an average 14.4% decline on the three down days. The downgrade makes Bhagavath only the fifth of the 25 analysts surveyed by FactSet to not have a bullish rating on Ciena. His price target is now tied for second lowest; the lowest is Drexel Hamilton's Greg Mesniaeff's $22 target, according to FactSet. Ciena's stock has lost 5.1% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 7.1%.

26 ‘cheap’ stocks in the market’s hottest sector

Ciena stock price target raised to $33 vs. $28 at Raymond James

Ciena downgraded a week before earnings, stock sinks
Shares of Ciena Corp.  sank 4.8% in active morning trade Wednesday, after Deutsche Bank downgraded the optical networking company a week before it's scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter results. Analyst Vijay Bhagavath cut his rating to hold from buy on concerns the stock will be range bound in the near term given expectations of that weak margin trends and sales in Europe and Latin America will be balanced with strong results from its cloud business. He cut his stock price target to $23 from $28. "Prudent to stay on the sidelines on this 'volatile' optical story," Bhagavath wrote in a note to clients. The stock has averaged a one-day post-earnings move of 13.2% over the past six quarters, including an average 12% gain on the three up days and an average 14.4% decline on the three down days. The downgrade makes Bhagavath only the fifth of the 25 analysts surveyed by FactSet to not have a bullish rating on Ciena. His price target is now tied for second lowest; the lowest is Drexel Hamilton's Greg Mesniaeff's $22 target, according to FactSet. Ciena's stock has lost 5.1% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 7.1%.

New Products from Ciena Enable Operators to Packetize Optical Networks to Manage Surging Demands for Ethernet Services   E-Suite modules bring cohesive and tailored packet capabilities to Ciena’s acclaimed 6500, allowing operators to more efficiently scale their Ethernet service offerings   May 14, 2013 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time   HANOVER, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--   Ciena® Corporation (NASDAQ: CIEN), the network specialist, today introduced significant new packet capabilities for its 6500 Packet-Optical Platform. New E-Suite packet modules for the 6500, featuring Ciena’s service aware packet operating system (SAOS), enable a highly scalable, converged packet-optical solution for network operators as they evolve toward simpler and more cost-effective metro networks. The new integrated packet-optical capabilities allow operators to swiftly and cost-effectively manage the surging demand for Ethernet services connectivity – from the network access to the metro core. This can yield substantial savings in reduced equipment costs in addition to significant operational efficiency improvements.   “Putting the Packet in Metro Packet-Optical Transport”   The new capabilities leverage Ciena’s field-proven, full-featured SAOS software, which is already available across the company’s packet networking portfolio and deployed on more than 300,000 platforms worldwide. Combined with Ciena’s widely deployed flagship 6500, Ciena customers can now select from a cohesive portfolio of pure packet networking devices as well as converged packet-optical platforms to tailor their networks to meet specific Ethernet service requirements regardless of their operational paradigm. Additionally, with Ciena’s OneControl Unified Management System, customers can now manage their Ethernet services end-to-end from a single management platform, enabling rapid and efficient service turn-up, monitoring and troubleshooting.   Key Facts:   Ciena’s new E-Suite modules for its 6500 family integrate packet switching and traffic management alongside OTN transport, leveraging the company’s SAOS software, to allow operators to quickly address surging demand for Ethernet services and connectivity. The new E-Suite for 6500 includes both blade-based packet switching modules for small footprint applications and fabric-based packet switching modules for high-bandwidth mesh connectivity.   The purpose-built packet capabilities combine with the 6500’s industry-leading coherent WaveLogic 3 optics for scale up to 400G, the full range of integrated ROADM solutions for dynamic service delivery, and integrated link planning tools for operational efficiencies. This provides a tailored and cohesive Ethernet service offering that can handle growth demands for years to come.  Ciena’s OneControl Unified Management System rounds out the solution by providing end-to-end point-and-click service provisioning for faster service turn-up, end-to-end visibility to ensure Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are met, and the ability to improve troubleshooting in the event of a network outage or alarm.  The new packet networking capabilities align with OPn, Ciena’s approach for building open, programmable next-generation networks that scale and automatically adapt to quickly deliver new services and bandwidth. Ciena-based packet networks can be deployed in conjunction with the company’s V-WAN Network Services Module, a network virtualization solution that automates the allocation of shared network resources among data centers.   Industry Comments:   “The metro packet optical transport market is entering a new phase that focuses much more heavily on the packet side of packet-optical transport, and adds new innovations such as switched OTN and 100G. In this new metro environment, Ciena’s products and technology are clearly resonating well with customers. In our recent Metro Packet-Optical Transport 2.0 survey, Ciena was selected by operators as the global leader in technological superiority and innovation in metro packet-optical transport products.”  Sterling Perrin, senior analyst, Heavy Reading   “With Ciena’s converged packet optical platforms, we can more easily and quickly scale to support large end user capacity demands driven by cloud computing, virtualization, SDN and video streaming. Deploying Ciena’s 6500 with integrated packet switching capabilities will also help to reduce the complexity of integrating and managing a separate Ethernet and optical infrastructure.”  Jason Koenders, senior vice president of engineering and network planning, Integra   Executive Comments   “The industry has been talking about converged packet optical for years, but unfortunately for operators past attempts have been more like duct tape than true convergence. By tightly integrating our widely deployed SAOS packet operating system with our industry-leading 6500, we are equipping operators to quickly turn up and deliver customized Ethernet services without compromise. With a purpose-built network infrastructure that is based on a combination of our packet and optical transport capabilities, operators now have a simpler, more cost-effective and more flexible approach to packet service delivery than an all-IP solution.”  Francois Locoh-Donou, senior vice president, global products group, Ciena   Upcoming Events:   Light Reading Packet-Optical Transport Evolution 2013: Ciena’s Mike Adams, vice president of product and technical marketing, will discuss the industry’s requirements to meet uncompromised packet optical convergence on a panel entitled “Putting the Packet in Metro Packet-Optical Transport” on Tuesday, May 14 at 1:15 p.m. ET.  On May 30 at 11:00 a.m. ET, Ciena will broadcast a live web event to discuss its new Packet-Optical capabilities. The webcast will feature Ciena’s Francois Locoh-Donou, senior vice president, global products group and Mike Adams, vice president of product and technical marketing; along with Stan Hubbard and Sterling Perrin, both senior analysts from Heavy Reading. Jason Koenders, senior vice president of engineering and network planning, from Integra will also join the event. To register, please click here.

Ciena Corporation is a United States-based global supplier of telecommunications networking equipment, software and services that support the delivery and transport of voice, video and data service. Its products are used in telecommunications networks operated by telecommunications service providers, cable operators, governments and enterprises.[1] The company was founded in 1992[2] and is headquartered in Hanover, Maryland.[3]
Ciena sells products and services across four segments: Converged Packet Optical, Packet Networking, Optical Transport, and Software & Services.[4] Key current platforms include the 6500 Packet-Optical Platform, 5430 Reconfigurable Switching System, CoreDirector Multiservice Optical Switch, 3000 family of service delivery switches, and the 4200 Advanced Services Platform. It also offers the Ciena One integrated network and service management software suite, consulting and support services, deployment services, maintenance and support services, spares and logistics management.[5]

History[edit]
Ciena was founded by David Huber, Kevin Kimberlin, and Optelecom to find ways to increase the capacity to design optical networking tech anagogic communication.[6][7][8] In 1994, Sevin Rosen invested $3.3 million in Ciena's Series A Venture financing.[9]
In late 1994, during the transition of the first high-speed optical backbone from public sector control of the National Science Foundation to private companies, Ciena began working with Sprint – an earlier carrier of Internet traffic – to develop "high-capacity fiber optic transmission systems called dense wave division multiplexing (DWDM)." [10] The outcome of their effort was the first commercial dense wave division multiplexing system. With it, the capacity increased "Sprint's nationwide, all-digital fiber-optic network by a stunning 1,600 percent."[8] Sprint therefore became the world's largest carrier of Internet traffic. With success from Sprint and others, Ciena's "first-year sales were the highest ever recorded by a start-up."[11]
In February 1997 Ciena pulled off the biggest initial public offering of a startup company ever, with a first-day valuation of $3.4 billion.[9] Subsequently, Goldman Sachs, in a research note, commented on the records set by Ciena: "1) steepest revenue ramp for any company in history, 2) most profitable company ever in its first year of product shipments, and 3) largest market capitalization of any new IPO."[12] By 2001, Ciena had achieved annual revenues of $1.6 billion and a marketing capitalization of nearly $30 billion.[13]
Despite setbacks along the way, Ciena continued to grow over the next few years, by both introducing new products and by acquiring companies such as Lightera (optical switches) and Omnia (local access equipment). With a broader product line, Ciena's customer base had grown from a small handful to 27 companies as network operators continued building their systems.[14]
In 2000, Ciena announced the MultiWave Metro optical transport solution, which allowed metropolitan area networks to deliver particular frequencies to individual customer premises. By June 2000, Ciena's stock had soared to $120 per share, giving it a market capitalization exceeding $30 billion. Sales of the company's new line of products prompted the investor optimism, though some analysts were beginning to wonder whether the U.S. fiber optic network had been overbuilt. The customer list continued to grow as it approached 50 names.[14]
Market downturn and diversification[edit]
During 2001, the telecommunications market went through a severe downturn, and the segment that included Ciena's optical networking equipment fell by nearly 2/3 to $9.1 billion and in 2002, Ciena's revenues had declined 80% to $361 million.[15] To address the firm's challenges, Gary Smith, previously president and head of sales, was named CEO in May 2001, and Patrick Nettles, CEO since 1994, became executive chairman.




Gary Smith, Ciena CEO


Over the next few years, Ciena re-grouped by expanding its product portfolio to include a broader range of advanced networking solutions, including optical switching, new generation hybrid gear and Ethernet technologies.
Ciena accomplished its diversification effort with internal development as well as a series of acquisitions and strategic partnerships. By 2004 Ciena had purchased a total of 11 firms (half prior to the downturn) with an aggregate value of over $3.3 billion.[16] With a broader range of offerings, Ciena was able both to offer its existing customers a wider range of solutions as well as compete for new customers in additional segments and regions.
"The network specialist"[edit]
In late 2004 Ciena refreshed its branding with the tag-line "the network specialist"[14] to reflect additional capabilities in optical transport and switching. Ciena's diversification strategy and numerous acquisitions were accompanied by its ability to integrate new products and technology advances. This success was in contrast to many of its rivals, such as Nortel, Alcatel Lucent and others that struggled.[16]

Ciena Corporation is a United States-based global supplier of telecommunications networking equipment, software and services that support the delivery and transport of voice, video and data service. Its products are used in telecommunications networks operated by telecommunications service providers, cable operators, governments and enterprises.[1] The company was founded in 1992[2] and is headquartered in Hanover, Maryland.[3]
Ciena sells products and services across four segments: Converged Packet Optical, Packet Networking, Optical Transport, and Software & Services.[4] Key current platforms include the 6500 Packet-Optical Platform, 5430 Reconfigurable Switching System, CoreDirector Multiservice Optical Switch, 3000 family of service delivery switches, and the 4200 Advanced Services Platform. It also offers the Ciena One integrated network and service management software suite, consulting and support services, deployment services, maintenance and support services, spares and logistics management.[5]

History[edit]
Ciena was founded by David Huber, Kevin Kimberlin, and Optelecom to find ways to increase the capacity to design optical networking tech anagogic communication.[6][7][8] In 1994, Sevin Rosen invested $3.3 million in Ciena's Series A Venture financing.[9]
In late 1994, during the transition of the first high-speed optical backbone from public sector control of the National Science Foundation to private companies, Ciena began working with Sprint – an earlier carrier of Internet traffic – to develop "high-capacity fiber optic transmission systems called dense wave division multiplexing (DWDM)." [10] The outcome of their effort was the first commercial dense wave division multiplexing system. With it, the capacity increased "Sprint's nationwide, all-digital fiber-optic network by a stunning 1,600 percent."[8] Sprint therefore became the world's largest carrier of Internet traffic. With success from Sprint and others, Ciena's "first-year sales were the highest ever recorded by a start-up."[11]
In February 1997 Ciena pulled off the biggest initial public offering of a startup company ever, with a first-day valuation of $3.4 billion.[9] Subsequently, Goldman Sachs, in a research note, commented on the records set by Ciena: "1) steepest revenue ramp for any company in history, 2) most profitable company ever in its first year of product shipments, and 3) largest market capitalization of any new IPO."[12] By 2001, Ciena had achieved annual revenues of $1.6 billion and a marketing capitalization of nearly $30 billion.[13]
Despite setbacks along the way, Ciena continued to grow over the next few years, by both introducing new products and by acquiring companies such as Lightera (optical switches) and Omnia (local access equipment). With a broader product line, Ciena's customer base had grown from a small handful to 27 companies as network operators continued building their systems.[14]
In 2000, Ciena announced the MultiWave Metro optical transport solution, which allowed metropolitan area networks to deliver particular frequencies to individual customer premises. By June 2000, Ciena's stock had soared to $120 per share, giving it a market capitalization exceeding $30 billion. Sales of the company's new line of products prompted the investor optimism, though some analysts were beginning to wonder whether the U.S. fiber optic network had been overbuilt. The customer list continued to grow as it approached 50 names.[14]
Market downturn and diversification[edit]
During 2001, the telecommunications market went through a severe downturn, and the segment that included Ciena's optical networking equipment fell by nearly 2/3 to $9.1 billion and in 2002, Ciena's revenues had declined 80% to $361 million.[15] To address the firm's challenges, Gary Smith, previously president and head of sales, was named CEO in May 2001, and Patrick Nettles, CEO since 1994, became executive chairman.




Gary Smith, Ciena CEO


Over the next few years, Ciena re-grouped by expanding its product portfolio to include a broader range of advanced networking solutions, including optical switching, new generation hybrid gear and Ethernet technologies.
Ciena accomplished its diversification effort with internal development as well as a series of acquisitions and strategic partnerships. By 2004 Ciena had purchased a total of 11 firms (half prior to the downturn) with an aggregate value of over $3.3 billion.[16] With a broader range of offerings, Ciena was able both to offer its existing customers a wider range of solutions as well as compete for new customers in additional segments and regions.
"The network specialist"[edit]
In late 2004 Ciena refreshed its branding with the tag-line "the network specialist"[14] to reflect additional capabilities in optical transport and switching. Ciena's diversification strategy and numerous acquisitions were accompanied by its ability to integrate new products and technology advances. This success was in contrast to many of its rivals, such as Nortel, Alcatel Lucent and others that struggled.[16]

Ciena Corporation is a United States-based global supplier of telecommunications networking equipment, software and services that support the delivery and transport of voice, video and data service. Its products are used in telecommunications networks operated by telecommunications service providers, cable operators, governments and enterprises.[1] The company was founded in 1992[2] and is headquartered in Hanover, Maryland.[3]
Ciena sells products and services across four segments: Converged Packet Optical, Packet Networking, Optical Transport, and Software & Services.[4] Key current platforms include the 6500 Packet-Optical Platform, 5430 Reconfigurable Switching System, CoreDirector Multiservice Optical Switch, 3000 family of service delivery switches, and the 4200 Advanced Services Platform. It also offers the Ciena One integrated network and service management software suite, consulting and support services, deployment services, maintenance and support services, spares and logistics management.[5]

History[edit]
Ciena was founded by David Huber, Kevin Kimberlin, and Optelecom to find ways to increase the capacity to design optical networking tech anagogic communication.[6][7][8] In 1994, Sevin Rosen invested $3.3 million in Ciena's Series A Venture financing.[9]
In late 1994, during the transition of the first high-speed optical backbone from public sector control of the National Science Foundation to private companies, Ciena began working with Sprint – an earlier carrier of Internet traffic – to develop "high-capacity fiber optic transmission systems called dense wave division multiplexing (DWDM)." [10] The outcome of their effort was the first commercial dense wave division multiplexing system. With it, the capacity increased "Sprint's nationwide, all-digital fiber-optic network by a stunning 1,600 percent."[8] Sprint therefore became the world's largest carrier of Internet traffic. With success from Sprint and others, Ciena's "first-year sales were the highest ever recorded by a start-up."[11]
In February 1997 Ciena pulled off the biggest initial public offering of a startup company ever, with a first-day valuation of $3.4 billion.[9] Subsequently, Goldman Sachs, in a research note, commented on the records set by Ciena: "1) steepest revenue ramp for any company in history, 2) most profitable company ever in its first year of product shipments, and 3) largest market capitalization of any new IPO."[12] By 2001, Ciena had achieved annual revenues of $1.6 billion and a marketing capitalization of nearly $30 billion.[13]
Despite setbacks along the way, Ciena continued to grow over the next few years, by both introducing new products and by acquiring companies such as Lightera (optical switches) and Omnia (local access equipment). With a broader product line, Ciena's customer base had grown from a small handful to 27 companies as network operators continued building their systems.[14]
In 2000, Ciena announced the MultiWave Metro optical transport solution, which allowed metropolitan area networks to deliver particular frequencies to individual customer premises. By June 2000, Ciena's stock had soared to $120 per share, giving it a market capitalization exceeding $30 billion. Sales of the company's new line of products prompted the investor optimism, though some analysts were beginning to wonder whether the U.S. fiber optic network had been overbuilt. The customer list continued to grow as it approached 50 names.[14]
Market downturn and diversification[edit]
During 2001, the telecommunications market went through a severe downturn, and the segment that included Ciena's optical networking equipment fell by nearly 2/3 to $9.1 billion and in 2002, Ciena's revenues had declined 80% to $361 million.[15] To address the firm's challenges, Gary Smith, previously president and head of sales, was named CEO in May 2001, and Patrick Nettles, CEO since 1994, became executive chairman.




Gary Smith, Ciena CEO


Over the next few years, Ciena re-grouped by expanding its product portfolio to include a broader range of advanced networking solutions, including optical switching, new generation hybrid gear and Ethernet technologies.
Ciena accomplished its diversification effort with internal development as well as a series of acquisitions and strategic partnerships. By 2004 Ciena had purchased a total of 11 firms (half prior to the downturn) with an aggregate value of over $3.3 billion.[16] With a broader range of offerings, Ciena was able both to offer its existing customers a wider range of solutions as well as compete for new customers in additional segments and regions.
"The network specialist"[edit]
In late 2004 Ciena refreshed its branding with the tag-line "the network specialist"[14] to reflect additional capabilities in optical transport and switching. Ciena's diversification strategy and numerous acquisitions were accompanied by its ability to integrate new products and technology advances. This success was in contrast to many of its rivals, such as Nortel, Alcatel Lucent and others that struggled.[16]
