Commercial Financing
If you have never had to deal with commercial real estate financing, you may find it intimidating. That is certainly the case for most first-time commercial borrowers. Commercial real estate mortgages are quite different from their residential cousins in terms of both complexity and cost. But getting the facts before you apply for a loan should eliminate any fears about this fantastic business financing technique.

The Basics of Commercial Real Estate Financing

Commercial real estate financing is very similar to residential mortgage lending in that real property is pledged as collateral against a loan to either buy or refinance the property. A business may also borrow against the equity in property it owns, which like its residential counterpart can take the form of a business line of credit or a lump sum payment for any business purpose. Commercial real estate mortgages generally require regular payments of principal and interest -- commercial mortgage rates can be either fixed or variable -- until the loan is paid in full. Moreover, a commercial lender retains a security interest in the property throughout the loan term, with the same right to foreclose if the borrower defaults as a residential lender. 

What distinguishes commercial mortgage lending from residential lending are the characteristics of the property and the borrower. Unlike residential mortgages, which are geared toward the individual and 1-4 unit residential dwellings, commercial property financing is designed for business entities -- both for profit and not-for-profit -- to mortgage nearly any type of retail, office, industrial, multi-unit (5+) unit residential, or just about any other commercially zoned real property.

Because of these property and borrower characteristics, commercial real estate mortgages are viewed as higher risk transactions by the lending industry. The limited marketability of commercial property and higher risk of borrower default translates to less generous terms and more conservative underwriting by commercial mortgage lenders than those found in the residential arena. If a lender has to take possession of a commercial property through foreclosure, it will generally have much more difficulty selling it to recoup its money than it would a house. To compensate for the greater risk, commercial mortgage rates are substantially higher as are down payment requirements, and loan terms are shorter (typically a maximum of 25/30 years). 

Commercial mortgage lenders prefer a solid business borrower, but for newer businesses or companies that cannot meet the required financial performance standards, a personal guarantee of repayment from one or more of the firm's principals may be used to compensate. 

A final important difference between commercial real estate financing and the residential variety is that commercial real estate mortgages are more expensive to process and close. Not only are they much larger loans on average than residential mortgages, but nearly every aspect of the "due diligence" phase -- from valuation, to title, to underwriting -- is more complicated and, therefore, more costly. 

An Illustration: The "Vanilla" Commercial Mortgage Loan

To help you understand how commercial mortgage lending works in practice, here are the major characteristics of a standard "vanilla" commercial mortgage loan.

Debt Coverage Ratio

Commercial real estate financing is based primarily on the income of the property rather than the borrower. The lender will want evidence that the property will produce more than enough income to cover the mortgage payments. Generally, commercial mortgage lenders require the property to produce from 1.1 to 1.25 times the monthly mortgage payment in net rental income. For example, if the monthly mortgage payment is $2,000, the property should be producing $2,200 to $2,500 after all expenses are paid. 

Down Payment

Commercial mortgage loans typically require a borrower to put a minimum of 25% down. A higher down payment may be required for certain properties that carry greater risk, newer companies or those without a solid track record of consistent profitability.

Prepayment Penalties

Commercial real estate mortgages normally carry deescalating prepayment penalties, that is, a fee due to the lender if the loan is paid off within a certain period of time after it is made. For example, the fee might be 5% of the outstanding balance during the first year, 4% the second year, and so on, with no penalty after the fifth year. For obvious reasons, prepayment penalties are a particularly important consideration for a business that may not wish to -- or be able to -- own the property long enough to avoid them.

Although these characteristics illustrate a “standard” in commercial real estate mortgages, you can find many lenders with flexibility in any of them. Generally, deviating from a standard will entail an offsetting adjustment in others to compensate for the increased risk. For example, an up-front fee or higher interest rate might reduce or entirely eliminate a prepayment penalty, while a personal guarantee from one or more company owners might reduce the required down payment.
Where to Go For Commercial Real Estate Financing

Commercial mortgage lending is widely available throughout the U.S. The three most common sources of commercial real estate mortgages are:
1. Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities2. Regional Banks3. Private Equity Companies - i.e. Life Insurance Companies / Pension Manager / Hedge Funds4. Specialty Finance Companies - i.e. Third-Party ("Conduit") and Hard Money Lenders
Commercial Mortgage Brokers
Naturally, most business owners turn to banks -- particularly ones with whom they have established relationships -- for their commercial real estate financing. On the one hand, banks tend to offer the lowest commercial mortgage rates; on the other, they are the most rigid in their lending. Many banks will refuse loans on certain classes of property or exclude companies from specific industries. They also require more documentation and may charge higher fees than other commercial mortgage lending sources.

Conduit and hard money lenders can fund commercial mortgage loans with less documentation and more quickly than banks. Because their money comes from private sources, insurance companies, and commercial lines of credit, they can be much more flexible in their lending. You will find that hard money lenders, in particular, will loan money at lightning speed on virtually any type of property with much less stringent criteria for their borrowers -- all at a cost: Hard Money Lenders charge significantly higher mortgage rates than banks.

For larger capital needs, companies often turn to private equity companies. Private equity companies can provide critical commercial real estate financing on the total cost of a project. The equity range is the difference between the total cost of the real estate and the amount the senior lender is willing to provide -- normally no more than 75 percent of costs. So, for a $5 million project, commercial mortgage lenders would typically loan no more than $3.8 million, leaving $1.2 million in the equity range for the borrower to fund. If the borrowing entity has $200,000 in cash to put into the project, it could consider a mezzanine loan or an equity capital investment to come up with the remaining $1 million. Private Equity Companies are quite versatile and they can provide creative, flexible financing solutions, but they expect a good return on investment, so their interest rates are considerably higher than those charged by commercial lenders. Commercial mortgage brokers don't fund loans directly. Instead, a good broker will conduct a thorough assessment of your needs and research the programs offered by other commercial mortgage lending sources to find you the right mortgage solution with the most competitive rates and fees. A good commercial mortgage broker will have established relationships with many different lenders offering a wide variety of lending programs, giving you access to financing you might not be able to find on your own. As an added benefit, commercial mortgage brokers handle the tedious details of loan processing and packaging, making an otherwise complex transaction less stressful and saving you much time and energy. Using just any commercial mortgage broker could cost you either in up-front fees, a higher than market interest rate, or both. A good one, though, will orchestrate a smooth transaction with an optimal loan suited to your company's specific needs at a competitive rate.

With so many choices, it is important that you shop around, but the goal of your shopping should not be just to get the best rate. As is the case in residential mortgages, commercial mortgage rates and terms will vary from one lending source to the next. But with such a big financial commitment at stake, unless you have expertise in commercial real estate financing, you need a trusted advisor to both help you understand and to guide you through the complex process that defines a commercial mortgage loan. 

Regardless of the source you ultimately use, a little preparation before you begin your search for commercial real estate financing will go a long way towards reducing stress and assuring a good outcome.

Preparation: The Key to a Smooth Commercial Mortgage Lending Process

When you are ready to begin your search for a commercial mortgage lender, some advance preparation will serve you well. The complex nature of commercial real estate financing means you cannot expect to "rate shop" multiple lenders with a few minutes on the telephone -- at least, not with any reliability. 
Any prospective lender you contact should ask you for the following information, which is needed to give you an informed, accurate decision about your company's ability to borrow and the approximate rates and terms you can expect: 1. Year-to-date profit & loss statement and balance sheet 2. Three years business income tax returns 3. Projected cash flow for the next 36 months
4. Personal Financial Statement and Resume for the Principal5. Property information
6. Written business plan
Having these items available will not only make your task easier, it will make it more likely you receive both an accurate quote and solid feedback on your loan request. Be wary of any prospective lender who will quote rates and terms without the required information. You could be in for nasty surprises later!

Commercial real estate financing is another of the business financing power tools available to your company. Unlike other types of credit for business, which typically have less attractive terms and a relatively short repayment period, commercial mortgage loans offer an excellent means to acquire property and manage risk with long-term, asset based financing, at attractive interest rates and with favorable tax treatment.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch to Rate CGCMT 2015-GC35 Commercial Mortgage Trust; Presale Issued | Business Wire


























































      Fitch to Rate CGCMT 2015-GC35 Commercial Mortgage Trust; Presale Issued
    





November 16, 2015 03:12 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report for Citigroup Commercial 
      Mortgage Trust 2015-GC35 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$30,787,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$111,638,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$200,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$386,647,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$44,547,000 class A-AB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$838,548,000b class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$59,403,000b class X-B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$64,929,000c class A-S 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$59,403,000c class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$183,735,000c class PEZ 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$59,403,000c class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$58,021,000 class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$58,021,000b class X-D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$29,011,000a class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$11,052,000a class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (a) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      (b) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      (c) The class A-S, class B and class C certificates may be exchanged for 
      class PEZ certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for 
      the class A-S, class B and class C certificates.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of November 13, 2015. Fitch does not expect to rate the $11,052,000 
      Class G or the $38,681,053 Class H.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 64 loans secured by 93 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.1 
      billion as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company, Citigroup Global Markets Realty 
      Corp., Rialto Mortgage Finance, LLC, and FCRE REL, LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 81.4% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 87.9%, and asset summary reviews on 87.9% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Lower Leverage than Other Recent Deals: The pool demonstrates leverage 
      statistics that are better than most recent Fitch-rated transactions in 
      fourth quarter 2015, with a Fitch DSCR and LTV of 1.22x and 105.3%, 
      respectively. Comparatively, the 2015 year-to-date (YTD) average Fitch 
      DSCR and LTV are 1.19x and 109.6%, respectively. However, excluding the 
      credit-assessed 590 Madison Avenue loan (9.1% of the pool), the Fitch 
      DSCR and LTV are 1.17x and 110.5%, respectively.
    

      Highly Concentrated Pool: The top 10 loans comprise 63.0% of the pool, 
      which is above recent averages of 48.2% and 50.5% for YTD 2015 and 2014, 
      respectively. Additionally, the LCI is 509 and the SCI is 529, which are 
      both higher than recent respective averages of 351 and 386 for YTD 2015.
    

      Credit Opinion Loan: One loan, 590 Madison Avenue (9.1% of the pool), 
      has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'AA+' on a stand-alone basis. 
      Excluding the 590 Madison Avenue loan, Fitch's implied conduit 
      subordination at the junior 'AAAsf' tranche is approximately 26.5% and 
      'BBB-sf' is approximately 8.9%.
    

      High Hotel Exposure: Approximately 23.5% of the pool by balance consists 
      of hotel properties, including four of the largest ten loans. This is 
      above the YTD 2015 average hotel concentration of 16.3% and the 2014 
      average of 14.2%; hotels have the highest probability of default in 
      Fitch's multi-borrower CMBS model.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 11.6% below the 
      most recent net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a recent 
      NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this 
      period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could 
      result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans, and 
      could result in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to CGCMT 
      2015-GC35 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the senior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'Asf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      senior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 11.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on 
      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 62 
      mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and 
      the findings did not have an impact on the analysis. A copy of the ABS 
      Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this 
      transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of 
      the related rating action commentary.

Fitch Affirms CGCMT 2015-GC35 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms CGCMT 2015-GC35
    





October 19, 2016 11:52 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 15 classes of Citigroup Commercial Mortgage 
      Trust (CGCMT) 2015-GC35 Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 
      2015-GC34. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this 
      press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are due to overall stable performance. The stable 
      performance reflects no material changes to pool metrics since issuance, 
      therefore the original rating analysis was considered in affirming the 
      transaction. As of the October 2016 distribution date, the pool's 
      aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 0.3% to $1.102 billion 
      million from $1.105 billion at issuance. Currently, there is one 
      specially serviced loan (3%). Two additional small loans (0.5%) are 
      considered Fitch Loans of Concern due to performance issues. No loans 
      are defeased and all loans are current. There is currently a $21,538 
      interest shortfall affecting class H related to a special servicing fee 
      and a small reimbursement for advance interest. The Fitch debt service 
      coverage ratio (DSCR) and loan to value (LTV) at issuance were 1.22x and 
      105.3%, respectively.
    

      Specially Serviced Loan: The 10th largest loan in the pool, Hammons 
      Hotel Portfolio (3% of the pool), transferred to special servicing in 
      August 2016 due to the borrower and parent company filing for Chapter 11 
      bankruptcy. The filing was made in connection with litigation, which was 
      ongoing at issuance, related to a complex deal made in 2005 to 
      reprivatize Hammons Hotels. The hotels and loan are performing better 
      than expected with year-end 2015 NOI across the collateral properties 
      10.6% above bank underwriting. The weighted average RevPAR Penetration 
      for the collateral properties was 138.3%, as of the June 2016 trailing 
      12 month period. This loan is a non-controlling pari passu loan with the 
      remaining notes securitized in CGCMT 2015-GC33, GSMS 2015-GS1, and GSMS 
      2015-GC34.
    

      Stable Performance with No Material Changes: All loans in the pool are 
      current as of the October 2016 distribution with property level 
      performance generally in line with issuance expectations and no material 
      changes to pool metrics.
    

      It should be noted that, at issuance, 750 Lexington Avenue, the eighth 
      largest loan in the pool, was facing a large imminent lease roll; Locke 
      Lord, which occupied 31% of the NRA (22% if revenue), subsequently 
      vacated the property at lease expiration in June 2016. The loan includes 
      a $7.75 million upfront leasing reserve related to this space. Fitch 
      will continue to monitor the leasing status of the space.
    

      Above-Average Pool Concentration: The largest 10 loans account for 63% 
      of the pool by balance. This is greater than the year-to-date (YTD) 
      October 2015 average of 48.5% and the 2014 average of 50.5%. It was also 
      noted at issuance that the loan concentration index (LCI) was higher 
      than average for this transaction.
    

      High Hotel Exposure: Approximately 23.4% of the pool by balance consists 
      of hotel properties, including four of the largest 10 loans. This is 
      above the YTD 2015 average hotel concentration of 16.3% and the 2014 
      average of 14.2%; hotels have the highest probability of default in 
      Fitch's multiborrower CMBS model.
    

      Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loan: One of the largest loans in the 
      pool, 590 Madison Avenue (9.1% of the pool), was assigned an investment 
      grade credit opinion at issuance.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee 
      positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or 
      asset-level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level 
      metrics.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:
    

      --$26.7 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$111.6 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$386.6 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$44.5 million class A-AB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$834.5 million* class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$59.4 million* class X-B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$64.9 million class A-S at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$59.4 million class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$183.7 million class PEZ at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$58 million class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$58 million* class X-D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$29 million class E at 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$11.1 million class F at 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      * Notional amount and interest only.
    

      Class A-S, class B, and class C certificates may be exchanged for class 
      PEZ certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for the

      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports,

      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are

      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a

      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative

      Fitch Ratings has affirmed 15 classes of Citigroup Commercial Mortgage 
      Trust (CGCMT) 2015-GC35 Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 
      2015-GC34. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this 
      press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are due to overall stable performance. The stable 
      performance reflects no material changes to pool metrics since issuance, 
      therefore the original rating analysis was considered in affirming the 
      transaction. As of the October 2016 distribution date, the pool's 
      aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 0.3% to $1.102 billion 
      million from $1.105 billion at issuance. Currently, there is one 
      specially serviced loan (3%). Two additional small loans (0.5%) are 
      considered Fitch Loans of Concern due to performance issues. No loans 
      are defeased and all loans are current. There is currently a $21,538 
      interest shortfall affecting class H related to a special servicing fee 
      and a small reimbursement for advance interest. The Fitch debt service 
      coverage ratio (DSCR) and loan to value (LTV) at issuance were 1.22x and 
      105.3%, respectively.
    

      Specially Serviced Loan: The 10th largest loan in the pool, Hammons 
      Hotel Portfolio (3% of the pool), transferred to special servicing in 
      August 2016 due to the borrower and parent company filing for Chapter 11 
      bankruptcy. The filing was made in connection with litigation, which was 
      ongoing at issuance, related to a complex deal made in 2005 to 
      reprivatize Hammons Hotels. The hotels and loan are performing better 
      than expected with year-end 2015 NOI across the collateral properties 
      10.6% above bank underwriting. The weighted average RevPAR Penetration 
      for the collateral properties was 138.3%, as of the June 2016 trailing 
      12 month period. This loan is a non-controlling pari passu loan with the 
      remaining notes securitized in CGCMT 2015-GC33, GSMS 2015-GS1, and GSMS 
      2015-GC34.
    

      Stable Performance with No Material Changes: All loans in the pool are 
      current as of the October 2016 distribution with property level 
      performance generally in line with issuance expectations and no material 
      changes to pool metrics.
    

      It should be noted that, at issuance, 750 Lexington Avenue, the eighth 
      largest loan in the pool, was facing a large imminent lease roll; Locke 
      Lord, which occupied 31% of the NRA (22% if revenue), subsequently 
      vacated the property at lease expiration in June 2016. The loan includes 
      a $7.75 million upfront leasing reserve related to this space. Fitch 
      will continue to monitor the leasing status of the space.
    

      Above-Average Pool Concentration: The largest 10 loans account for 63% 
      of the pool by balance. This is greater than the year-to-date (YTD) 
      October 2015 average of 48.5% and the 2014 average of 50.5%. It was also 
      noted at issuance that the loan concentration index (LCI) was higher 
      than average for this transaction.
    

      High Hotel Exposure: Approximately 23.4% of the pool by balance consists 
      of hotel properties, including four of the largest 10 loans. This is 
      above the YTD 2015 average hotel concentration of 16.3% and the 2014 
      average of 14.2%; hotels have the highest probability of default in 
      Fitch's multiborrower CMBS model.
    

      Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loan: One of the largest loans in the 
      pool, 590 Madison Avenue (9.1% of the pool), was assigned an investment 
      grade credit opinion at issuance.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee 
      positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or 
      asset-level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level 
      metrics.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:
    

      --$26.7 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$111.6 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$200 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$386.6 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$44.5 million class A-AB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$834.5 million* class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$59.4 million* class X-B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$64.9 million class A-S at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$59.4 million class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$183.7 million class PEZ at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$59.4 million class C at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$58 million class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$58 million* class X-D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$29 million class E at 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$11.1 million class F at 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      * Notional amount and interest only.
    

      Class A-S, class B, and class C certificates may be exchanged for class 
      PEZ certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for the 
      class A-S, class B, and class C certificates.
    

      Fitch does not rate the class G or the class H.

We respect your privacy. Your information will never be sold to a third party.

Lender fees are not to exceed $350 per transaction for Costco Executive Members, and $650 for Gold Star and Business Members

Other Fees include 3rd party fees such as appraisal, flood certification, credit report, etc, points, and upfront mortgage insurance premiums ("Upfront MIP"). Depending on the type of loan you select, fees may vary.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
