Wanda dropped the last clam into her bucket, scuffed her bare toes through the wet sand, and headed daintily across the dry hot drift above the water line to the trees. She felt certain it must be time for her Tie; Dick might be waiting.

Pretty Girl Punished 

Melody and I walk in single ﬁle, the padlocked chain from neck to neck keeps usunder perfect control. Melody's nakedness forms my principle view, and I wonderhow that glorious virgin back of her's will look tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.Mine has borne stripes for so long they do not matter. I look constantly at Melody'scrossed hands and bound wrists. She's so sweet, she does not struggle, innocentlyher ﬁngers accept their condition as captive to the cords. Looking at Melody's back and Melody's tied hands, I see also my own for we are similarly bound. Sometimesone of us will stumble or take a false step and thus snub our three foot length of tethering chain to jerk at both necks, but this we do not mind. We love each other.Our two guards who marched us back to servitude laughing, delighted in telling usof punishments to come, we were runaways and could expect the worst. But nowthey feel sorry for us and strive to console and reassure, offering the possibility of Lenore's forgiveness of our sin. We do not believe a word of it.They are intrigued by the lovely silver ring around my throat above the chain. Theyinsist again and again on my recounting the agonies it imposes when I run a steptoo far from my enslavement to the Estate. They ﬁnger it in curiosity with loving hands, assuring me I will have to wear it all my life. It will never allow me to go asingle step beyond what Lenore will choose. They had heard of the ring but hadnever previously seen one. They cheerfully admit to an erotic longing to be thusringed themselves since they have neither intent nor wish to escape. A ring like thisis an almost living bond between the girl who wears it and her mistress. Melodyassures them they don't know when they are well off.Our ponygirl escort do not wear the harness of a guard as do I. Melody hadcounselled against taking it with us when we ran away. But I was strangely loath topart with it. The tight clutch of it's straps gently and insistently imposed an eroticthrill while at the same time endowing me with authority over any other girl savethose who wore the harness too. Ruefully I wondered if my status as a Guard wouldsurvive this latest of my run-away exploits. Almost certainly they would take theharness away from me when I was whipped. I had no doubt whatever that I wouldbe whipped, it was the least I could expect and would probably be only one of many punishments I must bear. My heart bled for Melody, the poor darling was soinnocent of guilt.I had many times been made more helpless than now. Tied wrists and a chain



















 

around my neck was nothing new. But the circumstances under which I was thusbound imposed a fearful impotence. To have had freedom within my grasp but bedefeated by an electric impulse from a silver ring around my neck was bitter gall.Lenore had been playing with me all the time, knowing I would run but curious tosee how and when. Then she set her infernal gadget to reduce me to a helpless massof torment at a range of miles, she had let me make my own trap and walk into it. Idon't suppose she had ﬁgured on Melody running with me to guide me to the secretroad. I felt bad about Melody and the punishment waiting for her because she wasmy friend.I wondered if Lenore would allow me to retain possession of Melody and Nona,Celie and Inga - or whether they would be taken from me along with my leatherharness. I could plead Melody's innocence by afﬁrming my ownership, telling of aﬁctional compulsion I had placed upon the poor girl to lead me to freedom. Lenoreprobably would not buy it but I could try.I twisted at bound hands in bitter frustration. I thought of Bill Trafford, my Master.It had been he, rather than freedom, I sought in ﬂight. Now I would never see himagain. He could not come to me on the Estate and the ring around my throat madecertain I would not go to him. Melody and these two girl who were leading us asprisoners found it so easy to be happy with the Estate, but they had been born thereand I had not. Once again I cursed my tendency to rebellion, it would cost me dear.Lenore's farmstead greeted us with unconcern. Ponies who had seen Melody and Iled across the yard, bound and connected by our shameful chain, only smiled andnodded as though knowing this the inevitable end of too much freedom. Weevidently no longer rated the house but were taken directly to the stables where thegirl in charge told me my other ponies were harnessed to the mistress' buggy andwere either hard at work or hitched to a post. We were taken to a concrete slab andthere hosed down and laughingly toweled dry. She then said she had a single vacantstall at the far end of the row, as far from my beloved team as we could get. Wewere then lovingly kissed by our two girl escort who assured us they had thoroughlyenjoyed bringing us back to be ponies the way we were supposed to be. They kissedus several times, assuring us we shouldn't worry about punishment that might nothappen. We could see the stable girl did not believe them any more than we did.They went away to other duties and we were invited to walk in behind the bars andto hear the fateful clang and locking of the iron bar door. Melody and I were still joined by the locked chain upon our necks and our hands still tied behind ourbacks. I felt positive we were in deep disgrace. When we asked the stable girl shesaid she knew nothing about it but had been told to keep us safe. Melody and Iexchanged knowing glances and sat down on the straw, jerking our necks as we didso and not even chuckling."You may be right, darling," Melody admitted soberly. "I've come by a bad feeling. Ithink the girls all know something they won't tell us. Oh, darling, I'm so terriblysorry!"

Publisher's Description▼▲
"There is a charm and a charism to Pope Francis. His words have a way of captivating the reader. Like all good pastors, he points to Jesus. Prepare now to join Pope Francis on this walk along the Way." From the Foreword by ARCHBISHOP JOSEPH E. KURTZ Ask someone for a definition of Christianity and you are likely to hear a philosophical, historical, or even cultural description ofit. But any explanation of the Christian faith that fails to define it as a way of being, of proceeding, is missing the mark. For at its core, Christianity is about livingand lovingas committed disciples of Jesus Christ.Embracing the Way of Jesus is a beautifully curated collection of excerpts from the homilies and writings of Pope Francis, all centering on Christianity as a way of lifeor, as the earliest Christians would have understood it, "the Way." Through the Popes meditations on Scripture, we pause to consider essential aspects of discipleship such as The Way of the Cross, The Way of Prayer, The Way of Children, The Way of the Poor, and more. The book even offers a rare opportunity to see more clearly the path of discipleship through the lens of the Old Testament. For anyone desiring to live out the faith in a way that can truly transform and heal our hearts and our world, Embracing the Way of Jesus is the perfect place to start.


Author Bio▼▲
POPE FRANCIS was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio on 17 December 1936 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. As a young man, he worked briefly as a chemical technician and nightclub bouncer before entering the Jesuits. He was ordained a priest in 1969, and from 1973 to 1979, was Argentina's Provincial Superior of the Society of Jesus. He became the Archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1998, and was appointed a Cardinal in 2001. Following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI on 28 February 2013, Bergoglio was named his successor on 13 March. He chose the name Francis in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi. He is the first Jesuit Pope, the first Pope from the Americas, the first Pope from the Southern Hemisphere, and the first non-European Pope in over 1200 years. Pope Francis has been noted for his humility, his concern for the poor, and his commitment to dialogue as a way to build bridges between people of all backgrounds, beliefs, and faiths.JIM CAMPBELL is the general editor of the Harpers New American Bible Study Program. He is also a father of two, grandfather of six, religious educator, and author. He is the author of The Stories of the Old Testament and the coauthor of the Finding God religious education program, both published by Loyola Press. Jim is the staff theologian at Loyola Press.


About the Author/Editor▼▲
Pope Francis (Jorge Mario Bergoglio), is the first Latin American to be elected to the chair of Peter. A native of Buenos Aires, Argentina, he was ordained as a priest in 1969. He served as head of the Society of Jesus in Argentina from 1973 to 1979. In 1998 he became the archbishop of Buenos Aires, and in 2001 a cardinal. Following the resignation of his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, February 28, 2013, the conclave elected Bergoglio, who chose the papal name Francis in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi. He is the first pope to be a Jesuit and to come from the Americas.
James P. Campbell, DMin, father of two children and grandfather of six, is a religious educator and author. He is the coauthor of the Finding God religious education program, published by Loyola Press, and the general editor of the Haper's New American Bible Study Program. He has master's degrees in theology and history and a doctorate in ministry in Christian education from the Aquinas Institute of Theology, St. Loyus. He is the staff theologian at Loyola Press.

Title
Origami-Based Design for Engineering Applications



Author
Kevin Campbell Francis, Brigham Young University - ProvoFollow



Abstract
Origami can be a powerful source of design inspiration in the creation of reconfigurable systems with unparalleled performance. This thesis provides fundamental tools for designers to employ as origami-based designs are pursued in their respective fields of expertise. The first chapter introduces origami and makes connections between origami and engineering design through a survey of engineered applications and characterizing the relationship between origami and compliant mechanisms. The second chapter evaluates the creasing of non-paper sheet materials, such as plastics and metals, to facilitate origami-based compliant mechanism design. Although it is anticipated that most origami-based design will result from surrogate folds (indirect methods of replacing the crease), it is valuable to provide information that may help in more direct approaches for origami-based design in materials other than paper. Planar sheets of homogeneous material are considered as they maintain the principles fundamental to origami (flat initial state, low cost, readily available). The reduced stiffness along the axis of the crease is an enabling characteristic of origami. Hence a metric based on the deformation of the crease compared to the deformation of the panels enables engineering materials to be evaluated based on their ability to achieve the "hinge-like" behavior observed in folded paper. Advantages of both high and low values of this metric are given. Testing results (hinge indexes, residual angles, localized hinge behavior and cyclic creasing to failure) are presented for various metals and polymers. This methodology and subsequent findings are provided to enable origami-based design of compliant mechanisms. The third chapter proposes a basic terminology for origami-based design and presents areas of considerations for cases where the final engineering design is directly related to a crease pattern. This framework for navigating from paper art to engineered products begins once the crease pattern has been selected for a given application. The four areas of consideration are discussed: 1) rigid foldability 2) crease characterization 3) material properties and dimensions and 4) manufacturing. Two examples are concurrently presented to illustrate these considerations: a backpack shell and a shroud for an adjustable C-Arm x-ray device used in hospitals. The final chapter provides concluding remarks on origami-based design.
