CHICAGO, Oct. 17, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Morningstar, Inc. (NASDAQ:   MORN), a leading provider of independent investment research, today announced that Stephane Biehler, 45, is joining Morningstar as chief financial officer, reporting to Joe Mansueto, Morningstar's chairman and chief executive officer.  
Biehler has served as chief accounting officer and corporate controller for NYSE Euronext, a global operator of financial markets, since 2007. He will join Morningstar upon completion of the merger between NYSE Euronext and IntercontinentalExchange, which is targeted for Nov. 4. 
"We're pleased to welcome Stephane to Morningstar," Mansueto said. "His experience at the NYSE and Archipelago, and with global technology and financial services firms, was particularly attractive to us. We look forward to having Stephane on our team."
Mansueto added, "As we previously announced, Scott Cooley, who has been our CFO since 2007, is taking a leave of absence for a year to pursue a graduate degree. We look forward to having him return to Morningstar in a research role after he finishes his program."
Biehler worked for Archipelago Holdings in Chicago as corporate controller from 2004 to 2006 and joined NYSE Group in 2006 as controller when the firms merged. Among his accomplishments, he helped facilitate the Archipelago IPO a decade ago, as well as the mergers between the NYSE and Archipelago, and NYSE Group and Euronext. He started his career at Deloitte, where he worked for nine years.
"I look forward to helping build on the success of Morningstar and its global operations and continuing the pursuit of value creation for clients and shareholders," Biehler said. "My family and I are excited about returning to Chicago, where we previously lived."  
Biehler holds a master's degree in international business from the University of Haute-Alsace in France and is a Certified Public Accountant. He is also a dual French and American citizen.
