What are analysts saying about Thermo Fisher Scientific stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Thermo Fisher Scientific stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Over the last three months, Thermo Fisher is trading above the broader Medical - Instruments industry. The company’s last reported first quarter 2017 was quite impressive. The increased 2017 guidance is all the more encouraging indicating the fact that this overall bullish trend will continue through 2017. Moreover we remain encouraged by the company’s series of product launches and acquisitions along with strong growth in emerging markets and better management observed in its customer value proposition. Thermo Fisher’s acquisition of FEI has already started to boost the company’s analytical instruments portfolio. Its recent decision to acquire Pantheon is to expand its biopharma services in Europe. On the flip side, competitive pressure and currency headwinds add woes." (7/11/2017)
2. Evercore ISI analysts commented, "When all is said in done we will remember 4Q as being generally uneventful, with guidance coming in better than feared as investors had become concerned re the impact from slowing biopharma demand (didn't really occur), mixed A&G trends and an incremental headwind from Fx. The level of consistency we see from TMO is unusual in this challenging healthcare environment and likely helps to justify valuation that is certainly not inexpensive on an EV / EBITDA basis (particularly in a rising rate world). That being said with so few places to hide in a difficult healthcare tape, we would expect TMO's superior EPS growth to help shares to remain a preferred equity, particularly given its status as a visible compounder. Thus despite today's sharp move in shares (up a bit more than we would have anticipated) we reiterate our Buy rating as risk / reward continues to be asymmetrically biased upward." (1/31/2017)
