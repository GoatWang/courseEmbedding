 August�24, 2006  Board of Directors  c/o Marsh Supermarkets, Inc.  9800 Crosspoint Blvd  Indianapolis, IN 46256  Dear Members of the Board of Directors:  As the managing member of BML Investment Partners, a 5.0% holder of
Marsh B class securities, I strongly disagree with your decision to sell the Company to an affiliate
of Sun Capital Partners (�Sun�) for $11.125 per share.  I do not believe that the $11.125 per share transaction fully reflects the asset value of
our company, as my analysis yields an asset value of between $22-28�per share. Even assuming additional impairment charges for future store closings (such as the recently announced Naperville store closure), there�s a substantial gap
between book value and the Sun offer.  (In 1,000�s except per share amounts)  �

 Sun stated in a letter addressed to the Special Committee of the Board of Directors (Special Committee) dated
May�29, 2006 that the �real estate appraisals [independently appraised at $100-$150 million above carrying value, and disclosed in the Q3 2005 earnings release dated Feb 21, 2006] grossly overstate the value of Marsh�s assets and that
leverage against these assets would be far below expectations generated by those appraisals.� Assuming that Sun is correct, and that the value of the real estate is only worth half as much as above-stated appraisal, Marsh�s asset value is
still well above Sun�s $11.125 offer.  (In 1,000�s except per share amounts)  �

 I also take issue with the Board of Director�s decision to ignore the potential offer from
Cardinal/Drawbridge and its decision to reject financial buyer D�s request to match any superior offer. According to the PREM14A filed on June�16, 2006 the following events took place:  �


�
�
�
On April�3, 2006, financial buyer D submitted a revised indication of value of $10.47 per share, together with a request for exclusivity. On April�5, Merrill Lynch advised
financial buyer D that Marsh was not willing to grant exclusivity at that time. Financial buyer D withdrew its offer the next day.  �


�
�
�
On April�14, 2006, financial buyer D advised Merrill Lynch that it would be interested in re-entering the auction process if it was provided a right to match any superior
offer.  �


�
�
�
On April�14, 2006, Cardinal indicated that although its current valuation range was between its previous ranges of $11-13 and $18-20�per share, it had not yet refined its
view, and would attempt to submit a revised indication by the end of the following week.  �


�
�
�
On April�18, 2006 the board rejected financial buyers D�s request to match any superior offers.

�
�
�
On April�20, 2006, the Company signed a Letter of Intent with Sun at a price of $11.125 per share and agreed to a 21 day exclusivity period to allow Sun to complete due
diligence.  �


�
�
�
On April�27, 2006, the company received a joint indication from Cardinal and Drawbridge for $13.625 per share. Cardinal/Drawbridge indicated that they would need 15 days to
complete due diligence and agree to definitive merger terms. They also indicated that they would be willing to undertake a transaction without a financing contingency.  �


�
�
�
On April�28, 2006, the Board met telephonically to review the indication of interest from Cardinal/Drawbridge and decided against pursuing it, instead instructing management
and the Marsh advisors to continue working with Sun to finalize an agreement.  This sequence of events is baffling. The Board had clear
knowledge that a likely higher indication of interest was coming from Cardinal when it signed off on the April�20 letter of intent with Sun. When it received an indication from Cardinal/Drawbridge on April�27 in the amount of $13.625 per
share, it still decided to pursue the transaction with Sun. How is this in the best interest of shareholders when the potential offer from Cardinal/Drawbridge was 22.5% higher than the Sun offer? What was the reasoning behind denying financial buyer
D�s request to match any superior offer? Isn�t the purpose of an auction to receive the highest offer? In my opinion, the Board breeched its fiduciary duty to shareholders.  There is more to Marsh than the value of its real estate. As reported in form 10Q filed on August�8, 2006, FY07 Q1 earnings were $0.15 per diluted share versus $0.08 last year. Net of adjustments for merger
related expenses, real estate gains, restructuring charges, and adjusting the tax rate, earnings were $0.20 per diluted share (see below). This was achieved in the face of declining sales do to competition and more importantly, customer uncertainty
regarding the potential outcome of the sale of the company.  �

 Clearly, Marsh is benefiting from the closing of unprofitable stores and last year�s job reductions made at
the corporate level. As illustrated below, Marsh�s first quarter adjusted operating income was its highest quarterly results since Q1 of FY2003!  �

 During this 4+ year time period, Marsh stock nearly always traded at a premium to the current offer price of
$11.125. Only in late 2005 and early 2006 did the stock trade at any meaningful 








CUSIP No. 571783208

 discount to this price. In my opinion, this was due largely to the dividend suspension announced on
November�29, 2005 along with inaccurate rumors of the companies� demise. The market may be a �voting machine� in the short term, but is a �weighing machine� over longer periods of time. This means that the market
eventually gets it right. The average trading price over this time period, 4/01/2002-6/24/2006, is $12.10 for the A shares and $12.05 for the B�s. If the time period from November�29, 2005 is removed the average increases to $12.49 for the
A�s and $12.48 for the B�s. Why then is the Board willing to sell at a discount to the average trading price over these 17 quarters when the company just reported its 2nd best quarterly results in the last 4+ years?  Only recently
has Cardinal/Drawbridge withdrawn its indication of interest to acquire Marsh for $13.625 per share after an unfavorable court ruling prohibited Marsh from pursuing an indication of interest from Cardinal/Drawbridge. Not surprisingly,
Cardinal/Drawbridge was appeased by an affiliate of Sun with a possible sale/leaseback transaction announced on August�14, 2006. Further, according to the DEFM14A filed on August�18, 2006, if a definitive sale/leaseback is not agreed upon,
Cardinal and Drawbridge will have certain co-investment rights in connection with ownership of Marsh following the merger. In my opinion, it appears that Cardinal/Drawbridge was offered an incentive to step aside; one that�s not in the best
interest of shareholders.  The board may be concerned that without Sun, Marsh will be left without a potential buyer. In this unlikely case, I would remind
shareholders that they are owners of a company whose asset value far exceeds the current price, and one that just posted its 2nd best quarterly results in the last 4+ years!  For the reasons explained above, BML cannot support the merger with an affiliate of Sun
Capital and intends to vote against it. We hope that other shareholders will come to a similar decision. BML intends to consider all courses of action to maximize the value of its investment.  Finally, as a shareholder and customer, I want to thank all of the Marsh employees for their hard work and excellent service during this time of uncertainty. 
Sincerely,  Braden M. Leonard  Managing Member  Notes:  �

Mr. William C. Egan, Chairman of the Board
Mr. William J. Hemelt, Chief Executive Officer and Director
The Board of Directors, Matrixx Initiatives, Inc.
8515 E. Anderson Drive
Scottsdale, AZ 85255
 
Dear Madam and Sirs:
 
BML Investment Partners, L.P. is a holder of 935,000 shares of common stock of Matrixx Initiatives (the “Company”), or approximately 9.9% of the outstanding shares. This makes us the second largest shareholder according to public records. As managing member, I am writing to express my disappointment in the proposed transaction with affiliates of H.I.G. Capital, LLC (“HIG”). The proposed deal with HIG at $8 per share is at the extreme low end of any reasonable fair value estimate, and the timing of the announcement to coincide with the announced settlement of the bulk of the Company’s pending product liability cases makes no sense at all.
On the day of the announcement, December 14, 2010, I contacted Bill Hemelt, Matrixx CEO, to express my concerns that the $8 per share offer seemed quite low. In fact, it’s my strong belief that the stock would have reacted very favorably to the settlement alone, and would likely approach $8 per share without any mention of the proposed HIG transaction. After reading the Company’s Schedule 14D-9 filed on December 22, 2010, my feelings regarding the deal remained unchanged.
In addition, the Company’s third quarter earnings, released on January 20, 2011, revealed no data point that would indicate the $8 per share offer from HIG is fair. In fact, BML thought the results to be quite positive and indicative of a higher intrinsic value. Though hindered by many charges and tough comparisons to last year’s H1N1 scare, the results revealed important underlying strengths of the Zicam brand such as strong gross margins (above 70%) and growing consumer acceptance (December retail units sales of Zicam Cold Remedy +30% vs. entire cold/cough category of +5%). I again contacted Bill Hemelt on January 21, 2011 to express my view that the latest quarterly data confirmed my earlier view that the HIG offer of $8 per share was inadequate. The following simplistic analysis will reveal as much.

Nine Months Ended Dec 31, 2010



 

($ 000s)



 
 



Reported EBIT


(13,697)




Adjustments

 



Personal Injury Settlement (Net)


15,000

Adjusted EBIT

Note: The above number includes the YTD net legal defense costs of $2.0 million ($7.0 million in costs offset by $5.0 million of insurance reimbursement). This amounts to 667k per quarter which is a reasonable estimate on a post settlement basis.
The Company’s annual guidance for the year ending March 31, 2011, is for revenue to increase 3% to 5% above last years $67.3 million, the midpoint of which would put annual revenue at $70 million and Q4 revenue at $25.2 million. As shown below, using a similar gross margin percentage (70.6%) and SG&A level as in Q3 the Company would produce an additional $4.1mm of EBIT in Q4.




 

BML Estimate

 


 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2011

Revenue (based on midpoint of Company guidance)


25,200

 



Cost of Sales


7,409

 



Gross Profit @ 70.6%

EBIT


4,120

 


 
 
 



Note: The Q4 estimate includes the third quarter level of net legal expense of $1.3mm, which is likely higher than normal on a post settlement basis and thus is conservative.
The above analysis puts full year EBIT at $9.4 million, or about $1 per share. I believe this number is achievable, realistic, and something that can be improved upon in the future.
 
Considering the Q4 profit estimate outlined above and the seasonal nature of the Company’s working capital needs (which requires higher levels of inventory and receivables in quarters 2 and 3), it is likely the company will finish the year with somewhere in the neighborhood of $26-30 million in cash, not including the $11.5 million in restricted cash. 
 
While I recognize that the Company still has to pay $4 million over the next 20 months for the personal injury settlement and around $2.2 million to settle the economic injury claims, much of these cash outflows will likely be offset by receipt of an income tax receivable. Though the exact amount and timing of the receivable has not yet been reported, 
 
I believe it will be enough to largely offset the above mentioned payouts. As such, the Company should finish the year with around $3 per share in net cash. A back of the envelope analysis shows the $8 per share offer by HIG to be only five times pretax earnings, net of cash. I believe this is extremely inadequate.
HIG offer $8 per share
Market Cap @$8 $75 million
Year End Cash (BML estimate) $28 million
Enterprise Value @ $8/share $47 million
EBIT for year ending March 31, 2011 (BML estimate) $9.4 million
EV/EBIT @ $8/share 5X
 
As mentioned above, the timing of the announced deal is also extremely puzzling. While one can only speculate as to what might have happened, I strongly believe that the shares would be approaching $8 based on the very positive settlement news alone. If so, the current offer amounts to a deal with virtually zero premium. With the legal overhang largely removed, I believe the shares have strong potential to move higher on a standalone basis as investors focus on the strength of the Zicam brand and the company’s earnings power. As such, I am baffled as to why the Board felt the need to enter a deal at this time.
In light of the recent settlement news and positive underlying fundamentals BML has no interest in selling its shares at $8, so will not participate in the current tender.
 
Regards,
/s/ Braden M. Leonard
