Early life[edit]
Ahrendts was born and raised in New Palestine, Indiana, the third of six children.[2] Her father, Richard Ahrendts, was a businessman, and her mother, Jean, was a homemaker.[11]
She attended New Palestine High School, where she was a varsity cheerleader.[11] In 1982, She earned an undergraduate degree in Merchandising and Marketing from Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana. In 2010, she received an honorary doctorate of Humane Letters from Ball State.[12]
Career[edit]
Ahrendts moved to New York City to work in the fashion industry.[2] After a series of positions including merchandising at bra maker Warnaco,[2] Ahrendts joined Donna Karan International in 1989, working to develop the luxury brand internationally through both wholesale and licensing.[13] In 1996 she was hired at Henri Bendel by Leslie Wexner to expand Bendel stores to 50 new markets, but the project was cancelled by the board of directors two years later.[2]
In 1998, she joined Fifth & Pacific Companies as Vice President of Corporate Merchandising and Design. In 2001, she was promoted to Senior Vice President Corporate Merchandising and Group President, responsible for the merchandising of the group's 20 plus brands including Laundry by Shelli Segal, Lucky Brand Dungarees and the men's retail business of Liz Claiborne Inc. In 2002, she was promoted again to serve as Executive Vice President, with full responsibility for the complete line of Liz Claiborne products, services and development across both women's and men's lines.[13]
Burberry[edit]
Ahrendts joined Burberry in January 2006, and took up the position of CEO on July 1, 2006 replacing Rose Marie Bravo. Ahrendts mitigated the brand's decline in prestige by immediately limiting the number of clothing and accessories carrying the Burberry check pattern to 10%, minimizing the damage ubiquitous counterfeits had caused to sales. She also oversaw the buying out of the Spanish franchise which was then generating 20% of group revenues to stop its unfettered licensing.[2] Ahrendts says she did not model her approach after any other fashion house, but looked to world-class design as an influence, including Apple Inc..[2] The company value rose during her tenure from £2 billion to over £7 billion.[2] CNN Money reported that during 2012, she was the highest paid CEO in the UK, making $26.3 million.[14]
Apple[edit]
On October 15, 2013, it was announced that Ahrendts would leave Burberry in Spring 2014 to join Apple Inc. as a member of its executive team as Senior Vice President of Retail and Online Stores, filling the spot vacated by John Browett in October 2012. On May 1, 2014, Apple's new SVP of Retail and Online Stores Angela Ahrendts was placed on the Apple Leadership roster, signaling her official entry into the company.[15][16]
According to Apple's 2015 Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,[17] Ahrendts earned over $70 million in 2014, more than any other executive at Apple, including CEO Tim Cook. As of August 2016, she is reported to own approximately US$11 million worth of Apple shares.[18] She is the only female senior executive at Apple.[19]

Early life[edit]
Ahrendts was born and raised in New Palestine, Indiana, the third of six children.[2] Her father, Richard Ahrendts, was a businessman, and her mother, Jean, was a homemaker.[11]
She attended New Palestine High School, where she was a varsity cheerleader.[11] In 1982, She earned an undergraduate degree in Merchandising and Marketing from Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana. In 2010, she received an honorary doctorate of Humane Letters from Ball State.[12]
Career[edit]
Ahrendts moved to New York City to work in the fashion industry.[2] After a series of positions including merchandising at bra maker Warnaco,[2] Ahrendts joined Donna Karan International in 1989, working to develop the luxury brand internationally through both wholesale and licensing.[13] In 1996 she was hired at Henri Bendel by Leslie Wexner to expand Bendel stores to 50 new markets, but the project was cancelled by the board of directors two years later.[2]
In 1998, she joined Fifth & Pacific Companies as Vice President of Corporate Merchandising and Design. In 2001, she was promoted to Senior Vice President Corporate Merchandising and Group President, responsible for the merchandising of the group's 20 plus brands including Laundry by Shelli Segal, Lucky Brand Dungarees and the men's retail business of Liz Claiborne Inc. In 2002, she was promoted again to serve as Executive Vice President, with full responsibility for the complete line of Liz Claiborne products, services and development across both women's and men's lines.[13]
Burberry[edit]
Ahrendts joined Burberry in January 2006, and took up the position of CEO on July 1, 2006 replacing Rose Marie Bravo. Ahrendts mitigated the brand's decline in prestige by immediately limiting the number of clothing and accessories carrying the Burberry check pattern to 10%, minimizing the damage ubiquitous counterfeits had caused to sales. She also oversaw the buying out of the Spanish franchise which was then generating 20% of group revenues to stop its unfettered licensing.[2] Ahrendts says she did not model her approach after any other fashion house, but looked to world-class design as an influence, including Apple Inc..[2] The company value rose during her tenure from £2 billion to over £7 billion.[2] CNN Money reported that during 2012, she was the highest paid CEO in the UK, making $26.3 million.[14]
Apple[edit]
On October 15, 2013, it was announced that Ahrendts would leave Burberry in Spring 2014 to join Apple Inc. as a member of its executive team as Senior Vice President of Retail and Online Stores, filling the spot vacated by John Browett in October 2012. On May 1, 2014, Apple's new SVP of Retail and Online Stores Angela Ahrendts was placed on the Apple Leadership roster, signaling her official entry into the company.[15][16]
According to Apple's 2015 Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,[17] Ahrendts earned over $70 million in 2014, more than any other executive at Apple, including CEO Tim Cook. As of August 2016, she is reported to own approximately US$11 million worth of Apple shares.[18] She is the only female senior executive at Apple.[19]

Angela Jean Ahrendts, DBE (born June 7, 1960)[3] is an American businesswoman and the senior vice president of retail at Apple Inc. She was the CEO of Burberry from 2006 to 2014.[4] Ahrendts left Burberry to join Apple in 2014.[5] Ahrendts was ranked 25th in Forbes' 2015 list of the most powerful women in the world,[6] 9th most powerful woman in the U.K. in the BBC Radio 4 Woman’s Hour 100 Power List,[7] and 29th in Fortune’s 2014 list of the world's most powerful women in business.[8] She was also a member of the UK's Prime Minister's business advisory council until it was disbanded in 2016.[9][10]

Early life[edit]
Ahrendts was born and raised in New Palestine, Indiana, the third of six children.[2] Her father, Richard Ahrendts, was a businessman, and her mother, Jean, was a homemaker.[11]
She attended New Palestine High School, where she was a varsity cheerleader.[11] In 1982, She earned an undergraduate degree in Merchandising and Marketing from Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana. In 2010, she received an honorary doctorate of Humane Letters from Ball State.[12]
Career[edit]
Ahrendts moved to New York City to work in the fashion industry.[2] After a series of positions including merchandising at bra maker Warnaco,[2] Ahrendts joined Donna Karan International in 1989, working to develop the luxury brand internationally through both wholesale and licensing.[13] In 1996 she was hired at Henri Bendel by Leslie Wexner to expand Bendel stores to 50 new markets, but the project was cancelled by the board of directors two years later.[2]
In 1998, she joined Fifth & Pacific Companies as Vice President of Corporate Merchandising and Design. In 2001, she was promoted to Senior Vice President Corporate Merchandising and Group President, responsible for the merchandising of the group's 20 plus brands including Laundry by Shelli Segal, Lucky Brand Dungarees and the men's retail business of Liz Claiborne Inc. In 2002, she was promoted again to serve as Executive Vice President, with full responsibility for the complete line of Liz Claiborne products, services and development across both women's and men's lines.[13]
Burberry[edit]
Ahrendts joined Burberry in January 2006, and took up the position of CEO on July 1, 2006 replacing Rose Marie Bravo. Ahrendts mitigated the brand's decline in prestige by immediately limiting the number of clothing and accessories carrying the Burberry check pattern to 10%, minimizing the damage ubiquitous counterfeits had caused to sales. She also oversaw the buying out of the Spanish franchise which was then generating 20% of group revenues to stop its unfettered licensing.[2] Ahrendts says she did not model her approach after any other fashion house, but looked to world-class design as an influence, including Apple Inc..[2] The company value rose during her tenure from £2 billion to over £7 billion.[2] CNN Money reported that during 2012, she was the highest paid CEO in the UK, making $26.3 million.[14]
Apple[edit]
On October 15, 2013, it was announced that Ahrendts would leave Burberry in Spring 2014 to join Apple Inc. as a member of its executive team as Senior Vice President of Retail and Online Stores, filling the spot vacated by John Browett in October 2012. On May 1, 2014, Apple's new SVP of Retail and Online Stores Angela Ahrendts was placed on the Apple Leadership roster, signaling her official entry into the company.[15][16]
According to Apple's 2015 Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,[17] Ahrendts earned over $70 million in 2014, more than any other executive at Apple, including CEO Tim Cook. As of August 2016, she is reported to own approximately US$11 million worth of Apple shares.[18] She is the only female senior executive at Apple.[19]

Personal life[edit]
Ahrendts met her husband Gregg Couch in elementary school. They married in their 30s after a 17-year long-distance relationship. The couple has three children.[30] When Ahrendts was working at Burberry, the family lived in a 12,000 square feet (1,100 m2) home on an 8 acres (3.2 ha) plot west of London.[2] Brought up a Methodist, she is still an active Christian.[2]

Angela Ahrendts to Join Apple as Senior Vice President of Retail and Online Stores - Apple
















































PRESS RELEASE
October 14, 2013






       
         
             Angela Ahrendts to Join Apple as Senior Vice President of Retail and Online Stores


		
        
        







CUPERTINO, California—October 14, 2013—Apple® today announced that Angela Ahrendts, CEO of Burberry, will be joining Apple in a newly created position, as a senior vice president and member of our executive team, reporting to CEO Tim Cook.
Ahrendts will have oversight of the strategic direction, expansion and operation of both Apple retail and online stores, which have redefined the shopping experience for hundreds of millions of customers around the world. Apple retail stores set the standard for customer service with innovative features like the Genius Bar®, Personal Setup and One to One personal training to help customers get the most out of their Apple products.
“I am thrilled that Angela will be joining our team,” said Cook. “She shares our values and our focus on innovation, and she places the same strong emphasis as we do on the customer experience. She has shown herself to be an extraordinary leader throughout her career and has a proven track record.”
“I am profoundly honored to join Apple in this newly created position next year, and very much look forward to working with the global teams to further enrich the consumer experience on and offline,” said Ahrendts. “I have always admired the innovation and impact Apple products and services have on people’s lives and hope in some small way I can help contribute to the company’s continued success and leadership in changing the world.”
Ahrendts will join Apple in the spring from Burberry, where she serves as CEO and has led the company through a period of outstanding global growth. Prior to Burberry, she was executive vice president at Liz Claiborne Inc., and earlier in her career she served as president of Donna Karan International.
Apple designs Macs, the best personal computers in the world, along with OS X, iLife, iWork and professional software. Apple leads the digital music revolution with its iPods and iTunes online store. Apple has reinvented the mobile phone with its revolutionary iPhone and App Store, and is defining the future of mobile media and computing devices with iPad.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

		35 Comments 




“Apple Inc. insider Angela J. Ahrendts sold 25,377 shares of the stock in a transaction dated Wednesday, May 10th,” Daniel Jordon reports for Sports Perspectives. “The shares were sold at an average price of $154.24, for a total transaction of $3,914,148.48.”
“Following the completion of the transaction, the insider now owns 81,936 shares of the company’s stock, valued at approximately $12,637,808.64,” Jordon reports. “The sale was disclosed in a document filed with the SEC, which can be accessed through this link.”
Angela Ahrendts, Senior Vice President, Retail, Apple Inc.“The business also recently declared a quarterly dividend, which was paid on Thursday, May 18th,” Jordon reports. “Shareholders of record on Monday, May 15th were paid a $0.63 dividend.”

MacDailyNews Take: Not sure why this is on Sports Perspectives, but it is, so here ya go! After all, we scour the web for Apple-related articles.
This is likely a tax deal (cover the taxes on her salary, etc.) or Ahrendts is buying a cozy beach house or a Bugatti Chiron and an even cozier $1.3 million beach cottage.

Yep, she and he house hubs Gregg with 3 Gs are the definition of cute and stuff.

Keep a low profile and stick to her job (running retail), something I’d recommend to some of the other Apple brass, Cue, Ive and Cook in particular.

Considering not much (except rehashing old Ron Johnson\Steve Jobs ideas) has happened in retail sounds like a pretty cozy gig for that kind of coin. 
Also I may be wrong but didn’t she get millions in stock as a signing bonus did she unload that already?

Apple no longer breaks out the retail store revenue on its annual reports, but we know that they make over $5,000 per square foot and that there are more than 4.8 million square feet. Which of you critics sold more than $24 billion worth of stuff last year? I’ll listen to the one who did.

Ahrendts hasnt done a thing to improve Apple stores that a handful of preppy overprivileged kids wouldnt have figured out.  But then, one would have to consider blue t shirts and clueless employees with zero technical skills to be an improvement over how Apple stores used to be.  My last several experiences have been slow, multiple handoff situations where nobody at Apple was able to solve the issue.  Their one solution to everything is to flatten and reload the OS as if everyone wanted to trust their data to the effing icloud.  
All the overblown bs about fashion and design from atendts and ive bores me.  Granted I don’t live next to one of Apples huge architertural statement stores, but it has been a long time since I have found an Apple Store to be a comfortable place to hang out.  They are not warm welcoming places, they are sterile cold flat and lifeless like iOS 7.

Totally agree. What has she done to advance Apple Stores beyond a resume, pretty face and becoming a millionaire off of Apple stock.
Fingers crossed this is a prelude to an exit strategy …

Are you kidding?  She is clearly the heir apparent.  She’s the only one on the team that has been a CEO before.  She is a proven leader.  She has over seen the renewal and redesigns of many of the stores.  This sale was probably just taxes as MDN suggest or her financial planner suggested she diversify some of her holdings. We will be seeing a lot more of her in the future and she is clearly a better choice for CEO than either Ive, Shiller, Cue or Iovine.

Scott Forstall, like Gen. Douglas MacArthur, shall return—but only after his punitive NDA expires. Only a fool lets go of enough money to buy Crete and copperplate it, and Scott is no fool, but rather a tactician like MacArthur who waits for the moment and the resources to strike back effectively. Granted, either man, allowed autonomy, might have risked war and induced casualties; some would however argue that Truman’s and Cook’s bland and indifferent leadership were equally destructive in strategic or moral terms.

You must be joking. Angela is the least qualified manager at Apple to take the reins of CEO. 
As many posters on this forum confirm, what has she done? The Apple Store experience is at an all-time low and she had no hand in the original concept and implementation.
She is a cute fashionista PRIVILEGED and overpaid POSER, nothing more. She doesn’t have the tech chops …

Her initiative is not unique to the cashing in crowd; It’s merely another insance of the huge disparity agreed-upon by US legislators in colonialist, corporatist, and fake capitalist US. I say fake capitalist because US capitalism relies so much on Socialist handouts from the US gov. to grow its business model.

I am always impressed at the brilliance of the experts who regard Apple’s retail operations, which made significantly more than $24,000,000,000.00 in sales last year, as an abject failure. Things would have been so much better if the critics were in charge.

Can wearable technology ever be stylish? That is the question that former Burberry boss Angela Ahrendts, alongside Apple’s burgeoning team of fashion and design talent, has been brought in to answer as the company launched its first piece of wearable technology – the Apple Watch. 
And despite Ahrendts being absent from the stage at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts today, the Apple Watch collection bears the unmistakable imprimatur of the company’s new head of retail.
“We set out to make the best watch in the world,” Said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, before finally revealing the tech world’s worst kept secret, the Apple Watch. “We’ve been working incredibly hard for a long time on an entirely new product. And we believe this product will redefine what people expect from its category.” 
The launch of three distinct collections – Apple Watch, Sport and Apple Watch Edition – mimicked the traditions of a fashion brand, with each collection aimed at a different demographic, with the latter clearly designed to capture the luxury fashion customer.

September 9, 2014


Jony Ive, Apple’s vice-president of design, has overseen a range of watches that boast numerous digital functions including sensory touch, interfacing and “a rotary dial that translate into data” (a scroll button). But the emphasis was also on a watch that “is as much about technology as it is style and taste”. 
By creating a collection (in stores spring 2015) that features entry point watches at $349 (£217) alongside the sleekly designed – and almost certainly more expensive – Apple Watch Edition devices, which resemble high-end luxury jewellery, Apple’s design team has succeeded in overseeing a product whose aesthetic meets the standards of its technology.
“Apple is treating wearable technology the way that a fashion house treats an accessories line,” said Ben Thompson, editor of Statchery.com. “They have always created fashionable products but where they found the biggest success was personal devices.
“If you look at the way handbags have become statement items, and your choice of handbag tells the world something about who you are, I suspect that Apple will be going this way with the wearables. They’ll begin with two prototype products and later there will more options to follow, and the hope is to create something that becomes as successful as the luxury handbag market.”

Apple products have never been short on style but today’s event saw a heavy focus on fashion that began in the same week the company announced that acclaimed designer Marc Newson will be joining a team that already includes Musa Tariq, formerly of Nike, and Paul Deneve, previously chief executive of Yves Saint Laurent. 
For the Apple Watch launch launch Anita Borzyszkowska, a fashion industry PR heavyweight, was hired by Apple to recruit a wide range of fashion journalists and Alexandra Shulman, editor of British Vogue, was among the guests.

September 9, 2014


“Ahrendts is a talented executive,” says Lauren Indvik, a former tech writer who currently edits Fashionista.com. “When she started at Burberry, her own executives weren’t even wearing Burberry; it was a ‘has been’ – a waning brand. She left it positioned as a strong heritage brand that was also a digital pioneer, and cool and covetable because of that. She also transformed Burberry from a wholesaler to a direct retail business, and grew the business substantially in China – all of which align with Apple’s own goals pretty neatly.”

When the 54-year-old departed Burberry in 2013 she left a company whose value had risen by $3bn (£1.9bn) during her eight years at the helm of British fashion’s most established heritage brand. Ahrendts helped implement a digital strategy that revived Burberry’s image as both youthful and international. At Burberry she spotted the zeitgeist before the fashion world became obsessed with Instagram and celebrity social media stars. Now Apple are doing the same, as their wearable tech strategy features a range of biometrics and fitness tracking functionality.

This strategy, alongside Apple’s high-profile fashion appointments, makes sense in a fashion market that has seen a huge spike in the sale of gym wear and accessories. From activity trackers to yoga leggings, the international sports apparel market is set to grow to $178 billion by 2019, according to figures published by the Business of Fashion.
Apple’s presentation focused on the Apple Watch’s fitness tracking capability and tech innovation, but the real coup was that the company managed to make wearable tech the one thing it has never been before: fashionable.

Executive Summary
Reprint: R1301A 
As her top 60 executives arrived in London for the first strategic planning meeting after Ahrendts took the helm, she noticed that not one of them was wearing a Burberry trench coat, despite the damp, gray weather. It was a sign of the challenges the company faced. Even in a burgeoning global market, Burberry was growing at only 2% a year. It had lost focus in the process of global expansion: Each of the 23 licensees around the world was doing something different. Ubiquity was robbing the brand of its luster. 
Ahrendts realized that if Burberry was going to be a great, pure, global luxury brand, it needed to have one design director—a “brand czar”—and it needed to capitalize on its historical core: the trench coat. The company decided to innovate at the core to attract the luxury customers of the future: millennials.

 The Idea: Before Angela Ahrendts became Burberry’s CEO, licensing threatened to destroy the brand’s unique strengths. The answer? Centralize design and focus on innovating core heritage products. 
When I became the CEO of Burberry, in July 2006, luxury was one of the fastest-growing sectors in the world. With its rich history, centered on trench coats that were recognized around the world, the Burberry brand should have had many advantages. But as I watched my top managers arrive for our first strategic planning meeting, something struck me right away. They had flown in from around the world to classic British weather, gray and damp, but not one of these more than 60 people was wearing a Burberry trench coat. I doubt that many of them even owned one. If our top people weren’t buying our products, despite the great discount they could get, how could we expect customers to pay full price for them?
It was a sign of the challenges we faced. Even in a burgeoning global market, Burberry was growing at only 2% a year. The company had an excellent foundation, but it had lost its focus in the process of global expansion. We had 23 licensees around the world, each doing something different. We were selling products such as dog cover-ups and leashes. One of our highest-profile stores, on Bond Street in London, had a whole section of kilts. There’s nothing wrong with any of those products individually, but together they added up to just a lot of stuff—something for everybody, but not much of it exclusive or compelling.

In luxury, ubiquity will kill you—it means you’re not really luxury anymore. And we were becoming ubiquitous. Burberry needed to be more than a beloved old British company. It had to develop into a great global luxury brand while competing against much larger rivals. Among luxury players, Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH) had almost 12 times—and Pinault-Printemps-Redoute (PPR) more than 16 times—Burberry’s revenue. We wanted a share of the disposable income of the world’s most elite buyers—and to win it, we’d have to fight for prime real estate in the world’s most rapidly growing consumer markets. In many ways, it felt like a David-and-Goliath battle. 
One “Brand Czar”
On the surface, I might have seemed an unlikely CEO for a company that was considered quintessentially British. I was raised in a small town in Indiana and educated at Ball State University. I was a classic midwesterner—something the Financial Times had fun mocking when I first took the job. But I’d been fortunate enough to work with and learn from some of the most inspirational leaders in the fashion industry, from Paul Charron to Donna Karan. And I had 25 years of experience on my side.
I also clearly had one attribute that made me a good fit: I admire and respect great brands and helped to build some over the years. From Apple to Starbucks, I love the consistency—knowing that anywhere in the world you can depend on having the same experience in the store or being served a latte with the same taste and in the same cup. That’s great branding.
Unfortunately, Burberry didn’t have a lot of that. An experience in any given Burberry store in the world might be very different from the customer’s previous one. As part of my transition, I spent six months working closely with my predecessor, hitting the road to get a sense of Burberry worldwide. In Hong Kong, I was introduced to a design director and her team, who proudly showed me the line they were creating for that market: polo shirts and woven shirts and everything with the famous Burberry check, but not a single coat.
Then we went to America, where I was introduced to another design director and design team. This team was creating outerwear, but at half the price point of that in the UK. Furthermore, the coats were being manufactured in New Jersey. So we were making classic Burberry raincoats that said “Made in the U.S.A.” I later learned that we had outerwear licensees in Italy and Germany making trench coats that were even cheaper than those in the United States.
Great global brands don’t have people all over the world designing and producing all kinds of stuff. It became quite clear that if Burberry was going to be a great, pure, global luxury brand, we had to have one global design director. We had an incredible young designer named Christopher Bailey, with whom I’d worked at Donna Karan and who I knew was a sensational talent. So I introduced him early on as the “brand czar.” I told the team, “Anything that the consumer sees—anywhere in the world—will go through his office. No exceptions.” 
  
Within a year we had let the entire Hong Kong design team go and had brought some of the U.S. outerwear team to the UK, where we centralized all our design under Christopher. We closed the New Jersey factory—along with one in Wales that was making polo shirts—and began investing in our Castleford facility in Yorkshire, which makes our heritage rainwear. Closing the Welsh factory caused a political firestorm—I was even called to testify before Parliament alongside Burberry’s highly respected chairman—but we stood behind our decision. As a company, we always do what’s best for the brand, because our job is to protect it and keep it powerful and relevant. If we do that, even if it involves closing a factory with 300 employees, many more jobs will be created in time. We’ve doubled the head count at Castleford since then and almost tripled our global workforce to nearly 10,000, adding more than 1,000 jobs in the UK over the past two years alone. 







Sticking to the Core
Burberry is 156 years old; its coats were worn in the trenches of World War I by British soldiers, and for decades thereafter they were so much a part of British culture that the company earned a royal warrant, making it an official supplier to the royal family. Sir Ernest Shackleton wore a Burberry during his Antarctic expedition. Movie legends wore them on the silver screen. For more than a century the Burberry trench coat was cool. But when I became CEO, outerwear represented only about 20% of our global brand business. Fashion apparel and check accessories were leading our strategy. The more we examined the situation, the clearer it became that this wasn’t consistent with our luxury vision.
It’s not unusual for a luxury company to be born from a single product and then diversify. Louis Vuitton began with luggage, and Gucci with leather goods. But even as they diversified, each continued to earn the majority of its revenue from its original core products. Surveying the industry, we realized that Burberry was the only iconic luxury company that wasn’t capitalizing on its historical core. We weren’t proud of it. We weren’t innovating around it.
Furthermore, we were almost ignoring some of our strongest assets. Our weaving facility in Yorkshire produced the exclusive waterproof gabardine on which the company was founded. Thomas Burberry had created this fabric and the trench coat design for those early military and exploration commissions. The weaving facility was near the Castleford trench coat factory, in the north of England—fortunately, we hadn’t resorted to outsourcing in faraway places. What could be better than an authentic heritage brand with a great vertical supply chain? But we weren’t investing in it. We weren’t optimizing it.
After brainstorming and formalizing our instincts, we commissioned a consulting firm to provide us with competitor benchmarking. Our instincts confirmed, we clearly saw the way forward: We would reinforce our heritage, our Britishness, by emphasizing and growing our core luxury products, innovating them and keeping them at the heart of everything we did. I have to admit that some managers were cynical. A lot of them had been at Burberry for a really long time. I’m sure they left saying, “Focusing on trench coats—that’s our strategy?” But most of us were confident that it was the right plan. 
The Ethos of the Trench
The decision to focus on our heritage opened up a wealth of creativity. Christopher and the designers and marketers all started dreaming up ways to reinforce the idea that everything we did—from our runway shows to our stores—should start with the ethos of the trench.
At the same time, we had to shift Burberry’s historical corporate structure to reflect this new, purer point of view. We had great people, but we were organized like a department store. We had a person over each men’s category and a person over each women’s category. They made decisions that worked for their departments but might not make sense for the whole business. We needed to change, to focus on the big picture: the brand. In addition to putting Christopher in charge of all design, we had to hire functional expertise—a head of corporate resources, a head of planning, and a chief supply chain officer. It was all pretty basic, but necessary if we were to reach our goals.
To strengthen our retail operation, we decided to focus on markets where our competitors already had a presence, signaling the right kind of consumers to support a luxury brand. As our first blueprint for expansion, we identified every market in the world where two of our peers had stores and we had none. In the past six years we’ve opened 132 new stores, and we’ve refocused our retailing staff on outerwear. Trench coats are among the most expensive items we sell (many of them are priced over $1,000), but the staff was least equipped to sell them. Our salespeople had become accustomed to selling what was easy—relatively inexpensive items such as polo shirts. On commission, they’d be better off selling one trench coat than 10 polo shirts. They understood the math, but they needed tools to fully appreciate and communicate why the trench was the best investment for their customers. We established strong sales and service programs to put product education front and center. We created videos to demonstrate Burberry craftsmanship: All the collars are hand-rolled and hand-stitched. We equipped our sales associates with iPads and our stores with audiovisual technology to show these videos to best effect. We knew that beautiful, compelling content would connect customers to the brand and our iconic trench. 
  
We also began to shift our marketing efforts from targeting everyone, everywhere, to focusing on the luxury customers of the future: millennials. We believed that these customers were being ignored by our competitors. This was our white space.
The decision was not without controversy; we were choosing to aim squarely at a generation that had no current knowledge of Burberry’s core product. The effort had to be led by design—we needed to create outerwear that was innovative, cool, and so inviting that people would become repeat customers. Burberry used to have just a few basic styles of trench coats: Almost all were beige with the signature check lining, and the differences between them were minor. Now we have more than 300 SKUs, from capes and cropped jackets to the classic Burberry trench in a range of vibrant colors and styles, with everything from mink collars and alligator epaulets to studded leather sleeves. We had to infuse the new lines with our heritage. We also had to rethink our entire marketing approach for these customers—to make it digital. When we began, we had a few regional websites, so we consolidated them and redesigned everything on one platform. It showcases every facet of the brand. It has become the hub of all our marketing and branding, and a trench coat is always one of the first things you see when you go online. The site is designed to speak to that millennial consumer through emotive brand content: music, movies, heritage, storytelling. And we understand how critical it is. More people visit our platform every week than walk into all our stores combined. And the majority of our employees at corporate headquarters in London are under 30. They understand who we are trying to reach.
Now every major new initiative has the trench coat front and center. In 2009 it was the inspiration for our first social media platform, artofthetrench.com. Celebrating the iconic trench and the people who wear it, the site has had more than 2.5 million visitors to date. Last year, when we took our first step into customization, it was never in question that we would launch with the iconic trench. Burberry Bespoke went live on burberry.com offering some 12 million possible styles, and we are now introducing it in our physical stores in London and Chicago. And as we take direct control of our fragrance and beauty business next year, we will fully leverage the trench—as we did so successfully in the launch of Burberry Body perfume. 
Rewards of the Transformation
In a way, we’re right back to our roots. I always remind employees that we didn’t found the company, Thomas Burberry did—at the age of 21. He was young. He was innovative. We say that his spirit lives on, and that it’s this generation’s job to keep his legacy going.
The company transformation paid off. Today 60% of our business is apparel, and outerwear makes up more than half of that. At the end of fiscal 2012, Burberry’s revenues and operating income had doubled over the previous five years, to $3 billion and $600 million, respectively.
That’s not to say it has all been smooth sailing. Getting Burberry back on track took years of hard work, and we’re still navigating tricky waters in a cyclical global luxury market. In September 2012 we took the unusual step of issuing a sales update ahead of our quarterly earnings report: We were seeing a slowdown in traffic globally. A few weeks later, with better insight into the numbers, we were able to report that although traffic was down, the quality of our sales was actually improving: We were realizing higher transaction values, better conversion rates, and greater demand for our more elevated Prorsum and London lines. So although the aspirational customers at entry price points are behaving more cautiously, the brand is resonating ever more strongly with our core luxury audience.







We’ve always said we’re not immune to the ebb and flow of the macroeconomy, but that doesn’t change our vision. We have absolute clarity about—and commitment to—our proven strategies, which gives us confidence for the long term. That’s how we run our business and how a great global brand is created. In 2011 Burberry was named the fourth fastest-growing brand globally by both Interbrand (behind Apple, Google, and Amazon) and WPP/BrandZ (behind Facebook, Baidu, and Wells Fargo). In 2012 it was the fastest-growing luxury brand on Interbrand’s index. That’s beyond what we imagined was possible back in that strategy meeting in 2006.
Today it’s taken for granted inside the company that the trench coat must remain our most exciting, most iconic product. It guides all our decisions. Our sales associates understand it. This product is who we are. That is evident when I observe what our employees wear to work. If you ask a Burberry senior executive how many trench coats he or she owns, the answer is likely to be eight or nine. Everyone has a packable version. Everyone has a white one. Everyone has an evening one. We have all different lengths. 
As for me, I don’t have an exact count, but I can safely confess to owning a dozen. They’re not just raincoats anymore. They are the foundation of a great brand and a great company.

She was the CEO of Burberry from 2006 to 2014.[4] Ahrendts left Burberry to join Apple in 2014.[5] Ahrendts was ranked 25th in Forbes' 2015 list of the most powerful women in the world,[6] 9th most powerful woman in the U.K. in the BBC Radio 4 Woman’s Hour 100 Power List,[7] and 29th in Fortune’s 2014 list of the world's most powerful women in business.[8] She was also a member of the UK's Prime Minister's business advisory council until it was disbanded in 2016.[9][10]

Early life[edit]
Ahrendts was born and raised in New Palestine, Indiana, the third of six children.[2] Her father, Richard Ahrendts, was a businessman, and her mother, Jean, was a homemaker.[11]
She attended New Palestine High School, where she was a varsity cheerleader.[11] In 1982, She earned an undergraduate degree in Merchandising and Marketing from Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana. In 2010, she received an honorary doctorate of Humane Letters from Ball State.[12]
Career[edit]
Ahrendts moved to New York City to work in the fashion industry.[2] After a series of positions including merchandising at bra maker Warnaco,[2] Ahrendts joined Donna Karan International in 1989, working to develop the luxury brand internationally through both wholesale and licensing.[13] In 1996 she was hired at Henri Bendel by Leslie Wexner to expand Bendel stores to 50 new markets, but the project was cancelled by the board of directors two years later.[2]
In 1998, she joined Fifth & Pacific Companies as Vice President of Corporate Merchandising and Design. In 2001, she was promoted to Senior Vice President Corporate Merchandising and Group President, responsible for the merchandising of the group's 20 plus brands including Laundry by Shelli Segal, Lucky Brand Dungarees and the men's retail business of Liz Claiborne Inc. In 2002, she was promoted again to serve as Executive Vice President, with full responsibility for the complete line of Liz Claiborne products, services and development across both women's and men's lines.[13]
Burberry[edit]
Ahrendts joined Burberry in January 2006, and took up the position of CEO on July 1, 2006 replacing Rose Marie Bravo. Ahrendts mitigated the brand's decline in prestige by immediately limiting the number of clothing and accessories carrying the Burberry check pattern to 10%, minimizing the damage ubiquitous counterfeits had caused to sales. She also oversaw the buying out of the Spanish franchise which was then generating 20% of group revenues to stop its unfettered licensing.[2] Ahrendts says she did not model her approach after any other fashion house, but looked to world-class design as an influence, including Apple Inc..[2] The company value rose during her tenure from £2 billion to over £7 billion.[2] CNN Money reported that during 2012, she was the highest paid CEO in the UK, making $26.3 million.[14]
Apple[edit]
On October 15, 2013, it was announced that Ahrendts would leave Burberry in Spring 2014 to join Apple Inc. as a member of its executive team as Senior Vice President of Retail and Online Stores, filling the spot vacated by John Browett in October 2012. On May 1, 2014, Apple's new SVP of Retail and Online Stores Angela Ahrendts was placed on the Apple Leadership roster, signaling her official entry into the company.[15][16]
According to Apple's 2015 Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,[17] Ahrendts earned over $70 million in 2014, more than any other executive at Apple, including CEO Tim Cook. As of August 2016, she is reported to own approximately US$11 million worth of Apple shares.[18] She is the only female senior executive at Apple.[19]

Personal life[edit]
Ahrendts met her husband Gregg Couch in elementary school. They married in their 30s after a 17-year long-distance relationship. The couple has three children.[30] When Ahrendts was working at Burberry, the family lived in a 12,000 square feet (1,100 m2) home on an 8 acres (3.2 ha) plot west of London.[2] Brought up a Methodist, she is still an active Christian.[2]

Angela Jean Ahrendts, DBE (born June 7, 1960)[3] is an American businesswoman and the senior vice president of retail at Apple Inc. She was the CEO of Burberry from 2006 to 2014.[4] Ahrendts left Burberry to join Apple in 2014.[5] Ahrendts was ranked 25th in Forbes' 2015 list of the most powerful women in the world,[6] 9th most powerful woman in the U.K. in the BBC Radio 4 Woman’s Hour 100 Power List,[7] and 29th in Fortune’s 2014 list of the world's most powerful women in business.[8] She was also a member of the UK's Prime Minister's business advisory council until it was disbanded in 2016.[9][10]

Early life[edit]
Ahrendts was born and raised in New Palestine, Indiana, the third of six children.[2] Her father, Richard Ahrendts, was a businessman, and her mother, Jean, was a homemaker.[11]
She attended New Palestine High School, where she was a varsity cheerleader.[11] In 1982, She earned an undergraduate degree in Merchandising and Marketing from Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana. In 2010, she received an honorary doctorate of Humane Letters from Ball State.[12]
Career[edit]
Ahrendts moved to New York City to work in the fashion industry.[2] After a series of positions including merchandising at bra maker Warnaco,[2] Ahrendts joined Donna Karan International in 1989, working to develop the luxury brand internationally through both wholesale and licensing.[13] In 1996 she was hired at Henri Bendel by Leslie Wexner to expand Bendel stores to 50 new markets, but the project was cancelled by the board of directors two years later.[2]
In 1998, she joined Fifth & Pacific Companies as Vice President of Corporate Merchandising and Design. In 2001, she was promoted to Senior Vice President Corporate Merchandising and Group President, responsible for the merchandising of the group's 20 plus brands including Laundry by Shelli Segal, Lucky Brand Dungarees and the men's retail business of Liz Claiborne Inc. In 2002, she was promoted again to serve as Executive Vice President, with full responsibility for the complete line of Liz Claiborne products, services and development across both women's and men's lines.[13]
Burberry[edit]
Ahrendts joined Burberry in January 2006, and took up the position of CEO on July 1, 2006 replacing Rose Marie Bravo. Ahrendts mitigated the brand's decline in prestige by immediately limiting the number of clothing and accessories carrying the Burberry check pattern to 10%, minimizing the damage ubiquitous counterfeits had caused to sales. She also oversaw the buying out of the Spanish franchise which was then generating 20% of group revenues to stop its unfettered licensing.[2] Ahrendts says she did not model her approach after any other fashion house, but looked to world-class design as an influence, including Apple Inc..[2] The company value rose during her tenure from £2 billion to over £7 billion.[2] CNN Money reported that during 2012, she was the highest paid CEO in the UK, making $26.3 million.[14]
Apple[edit]
On October 15, 2013, it was announced that Ahrendts would leave Burberry in Spring 2014 to join Apple Inc. as a member of its executive team as Senior Vice President of Retail and Online Stores, filling the spot vacated by John Browett in October 2012. On May 1, 2014, Apple's new SVP of Retail and Online Stores Angela Ahrendts was placed on the Apple Leadership roster, signaling her official entry into the company.[15][16]
According to Apple's 2015 Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,[17] Ahrendts earned over $70 million in 2014, more than any other executive at Apple, including CEO Tim Cook. As of August 2016, she is reported to own approximately US$11 million worth of Apple shares.[18] She is the only female senior executive at Apple.[19]

Personal life[edit]
Ahrendts met her husband Gregg Couch in elementary school. They married in their 30s after a 17-year long-distance relationship. The couple has three children.[30] When Ahrendts was working at Burberry, the family lived in a 12,000 square feet (1,100 m2) home on an 8 acres (3.2 ha) plot west of London.[2] Brought up a Methodist, she is still an active Christian.[2]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/type.object.type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
