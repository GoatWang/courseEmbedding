Life and career[edit]
Education[edit]
Arnheim earned his BS in chemical engineering degree from the University of Pittsburgh in 1966[2] and an MBA in operations research and finance from Columbia University in 1968.[3]
Oil executive[edit]
For more than three decades, he was employed by Mobil Oil joining the company in 1968 in operations research. He retired as treasurer of the company following the merger with ExxonMobil in 1999. Over the course of his 31 years with the company, he served in multiple positions and locations, including assistant treasurer for Europe and Africa, based in London, and vice president for economics and planning, based in Mobil's US headquarters.
The Washington Opera[edit]
After leaving Mobil, Arnheim joined the Washington Opera as executive director in January 2000, which he led for two and a half years,[4] working closely with artistic director Plácido Domingo and overseeing a period of rapid growth and expansion for the company.[5] A long-time opera afficiando, he previously served as Mobil's representative on the board of the Washington Opera from 1996-1999. The move to opera management was an opportunity to bring his business acumen to support the nonprofit world. While serving as Executive Director, Arnheim lead a $2 million renovation and relocation of the Washington Opera's costume and rehearsal studio to Takoma Park [6]
Other positions[edit]
Over the course of his career he has served on the board of multiple companies, including Compaq and Spinnaker Oil Company, until it was acquired by Norsk Hydro. He taught as an associate professor at Hofstra University Business School and has been recognized as a distinguished alumni by the University of Pittsburgh.[7]
Recent activities[edit]
He is currently President of Mozaik Investments,[8] a private equity firm. He also serves on the board of Magellan Midstream Partners,[9] a publicly listed petroleum logistics company with the longest system of refined petroleum product pipelines in the US, and Opera Lafayette, a DC-based opera company.[10]
As a recognized expert in renewable energy, he has advised the government of Serbia on how to develop the biomass market as part of a program funded by USAID. He believes that there is significant potential in the sector, especially the conversion from woodwaste to pellets.[11]
He has a doppelganger in the form of a picture of a tailor sitting at a sewing machine, a commonly used decal among dry cleaners in the US. Arnheim did not serve as its model.[12]
Personal interests[edit]
In addition to Arnheim's passion for opera, which is focused on German operas, including those by Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss,[13] he has an interest in ice hockey and played amateur hockey for a period.[14] A member of Beth El Synagogue, he served as president of the congregation from 2005 to 2007.

Life and career[edit]
Education[edit]
Arnheim earned his BS in chemical engineering degree from the University of Pittsburgh in 1966[2] and an MBA in operations research and finance from Columbia University in 1968.[3]
Oil executive[edit]
For more than three decades, he was employed by Mobil Oil joining the company in 1968 in operations research. He retired as treasurer of the company following the merger with ExxonMobil in 1999. Over the course of his 31 years with the company, he served in multiple positions and locations, including assistant treasurer for Europe and Africa, based in London, and vice president for economics and planning, based in Mobil's US headquarters.
The Washington Opera[edit]
After leaving Mobil, Arnheim joined the Washington Opera as executive director in January 2000, which he led for two and a half years,[4] working closely with artistic director Plácido Domingo and overseeing a period of rapid growth and expansion for the company.[5] A long-time opera afficiando, he previously served as Mobil's representative on the board of the Washington Opera from 1996-1999. The move to opera management was an opportunity to bring his business acumen to support the nonprofit world. While serving as Executive Director, Arnheim lead a $2 million renovation and relocation of the Washington Opera's costume and rehearsal studio to Takoma Park [6]
Other positions[edit]
Over the course of his career he has served on the board of multiple companies, including Compaq and Spinnaker Oil Company, until it was acquired by Norsk Hydro. He taught as an associate professor at Hofstra University Business School and has been recognized as a distinguished alumni by the University of Pittsburgh.[7]
Recent activities[edit]
He is currently President of Mozaik Investments,[8] a private equity firm. He also serves on the board of Magellan Midstream Partners,[9] a publicly listed petroleum logistics company with the longest system of refined petroleum product pipelines in the US, and Opera Lafayette, a DC-based opera company.[10]
As a recognized expert in renewable energy, he has advised the government of Serbia on how to develop the biomass market as part of a program funded by USAID. He believes that there is significant potential in the sector, especially the conversion from woodwaste to pellets.[11]
He has a doppelganger in the form of a picture of a tailor sitting at a sewing machine, a commonly used decal among dry cleaners in the US. Arnheim did not serve as its model.[12]
Personal interests[edit]
In addition to Arnheim's passion for opera, which is focused on German operas, including those by Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss,[13] he has an interest in ice hockey and played amateur hockey for a period.[14] A member of Beth El Synagogue, he served as president of the congregation from 2005 to 2007.

The move to opera management was an opportunity to bring his business acumen to support the nonprofit world. While serving as Executive Director, Arnheim lead a $2 million renovation and relocation of the Washington Opera's costume and rehearsal studio to Takoma Park [6]
Other positions[edit]
Over the course of his career he has served on the board of multiple companies, including Compaq and Spinnaker Oil Company, until it was acquired by Norsk Hydro. He taught as an associate professor at Hofstra University Business School and has been recognized as a distinguished alumni by the University of Pittsburgh.[7]
Recent activities[edit]
He is currently President of Mozaik Investments,[8] a private equity firm. He also serves on the board of Magellan Midstream Partners,[9] a publicly listed petroleum logistics company with the longest system of refined petroleum product pipelines in the US, and Opera Lafayette, a DC-based opera company.[10]
As a recognized expert in renewable energy, he has advised the government of Serbia on how to develop the biomass market as part of a program funded by USAID. He believes that there is significant potential in the sector, especially the conversion from woodwaste to pellets.[11]
He has a doppelganger in the form of a picture of a tailor sitting at a sewing machine, a commonly used decal among dry cleaners in the US. Arnheim did not serve as its model.[12]
Personal interests[edit]
In addition to Arnheim's passion for opera, which is focused on German operas, including those by Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss,[13] he has an interest in ice hockey and played amateur hockey for a period.[14] A member of Beth El Synagogue, he served as president of the congregation from 2005 to 2007. [15]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
