James Lynn Johnson's Experience
Title: Lead Electronics Technician
               Company: Power Control Services
Job Details
               Power Control Services Incorporated makes reasonable economic efforts to test equipment as fully as possible. This testing is rarely a full operational test exercising every function of the equipment. Our testing primarily consists of static tests on a component level with minimal dynamic testing on a board level. We make reasonable efforts to repair all faults found, but in no way can we fully operationally test all equipment we repair. We rely on the customer to provide us with a detailed fault description or we are forced to make a best guess as to the problems with the equipment. We will attempt the repair of almost any item in lieu of returning the item un-repaired to the customer. In the uncommon event that an item does not work according to the customer specifications we offer the following warranty on the item. At our discretion any repair may be sent to another repair facility to be repaired.

An Athens man is accused of beating his girlfriend and her 2-year-old daughter so badly that the child suffered a fractured skull and broken arm and her mother's eyes were nearly swollen shut. 
James Lynn Johnson (Athens Police Department) 
James Lynn Johnson, 28, is charged with two counts of first-degree kidnapping, one count of torture/willful abuse of a child, domestic violence by strangulation and two counts of second-degree domestic violence, according to the News-Courier. He is being held in the Limestone County jail.
"The child in this case has a possible skull fracture, a broken arm and multiple bruises on her face and body," Athens Police Chief Floyd Johnson told the newspaper. "The mother has multiple bruises all over her body, cuts and puncture marks."
The 21-year-old woman and the child were discovered Tuesday after Johnson allegedly forced them to hide in a shed. The little girl was flown to Huntsville Hospital for treatment. 
The adult victim is being treated at Athens-Limestone Hospital. 
Police say that Johnson went to the woman's home on Sunday and accused her of cheating on him. He allegedly beat her with his hands, Johnson beat her with his hands, a wrench, a screwdriver and a necklace before forcing her to take Xanax.
The woman said she did not know what Johnson had done to her daughter, but that she could hear the child screaming from the next room. The little girl was allegedly forced into a closet.
It was Tuesday when Johnson forced the pair into a shed on North Houston Street, telling the woman he'd kill the girl if they left it, the News-Courier reported. After he left, she ran for help at a nearby home.
