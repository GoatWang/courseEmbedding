Top Ships's stock plunges below $1 mark after 1-for-15 reverse split is enacted
Shares of Top Ships Inc.  plummeted 60% in morning trade Friday, to below the $1 mark, even after the company enacted a 1-for-15 reverse stock split. After the tanker ship operator's stock closed Thursday at a pre-split price of 16 cents after company announced that it was enacting a reverse 1-for-15 split effective Friday, which increases the price to $2.40. The reverse split comes just six weeks after the company enacted a 1-for-20 reverse split, meaning the company has engineered an increase in its stock price by a factor of 300 in less than two months. The stock has plunged 99.9% year to date. The company had enacted a 1-for-10 reverse split in February 2016, a 1-for-7 reverse split in April 2014 and a 1-for-10 reverse split in June 2011. On Thursday, fellow tanker operator DryShips Inc. enacted a 1-for-5 reverse split.

DryShips's stock plunges after reverse stock split announced
Shares of DryShips Inc.  plunged 18% in premarket trade Monday, after the ocean-going cargo vessel company said it will effect a 1-for-5 reverse stock split.

When stocks rose after last year’s election, DryShips left the market far behind, with its shares rallying 1,500% for no apparent reason. The rally quickly unwound, but the run-up appears to have made possible a flurry of financial maneuvers that may earn the company’s founder a huge windfall.

Top Ships's stock plunges below $1 mark after 1-for-15 reverse split is enacted
Shares of Top Ships Inc.  plummeted 60% in morning trade Friday, to below the $1 mark, even after the company enacted a 1-for-15 reverse stock split. After the tanker ship operator's stock closed Thursday at a pre-split price of 16 cents after company announced that it was enacting a reverse 1-for-15 split effective Friday, which increases the price to $2.40. The reverse split comes just six weeks after the company enacted a 1-for-20 reverse split, meaning the company has engineered an increase in its stock price by a factor of 300 in less than two months. The stock has plunged 99.9% year to date. The company had enacted a 1-for-10 reverse split in February 2016, a 1-for-7 reverse split in April 2014 and a 1-for-10 reverse split in June 2011. On Thursday, fellow tanker operator DryShips Inc. enacted a 1-for-5 reverse split.

DryShips' stock extends plunge after reverse stock split takes effect
Shares of DryShips Inc.  changed hands at $3.74 in premarket trade as the reverse stock split took effect, tumbling 12% from the split-adjusted close of $4.25. The stock had closed at 85 cents on Thursday, before the 1-for-5 reverse split took effect. The stock had plunged 51% the past three sessions, after ocean-going cargo vessel company announced the reverse split ahead of Monday's open. That stock had already lost 99.9% of its value year to date through Wednesday, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.8%.

DryShips's stock plunges after reverse stock split announced
Shares of DryShips Inc.  plunged 18% in premarket trade Monday, after the ocean-going cargo vessel company said it will effect a 1-for-5 reverse stock split. The stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on the Nasdaq Capital Market on June 22, under the current ticker symbol of "DRYS." The reverse stock split will reduce the number of shares outstanding to 4.8 million shares from 24.1 million share. Reverse stock splits are often effected to increase the stock price, which may be in danger of falling below thresholds required for continued listing, or to attract certain investors. DryShips's stock closed at a record low of $1.70 on June 15, and has has closed below $5, a key level for some institutional investors, since May 15. It has plummeted 99.8% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.7%.

Men's ClothingGuys, it’s time to update your wardrobe. Luckily for you, we’ve got all the staples and on-trend pieces your closet needs. Explore men’s clothing (including big & tall sizes), plus shoes and accessories to create outfits tailored for every occasion. And if you’re interested in a few helpful styling tips, then check out our Men’s Guide to Style. Don’t worry, you can thank us later.
First, let’s keep it casual. The keys to a great laid-back wardrobe are to pick pieces that fit well, are comfortable and are versatile. T-shirts and tees are a great place to start. Plain tees are simple and can be worn with anything. Bonus? They can double as undershirts in a pinch. Graphic tees are an easy way to show off your personality. Go with versions that showcase your interests, rep your favorite sports team or just look cool. Finish your chill shirt collection with a few polos—they’re a more polished option and can easily be dressed down or up.
Now that you’ve got your list of classic casual shirts, it’s time to focus on refreshing your collection of shorts and pants. From cargos and chinos to denim, we’ve got you covered. When it comes to jeans, especially, grab a few pairs in various washes—think light, medium and dark. Feeling adventurous? Colored denim provides a fresh update to your look. From skinny and slim fit to bootcut and relaxed, fit matters and you should always pick pairs that suit your frame and that you feel good in.
Let’s move on to pieces you’ll need to dress to impress. Look pulled together with suits, dress shirts, undershirts and men’s dress shoes. Take the opportunity to mix and match with sport coats and blazers. Pair them with dress pants or jeans for a modern feel (but only if if the dress code is more lenient). Whether you’re headed to the office, a wedding or special event, your stylish clothes will speak for themselves. Don’t forget accessories. Grab a wallet, cuff links, ties, belts and more to round out your look.
Whether you’re dressed up or down, you’ll need to layer up when it’s cold outside. Our collection of jacket, coats and vest will keep you warm. Throw on cozy sweaters and sweatshirts into your look, and for even more warmth, stock up on hats, scarves and gloves. Stick with Timberland boots and thicker fabrics that help trap heat—think wool, leather, cotton and more.
Oh, and we can’t forget workout clothes. Whether you live at the gym or are just getting back into an exercise routine, you’re going to need a solid collection of activewear. And on rest days (and every evening), pajamas and loungewear will come in handy. We’re here to help you look great every hour of the day. Find helpful styling tops and tricks with Macy’s Men’s Guide to Style.
Who’s ready for a wardrobe refresh? Shop men’s clothing, shoes, accessories and more at Macy’s.Looking for huge savings? Shop our Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Holiday Gift Guide!
