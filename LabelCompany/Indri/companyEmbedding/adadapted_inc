Discussed briefly in the last article, millennials are over half of the users using shopping list apps since 2013. In the article, Path to Purchase Institute points out that these mothers are looking for new ways to feed their families and be cost conscious. They are looking online for new recipes and the best deals for their dollar.
Millennial moms are heavily influenced through social media and the internet. Over 7% of millennial moms are strongly influenced by smartphone/apps compared to Generation X moms. This proves that millennials are a great demographic to target because they have such a huge influence on the digital world.

Basic AdAdapted Demo

This is basic demo of how AdAdapted’s dynamic ad serving technology works. Instead of building an advertiser’s assets into the game, we used our SDK to create dynamic properties. Every time the game refreshes, our ad server sends ads that are automatically manipulated to fit the size required for the specific placement. We can also report on when each ad is served, how long it is on screen, etc. 
This is definitely a very basic application of our technology- but it’s not hard to imagine how the same mechanisms could be used to change out billboards in street racing games, backgrounds in puzzle games, and sponsorship announcements.

Current Status

                                Unlike websites, “get stuff done” apps are narrowly focused, deeply personal, and built around specific functionality/user interaction. To engage app users, a brand’s message must be contextually relevant, personalized, and leverage app utility, i,e., ads must be customized both in form and function. AdAdapted provides this customization at scale.

High performance native advertising platform for mobile apps that drive path to purchase


Specializing in context-relevant ads that drive recall, engagement, and purchase intent


Add-It: Industry’s only ad solution that helps consumers build mobile grocery lists which drive in-store conversions 



The Importance of the List:


38% of Millennials and 26% of Gen-Xers build their shopping lists on their phone (Supermarket News)

98% of Millennials say they buy all or most of the items on their shopping list (Santy Research)

How it Works

 Team







Molly McFarland | Founder









Michael Pedersen | Founder







Business model

AdAdapted has two methods of revenue:

Cost per List Add – Brands pay only when a user adds an item to a list.
Impressions – Brands pay every time an ad is shown to a user

Once a brand has chosen a path, we target users in a variety of channels, from social, to in-app, and mobile web.  For publishers, we pay them for any media run within their apps, as well as co-branded media ads that drive app awareness, engagement, and downloads.

Competitive advantage

AdAdapted has been working with independent shopping lists since 2014.  Since then, we've been tracking people's digital shopping list and have learned when people are building their lists, what they're adding, and when they go shop.  We have also have been running ads that lead users to add items directly to their digital shopping lists since early 2015.  We have a set of 6MM unique users in the US, that we are able to re-target within the mobile ecosystem.  Finally, we've been working with the major CPG brands, such as P&G, Nestle, and Chobani.

Better late than never.
AdAdapted Inc., an Ann Arbor firm that helps companies build ads designed for mobile devices, has finished raising its seed-stage round of funding of $725,000.
The company was expected to announce the news on July 7 — many months after it originally planned to finish raising capital.
Last September, the company was halfway to its original target of $600,000, and founders CMO Molly McFarland and CEO Mike Pedersen believed they were on track to receive $250,000 from the Michigan Pre-Seed Capital Fund.
Instead, the Michigan Economic Development Corp. stopped funding the program.
"People told us, don't count on anything 'til you get it, but the truth is, we were counting on that money," said McFarland.
It was back to fundraising for AdAdapted.
Veteran angel investor and consultant Terry Cross made a personal investment in the company and helped bring in more money from his range of contacts.
What helped, too, was that the market for what AdAdapted was trying to do had quickly heated up. The company builds what's known in the industry as "native ads," which is advertising that is integrated with other content and sometimes appears as content itself.
Native ads create more click-throughs and less frustration on mobile devices than drop-down and banner ads, which are meant for larger screens. AdAdapted's customers are companies with mobile apps.
While AdAdapted worked to raise money, "native" had become a hot topic in the mobile ad industry and was attracting the attention of investors.
McFarland and Pedersen founded AdAdapted in 2012. Both left Amplifinity Inc., a fast-growing Ann Arbor company that uses social media websites to help companies build their businesses through customer and employee referrals. She had been a marketing officer and he had been a software developer.
McFarland said Pedersen got the idea for AdAdapted and, with the blessing of Amplifinity founder Dick Beedon, left to form the company.
"People were spending more time on smartphones," she said, "but the ad model was broken. Ads that worked on computers don't work on small screens. Ads only work if they're developed specifically for the platform they'll be seen on. You're more likely to climb Mount Everest than you are to click on a banner ad on your smartphone."
AdAdapted's ads are integrated into content, McFarland said. "So, if you have a grocery list, the ad might appear as a sponsored item on that list. Or, we may use colors, sizing and (type) font to format the ad so it reflects the app's look, feel and content."
What she described as the secret sauce for AdAdapted is that its technology allows clients to create ads automatically but make them look custom-designed. The company has applied for a provisional patent covering that process.
It is a process and patent that McFarland hopes will help AdAdapted carve out a niche in the soon-to-be crowded space of native advertising.
Large competitors include Toronto-based Polar Mobile Group Inc.; Bangalore, India-based InMobi; and San Francisco-based LiquidM Inc.
AdAdapted projects revenue in 2015 of more than $1 million.
"The goal is never to trick the user," McFarland said, "but instead to show users that each advertisement was designed for their favorite apps. And the ad messaging is connected to the app's content, not some generic ad blindly served anywhere."
Ronda Guimond is media director of Ann Arbor-based Enlighten Inc., a digital ad agency that decided to try AdAdapted last year when it was in beta testing.
Enlighten launched a mobile ad campaign for Biore, a line of skin care products.
Biore was trying to reach women ages 15-29, and the best way was with mobile ads. But traditional ads, developed for other digital media, were notoriously bad, Guimond said, annoying to the point that they engendered ill will in consumers and few click-throughs and sales.
Guimond said AdAdapted's ads were "low-cost, efficient and provided enough eyeballs and impressions to show it was well worth the spend."
AdAdapted also did some project work for the Detroit Lions last season, but the team is hiring a new digital director and so any work for the coming season is up on the air.
Scott Brew is president and CEO of Adtegrity Inc., a Grand Rapids-based digital advertising firm that has been around for 15 years, has about 50 employees and does about $20 million in business a year.
Brew said he heard about Ad-Adapted more than a year ago through Carl Erickson after McFarland made a pitch for funding to the Grand Angels, an angel investing group that Erickson is a part of. Erickson is also founder of Atomic Object, a Grand Rapids-based app, website and software developer that has offices in Detroit and Ann Arbor.
Atomic Object's Ann Arbor office has been serving as AdAdapted's temporary headquarters while it raised funding. AdAdapted now will be able to find space of its own, build up its team and heavily market the product.
Erickson told Brew that he ought to meet McFarland and that some synergies might be found between the two companies.
Brew said that he liked what AdAdapted does enough to become an investor himself and that the two companies probably will be "making pitches together to clients looking for broad advertising solutions. It's pretty exciting to be working with them.
"AdAdapted reduces the friction of advertising on mobile platforms. They've created a system that allows advertisers to run flowing ads that aren't disruptive and irritating. Companies can create customized ads based on AdAdapted's platform that make it easy to create a placement without having to go back to their in-house people and taking three weeks to do it."
Other investors include the student-managed Frankel Commercialization Fund at the University of Michigan; the Detroit-based First Step Fund; Grand Rapids-based Start Garden; Michigan Pre-Seed Fund 2.0, and the Grosse Pointe Farms-based Belle Michigan Fund LP, which is advised by Cross and invests in woman-owned technology companies.
AdAdapted also has received $100,000 in loans and $30,000 in grants from Ann Arbor Spark. It has four full-time employees and six part-timers.
Last month, AdAdapted was one of 10 finalists that pitched to AOL co-founder Steve Case in Detroit when he kicked off his Rise of the Rest tour to promote technology startups.
"They've got a good product that has already been validated in the marketplace," Cross said. "Mobile advertising today is something people hate, so native advertising is a big, big opportunity. And they've found a way to provide a platform so there's native advertising you can do yourself.
"But what I really like is they have someone who can market the heck out of it, and that's Molly. She leaves no stone unturned. She understands the industry, and she walks the walk."Tom Henderson: (313) 446-0337, [email protected]. Twitter: @tomhenderson2 
Correction: An earlier version of this story should have identified co-founder Mike Pedersen as the one who had the idea for the Ann Arbor company.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.
