I knew I made a difference and did my job well. Not many has the same skill set I did and there was always work to do.Cons1. It's an old white boys club. I say that as a white individual. It sucks that's how MFN rolls. They say they value diversity but they don't. They will have a token diverse person in an exec role but they're there to be a face, not make any changes or impact.2. They pay really well but that hurts when you leave.3. They layoff the good people and keep the undereducated white males. Why? See #1 above.4. They don't want you if you are female and over 40. Think I'm lying? See the number of females 40+ who got hit in the January "reorganization."5. HR is a joke. Talent acquisition couldn't find their rear ends with both hands and a map. So many excuses on why they didn't do their jobs.6. MFN said the HealthNet employees needed to learn the Centene way and the Centene way would prevail. He lied.7. They never entertained the idea of working from home. At all. Even a 25% WFH option would cut costs and improve morale.Advice to ManagementRead the list of cons and actually take action to make this more than a joke of a company. And think twice before you get rid of the good people.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (66) Centene Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Centene 2017-06-12 16:26 PDT Jul 17, 2017 Helpful (3)"Growth is good,, but not prepared for success"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - General Manager in Austin, TXCurrent Employee - General Manager in Austin, TXDoesn't RecommendNeutral OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Centene full-time (More than 8 years)ProsGood benefits, opportunities for advancement, and diversity .

Centene is very fast paced and rapidly growing. There are fires that need fighting and lots of growing pains, but this brings as much opportunity as challenge. Make yourself useful in the right area and you will go far.- I have been blessed with some incredible leaders, although not all areas of the company seem to be as lucky.- Good benefits, good pay.- Acceptable hours. This may not be true for all of IT, but in my area it's not common to work more than 45 hours a week unless someone just likes to do that.Cons- Changing culture since the Healthnet merger. The values of the company overall have declined in the aftermath.- Some internal teams are very difficult to work with and take up to 6 weeks to respond to very simple requests or inquiries.- Competing direction given from upper management in IT. While some are embracing Agile and even DevOps, others are being pushed to enforce restrictive, regimented processes and things that oppose the very nature of Agile and DevOps.Advice to ManagementDon't give up on the values of Centene that made this a great place to work for many. Empower employees, trust them, equip them, reward them. Free them to accomplish great things and help them push back against some of the unnecessary bureaucracy taking root in IT. Demonstrate servant leadership.

HR seems to be fully invested in kissing the backside of management.I had read reviews on working here prior to accepting the position (which, sadly, I was expected to accept THE DAY IT WAS OFFERED. Because, of course, you are to show respect only to your new boss. They aren't invested in any of the professional relationships you have and therefore don't understand what giving notice even means.) And I was told to run, don't look back, et cetera. And I thought perhaps it was all because of some disgruntled ex-employees who couldn't run amock.Little did I know the reviews were _solid_.You'll only survive in this mess if you're ok with things proverbially blowing up all around you. If you are good at turning the other cheek, you're gonna go far, kid.Advice to ManagementGet out. Replace yourselves with someone worth reporting to and someone who understands what it means to manage.Also, let's not pretend that some of the technology being used is complete trash. Stop using employees as scapegoats for the "numbers" you can't produce. (Or comprehend, for that matter) Despite you're saying otherwise, it IS the system. FIX IT.

ST. LOUIS, June 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Centene Corporation (NYSE:    CNC) today announced that it is expanding its offerings in the 2018 Health Insurance Marketplace, or exchange. The company is planning to enter Kansas, Missouri and Nevada in 2018, and expanding its footprint in six existing markets: Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Ohio, Texas, and Washington.








Last year marked another year of Centene's successful operations on the exchanges. At December 31, 2016, Centene served 537,200 exchange members and grew to 1.2 million members at March 31, 2017. The key demographics of these members including age, gender, financial assistance and metal tier are consistent with Centene's experience over the past three years. Ninety percent are eligible for subsidies. 
"Centene recognizes there is uncertainty of new healthcare legislation, but we are well positioned to continue providing accessible, high quality and culturally-sensitive healthcare services to our members," said Michael F. Neidorff, chairman, president and CEO for Centene. "Centene has demonstrated disciplined execution, agility and capacity to successfully navigate industry changes to the benefit of our members, customers and shareholders."
Centene is committed to working closely with regulators and policymakers to collaborate on the actions that stabilize the market and offer affordable and high quality coverage options. We have started the process for seeking all necessary regulatory approvals in targeted states for 2018. 
About Centene Corporation Centene Corporation, a Fortune 500 company, is a diversified, multi-national healthcare enterprise that provides a portfolio of services to government sponsored healthcare programs, focusing on under-insured and uninsured individuals. Many receive benefits provided under Medicaid, including the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), as well as Aged, Blind or Disabled (ABD), Foster Care and Long Term Care (LTC), in addition to other state-sponsored programs, Medicare (including the Medicare prescription drug benefit commonly known as "Part D"), as well as programs with the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Centene operates local health plans and offers a range of health insurance solutions. It also contracts with other healthcare and commercial organizations to provide specialty services including behavioral health management, care management software, correctional healthcare services, dental benefits management, in-home health services, life and health management, managed vision, pharmacy benefits management, specialty pharmacy and telehealth services. 
Centene uses its investor relations website to publish important information about Centene, including information that may be deemed material to investors. Financial and other information about Centene is routinely posted and is accessible on Centene's investor relations website, http://www.centene.com/investors.
Forward-Looking StatementsThe company and its representatives may from time to time make written and oral forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act ("PSLRA") of 1995, including statements in this and other press releases, in presentations, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), reports to stockholders and in meetings with investors and analysts. In particular, the information provided in this press release may contain certain forward-looking statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and business of Centene and certain plans and objectives of Centene with respect thereto, including but not limited to the expected benefits of the acquisition of Health Net, Inc. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current facts. Without limiting the foregoing, forward-looking statements often use words such as "anticipate", "seek", "target", "expect", "estimate", "intend", "plan", "goal", "believe", "hope", "aim", "continue", "will", "may", "can", "would", "could" or "should" or other words of similar meaning or the negative thereof. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe-harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in PSLRA. A number of factors, variables or events could cause actual plans and results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, Centene's ability to accurately predict and effectively manage health benefits and other operating expenses and reserves; competition; membership and revenue declines or unexpected trends; changes in healthcare practices, new technologies, and advances in medicine; increased health care costs; changes in economic, political or market conditions; changes in federal or state laws or regulations, including changes with respect to government health care programs as well as changes with respect to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act and any regulations enacted thereunder that may result from changing political conditions; rate cuts or other payment reductions or delays by governmental payors and other risks and uncertainties affecting Centene's government businesses; Centene's ability to adequately price products on federally facilitated and state based Health Insurance Marketplaces; tax matters; disasters or major epidemics; the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings; changes in expected contract start dates; provider, state, federal and other contract changes and timing of regulatory approval of contracts; the expiration, suspension or termination of Centene's contracts with federal or state governments (including but not limited to Medicaid, Medicare, and TRICARE); challenges to Centene's contract awards; cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents; the possibility that the expected synergies and value creation from acquired businesses, including, without limitation, the Health Net acquisition, will not be realized, or will not be realized within the expected time period, including, but not limited to, as a result of conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions imposed by regulators in connection with their approval of, or consent to, the acquisition; the exertion of management's time and Centene's resources, and other expenses incurred and business changes required in connection with complying with the undertakings in connection with certain regulatory approvals; disruption from the acquisition making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships; the risk that unexpected costs will be incurred in connection with, among other things, the acquisition and/or the integration; changes in expected closing dates, estimated purchase price and accretion for acquisitions; the risk that acquired businesses will not be integrated successfully; Centene's ability to maintain or achieve improvement in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Star ratings and other quality scores that impact revenue; availability of debt and equity financing, on terms that are favorable to Centene; inflation; foreign currency fluctuations; and risks and uncertainties discussed in the reports that Centene has filed with the SEC. These forward-looking statements reflect Centene's current views with respect to future events and are based on numerous assumptions and assessments made by Centene in light of its experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, business strategies, operating environments, future developments and other factors it believes appropriate. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are subject to change because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. The factors described in the context of such forward-looking statements in this press release could cause Centene's plans with respect to the Health Net acquisition, actual results, performance or achievements, industry results and developments to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Although it is currently believed that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct and persons reading this press release are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date of this press release. Centene does not assume any obligation to update the information contained in this press release (whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise), except as required by applicable law. This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive. We discuss certain of these matters more fully, as well as certain other risk factors that may affect Centene's business operations, financial condition and results of operations, in Centene's filings with the SEC, including the annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.
