Tactical Opportunities
Differentiated Investment Solutions for a Rapidly Evolving Investment Landscape





Overview
Tactical Opportunities (Tac Opps) is an opportunistic investing platform seeking to capitalize on global investment opportunities that are time-sensitive, complex, or in dislocated markets where we believe risk is fundamentally mispriced. 

The Tac Opps’ team invests globally across asset classes, industries and geographies, and can leverage intellectual capital from across Blackstone’s businesses to inform investment due diligence and execution. Our flexible investment mandate enables us to dynamically adjust to changing market conditions and to focus on deep value opportunities that may be overlooked by less nimble market participants.








				A Message from David Blitzer, Senior Managing Director & Head of Tactical Opportunities
			



















Flexible Mandate

Designed to take advantage of a rapidly evolving investment landscape, we serve as a source of differentiated investment opportunities for our investors and an innovative solution provider to sellers.


 
Breadth
Leveraging the strength of the firm’s global platform, our portfolios provide exposure to timely investment themes across asset classes, industries and geographies.



Nimble and Decisive
Identifying and executing on diverse opportunities requires a broad, deep and experienced perspective balanced by the ability to act in a nimble, decisive manner.






Blackstone's leading alternative asset platform yields compelling insights and synergies that inform our investment decisions.







 Tactical Opportunities  In a world where the most attractive investment opportunities are often short-lived and difficult to source, analyze and execute, Tac Opps is positioned to thrive. Tac Opps is one of the world’s leading opportunistic investment platforms with a dedicated team of 60 professionals who marshal the resources and insights of Blackstone to identify and execute differentiated investments on behalf of our investors. As our investments typically fall outside traditional alternative investment categories, we strive to deliver less correlated returns and lower volatility across our portfolio. 
  




 Our Approach    Investment flexibility Tactical Opportunities’ flexible mandate is designed to allow our team to adjust to changing market circumstances, facilitating the creation of a balanced, complementary portfolio with an attractive overall risk/return profile.   Strong governance The Tactical Opportunities Investment Committee is comprised of the firm’s senior leadership to ensure strong firm-wide collaboration, robust investment analysis and a consistent investment approach.   Taking advantage of synergies The Tactical Opportunities team leverages intellectual capital embedded in businesses that cover every major alternative asset. This enables us to assess and synthesize a broad range of market information into actionable investment ideas.   Focus on managing risk With little tolerance for capital loss, our investment process seeks to identify opportunities with asymmetric return profiles often characterized by downside protection.

The Blackstone Group is targeting a total of $7 billion to $8 billion for its second generation Tactical Opportunities fund, according to two people with knowledge of the situation.
Blackstone’s Tactical Opportunities funds are a mix of large separate accounts with big investors and a commingled vehicle for smaller LPs. The second generation TacOpps fund will have about $2 billion to $3 billion in the commingled fund, with the balance in big accounts, one of the people, an LP who has heard the fund pitch, told peHUB.
Blackstone declined to comment.
Tony James, Blackstone’s president, announced in July the Tactical Opportunities team was working on raising a second offering. At the time, he didn’t disclose details about how much the group was targeting.
The first TacOpps fund, which launched in 2012, closed in March on $5.6 billion and included investors such as the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund, the New York State Common Retirement Fund and the New Jersey Division of Investment.
Performance on the first Tactical Opportunities fund is hard to gauge because each large account gets its own marks (also because Blackstone is not commenting, of course). The LP said the first fund was generating a net internal rate of return of around 23 percent. 





“Some early mark-ups are driving the IRR,” the LP said, adding the high performance numbers “might not be sustainable. It’s a super early fund.”
The big accounts have their own performance marks. For example, CalPERS’ $800 million account with Tactical Opportunities was generating a 10.9 percent IRR and a 1.1x multiple as of March 31, 2014, according to CalPERS performance information.
Tactical Opportunities, led by David Blitzer, pursues investments that don’t fit the mandates of Blackstone’s primary business lines. The group invests across all the firm’s asset classes, chasing everything from distressed mortgage loans and property investments in Latin America to shipping opportunities, Blitzer said at a conference earlier this year.
“To have the ability and flexibility to play across the entire spectrum is something that market was missing and we felt Blackstone would be well suited for that kind of flexible fund,” Blitzer said at the conference.
In July, Friends Life Group announced it was selling its wealth management business to Blackstone for up to $577.6 million (356 million pounds), according to Reuters. Blackstone was making the investment through its Tactical Opportunities business, Bloomberg reported at the time.
Blackstone and TPG Capital also announced earlier this month they were buying UK residential mortgage lender Kensington from South African investment bank Investec for about $290 million, with Blackstone making the investment through Tactical Opportunities. 





Blackstone also is in the market raising its next flagship private equity fund, Blackstone Capital Partners VII, which is targeting $16 billion, sources told peHUB this week.
