Captain Richard Chase was highly decorated for his chaplain service during World War II. So remarkable were his experiences that he was featured in articles in Life, Saturday Evening Post and the Christian Herald as well as appearing on a national television program after the war. But, like so many others that served in the war, he rarely spoke of it himself. 
He was constantly praying to understand God’s loving presence protecting and caring for everyone, and we know from the records that he was able to effectively minister to all those around him. Although he writes matter-of-factually about some of his experiences, they actually relate many instances of extraordinary protection and comfort.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.
* Denotes a required field. All required fields must be filled out for us to be able to process your form.
