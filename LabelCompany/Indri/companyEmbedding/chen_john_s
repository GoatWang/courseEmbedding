Early life and education[edit]
A native of Hong Kong, Chen studied at La Salle College in Hong Kong until Form 5,[citation needed] before going to the United States and graduating from Northfield Mount Hermon School, a preparatory school in Northfield, Massachusetts.[citation needed] He went on to graduate from Brown University in 1978 with a B.S., magna cum laude in electrical engineering, and in 1979, with an M.S. in electrical engineering from CalTech.[3]

Chen began his career in 1979 as a design engineer with Unisys, where he eventually served as vice president and general manager of, in turn, the Convergent RISC Platform Division and the Convergent UNIX Systems Group.[citation needed] In 1991 he joined Pyramid Technology Corporation as executive vice president.[citation needed] Chen was elected president, chief operating officer and a director of Pyramid in 1993, serving until 1995.[citation needed]
Chen next joined Siemens Nixdorf as a vice president in 1995.[citation needed] He was promoted to president and chief executive officer of Siemens Nixdorf's Open Enterprise Computing Division in 1996.[citation needed]
Chen became CEO of Sybase in 1998.[4] As John Gallant and Eric Knorr noted in IT World, Sybase had been a strong competitor of Oracle, but had become a "dead company" after failing to enter the market for enterprise applications, as Oracle had; Chen and his team proceeded to reinvent Sybase as an "enabler of the 'unwired enterprise'".[4] In so doing, Chen and his team led a re-invention strategy that moved the mature, slower growth technology company into being a high-growth innovator,[citation needed] valued at US $6B in 2010.[4] This involved improving its balance sheet and returning Sybase to profitability,[citation needed] including by leveraging its existing database knowledge to create new products to address the emerging markets for analytics and mobility.[citation needed] Sybase achieved strong financial performance and shareholder returns under Chen’s leadership, including 55 consecutive quarters of profitability,[citation needed] $2.8 billion of cash generated,[citation needed] and a 28 percent compound annual growth rate of its market capitalization (from a low of $362 million to $5.8 billion through 2010).[citation needed] Sybase was acquired in 2010 by SAP AG.[citation needed]

Chen was appointed executive chairman of the board and interim CEO of BlackBerry Ltd in November 2013,[5] responsible for the company's strategic direction, strategic relationships and organizational goals.[citation needed] He was elected a director of the Walt Disney Company in 2004 and of Wells Fargo & Company in 2006,[citation needed] and as of September 2016 maintains stock holdings in both companies valued in the single-digit millions of dollars.[6][better source needed] He has also served on the board of the CIT Group Inc.,[citation needed] and as a member of the New York Stock Exchange’s listing advisory committee,[citation needed] as well as the boards of several high-tech start-ups, including Beyond.com,[citation needed] Niku Corporation,[citation needed] Wafer Technology,[citation needed] and Turbolinux US.[citation needed]

Early life and education[edit]
A native of Hong Kong, Chen studied at La Salle College in Hong Kong until Form 5,[citation needed] before going to the United States and graduating from Northfield Mount Hermon School, a preparatory school in Northfield, Massachusetts.[citation needed] He went on to graduate from Brown University in 1978 with a B.S., magna cum laude in electrical engineering, and in 1979, with an M.S. in electrical engineering from CalTech.[3]
Career[edit]

This section needs expansion with: revisions that source (and revise-to-source) the original COI-violating content of an earlier Sybase-employed editor (almost all section material), and then a well-sourced, short summary of Chen's career accomplishments since 2010, i.e., since Sybase's acquisition by SAP. You can help by adding to it. (September 2016)

Chen began his career in 1979 as a design engineer with Unisys, where he eventually served as vice president and general manager of, in turn, the Convergent RISC Platform Division and the Convergent UNIX Systems Group.[citation needed] In 1991 he joined Pyramid Technology Corporation as executive vice president.[citation needed] Chen was elected president, chief operating officer and a director of Pyramid in 1993, serving until 1995.[citation needed]
Chen next joined Siemens Nixdorf as a vice president in 1995.[citation needed] He was promoted to president and chief executive officer of Siemens Nixdorf's Open Enterprise Computing Division in 1996.[citation needed]
Chen became CEO of Sybase in 1998.[4] As John Gallant and Eric Knorr noted in IT World, Sybase had been a strong competitor of Oracle, but had become a "dead company" after failing to enter the market for enterprise applications, as Oracle had; Chen and his team proceeded to reinvent Sybase as an "enabler of the 'unwired enterprise'".[4] In so doing, Chen and his team led a re-invention strategy that moved the mature, slower growth technology company into being a high-growth innovator,[citation needed] valued at US $6B in 2010.[4] This involved improving its balance sheet and returning Sybase to profitability,[citation needed] including by leveraging its existing database knowledge to create new products to address the emerging markets for analytics and mobility.[citation needed] Sybase achieved strong financial performance and shareholder returns under Chen’s leadership, including 55 consecutive quarters of profitability,[citation needed] $2.8 billion of cash generated,[citation needed] and a 28 percent compound annual growth rate of its market capitalization (from a low of $362 million to $5.8 billion through 2010).[citation needed] Sybase was acquired in 2010 by SAP AG.[citation needed]
Board and trustee appointments[edit]

Chen was appointed executive chairman of the board and interim CEO of BlackBerry Ltd in November 2013,[5] responsible for the company's strategic direction, strategic relationships and organizational goals.[citation needed] He was elected a director of the Walt Disney Company in 2004 and of Wells Fargo & Company in 2006,[citation needed] and as of September 2016 maintains stock holdings in both companies valued in the single-digit millions of dollars.[6][better source needed] He has also served on the board of the CIT Group Inc.,[citation needed] and as a member of the New York Stock Exchange’s listing advisory committee,[citation needed] as well as the boards of several high-tech start-ups, including Beyond.com,[citation needed] Niku Corporation,[citation needed] Wafer Technology,[citation needed] and Turbolinux US.[citation needed]
International relations[edit]
Chen is actively involved in international relations. U.S. President George W. Bush appointed Chen to serve on the President's Export Council (in 2005),[7] and as co-chair of the Secure Borders and Open Doors Advisory Committee.[when?][8] He has testified before Congress on U.S.-China trade relations.[when?][3]
Additionally, Chen chaired the U.S.-China Policy Advisory Roundtable for the Center for Strategic and International Studies.[when?][9]
He serves as a trustee of the Brookings Institution,[citation needed] and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[citation needed]
Awards[edit]
Chen has been an invited member, since 1997, of the Committee of 100 (C-100) organisation of "Extraordinary Chinese Americans."[10]

Chen was awarded an honorary professorship from Shanghai University,[when?][citation needed] and honorary doctorates from San Jose State University,[when?][citation needed] City University of Hong Kong,[when?][citation needed] and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.[when?][citation needed]
Personal life[edit]





This section needs expansion with: usual content on family life, residence, etc. that are found in Wikipedia personal life sections. You can help by adding to it. (September 2016)


As of 2016, Chen was a trustee of Caltech[13] and of the charitable organisation, The First Tee,[14] and a governor of the San Francisco Symphony.[3][15]

Early life and education[edit]
A native of Hong Kong, Chen studied at La Salle College in Hong Kong until Form 5,[citation needed] before going to the United States and graduating from Northfield Mount Hermon School, a preparatory school in Northfield, Massachusetts.[citation needed] He went on to graduate from Brown University in 1978 with a B.S., magna cum laude in electrical engineering, and in 1979, with an M.S. in electrical engineering from CalTech.[3]

This section needs expansion with: revisions that source (and revise-to-source) the original COI-violating content of an earlier Sybase-employed editor (almost all section material), and then a well-sourced, short summary of Chen's career accomplishments since 2010, i.e., since Sybase's acquisition by SAP. You can help by adding to it. (September 2016)

Chen began his career in 1979 as a design engineer with Unisys, where he eventually served as vice president and general manager of, in turn, the Convergent RISC Platform Division and the Convergent UNIX Systems Group.[citation needed] In 1991 he joined Pyramid Technology Corporation as executive vice president.[citation needed] Chen was elected president, chief operating officer and a director of Pyramid in 1993, serving until 1995.[citation needed]
Chen next joined Siemens Nixdorf as a vice president in 1995.[citation needed] He was promoted to president and chief executive officer of Siemens Nixdorf's Open Enterprise Computing Division in 1996.[citation needed]
Chen became CEO of Sybase in 1998.[4] As John Gallant and Eric Knorr noted in IT World, Sybase had been a strong competitor of Oracle, but had become a "dead company" after failing to enter the market for enterprise applications, as Oracle had; Chen and his team proceeded to reinvent Sybase as an "enabler of the 'unwired enterprise'".[4] In so doing, Chen and his team led a re-invention strategy that moved the mature, slower growth technology company into being a high-growth innovator,[citation needed] valued at US $6B in 2010.[4] This involved improving its balance sheet and returning Sybase to profitability,[citation needed] including by leveraging its existing database knowledge to create new products to address the emerging markets for analytics and mobility.[citation needed] Sybase achieved strong financial performance and shareholder returns under Chen’s leadership, including 55 consecutive quarters of profitability,[citation needed] $2.8 billion of cash generated,[citation needed] and a 28 percent compound annual growth rate of its market capitalization (from a low of $362 million to $5.8 billion through 2010).[citation needed] Sybase was acquired in 2010 by SAP AG.[citation needed]
Board and trustee appointments[edit]

Chen was appointed executive chairman of the board and interim CEO of BlackBerry Ltd in November 2013,[5] responsible for the company's strategic direction, strategic relationships and organizational goals.[citation needed] He was elected a director of the Walt Disney Company in 2004 and of Wells Fargo & Company in 2006,[citation needed] and as of September 2016 maintains stock holdings in both companies valued in the single-digit millions of dollars.[6][better source needed] He has also served on the board of the CIT Group Inc.,[citation needed] and as a member of the New York Stock Exchange’s listing advisory committee,[citation needed] as well as the boards of several high-tech start-ups, including Beyond.com,[citation needed] Niku Corporation,[citation needed] Wafer Technology,[citation needed] and Turbolinux US.[citation needed]
International relations[edit]
Chen is actively involved in international relations. U.S. President George W. Bush appointed Chen to serve on the President's Export Council (in 2005),[7] and as co-chair of the Secure Borders and Open Doors Advisory Committee.[when?][8] He has testified before Congress on U.S.-China trade relations.[when?][3]
Additionally, Chen chaired the U.S.-China Policy Advisory Roundtable for the Center for Strategic and International Studies.[when?][9]
He serves as a trustee of the Brookings Institution,[citation needed] and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[citation needed]
Awards[edit]
Chen has been an invited member, since 1997, of the Committee of 100 (C-100) organisation of "Extraordinary Chinese Americans."[10]
The Brown University School of Engineering awarded Chen its Brown Engineering Alumni Medal (BEAM) in 2003.[11]
In July 2007, Sybase announced that Chen, its CEO, had been awarded the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year for Northern California.[12][better source needed]
Chen has also received awards from the US-Asia Institute (2009),[citation needed] the U.S.-China Policy Foundation,[when?][citation needed] and the California-Asia Business Council (2007).[citation needed] In addition, the U.S.-Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce Education Foundation has recognized Chen for his corporate board work.[when?][citation needed]
Chen was awarded an honorary professorship from Shanghai University,[when?][citation needed] and honorary doctorates from San Jose State University,[when?][citation needed] City University of Hong Kong,[when?][citation needed] and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.[when?][citation needed]
Personal life[edit]





This section needs expansion with: usual content on family life, residence, etc. that are found in Wikipedia personal life sections. You can help by adding to it. (September 2016)


As of 2016, Chen was a trustee of Caltech[13] and of the charitable organisation, The First Tee,[14] and a governor of the San Francisco Symphony.[3][15]

BlackBerry CEO John Chen on his turnaround strategy

BlackBerry's Chen committed to turnaround

          BlackBerry loses $423M in last quarter as revenue plunges       









John Chen has an enviable track record as a turnaround specialist for troubled tech companies. But the 58-year-old Hong Kong native knew he’d really have his work cut out for him when he assumed the role of CEO at BlackBerry, one of Canada’s most iconic tech companies. That was five short months ago.
BlackBerry was in desperate shape at the time, shedding customers and losing billions as more aggressive and nimble smartphone companies helped themselves to a market share that was at one time so solid, it seemed to be a BlackBerry birthright. 
But how to engineer the turnaround? How even to stop the hemorrhaging?
In a wide-ranging and revealing interview with Amanda Lang, host of The Lang & O’Leary Exchange, Chen spelled out the rationale behind his customer-first repair strategy. 
To that end, Chen did a lot of listening to his core customers – the long-neglected business market (what’s often referred to as the enterprise market). He tried to find out what they don’t like and what they do. “If the customer likes it, it’s the right thing to do,” he says — a phrase that amounts to Chen’s turnaround tagline. Discussions like that persuaded him to bring back some much-loved but abandoned features.
“I knew we’d have to stabilize the company and show some level of confidence,” Chen says. “And the only way to do that is to tell your customers that you’re here to stay; we’re very focused on delivering better products, better services, going forward.” 

'If the customer likes it, it’s the right thing to do'
- BlackBerry CEO John Chen

Chen knew his enterprise users were starting to worry.  Not to worry, was Chen’s message back. “We’re here to stay and there’s a future plan of good technology and services.”
But the CEO says his company’s more than 60 million mobile subscribers aren’t being forgotten in the rush.  “I don’t want anybody to think that BlackBerry is walking away from the mass market. But in order to repair the company, especially on the financial side of the equation, I need to focus on the enterprise customer first.”
No sale...at least, not yet 
Some analysts have speculated that Chen’s cleanup, his aggressive cost-cutting, seems designed to pretty up BlackBerry’s balance sheet for a possible sale. Maybe down the road, in "a number of years... ages... decades...", he told Lang, but not now, he insists.
“I have no interest in selling the company,” Chen said. “Not at this point. I think the company has a lot of value. I’m interested in unlocking that value. I think the shareholder will not be as rewarded by selling at this point because our full value hasn’t been realized.“
Just watch us, seems to be Chen’s message to the shareholders, the customers, the competitors, and especially the doubters.
Is it working? Chen thinks the doubters are starting to come around. “People are [saying]...maybe there’s a chance it’ll come back. All I ask for is that, to give us the opportunity to execute.”

By CrackBerry Kevin
Less than 24 hours after being introduced as the new Interim CEO of BlackBerry, John Chen set aside some time to talk with us at CrackBerry so we could get to know him.

He’s got a lot on his plate and a lot has been covered since yesterday’s news broke. So instead of peppering John with questions until one of us tired of the other, we kept it sweet and to the point (and he’s also a busy guy with a lot suddenly heaped onto his plate). So is John Chen the right man to help correct BlackBerry’s wandering course? Let’s find out.

SPHS looking good today, finally.  Peculiar though, as I couldn't find any news to correspond to the jump.  

I've felt for a while that the stock has been unfairly beaten down, so hopefully this is just a repricing.

John Chen: Blackberry’s Future is as a Niche Product


May 19, 2015May 20, 2015

There once was a time when Blackberry (NASDAQ: BBRY) was a global force in the smartphone market. Then along came Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and the countless Android phones that the world’s 1.75 billion smartphone owners use.
People have long thought that Blackberry, with its dramatic fall from grace, was going to be dismantled patent-by-patent and sold off in chunks to its competitors. After all, Blackberry’s market share is almost too small to measure as the company only shipped 1.6 million phones in the last quarter compared to Apple’s 60 million. But under John Chen, the CEO Blackberry’s board appointed in November 2013, the company seems to have another chance at life with Chen repeatedly promising a turnaround and recovery by focusing strictly on enterprise and government customers.
In a recent interview with Business Insider, Chen says that Blackberry will continue pushing along in the smartphone market because its key customers — enterprise and government — demand the security that only Blackberry can provide.
“I can only make iPhone so much more secure, but I can’t make it as secure as a BlackBerry device,” Chen said to Business Insider. “If you look at the US Army, they’re still rolling out all BlackBerry. If I tell them there are no more phones, I lose that account. The question is how do you make phones profitable at the volume those people represent?”
Blackberry’s cash burn isn’t as bad as it once was, but shareholders aren’t going to be infinitely patient with Chen. They will want to see evidence of a turnaround soon. Blackberry’s client base is a guaranteed source of income, but the company will have to do much more than that to enter the turn around stage.
