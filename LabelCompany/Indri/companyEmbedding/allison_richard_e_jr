This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Testimonials

" Allison is clearly knowledgeable on issues of estate planning; but I appreciated most the Aging Care Power of Attorney that I was able to create giving my son an understanding -- and my approval -- regarding what stages of mental capacity he should step in to help me live safely and securely.  My firsthand experience with my own aging family members has revealed just how hard it is for someone to let go of independence, such as driving a car, so I've made that decision myself.  It's in writing and hopefully it will provide my son some ease when those tough decisions come.  Doing this step has helped me to feel more comfortable about my quality of life as I age.  Allison was a huge help."

- Sandy Milliken (SC)



"Very pleased with [all the] help.  Excellent communication skills, fast response to emails and texts.  Could not ask for better!  I am glad to refer friends . . ."

- Dr. Donald L. Lewis, DMD (SC)



"We highly recommend Farina Law Firm, PC, for any of your estate and small business planning needs.  Allison is highly professional and knowledgeable, following through in a timely and organized fashion.  We're happy to know our family is safer with Allison looking after us."

- Drs. Andrea & Charles Kelly (SC)



"The reason I have Allison as my lawyer: she is direct, plain speaking . . . no messing about."

- Camilla (SC)


"My husband and I found Allison through a recommendation from a friend.  We were in need of an attorney to set up a trust and a will.  With three kids and a grandson we had put it off long enough.  Allison was a pleasure to work with.  She is extremely smart, organized and very easy to talk to.  When you decide to take the step to tidy up all the loose ends in your life, it is important to use an attorney in which you feel comfortable  sharing very personal information regarding family and monetary matters.  Its a tedious process and Allison kept us on task and was also very patient.  We would highly recommend her!"

- Mary & Paul Cronin (SC)



"We had a great experience working with Allison. She made the entire process so manageable and her attention to detail was exceptional."

- Peter & Kristen (SC)
	 


"Professional and efficient. You depart as not just a customer, but a friend.
	If everyone is blessed with a highly skilled professional they can trust in the legal, accounting and medical professions life is a helluva lot easier.
	Allison fulfills the legal and we were not left wanting.
	With a lot of professions in the best case what you ask to be done is done.  The difference with Allison is that she does that well, and adds on the options you never thought of and lays them out in simple non-legalese advice, advantages/disadvantages of each and the option she suggests and why.  In fact, she would make a superb management consultant.  However she likes to provide solutions not perpetuate the problem."

 - Matthew Bertino (Management Consultant, NY)
	 


"I came to know Allison several years ago and she continues to identify herself as one of the more impressive individuals I have had the pleasure of meeting.  Allison actively and consistently seeks to expand her base of knowledge and conducts herself in a manner which immediately informs of a firm grounding that guides her personal and professional life.  These traits see her as unique among her peers and should provide meaningful assurance to her clients that any counsel received is the product of a learned professional focused on their unique needs."
	 
- Richard E. Conner, Jr. M.A., J.D., LL.M. 
	 


"From start to finish Allison was thorough, detailed, and organized.  We felt 100% confident in her ability to make sure we planned a comprehensive will and trust and she delivered!  Would highly recommend Allison for any estate planning needs.  She's the best!"

- M & B Ohlson (SC)
	 

"Allison Van Nostrand is an outstanding South Carolina attorney. When we needed someone to help us with our wills and estate planning, we contacted Allison. She listened carefully to our questions and her comments were thoughtful and thorough, and most importantly gave practical legal advice regarding a wide variety of benefit law issues. Allison has all the attributes we had hoped for in a family attorney; knowledge, seasoned experience, professionalism, integrity, strategic thinking, enthusiasm, and responsiveness. We recommend her to all our friends and family." 

-Walter and Barbara Jenner (Daniel Island, SC)



"My mommy is good because she helps everyone."
	 
-Spencer (6 yrs old)
