I had the opportunity to work with Darby for many years. Darby was not only a great nurse, but she truly was a one of a kind person, always upbeat, and always smiling.As a nursing supervisor, Darby was not only a patients advocate, but a nurses advocate as well, which is a rare quality in the profession anymore. Whenever we needed her assistance, she was there in a heartbeat. I am so glad that I had the opportunity to cross paths with Darby, and will always remember her impish grin and hearty laughter. I'd like to send my condolences to her family, I am sure you will miss her dearly. May God bless you and carry you through these difficult times. I leave you with this scripture:"For if we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord. So then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's." Romans 14:8
