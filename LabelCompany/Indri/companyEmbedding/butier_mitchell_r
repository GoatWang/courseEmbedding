NYSE:AVY 







  "Mitch has been a great thought partner in shaping our business model,        and an architect of our value creation strategy" 



GLENDALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Avery Dennison Corporation (NYSE:AVY) today announced that its board of 
      directors has elected Mitchell R. Butier as president and chief 
      operating officer, effective November 1.
    

      Mr. Butier, 43, has been the company’s senior vice president and chief 
      financial officer since June 2010, and will continue to serve as CFO 
      until a successor is named. Dean A. Scarborough continues as chairman 
      and chief executive officer.
    

      “Mitch has been a great thought partner in shaping our business model, 
      and an architect of our value creation strategy,” said Scarborough. “He 
      has worked in both of our core businesses, and played an instrumental 
      role in developing their strategies for profitable growth.”
    

      As COO, Butier will be responsible for the company’s operations, with 
      all business unit leaders reporting to him. Donald A. Nolan, president 
      of the Materials Group, will leave the company after a brief transition 
      period. As a result, Butier will assume direct oversight of the 
      materials businesses as of November 1.
    

      “Mitch is highly respected throughout the organization for his exemplary 
      leadership and ability to make things happen,” said Scarborough. “We’ve 
      worked together for more than a decade, and I look forward to our new 
      partnership in building this great company.”
    

      Butier joined Avery Dennison from PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2000. Prior 
      to being named senior vice president and chief financial officer, he 
      served from 2007 to 2010 as corporate vice president, global finance, 
      and chief accounting officer. Prior to 2007, he held other senior 
      leadership roles across the company. He earned a B.S.A. from Loyola 
      Marymount University.
