Home // About Novelion // Aegerion Pharmaceuticals



Aegerion Pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for patients with debilitating rare diseases.




Marketed Products

Juxtapid®Juxtapid® (lomitapide) capsules is a prescription medicine used along with diet and other lipid-lowering treatments, including low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis where available, in adults with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) to reduce LDL (“bad”) cholesterol, total cholesterol, a protein that carries bad cholesterol in the blood (apolipoprotein B), and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C).
Studies have not been conducted to tell us whether Juxtapid can help prevent problems from high cholesterol, such as heart attack, stroke, death, or other health problems. Studies have also not been conducted to tell us whether Juxtapid is safe for use in people with high cholesterol who do not have HoFH, including those with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH).

Myalept®Myalept (metreleptin) is a leptin replacement therapy used with a doctor-recommended diet to treat problems caused by not having enough leptin (leptin deficiency) in people with generalized lipodystrophy. It is not known if Myalept is safe and effective when used to treat problems (complications) caused by partial lipodystrophy or to treat liver disease, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Myalept should not be used to treat people with HIV-related lipodystrophy or people with metabolic disease, including diabetes mellitus and hypertriglyceridemia, without signs or symptoms of congenital or acquired generalized lipodystrophy.

Important Safety Information
WARNING: RISK OF HEPATOTOXICITY
JUXTAPID can cause elevations in transaminases. In the JUXTAPID clinical trial, 10 (34%) of the 29 patients treated with JUXTAPID had at least one elevation in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥3x upper limit of normal (ULN). There were no concomitant clinically meaningful elevations of total bilirubin, international normalized ratio (INR), or alkaline phosphatase.
JUXTAPID also increases hepatic fat, with or without concomitant increases in transaminases. The median absolute increase in hepatic fat was 6% after both 26 and 78 weeks of treatment, from 1% at baseline, measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Hepatic steatosis associated with JUXTAPID treatment may be a risk factor for progressive liver disease, including steatohepatitis and cirrhosis.
Measure ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin before initiating treatment and then ALT and AST regularly as recommended. During treatment, adjust the dose of JUXTAPID if the ALT or AST are ≥3x ULN. Discontinue JUXTAPID for clinically significant liver toxicity.
Because of the risk of hepatotoxicity, JUXTAPID is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the JUXTAPID REMS PROGRAM. 

Please see additional Important Safety Information for JUXTAPID within the US Full Prescribing Information
 



Important Safety Information
WARNING: RISK OF ANTI-METRELEPTIN ANTIBODIES WITH NEUTRALIZING ACTIVITY AND RISK OF LYMPHOMA
Anti-metreleptin antibodies with neutralizing activity have been identified in patients treated with MYALEPT. The consequences are not well characterized but could include inhibition of endogenous leptin action and/or loss of MYALEPT efficacy. Worsening metabolic control and/or severe infection have been reported. Test for anti-metreleptin antibodies with neutralizing activity in patients with severe infections or loss of efficacy during MYALEPT treatment. Contact Aegerion at 1-866-216-1526 for neutralizing antibody testing. 
T-cell lymphoma has been reported in patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy, both treated and not treated with MYALEPT. Carefully consider the benefits and risks of treatment with MYALEPT in patients with significant hematologic abnormalities and/or acquired generalized lipodystrophy. 
Because of these risks associated with the development of anti-metreleptin antibodies that neutralize endogenous leptin and/or MYALEPT and the risk for lymphoma, MYALEPT is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the MYALEPT REMS PROGRAM

Please see additional Important Safety Information for MYALEPT within the US Full Prescribing Information.
