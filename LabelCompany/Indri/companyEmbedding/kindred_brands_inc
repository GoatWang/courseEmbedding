recommend providing the cabinet maker with the actual sink to be installed.

fabricator/installer when preparing the countertop cut-out. This template has been sized to
reveal approximately 1/4" of the sink rim. Any variance from this standard is certainly
permissible,
fabricator/installer.
6.
The aesthetics of the installed product is of the utmost importance. Please take the necessary
care to ensure that any exposed silicone joints are kept to a minimum, the sink is properly
aligned to the cut-out, and excess silicone is cleaned from the sink.

FARMHOUSE SINKS Installation Options With appropriate planning, Kindred Farmhouse sinks may be installed several different ways. The sink ... the base cabinet unit ... and the countertop ... must be selected with a specific installation in mind.

UNDERMOUNT SINKS Fabricator Template Preparation The masonite template supplied by Kindred has been machined to the exact size and shape of the countertop cut-out, and will reveal approximately 1/4" of the sink rim. We recommend that this masonite template be used to create a female template from 1/2" plywood. Use a router guide bushing and straight cutter bit to trace the masonite template onto 1/2"...


Page 5
UNDERMOUNT SINK INSTALLATION ALTERNATIVE 1 Sink Installation Procedure Clamp the 1/2" plywood female template on the top surface of the countertop, in the desired position. This position will be determined by the relationship of the sink rim to cabinet gables, cabinet supporting members, and deck mounted fittings.


Page 6
UNDERMOUNT SINK INSTALLATION ALTERNATIVE 2 Sink Installation Procedure Kindred provides DXF files for The Designer Series sinks on the Tools for the Trade section of www.kindredcanada.com . This outline of the countertop cut-out is full scale and can be used to program CNC machinery.


Page 7
BACKSPLASH SINKS Installation Options We recommend that Kindred Backsplash sinks be installed as a built-up sink where the rim of the sink is raised above the countertop. Built-up sinks may be installed with up to 1 1/2" of the side of the sink exposed (above the top surface of the countertop).

Page 15
ÉVIERS AVEC DOSSERET Options d’installation Nous recommandons d’installer les éviers avec dosseret comme s’il s’agissait d’éviers surélevés, soit avec le rebord plus haut que la surface du comptoir. On peut installer les éviers surélevés de manière à ce qu’au plus 3,8 cm (1 1/2 po) des côtés soient apparents (au-dessus de la surface du comptoir).


Page 16
ÉVIERS AVEC DOSSERET (suite) Dosseret de 20,3 cm (8 po) Tablier de 22,9 cm (9 po) Les supports Z ne servent pas à soutenir l’évier, mais à maintenir le dosseret contre le mur (l’évier est soutenu par l’armoire). Les trous se trouvent au milieu vertical du dosseret. (Le diamètre des trous et leur position latérale sont déterminés par le client.) LES MODULES ÉVIERS ET LES ÉVIERS AVEC ÉGOUTTOIR Les modules-éviers et les éviers avec égouttoir de Kindred sont renforcés au moyen d’une âme en panneau de particules.
