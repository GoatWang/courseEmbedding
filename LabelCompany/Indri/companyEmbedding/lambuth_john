Welcome from the Vice Provost at UofM Lambuth!
As the Vice Provost, I invite you to visit our historical and residential campus in
                        Jackson, Tennessee. Offering  students the perfect collegiate setting on 57 acres
                        in midtown Jackson, UofM Lambuth is classified as an arboretum and displays year-round
                        beauty. In addition to over 20 undergraduate majors and minors, students can also
                        obtain a variety of master's or doctorate degrees. Living on campus in historic Carney-Johnston
                        Hall or commuting from home, students can find a number of organizations in which
                        to be involved including fraternity or sorority affairs, club sports, intramural activities,
                        or registered student organizations such as Tiger Leadership Institute that offer
                        leadership benefits. It's not uncommon to see students reading or listening to music
                        on the quad or engaged in a Quidditch match, game of croquet, Frisbee, or sand volleyball.
                     
Come be a part of something special at the University of Memphis Lambuth—small classes,
                        first-class education, and meaningful experiences that last a lifetime.
                     
—Dr. Niles Reddick, Vice Provost
Come see what's special about UofM Lambuth - tour it
No one can tell you which college is right for you. It really is something you have
                        to decide for yourself. Part of that process is going to see the campus in person.
                        We hope you will come and see why so many students fall in love with UofM Lambuth.
                        Our students come from all walks of life and are in different stages of their college
                        experience. But they feel right at home here. Campus tours are given at the following

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Lambuth University was a liberal arts university located in Jackson, Tennessee, United States. It was active from 1843 to 2011, and was supported by the Memphis Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church.
Lambuth's athletic teams participated in the NAIA's TranSouth and Mid-South Conferences.
The university began as the Memphis Conference Female Institute in 1843 and was later renamed in honor of Walter Russell Lambuth (1854–1921), a Methodist missionary who traveled globally.
After several years of financial struggles, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools opted not to renew Lambuth's accreditation in 2011. Due to both the financial and accreditation problems, the Board of Trustees voted in April 2011 to cease operations on June 20, 2011.[1] Final commencement exercises were held April 30, 2011.[2]
During the summer of 2011, the University of Memphis acquired the former Lambuth campus and began offering four-year degrees there on August 29, 2011. The campus is now known as the University of Memphis – Lambuth Campus.
