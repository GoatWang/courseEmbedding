Herbert H. Hofmann, II.

Biography Overview
Herb Hofmann was born in Chicago, Illinois, but after a few years, his
family moved to Sarasota County, Florida where he was raised. He
graduated from Pine View High School and then attended New College for a
year when he transferred to Florida State University. In 1989, he
received his Bachelor of Science degrees in Finance and Multinational
Business Operations Cum Laude and then his Juris Doctorate degree in
1991 Cum Laude. As an undergraduate, Mr. Hofmann was elected to the Golden Key
National Honor Society, Beta Gamma Sigma National Business Honor
Society, U.S. Achievement Academy National Award Winner, and All
American Scholar Award Winner. While attending law school, Mr. Hofmann was
elected into Phi Delta Phi International legal honorary society and
served as its Magister. He received the Phi Delta Phi Certificate of
Merit and was a member of Who’s Who Among American Law Students. He
also presided on the student supreme court for Florida State University.
Mr. Hofmann began his legal career working in Sarasota for a private firm
handling personal injury claims. It didn’t take long and he knew that
he wanted to be a trial lawyer. Instead of following the typical private
firm path, he became an Assistant State Attorney for the 12th Judicial
Circuit and prosecuted criminals for two years. Having tried countless
jury and bench trials, Mr. Hofmann was hired by a long standing local firm
where he handled personal injury claims for injured persons and extra
contractual matters defending local establishments against negligence
claims. He had just begun his partnership track when he was invited to
join the Law Firm of Morgan & Morgan in 1999. Today, he is one of
the owners and is the managing partner of Morgan & Morgan’s Sarasota
office. He focuses his practice on wrongful death and severe personal
injuries resulting from vehicle crashes and premises liability.
Since joining Morgan & Morgan, Mr. Hofmann has been a frequent seminar
presenter for effectively prosecuting a personal injury claim both in
house and for plaintiffs’ lawyers from across the country. In 2013, he
was selected for membership in The National Trial Lawyers Top 100 Trial
Lawyers. This organization is noted as being composed of the premier
trial lawyers from across the nation. Less than one percent of all
attorneys are invited to join. In 2014, he was invited and joined the
Southern Trial Lawyers Association comprised of an elite group of
lawyers who are among the most respected by their peers and who are
honored for the work they do to protect the individuals and families
they represent and the profession they uphold. He is also a member of
The Florida Bar, The Sarasota County Bar Association, The Florida
Justice Association, the Manasota Trial Lawyers Board and the American
Association for Justice. He consistently ranks within the firm’s
top-producing personal injury lawyers for the Tampa office and has
represented more than 8,000 clients for Morgan & Morgan.
Mr. Hofmann was recently selected by his peers to join the American Board of
Trial Advocates (ABOTA), a national association of experienced trial
lawyers and judges dedicated to the preservation and promotion of the
civil jury trial and elevating the standards of integrity, honor,
ethics, civility and courtesy in the legal profession. Herb has also
been honored with the prestigious AV® Peer Review Rating by
Martindale-Hubbell, the preeminent national publication in the legal
field. According to Martindale-Hubbell, “An AV rating is a significant
accomplishment - a testament to the fact that a lawyer’s peers rank him
or her at the highest level of professional excellence. A lawyer must be
admitted to the bar for 10 years or more to receive an AV rating. This
rating is based upon evaluations by other lawyers and is the highest
ranking attainable by an attorney for ability and ethics in the practice
of law. It is a distinction reserved for a select few in the legal
community.”
In 2015, Mr. Hofmann was recognized for excellence and achievements by the
legal community when he received the 2015 Top Lawyers of Tampa award.
Another proud accomplishment was being recognized by the American
Institute of Personal Injury Attorneys for his exceptional performance
as one of Florida’s 2015 10 Best Personal Injury Attorneys for Client
Satisfaction. The American Institute of Personal Injury Attorneys is a
third-party attorney rating organization that publishes an annual list
of the Top 10 Personal Injury attorneys in each state. Attorneys who are
selected to the “10 Best” list must pass AIOPIA’s rigorous selection
process, which is based on client and/or peer nominations, thorough
research, and AIOPIA’s independent evaluation. AIOPIA’s annual list
was created to be used as a resource for clients during the attorney
selection process.
One of the most significant aspects of the selection process involves
attorneys’ relationships and reputation among his or her clients. As
clients should be an attorney’s top priority, AIOPIA places the utmost
emphasis on selecting lawyers who have achieved significant success in
the field of Personal Injury law without sacrificing the service and
support they provide. Selection criteria therefore focus on attorneys
who demonstrate the highest standards of Client Satisfaction. Mr. Hofmann works
tirelessly in his fight to help the injured people he serves.
