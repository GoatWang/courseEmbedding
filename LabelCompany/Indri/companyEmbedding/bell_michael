As Seen on Claire (Kristen Bell) in The Boss


  					Her name is Michelle Darnell (Melissa McCarthy) and she’s the wealthiest woman in the world. But when she gets arrested for insider trading, she’s forced to give up her satin leisure suits and coiffed hairdo for an orange jumpsuit. Fast forward 6 months and she’s sleeping on the couch of her former employee, a single mom played by Kristen Bell. When this bourbon drinking power player is set loose in the suburbs, she shakes up the PTA by starting a brownie empire. In the hilarious comedy The Boss, you better watch your assets.  Scroll down to see more clothes, outfits and products identified from The Boss.

Jump to Bottom LineEditor's ReviewComments (41)ArchivedEditor's ReviewMore Comments (41)ArchivedUpdated: 07/18/2017 - Site sponsored by Dietspotlight BurnBy Summer Banks on Jun 15, 201741commentsDiet Reviews / Supplement Manufacturer Reviews / Bell Lifestyle Products Review Bell Lifestyle Products offer a complete line of supplements, but do they work? We spent time examining the ingredients, side effects, and clinical research. Additionally, we read hundreds of user experiences and reviews. Then, we summarized and condensed to give you the info you need.Bell Lifestyle Products Readers: Click here to find out why we're giving away samples of our product, Dietspotlight Burn.What are Bell Lifestyle Products?First off, Bell Lifestyle Products is a full line of supplements, including pain control, urinary health, sexual health, medicinal teas, and more. The ingredients vary by product, but some include bladderwrack, guarana, chromium picolinate and kelp. You take the supplements based on the label directions.Bell Lifestyle Products is the company. It was founded in 1996, and supplements can be purchased online and in mass retailers as a result of relationships with multiple distributors. We like longevity, as well as the convenience of a toll-free customer service number, but read on…Bell Lifestyle Products Ingredients – “Products Don’t Work?”The first thing we noticed is that Bell Lifestyle Products just didn’t work for some. “If people are finding the formulas don’t work, they’re going to move on to something else. They don’t want to waste time and money to end up without results,” said our Research Editor.”The blood sugar supplement didn’t work to help me lower my blood sugar,” said one user.”It did not do a thing for weight or cleansing,” claimed a buyer.Others maintain they work, and well.“They are wonderful and, along with a more careful and better diet have been a tremendous help,” said a dieter.“I have NEVER believed in the efficacy of supplementation, thinking that only prescription drugs work. Bell Lifestyle Products changed my mind,” offered a customer.Scroll below for one of the best products we’ve seen over the last year.Few Customer Reviews – “What’s Up With That?”Our next issue is that though we were able to find a handful of comments for Bell Lifestyle Products, there are several that don’t have any reviews at all. We’re not sure what this really means for the company.”Not great at all, keeps it steady, but does not decrease total cholesterol levels. Does not worth the price IMHO,” said a customer who used a cholesterol lowering product.”Made my skin break out,” offered another who tried an acne formula.There were some people who had good things to say about certain products.“Awesome tea, works great,” said a reviewer of the detox tea.“Does not taste bad at all. I don’t sweeten or anything. I make enough for the week and put it in a container in fridge. Hopefully it will make a difference. It’s guaranteed or money back on tea if no change in kidney function after a couple of months,” claimed another.Our years of research experience have taught us that it only takes a small issue, like lack of customer reviews, to prevent users from giving a product line a try. If Bell Lifestyle Products isn’t in the eye of buyers, how are they supposed to know it’s there?The Science – “Maybe, Maybe Not”There are multiple Belly Lifestyle Products to choose from, but taking the Shape & Health into consideration, there is one ingredient that can help boost energy – guarana. Chromium is also in there, so there could be a reduction in appetite. However, there are common and there are others that work to create a better formula.At DietSpotlight, we want to see science before we can recommend any formula and that’s just not there this time.The Bottom Line – Does Bell Lifestyle Products Work?Should I race out for a bottle of Bell Lifestyle Products? The official website does offer information on the products and you can order online. But, we have reservations about recommending the line. The weight management formula contains some caffeine and chromium and that’s not the strongest combination on the market. Plus, there are reports that it doesn’t work as claimed.If you’re ready to lose weight, we suggest using a supplement that contains clinically tested ingredients. Make sure it’s known to help support your weight-loss efforts. To get even better results, use it with diet and exercise.Among the best products we’ve seen this year is one called Dietspotlight Burn. It is it made with a unique blend of four key ingredients all clinically tested and shown to help boost metabolism and spark fat loss. We couldn’t find negative comments or mentions of harmful side effects. This means users are getting solid results.Plus, if you’re interested, you can get a Special Trial Offer directly from the manufacturer. What a great thing to see.  Previous Bell Lifestyle Products Review (Updated December 4, 2012):What You Should KnowBell Lifestyle Products is a company that manufactures all sorts of health supplements for men and women. These product are sold all over the world through numerous distributors. A convenient store locator apparatus is available on the official website to help you find a distributor near you. A convenient 1-800 number is also provided on the website for those who prefer to place an order over the phone. You can find their products online for Respiratory Health, Muscle and Bones, Sensory Improvement, Digestive Health, Cardiovascular Health and Immune System.
To break it down, Bell Lifestyle Products come in categories like Pain Control, Urinary Health, Preventing Illness, Healthy Sex Life, Medicinal Teas, Women, Sleeping Problems, Constipation, Viruses, Plan to Prevent Cancer, and Weight Control. In the Weight Control category, you will find two products that aim to assist with weight reduction. These are the Ezee Slimming Patch and the Bell Hoodi Burst Gum. While there are no prices posted for these two weight control products, there are plenty of testimonials listed under the Ezee Slimming Patch, as well as a lot of negative comments about diet pills and the overall weight loss supplement market.List of IngredientsNot applicable.Product FeaturesTo focus a little more on the diet side of Bell Lifestyle Products, we can take a closer look at the Ezee Slimming Patch and the Bell Hoodi Burst Gum. While the gum is essentially chewed to suppress hunger throughout the day, the Slimming Patch is placed directly on the skin in order to curb fat and sugar cravings. According to the website for Bell Lifestyle Products, cravings for junk food are one of the key issues with obesity and weight gain today. The two core ingredients used in the patch product are bladderwrack kelp extract and garcinia cambogia. Actual clinical research is not clarified on the website.Advantages There are all sorts of Bell Lifestyle Products available. These products are suitable for both women and men of various ages. A lot of testimonials are posted for the Ezee Slimming Patch.Disadvantages There does not appear to be real clinical research provided to support these the Ezee Slimming Patch. The prices are not posted for these two diet products. There does not appear to be any information presented on the Bell Hoodi Burst Gum. The ingredients found in these diet products may lead to allergic reactions in some users.ConclusionThere is no doubt a lot of Bell Lifestyle Products offered through authorized dealers. However, the official website does not appear to offer a great deal of information on the supplements themselves. There is, however, quite a bit of data provided on other diet pills and how they are harmful. It is a good idea to consult your physician before trying any Bell Lifestyle Products.Learn More About Dietspotlight Burn »About the Author:Summer Banks, a content strategist at Dietspotlight, has researched over 5000 products in the past 10 years.

We believe dieters should know where the product originates and the reputation that follows that business. We searched for expert opinions and government guidance to give you exactly what you deserve to know about supplement manufacturers.     Popular Supplement Manufacturer Articles   Purium Review Isagenix Review Herbalife Review Yoli Better Body System Review Omnitrition Review Biotrust Nutrition Review Blue Star Nutraceuticals Review NuBiotix Review Saba Review IdealShape Review It Works! Review   View All Supplement Manufacturer Articles    What is a Supplement Manufacturer?A supplement manufacturer is the company responsible for making the weight-loss product. This entity may be different from the one that sells you the formula. Many times, the business that markets and sells a diet pill is not the one that formulates or bottles it. Our supplement manufacturer reviews cover this and many other aspects.Finding the Supplement ManufacturerThe United States government does dieters a solid by requiring supplement companies to list the name and address of the manufacturer on the product label. If that information is not listed, that’s a big red flag telling you to skip that one.The Importance of Finding a Trustworthy Supplement ManufacturerThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t review or approve all weight-loss supplements manufactured in the United States or imported from other countries. When a special investigation is performed, there are some reviews that take place, but those are few and far between. There have been many checks that found illegal and/or dangerous ingredients so you need a supplement manufacturer that’s trustworthy. We aim to give you the information you need in our supplement manufacturer reviews.Look for These Things in Your Supplement Manufacturer and SellerIf the company that sells the product is also the supplement manufacturer, things are much easier. You can visit the official website and look for some specific information that can give you an idea of how trustworthy the company is. If it is not produced by the selling company, you may have difficulty finding out detailed information about the business. Note: Our supplement manufacturer reviews offer contact details, so you know who you’re working with.Phone Number/Customer ServiceOn the contact page for the supplement manufacturer, look for a phone number that allows dieters to reach a representative. This means the company is dedicated to keeping the customer happy. Take things one step further by calling that number to see how long you have to wait, the demeanor of the agent and how much they know about the supplement they’re selling.BBB RatingSearch the Better Business Bureau website for a rating on the supplement manufacturer. Think “A” or “B”; anything below that could mean the company has infractions on its record.Clinical ResearchJust as we said before, not all supplement manufacturers are 100% honest with product claims. To weed out the good from the bad, look for clinical research. You should have to go no further than the official website. If the science is there, the company will want to shout about it from the rooftops.Professional WebsiteIt takes money and dedication to create and maintain a professional website. Look for clear, concise information, testimonials, a dedicated contact page and extra information about dieting, weight-loss and overall health. If every word is set on selling you the product, the company may not have your best interest and well-being at heart.Things You Need to Know About Supplement ManufacturersWhen looking closely at the supplement manufacturer, you need to keep a few things in mind so you don’t step into a situation with unrealistic expectations.EffectivenessAccording to an article in the NY Times, “experts say that there is no guarantee that supplements will do what they say they do.” If the claims are unrealistic and seem too good to be true, that’s your brain telling you to leave this one alone.Unrealistic ClaimsAlong the same lines as the NY Times article, the Council for Responsible Nutrition says dieters need to keep expectations realistic. “Dietary supplements can play an important role in good health, but they are meant as supplements to other healthy habits and should be used in combination with other smart lifestyle choices such as trying to eat a healthy diet, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep and seeing a healthcare professional. Dietary supplements are not intended to have the same immediate or dramatic effects that you would expect from taking a drug.”Regulatory ActionsThe FDA is responsible for regulatory actions in regards to diet supplements. This does not mean they test every formula; it only means that they set forth a list of rules the supplement manufacturer must follow. If there are reports of negative side effects, the FDA may look into those and act on the companies accordingly.Safety and the Supplement ManufacturerWhile the FDA requires supplement manufacturers follow some strict rules, the safety of the product is in that hands of that company. The National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements says, “Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, the dietary supplement manufacturer is responsible for ensuring that a dietary supplement is safe before it is marketed.” If it’s any consolation, the FDA is responsible for taking action against any company that sells an unsafe product.The NSF attempts to help the customer find safe supplements by creating a seal of approval associated with testing. “We have developed the only American National Standard for dietary supplements (NSF/ANSI 173) and with NSF certification you can be sure that dietary supplements do not contain unacceptable levels of contaminants.” The U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention offers a similar program. “A supplement successfully meeting our rigorous testing and auditing criteria receives the USP Verified Mark. When you see the Mark, it means the supplement contains the ingredients listed on the label, in the declared strength and amounts; does not contain harmful levels of specified contaminants; is made according to FDA and USP Good Manufacturing Practices, using sanitary and well-controlled processes.”What’s the Last Word on the Supplement Manufacturer?If you think all supplement manufacturers have the safety and well-being of the consumer in mind, you are being a bit naïve. The company is looking to sell a product, first and foremost. But, you can find businesses that want you to succeed with a supplement that is clinically tested and proven to help you achieve realistic results. Look closely at the supplement manufacturer before pulling out that credit card.
