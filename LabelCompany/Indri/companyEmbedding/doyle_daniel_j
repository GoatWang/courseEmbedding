Publication number:  20170147304
                                            

Abstract:  Embodiments of the present invention provide methods, computer program products, and systems for optimizing virtual calls.

Digital signalling receiver for receiving PCM tones



Patent number:  4203008

In the receiver, steering signals are generated in synchronism with the operation of the switching facility to direct the operation of a time shared filter. The filter performs a plurality of filter functions with a series of PCM signals received from the TDM switching facility and generates therefrom series of filter signals relative each of the filter functions.
