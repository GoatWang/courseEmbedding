Publication number:  20170147304
                                            

Abstract:  Embodiments of the present invention provide methods, computer program products, and systems for optimizing virtual calls.

Embodiments of the present invention can determine whether the virtual call associated with the first implementation method and the virtual call associated with the second implementation method produce the same result and, responsive to determining that the virtual call associated with the first implementation method and the virtual call associated with the second implementation method produce the same result, use a result of the virtual call associated with the first implementation method as a result of the virtual call associated with the second implementation method.

Patent number:  4203008

In the receiver, steering signals are generated in synchronism with the operation of the switching facility to direct the operation of a time shared filter. The filter performs a plurality of filter functions with a series of PCM signals received from the TDM switching facility and generates therefrom series of filter signals relative each of the filter functions.
