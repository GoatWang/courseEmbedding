Andrew Anagnost


President and CEO
Board Director







Andrew Anagnost is the President and Chief Executive Officer of Autodesk.
Anagnost’s career spans more than 25 years of product, business, and marketing experience focused on driving strategy, transformation, and product development — and includes positions at Autodesk, Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Company, and EXA Corporation.

Anagnost began his career at Autodesk in 1997 and has held a wide range of roles in the areas of marketing, new business development, product management, and product development. Prior to becoming President and CEO in June 2017, he served as Chief Marketing Officer and SVP of the Business Strategy & Marketing organization. In this role, Andrew served as architect and leader of Autodesk’s business model transition—moving the company to become a software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions provider.  Previously, Anagnost held various executive positions across Autodesk.  Early in his Autodesk career, he led the development of the company’s manufacturing products and grew Autodesk Inventor revenue to over $500 million.
Anagnost is a member of the Autodesk Board of Directors.  He holds a Bachelor of Science Degree in Mechanical Engineering from the California State University, and holds both an MS in Engineering Science and a PhD in Aeronautical Engineering and Computer Science from Stanford University.

    Andrew Anagnost “So Excited to be Autodesk’s Next CEO”; Other Interim Co-CEO Amar Hanspal Departs the Company | 3DPrint.com | The Voice of 3D Printing / Additive Manufacturing                  







 3DPrintBoard.com | Insidebitcoins.com    Twitter     Pinterest     Facebook     LinkedIn     Youtube Videos     RSS           The Voice of 3D Printing / Additive Manufacturing    Select Page       Andrew Anagnost "So Excited to be Autodesk's Next CEO"; Other Interim Co-CEO Amar Hanspal Departs the Company by Sarah Anderson Goehrke | Jun 19, 2017 | 3D Printing, 3D Software, Business |    Share on Tumblr“Our products are the products everyone wants to use,” says new Autodesk President and CEO Andrew Anagnost.Following the announcement of longtime CEO Carl Bass’ resignation back in February, and the Board of Directors’ four-month-long search for the next chief executive, today the company has announced his successor.“The board and I are delighted that Andrew will lead Autodesk into its next stage of growth. Andrew has been instrumental in the development and execution of Autodesk’s successful business model transition, and with his leadership, we are confident that our move to the cloud and subscription will continue to be successful,” said Crawford W. Beveridge, Chairman of the Board of Autodesk.Autodesk President and CEO Andrew AnagnostAndrew Anagnost has been with Autodesk since 1997 and brings more than 25 years of experience in product, business, and marketing to the table. Upon Bass’ resignation in February, Anagnost added to the mantles of the CMO title he had carried since October 2016, and Senior Vice President of Business Strategy and Marketing since January 2012, that of Co-CEO. Today Autodesk announces Anagnost as the President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as joining the Board as a Director.With a background additionally including career positions at Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Company and EXA Corporation, work as an NRC post-doctoral fellow at NASA AMES Research Center, and degrees from California State University (Bachelor of Science, Mechanical Engineering) and Stanford University (Master of Science, Engineering Science; PhD, Aeronautical Engineering and Computer Science), Anagnost brings a broad swathe of experience to the helm of this industry-leading company.“I have worked closely with Andrew over the past 20 years, and I know he will be a great leader for Autodesk. His contributions and dedication to the company, our employees, and customers have been immeasurable. I look forward to working with him from my seat on the board and can’t wait to see where he takes Autodesk in the future,” said former CEO and Board Director Bass of the appointment.Anagnost shares his thoughts directly in a video directed to Autodesk employees, technology users, and partners:Well aware of the existing legacy of innovation at Autodesk — he notes that the company was the first to the cloud and the first to employ a subscription model — Anagnost notes several items that one would want to hear from a big name company’s new executive leader. In addition to already having several ideas for new moves in the works, he explains clearly that he looks forward to receiving and acting upon input from users, all 8,000+ of them, regarding “what you love” along with “what you want to improve,” all for what he sees as a collaborative mission: “Let’s go out and make a better world together.”“For 20 years, I’ve watched Autodesk innovate and grow into the company it is today and I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished together,” Anagnost writes in a letter on the company’s next chapter. “But our success isn’t based on a single product, business strategy, or sales win—it’s a result of the collective efforts of all of you, our diverse and global team. With your passion, ideas, and skills, we are ready to grow in incredible new ways.”Autodesk has been increasingly transparent lately in strategy, as we recently followed the company’s roadmap for its popular Fusion 360 software and saw first-hand the work being done in some projects, such as in aircraft seating, and in collaborations for work bringing additive manufacturing to yachts and propellers. The company has shown that it is keen to respond to realistic feedback, and is embracing its position as a software company, not a hardware endeavor, though it has dabbled in creating its own 3D printer (now discontinued, but with files still available) and continues to work alongside 3D printer manufacturers on some big projects.Autodesk at RAPID + TCT 2017 [Photo: Sarah Goehrke]“Autodesk’s history has been defined by periods of both product innovation and business execution. We began with a clear goal to transform how design was documented, brought 3D design to the broader market, and then became a respected technology leader. We were first to bring design to the cloud, to mobile, and to subscription—and now we’re bringing innovation to the world of making,” his letter continues.“The next era of Autodesk is not defined by product or business innovation—but in their combination.  We must excel at both, all in the service of our customers. To ensure their success, and ours, we will improve not only our product experience, but also our customer experience.  And we will continue to deliver incredible tools that customers can use to make a better world.”Amar Hanspal, Former Senior Vice President and Chief Product OfficerStill, as we know that executive leadership is never without some upheaval and upset, Anagnost notes as well the departure of another longtime member of the Autodesk executive team. Along with Anagnost, Amar Hanspal was heading the Interim Office as Co-CEO in the aftermath of Bass’ departure. Hanspal, the company’s Senior Vice President and Chief Product Officer, will no longer be with Autodesk, following work with the company in customer support and project management positions between 1987 and 1999, and rejoining from 2002 until his just-announced departure. During his more recent tenure, Hanspal worked with such projects as the 2015 introduction of cloud-based Forge, signing an MoU with Dubai on behalf of the Spark Investment Fund, and presenting the company’s vision at Autodesk University, among many other initiatives and activities.With the tumult of a new CEO, departure of a long-term executive, and all that goes along with the shuffle in corporate structure, Anagnost is looking to interim appointments to keep business activities afloat.“Regretfully, Amar Hanspal has decided to leave the company,” Anagnost shares. “As many of you know, Amar and I have shared countless experiences and tackled great challenges together; I’m truly sad to see him leave. I’d like to extend my sincere thanks and appreciation for his 30 years of service and all that he’s done to make Autodesk, our team, and our products great. With Amar’s departure and my new role, I’ve asked Scott Reese to be the acting leader of the Product Development Group and Lisa Campbell to be the acting leader of Business Strategy & Marketing. I recognize that it’s very difficult to say goodbye to a leader we have valued and respected for many years. I understand that, and I look forward to working closely with you and Autodesk leadership on a smooth transition.”These appointments and the restructuring seen at Autodesk seem to fit right in to 2017 overall, as this year has seen some major executive shuffling among the ranks of well-known companies working in the 3D printing industry. Just last week, GE announced the upcoming departure of its CEO as well as his successor, while in April Organovo announced its own CEO changeover.

Autodesk Names Andrew Anagnost President, CEO









Giovanni Bruno




Jun 19, 2017 5:09 PM EDT













 














































































 Software company Autodesk ( ADSK) announced on Monday evening that it has named co-CEO Andrew Anagnost as its permanent president and only CEO.   Anagnost shared the title of interim co-CEO Amar Hanspal, who will leave the company on July 10.   Hanspal was the SVP, chief product officer, and became an interim co-CEO when former CEO Carl Bass stepped down in February.   Shares of Autodesk closed higher by 1.22% to $106.16 per share on Monday.   Shares of the firm are higher over 25% since February when the two took over as the co-CEOs.     What's Hot On the TheStreet All eyes on Apple this week: Apple's  (AAPL)  stock will be on the minds of Wall Street bit more than the norm this week. Shares of the tech giant have fallen 6.9% since the Nasdaq's peak on June 8 amid a broader selloff in tech. Not helping near-term sentiment on the company are two rare analyst downgrades that have questioned how big a seller the iPhone 8 will be. But investors shouldn't be ready to throw in the towel on Apple by any stretch of the imagination. "When you have these sellers come in, all you have to do is wait them out -- and one of the things I learned as a hedge fund manager is that patience is a true virtue," TheStreet's founder Jim Cramer, who also manages the Action Alerts PLUS charitable trust portfolio, said on Apple's recent slide.

Industry Veteran to Lead Autodesk Through Next Phase of Growth
SAN FRANCISCO, June 19, 2017 — (PRNewswire) —   Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ: 
ADSK) today announced that its board of directors has appointed Andrew Anagnost, current interim co-chief executive officer and chief marketing officer, as the company's new president and CEO, effective immediately. He will also join Autodesk's board of directors.


    


"The board and I are delighted that Andrew will lead Autodesk into its next stage of growth," said Crawford W. Beveridge, chairman of the board of Autodesk. "Andrew has been instrumental in the development and execution of Autodesk's successful business model transition, and with his leadership, we are confident that our move to the cloud and subscription will continue to be successful."
Anagnost, who holds a PhD in Aeronautical Engineering and Computer Science from Stanford University, began his career at Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Company and as an NRC fellow at NASA Ames Research Center. After joining Autodesk in 1997, he held various technical and strategic roles. 
He led engineering for Autodesk Inventor, the company's 3D model-based product design and engineering tool, growing revenue five-fold during his tenure.  As senior vice president of business strategy and marketing, he led the company's successful transition to a subscription business model, and drove adoption of Autodesk's cloud technologies. For more on Anagnost's background and a full bio, visit 
http://autode.sk/anagnost.
"This is an exciting time for Autodesk, and I am thrilled to be taking on the CEO role," said Anagnost. "Autodesk transformed the design industry by bringing CAD to the PC 35 years ago, and in the last 10 years became the clear technology leader. We were first to bring design to the cloud and mobile, and now we're bringing construction and manufacturing to the cloud as well. I can't wait to lead Autodesk into our next phase of growth, where we will combine business and product innovation to become an even more customer-focused company."
Anagnost's appointment follows the February 2017 resignation of the company's former president and CEO, Carl Bass, and a comprehensive search process conducted by the board over the last four months.
"I have worked closely with Andrew over the past 20 years, and I know he will be a great leader for Autodesk," said Bass, Autodesk board director. "His contributions and dedication to the company, our employees, and customers have been immeasurable. I look forward to working with him from my seat on the board and can't wait to see where he takes Autodesk in the future."
Autodesk also announced that Amar Hanspal, senior vice president, chief product officer and interim co-CEO, has decided to leave the company. Anagnost commented, "I want to thank Amar for his many important contributions to Autodesk's culture and product line over his 30 years with the company. He is a great colleague and friend, and he will be missed."
