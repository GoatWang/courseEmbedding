Hershey’s CEO Bilbrey to Retire
Chief stepping down in July; search for successor under way

October 14, 2016, 12:54 pm



 



John P. Bilbrey, chairman, president and CEO of The Hershey Co., plans to retire from the company, continuing as non-executive chairman of Hershey’s board of directors after stepping down on July 1, 2017.
The board has appointed a special committee to direct the search for a new CEO. The committee, led by Pamela Arway, chair of the governance committee, will review internal and external candidates with assistance from Egon Zehnder, a leading executive search firm.
“I have had the privilege of working in consumer packaged goods for more than 35 years and leading The Hershey Company has been the highlight of my career,” Bilbrey said. “Our iconic brands, remarkable employees and commitment to making a difference in the world has made this a difficult decision for me. But now is the right time to begin the process of handing over the reins as CEO.”
Unwavering Commitment
Arway praised Bilbrey for his “unwavering commitment and many contributions to Hershey’s success during his 13 years with the company,” adding that his leadership team “will continue to focus on growing the business while upholding Hershey’s great heritage and values” during the search for Bilbrey’s successor.
“I am proud of all that we have accomplished as a team,” Bilbrey said. “I look forward to working alongside the board to make the transition to new leadership a seamless process. Until that time, I will continue to work closely with my management team to grow the business and create additional value for all stockholders.”
The company also reaffirmed its full-year 2016 outlook outlined in the company’s second quarter 2016 earnings announcement.
The Hershey Co., based in Hershey, Pa., is a global confectionary company that markets, sells and distributes its products under more than 80 brand names in 70 countries worldwide.

Bilbrey Adds Chairman to Hershey TitlesExec will continue to serve as candy company's president, CEO









April 03, 2015
John BilbreyHERSHEY, Pa. -- The Hershey Co. said that its board of directors has elected John P. Bilbrey as chairman, effective immediately. Bilbrey will continue to be president and CEO of the global confectionery company, a role he has held since May 2011. Bilbrey succeeds James E. Nevels who held the position since February 2009 and will now assume the role of lead independent director.Nevels proposed the combination of the offices of CEO and chairman and presented the idea for board consideration to underscore its confidence in Hershey, the existing management team and Bilbrey. Under Bilbrey's leadership, Hershey has delivered strong financial results, expanded its global reach and positioned itself to capture new growth opportunities to build value for all of Hershey's shareholders. His recent appointments to presidential advisory committees and leadership in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry further demonstrate his depth of expertise for this expanded role."It is a privilege and honor to succeed Jim as chairman," said Bilbrey. "On behalf of all of our employees, I'd like to thank Jim for his partnership and the solid contributions he has made as chairman over the last six years as we transformed Hershey into a growth company. Our financial strength, global reach and vision, as well as great brands and experienced management team provide a strong foundation for the future of The Hershey Co. I look forward to working closely with Jim in his new role as lead independent director."As lead independent director, Nevels will hold a number of duties consistent with those he held as non-executive chairman and with best practices in corporate governance, including serving as a liaison between the chairman and the independent directors, approving board meeting agendas and schedules and assisting with succession planning and crisis management."These changes to our board are the result of careful thought and consideration by the full board and are consistent with our vision for continuing to deliver sustainable growth and build on the legacy of our great company," said Nevels. "J.P. is one of the most effective leaders in corporate America. Throughout his career, industry groups, government and corporations have turned to him for his thoughts and perspective on the changing dynamics of global food trends. We are fortunate that J.P. will continue to lead the company in this added capacity."The Hershey Co., with headquarters in Hershey, Pa., is a global confectionery leader known for chocolate, sweets, mints and other snacks. The company, which has more than 80 brands around the world that drive more than $7.4 billion in annual revenues, includes Hershey's, Reese's, Hershey's Kisses, Jolly Rancher, Ice Breakers and Brookside.Related Content

As the new CEO of The Hershey Co., John P. Bilbrey isn’t expected to start by making wholesale changes — after all, if it isn’t broke, why fix it?     Instead, Bilbrey’s nod for the top spot is considered a good, steady bet by the Derry Township-based chocolate maker.     “It’s no surprise,” said Jack Russo, an analyst with Edward Jones, who said Bilbrey was the obvious choice for the job.     View full sizeJohn P. BilbreyBilbrey, who served as interim CEO, has been with the company since 2003 and has a deep understanding of not only the company, but also the general consumer products industry.     For years, he was the vice president of the company’s international arm, and before that, spent 22 years with Procter & Gamble.     Bilbrey was not available for an interview after the company’s announcement last week. But the 54-year-old is widely expected to build on the gains that his predecessor, David West, made over the last few years — especially in developing rapidly expanding overseas markets.     The company has said that over the next few years, it expects its international sales, driven primarily by China and India, to account for more than $1 billion. 
Erin Lash, who follows The Hershey Co. for Morningstar, said she expects those targets to be on the top of Bilbrey’s mind as he assumes control of the company, but the candy company faces an uphill climb.     The Hershey Co. dominates the U.S. market among chocolate makers, but lags behind rivals Kraft and Mars internationally.     “Bilbrey’s resume includes numerous stints operating in international markets, which could aid this endeavor,” she wrote in a note to investors. “However, due to the beachheads that Hershey’s competitors already maintain in these markets, we don’t expect international growth to contribute meaningfully to the domestic confectionery firm’s results over the near term.”     Bilbrey has been considered West’s right-hand man over the last few years, and will inherit a company of 13,000 employees that has been having a resurgence after a downturn earlier this decade.     During the last three years, the company’s net income has increased by almost 64 percent and annual sales jumped from $5.1 billion to $5.6 billion through the end of 2010.     The company’s stock value has also shot up.     Earlier this spring the company, traded under the symbol HSY, was trading at three-year highs and briefly broached $57 per-share.     It retreated after the announcement that West was leaving, but Bilbrey’s nod for the top spot received votes of confidence from Wall Street — Hershey Co. shares rose sharply in the days following the announcement.     The profits came in the wake of significant changes — the company has reworked it supply chain, closing factories and distribution centers across the United States.     At times, there were concerns if The Hershey Co. would leave the town it’s founder created all together.     But work is progressing on the West Hershey chocolate plant, which will ensure chocolate is produced in the town for decades to come.     Production work is expected to migrate from the original plant to the new facility at the end of this year and be completed by early 2012.     It remains to be seen what the company will do with Milton S. Hershey’s original chocolate plant in the downtown area, although The Hershey Co. disclosed it has discussed a possible sale of the 106-year-old building to one of the other Hershey entities.     The Hershey Trust Co., which manages a controlling interest in the Hershey Co. has stated it is considering buying the property. If the sale proceeds, at least a piece of the property will be renovated and leased back to The Hershey Co. for use as its corporate offices.     It’s speculated the remainder of the factory — more than a million square feet — could be redeveloped into shops, condos or other commercial uses.     Both The Hershey Co. and the trust company said Monday the fate of Hershey’s factory remains undecided.     While Bilbrey was recognized as the leading contender for the CEO position, he was not the only candidate considered.     Previously, Bloomberg News reported that the company had held talks with ex-Cadbury CEO Todd Stitzer about the position.     However, Lash speculated that the company’s unique structure, with the Hershey School Trust controlling 80 percent of the company’s voting shares, may have made recruiting an outsider a challenge.     In an economy that has seen dramatic changes over the last several years, a safe, conservative bet is considered a home run, at least as far as investors are concerned.     “There really isn’t too much to say,” Russo said. “It’s a safe, conservative company, so the choice fits who they are and what they are.”
Meet the new boss:     Name: John P. Bilbrey Title: President, CEO of The Hershey Co. Salary: $1.06 million Previous: Chief operating officer, The Hershey Co. Age: 54 Background: Joined The Hershey Co. in 2003 as president of Hershey International. Previously he held executive positions at Mission Foods and Danone Waters of North America, a division of Groupe Danone, Paris. Bilbrey also spent 22 years at the Procter & Gamble Co. and currently sits on the board of directors of the McCormick Co.
