Family Office









Families are complicated. Managing their finances doesn’t have to be.
Think of us as a trusted resource for managing virtually any aspect of your family’s financial life. Using our framework of family office services, you can create a customized approach that suits your family’s particular circumstances. Our process begins with a thorough review of your financial assets and family dynamics. This helps us determine what services your family needs—where you might need help, and where you don’t. The result is an arrangement which allows us to lighten your load by collaborating with your other advisors and assume responsibility for your important family financial matters.

Frequently Asked Questions










How large is your firm?


Cobblestone Capital Advisors is a well-established investment advisory firm with roots extending back to 1986. We currently manage $1.4 billion of assets with over 700 client relationships. Our clients range from not‐for‐profit endowments, pension plans, foundations and insurance pools to individuals and families. Our office is located in Rochester, New York and houses a team of 30 professionals with extensive portfolio management, wealth planning, and financial consulting experience.


What are your qualifications?


Our in-house team includes 6 Certified Financial Analyst® Charterholders, 3 Certified Financial Planners™, 1 Juris Doctor, and 2 Certified Public Accountants. The majority of our employees have at least 10 years of industry experience and many have been with Cobblestone for over 20 years. Our extensive investment and planning expertise allows clients to better build, manage, monitor and retain wealth.


What services do you offer?


Our offerings include traditional investment management and wealth management services, as well as private investments and family office services.


What is your approach to managing client accounts?


Cobblestone employs a customized goals-based approach to wealth management, which is guided by the unique needs and objectives of each client. Once goals are identified and documented, we employ deep planning and investment expertise, devising creative strategies and keeping an eye on thoughtful execution to ensure successful implementation of your plan.


Will you be the only person working with me?
No. In fact, one of our strengths is our team approach. While your primary point of contact is your Relationship Manager, your team will also include two to three additional financial professionals: a Portfolio Manager, a Client Service Associate, and possibly a Wealth Planner. Any of these contacts will be happy to assist you should your Relationship Manager be unavailable for any reason.



What is your approach to communicating with clients?
We understand that communication is critical in developing successful client relationships – and that every client is different. We’ll work with you to understand your preferences regarding how and how often you’d like to hear from us to make sure you’re always well informed about your account.

Your Cobblestone Capital Advisor team will meet/communicate with you for periodic investment reviews to cover the following topics:

Portfolio performance (net of fee)
Market Overview
Asset allocation
Open discussion

 
Cobblestone Capital also engages in ongoing communication with our clients throughout the year. We distribute timely, informational pieces and a quarterly newsletter, offering general economic updates and Cobblestone’s perspective on current market conditions. We’ll also communicate with you in times of major, global events, significant market movements or large-scale catastrophes. We understand that our clients are concerned about how such events may impact the global markets, as well as how they may trickle down to affect us locally. We provide our perspective on how we expect the markets to react to such events and what actions we may need to address moving forward. Cobblestone will communicate promptly with you if there are significant positive or negative trends in investment performance as well as significant changes in investment philosophy or key staff positions.


How will I pay for your services and how is Cobblestone compensated?


Cobblestone Capital Advisors is a fee-only Registered Investment Advisor. We are independent and independently owned. Because we have a fiduciary responsibility, our efforts are focused solely on you and your success. Unlike brokers, we do not accept any commissions.
We calculate management fees according to the fair market value of account assets. Fees are assessed quarterly, in advance. Consulting fees are quoted separately.
 
Investment Management Fee Schedule
$0 ‐ $1,500,000……………………..1.00%
$1,500,001 ‐ $5,000,000………….0.75%
 
In an investment management capacity, Cobblestone has full discretion to take action within a portfolio. Cobblestone receives no other compensation for its services.
Private investment vehicles may also be subject to performance-based fees. All fees are subject to change.


Have you ever been publicly disciplined for any unlawful or unethical actions in your professional career?
No, Cobblestone has never been subject to any pending litigation or regulatory issues. Cobblestone is committed to maintaining a strong and effective compliance program. As an investment advisor registered with the SEC, Cobblestone is subject to regulatory compliance inspections and examinations.



Do you have a succession plan for ownership of your firm?


Yes. Management responsibility and firm ownership deliberately transitioned from senior partners to new generations of firm leadership many times over the past 25 years. The firm has actively engaged external resources for guidance and perspective on succession issues. Our trust in the firm’s stability is reflected in the fact that many of the partners and employees are also clients.

Private Investments









Exclusive opportunities for added diversification
We tap a broad sourcing network to help qualified investors achieve greater diversification and better returns with less liquid, private market investments. Our rigorous due diligence process allows us to find, vet and monitor attractive opportunities. We utilize both diversified funds and targeted single-purpose entities to invest across the capital structure in private assets that exhibit attractive cash flow, appreciation potential, or both.

Some of our past projects & operating partners include:

Hampton Inn & Suites
M North Apartments
JCR Capital
Broadstone Real Estate, LLC
Southwest Value Partners
The Carlyle Group
Royal Oak Realty Trust
Cobblestone Private Income Fund, L.P.

Private Investments have specific characteristics that make them risky and unsuitable for many investors: they are illiquid; they often bear higher expenses and sizeable minimums; they typically require great effort to analyze and monitor; and in some instances, they contain the potential for total loss of capital.
The securities identified and described do not represent all of the securities purchased, sold, or recommended for client accounts. The reader should not assume that an investment in the securities identified was or will be profitable.

What are analysts saying about Emerson Electric Company stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Emerson Electric Company stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Emerson’s second-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, and inched up 2% from the year-ago tally on the back of an improving macro environment, restructuring benefits and lower expenses. Going forward, the company’s aggressive restructuring actions and strategic divestures are expected to boost performance. Emerson seems well positioned to benefit from global infrastructure growth, as its core businesses hold dominant positions in markets tied to energy efficiency and infrastructure spending. However, on the flip side, prolonged softness in the oil and gas markets has affected both capital spending and operational expenditure of clients, thereby hurting Emerson’s order rates in power generating alternators and electrical distribution businesses. In light of these issues, the stock has underperformed the Zacks classified Machinery-Electrical industry average over the past year." (5/5/2017)
2. Cowen and Company analysts commented, "Automation & CRS trends improved again, & EMR raised the F17 organic sales/." (5/2/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Emerson Electric Company (NYSE:EMR) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Sell Ratings, 12 Hold Ratings, 3 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.06)Consensus Price Target: $56.80 (5.40% downside)
