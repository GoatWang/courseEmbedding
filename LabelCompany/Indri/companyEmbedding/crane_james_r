Jim Crane - Wikipedia




















 






Jim Crane

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

James Robert Crane is a businessman from Houston, Texas. Crane is chairman and chief executive of Crane Capital Group, the majority shareholder of Champion Energy, Crane Worldwide Logistics, and Crane Freight & Shipping. He is also the owner and chairman of the MLB team Houston Astros [1]

Early life and education[edit]
Crane, who grew up in the north St. Louis suburb of Dellwood, Missouri, attended Lutheran High School North and graduated from there in 1972.[2] He gave the school a donation of USD$1 million to improve their athletic facilities and enlarge the size of the campus from 40 acres to 67 in 2004.[2][3] The school named the James R. Crane Athletic Complex for his contribution.[4]
Crane earned a degree in industrial safety from Central Missouri State University[5] (now University of Central Missouri) in 1976, where he became a member of the fraternity, Tau Kappa Epsilon. He pitched for the Central Missouri Mules baseball team.[6] Crane's father died between his freshman and sophomore years and he seriously thought about dropping out of college, but his coach Robert N. Tompkins drove to his home in north St. Louis and talked Crane into returning to school.[7]
In 1998 Crane was the largest donor in a USD$1.2 million upgrade of the CMSU baseball stadium, which was then named James R. Crane Stadium.[8]
Career[edit]
After graduating from college he followed his father and went into the insurance business. He moved to Houston in 1980, and in March 1984 Crane borrowed USD$10,000 from his sister and founded Eagle USA Airfreight, an air freight logistics business.[7][9] In 2000, Eagle USA was subject of an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigation regarding hiring practices of minorities and women.[10]
Eagle USA Airfreight later became Eagle Global Logistics, and then EGL, Inc., and moved into the supply chain management and information services business. In August 2007 EGL merged with United Kingdom-based CEVA Logistics, owned by American private equity capital management and leveraged buyout firm Apollo Management L.P.. Crane owned approximately 17.6% of EGL's stock at the time of the merger. He had wanted to do a leveraged, management, or combination of the two, buyout of EGL, prior to the merger with CEVA, but was unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms. Later, after he obtained equity backing he initially offered $36 per-share for EGL, but Apollo then engaged in a bidding war and the shareholders eventually went with the Apollo/CEVA offer of $47.50 per share. He was opposed to the EGL and CEVA merger.[11]
Crane took his profits from EGL and formed Crane Capital Group. He also became a director and shareholder (less than 1%) in Western Gas Holdings, LLC, the general partner in Western Gas Partners, LP, a mid-stream (mainly pipelines and natural gas gathering assets) energy company operating in the southeastern Rocky Mountain region and southern Mid-Continent area (Oklahoma and Texas) of the United States. Western Gas Holdings and Western Gas Partners are majority owned by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation.[9] Crane is also the majority shareholder in Crane Worldwide Logistics LLC.,[5] director of Fort Dearborn Life Insurance Company (a subsidiary of Health Care Service Corporation),[5] and a director and executive officer in Champion Energy Holdings LLC.
A scratch golfer, Crane has been ranked as the nation's top CEO golfer. In April 2010 he purchased The Floridian National Golf Club from H. Wayne Huizenga. The Floridian in Palm City, Florida recently completed major renovations and additions under the supervision of noted architect Tom Fazio.
Crane reached an agreement to purchase the Houston Astros of Major League Baseball from Drayton McLane for a reported $680 million.[12] He was unanimously approved by MLB on November 17, 2011 after being forced to move to the American League in 2013.[13]
"It was two things (owning a team and golf course) that I never thought I would be able to accomplish," he said. "I was able to pull it together and I am very happy about it."
Personal life[edit]
Crane and his ex-wife, Franci Neely Crane, are financial supporters of The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.[14][15][16][17][18]
For her 60th birthday party Franci was serenaded by the rock-pop band The B-52's at the Crane's summer home in Nantucket, Massachusetts in July 2010.[19]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Early life and education[edit]
Crane, who grew up in the north St. Louis suburb of Dellwood, Missouri, attended Lutheran High School North and graduated from there in 1972.[2] He gave the school a donation of USD$1 million to improve their athletic facilities and enlarge the size of the campus from 40 acres to 67 in 2004.[2][3] The school named the James R. Crane Athletic Complex for his contribution.[4]
Crane earned a degree in industrial safety from Central Missouri State University[5] (now University of Central Missouri) in 1976, where he became a member of the fraternity, Tau Kappa Epsilon. He pitched for the Central Missouri Mules baseball team.[6] Crane's father died between his freshman and sophomore years and he seriously thought about dropping out of college, but his coach Robert N. Tompkins drove to his home in north St. Louis and talked Crane into returning to school.[7]
In 1998 Crane was the largest donor in a USD$1.2 million upgrade of the CMSU baseball stadium, which was then named James R. Crane Stadium.[8]
Career[edit]
After graduating from college he followed his father and went into the insurance business. He moved to Houston in 1980, and in March 1984 Crane borrowed USD$10,000 from his sister and founded Eagle USA Airfreight, an air freight logistics business.[7][9] In 2000, Eagle USA was subject of an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigation regarding hiring practices of minorities and women.[10]
Eagle USA Airfreight later became Eagle Global Logistics, and then EGL, Inc., and moved into the supply chain management and information services business. In August 2007 EGL merged with United Kingdom-based CEVA Logistics, owned by American private equity capital management and leveraged buyout firm Apollo Management L.P.. Crane owned approximately 17.6% of EGL's stock at the time of the merger. He had wanted to do a leveraged, management, or combination of the two, buyout of EGL, prior to the merger with CEVA, but was unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms. Later, after he obtained equity backing he initially offered $36 per-share for EGL, but Apollo then engaged in a bidding war and the shareholders eventually went with the Apollo/CEVA offer of $47.50 per share. He was opposed to the EGL and CEVA merger.[11]
Crane took his profits from EGL and formed Crane Capital Group. He also became a director and shareholder (less than 1%) in Western Gas Holdings, LLC, the general partner in Western Gas Partners, LP, a mid-stream (mainly pipelines and natural gas gathering assets) energy company operating in the southeastern Rocky Mountain region and southern Mid-Continent area (Oklahoma and Texas) of the United States. Western Gas Holdings and Western Gas Partners are majority owned by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation.[9] Crane is also the majority shareholder in Crane Worldwide Logistics LLC.,[5] director of Fort Dearborn Life Insurance Company (a subsidiary of Health Care Service Corporation),[5] and a director and executive officer in Champion Energy Holdings LLC.
A scratch golfer, Crane has been ranked as the nation's top CEO golfer. In April 2010 he purchased The Floridian National Golf Club from H. Wayne Huizenga. The Floridian in Palm City, Florida recently completed major renovations and additions under the supervision of noted architect Tom Fazio.
Crane reached an agreement to purchase the Houston Astros of Major League Baseball from Drayton McLane for a reported $680 million.[12] He was unanimously approved by MLB on November 17, 2011 after being forced to move to the American League in 2013.[13]
"It was two things (owning a team and golf course) that I never thought I would be able to accomplish," he said. "I was able to pull it together and I am very happy about it."
Personal life[edit]
Crane and his ex-wife, Franci Neely Crane, are financial supporters of The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.[14][15][16][17][18]
For her 60th birthday party Franci was serenaded by the rock-pop band The B-52's at the Crane's summer home in Nantucket, Massachusetts in July 2010.[19]

Early life and education[edit]
Crane, who grew up in the north St. Louis suburb of Dellwood, Missouri, attended Lutheran High School North and graduated from there in 1972.[2] He gave the school a donation of USD$1 million to improve their athletic facilities and enlarge the size of the campus from 40 acres to 67 in 2004.[2][3] The school named the James R. Crane Athletic Complex for his contribution.[4]
Crane earned a degree in industrial safety from Central Missouri State University[5] (now University of Central Missouri) in 1976, where he became a member of the fraternity, Tau Kappa Epsilon. He pitched for the Central Missouri Mules baseball team.[6] Crane's father died between his freshman and sophomore years and he seriously thought about dropping out of college, but his coach Robert N. Tompkins drove to his home in north St. Louis and talked Crane into returning to school.[7]
In 1998 Crane was the largest donor in a USD$1.2 million upgrade of the CMSU baseball stadium, which was then named James R. Crane Stadium.[8]
Career[edit]
After graduating from college he followed his father and went into the insurance business. He moved to Houston in 1980, and in March 1984 Crane borrowed USD$10,000 from his sister and founded Eagle USA Airfreight, an air freight logistics business.[7][9] In 2000, Eagle USA was subject of an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigation regarding hiring practices of minorities and women.[10]
Eagle USA Airfreight later became Eagle Global Logistics, and then EGL, Inc., and moved into the supply chain management and information services business. In August 2007 EGL merged with United Kingdom-based CEVA Logistics, owned by American private equity capital management and leveraged buyout firm Apollo Management L.P.. Crane owned approximately 17.6% of EGL's stock at the time of the merger. He had wanted to do a leveraged, management, or combination of the two, buyout of EGL, prior to the merger with CEVA, but was unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms. Later, after he obtained equity backing he initially offered $36 per-share for EGL, but Apollo then engaged in a bidding war and the shareholders eventually went with the Apollo/CEVA offer of $47.50 per share. He was opposed to the EGL and CEVA merger.[11]
Crane took his profits from EGL and formed Crane Capital Group. He also became a director and shareholder (less than 1%) in Western Gas Holdings, LLC, the general partner in Western Gas Partners, LP, a mid-stream (mainly pipelines and natural gas gathering assets) energy company operating in the southeastern Rocky Mountain region and southern Mid-Continent area (Oklahoma and Texas) of the United States. Western Gas Holdings and Western Gas Partners are majority owned by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation.[9] Crane is also the majority shareholder in Crane Worldwide Logistics LLC.,[5] director of Fort Dearborn Life Insurance Company (a subsidiary of Health Care Service Corporation),[5] and a director and executive officer in Champion Energy Holdings LLC.
A scratch golfer, Crane has been ranked as the nation's top CEO golfer. In April 2010 he purchased The Floridian National Golf Club from H. Wayne Huizenga. The Floridian in Palm City, Florida recently completed major renovations and additions under the supervision of noted architect Tom Fazio.
Crane reached an agreement to purchase the Houston Astros of Major League Baseball from Drayton McLane for a reported $680 million.[12] He was unanimously approved by MLB on November 17, 2011 after being forced to move to the American League in 2013.[13]
"It was two things (owning a team and golf course) that I never thought I would be able to accomplish," he said. "I was able to pull it together and I am very happy about it."
Personal life[edit]
Crane and his ex-wife, Franci Neely Crane, are financial supporters of The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.[14][15][16][17][18]
For her 60th birthday party Franci was serenaded by the rock-pop band The B-52's at the Crane's summer home in Nantucket, Massachusetts in July 2010.[19]

Crane, James R. - The Wall Street Transcript














































 





































James R. Crane
JAMES R. CRANE is the Chairman, President, CEO, and major
shareholder of EGL-Eagle Global Logistics, the largest and
fastest-growing freight forwarder in the domestic heavy freight
market and a growing presence in the international arena. Since
founding EGL in 1984 ‘ then known as EAGLE USA Airfreight ‘ Mr.
Crane has directed the company’s growth by creating a unique
business model within the transportation industry that combines
the flexibility of traditional freight forwarding with multi-
modal transportation using integrated global logistics. EGL’s
non-asset based model allows the company to provide customized
transportation solutions without the schedule limitations and
higher costs of dedicated aircraft and truck fleets. In October
2000, EGL completed a merger with Circle International that
doubled the size of the company. The merger combined the strength
of EGL’s comprehensive US network with the scope of Circle’s
international infrastructure creating a full-service freight
forwarding and logistics company. The company’s stock is publicly
traded on the NASDAQ market. Mr. Crane was educated at Central
Missouri State University where he received a Bachelor of Science
degree in industrial safety in 1976 followed by Master’s work.
Following college, Mr. Crane worked with a major insurance
carrier for seven years before entering the transportation
industry. After gaining transportation experience from two
airfreight companies, Mr. Crane founded EAGLE USA Airfreight in
1984. Recent recognition enjoyed by Mr. Crane and EGL employees
include the following: 1996 Entrepreneur of the Year in Houston
and Runner-up in the National Award. He is President of The Crane
Foundation, which contributes to local and national charities. In
May 1999, the Houston Chronicle named Eagle USA to the Chronicle
100 Leading Companies in Houston.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
