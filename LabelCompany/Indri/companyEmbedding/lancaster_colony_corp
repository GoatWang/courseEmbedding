Best Dividend Stocks to Buy Now – 122 Years Of Big Payouts

Lancaster Colony Corp. (NASDAQ:LANC) is a relatively unknown dividend stock. However, this is despite growing its dividend every year since 1963.
Lancaster Colony has had 50+ consecutive years of payout growth. But unlike many of the other dividend kings, which are generally large and relatively slow-growing companies, LANC stock has a roughly $3 billion market cap.
Let’s take a closer look at one of the rare small cap dividend kings, Lancaster Colony, which just raised its dividend for the 54th straight year, a feat matched by just 14 other U.S. corporations.
Specifically, learn why LANC stock deserves to be on your radar and if its valuation is attractive for investors who are building a dividend portfolio the responsible way.
Lancaster Colony Corp.Overview
Founded in 1961 in Columbus, Ohio, Lancaster Colony is a specialty food maker that owns several niche dip, garlic bread, frozen roll, croutons, caviar, and flat bread brands, including Marzetti, New York Bakery, Sister Schubert’s, Flatout, Aunt Vi’s, Reames, Mamma Bella’s, Romanoff, and Chatham Lodge.
In addition, Lancaster makes licensed products including Olive Garden dressing, Jack Daniel’s mustard, and Hungry Girl Flatbreads.
LANC stock products are distributed through both retail grocery channels, as well as to 18 of America’s 25 most popular national restaurant chains.

LANC Stock Analysis
The key to any dividend growth stock includes a steady business model, with highly predictable and growing cash flow with which it can fund a secure and rising payout.
Over the past half century, Lancaster has managed to achieve impressive growth thanks to its disciplined approach to acquiring small, niche specialty products food companies that fit well into its existing business model and supply chain.
You can see that the company’s sales have grown by 12% per year since 1971, largely driven by acquisitions.

However, what truly sets the company apart from most of its rivals is that rather than attempt to grow for growth’s sake, management has remained steadfast in its approach to buying only the most popular names in its niche industries.
These are brands that have been benefiting from major demographic trends, such as the continued rise of the Millenial generation, and the changes in consumer tastes that come with them.
 

Specifically, the maturing of the Millennial generation, the largest in U.S. history, has resulted in consumers shifting their food dollars away from pre-packaged products found in the center of the grocery store, and towards the periphery to things like fresh foods, meats, and specialty products.
 

Over time Lancaster has evolved its business model to successfully tailor its product offerings towards these shifting consumer trends, including an increasing focus on expanding its produce and deli offerings, which now account for close to 40% of its retail sales mix.
 

Of course, even poorly run companies can grow strongly for a time through acquisition. However, Lancaster’s quality stems from its multi-pronged approach to long-term growth.

David Ciesinski knows his audience.
The long-time food industry veteran, who has had stints at Kraft and Heinz, joined Lancaster Colony Corp. as president in April 2016 and already speaks the second language of Central Ohioans: Ohio State University football.

Ciesinski explained the Westerville-based food manufacturer's product portfolio with a Buckeyes analogy. He compared the company's foundational brands – like frozen bread found in the center of grocery stores – to the offensive line: Sturdy and necessary, but not the center of attention.
The products on the perimeter – refrigerated salad dressing and fresher foods – are more like wide receivers and flashier offensive skill positions.
Each are different but just as vital to the team’s success.
“You can’t have all weapons and no line,” Ciesinski said.
Kraft and Heinz veteran
Ciesinski takes that kind of mindset with him as he begins his tenure as CEO, leading the company into an era sure to be just as beset by changes as other legacy industries affected by changing consumer tastes.
And he does so while replacing Lancaster Colony’s longtime leader. Jay Gerlach Jr. spent more than three decades as an executive at the company founded by his father and grandfather in 1961, including the last two as CEO and board chairman.
“Jay’s just an incredibly principled leader,” Ciesinski said. “He’s built the company around bedrock values.”




Ciesinski joined Lancaster Colony last year as its president and COO. His prior job was at Kraft Foods Group Inc., where he led the food giant’s grocery business. He's also been CMO at H.J. Heinz Co., where he later headed its corporate business development division and in 2013 was involved in the $28 billion sale of the ketchup king to an investment group.
Lancaster Colony is much smaller than some of its food producing peers, including the $26.5 billion revenue Kraft Heinz Co. (both big-brand companies merged in 2015). Lancaster Colony recorded $121.8 million in net income on $1.2 billion in revenue in 2016.

But that relative lack of size can be a good thing, Ciesinski said.
“We’re big enough to have scale but compared to the mega-caps, Kraft Heinz or companies like that, also small enough to be quite nimble, which makes it a lot of fun,” he said.
Grocery customers flocking to the perimeter
Lancaster Colony's strategy is three-fold:
Accelerate growth with new products. Simplify the supply chain and how its food products are made. Complete more complementary acquisitions like it did in 2015 with the $92 million purchase of Flatout, which makes low-calorie flatbread wraps.
Foods in a store’s perimeter are home to Lancaster Colony’s fastest growth. Consumer demographics are changing, as are what they choose to eat. It’s not new that fresh foods have become a preferred food type, leading major grocers to expand their offerings to compete with what was once the purview of specialty stores like Whole Foods.
“In many respects that was one of the appeals of our company here,” Ciesinski said. “A lot of those changes causing consumers to shop more frequently in the perimeter of the stores comes to our benefit.”
It also led to more competition. Refrigerated salad dressing, an area dominated by Marzetti and in which Lancaster Colony holds a market-leading 25.1 percent market share, is as popular as ever.




 


“Big guys are buying into it with limited success – it’s smaller brands we’re watching,” Ciesinski said.
Adapting to stay relevant
Another changing consumer preference impacting Lancaster Colony (NASDAQ:LANC) is an aversion to chain restaurants, especially among younger customers. Last month the CEO of prominent chain Buffalo Wild Wings told shareholders that Millennials are to blame for falling sales.
That matters to Lancaster Colony, where 48 percent of its sales are in foodservice, with three-fourths of that coming from national accounts. It supplies food to 18 of the top 25 restaurant chains in the country.
Increasingly, though, chains are trying to change by blurring the lines between foodservice and retail, Ciesinski said, offering new services like delivery and catering. Grocery stores, meanwhile, are offering more ready-made full meals.
Those changes can be good for Lancaster Colony, which provides some of its food to Olive Garden, the restaurant that’s probably near the top of the list to many people when visualizing a prototypical chain restaurant. Now the two companies have a licensing agreement that allows Lancaster Colony to sell Olive Garden-branded salad dressing in stores.
It’s an example, Ciensinski says, of the food maker adapting to remain relevant to consumers.
“As much as anything else, your business, our business, retail – relevant is the watchword,” he said.

What does Lancaster Colony sell to grocery stores? Here’s a look at some of its prominent brands:
Marzetti refrigerated salad dressing
Sales: $63.3 million Market share: 16%
Marzetti dips
Sales: $128.5 million Market share: 82.5%
Olive Garden salad dressing
Sales: $57.9 million Market share: 3.3%
New York Bakery frozen bread
Sales: $209.6 million Market share: 40.1%
Sister Schubert’s frozen bread
Sales: $109.7 million Market share: 51.2%
Flatout flatbread
Sales: $53.7 million Market share: 22.4%
Marzetti Simply Dressed salad dressing
Saless: $36 million Market share: 9.1%

Home  >  Our Company














Lancaster Colony Corporation is a manufacturer and marketer of specialty food products for the retail and foodservice markets.  Lancaster Colony is the parent of the well-known and well-established T. Marzetti Company. 
Top brands include Marzetti®, New York Brand® Bakery, Sister Schubert’s® and Flatout®. 

Over a half-century of success
In 1961, several small glass and related housewares manufacturing companies combined to form Lancaster Colony Corporation.

Lancaster Colony went public in 1969, the same year the company entered the specialty foods business with the purchase of the T. Marzetti Company.
Today, Lancaster Colony is a leading marketer and manufacturer of specialty food products for the retail and foodservice markets with popular brand name products including:
Marzetti® refrigerated salad dressings and dips (visit marzetti.com)

Lancaster Colony Corp. Fined $150,000 for Failing to Report Defective Candles to CPSC




























                Release date:
                February 9, 2000


                Release number:
                                00-065



Release Details


The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) announced today that Lancaster Colony Corp., of Columbus, Ohio, will pay a civil penalty of $150,000 to settle allegations that the company's original formulation Clearfire candles, sold by its Candle-lite division, contained a defect and the firm failed to report the problem to the agency as required by law. CPSC alleges that Lancaster Colony failed to report that original formulation Clearfire candles could flare up, causing the glass holders to overheat and break, putting consumers at risk of being burned or injured by broken glass. CPSC alleges that Lancaster Colony was aware of at least 142 incidents involving candle flare-ups, resulting in 20 burn or laceration injuries and more than 55 reports of property damage, but did not report to CPSC.Although the company agreed to the civil penalty, Lancaster Colony denies that the candles contain a defect that could create a substantial product hazard and that it violated the law.Lancaster Colony recalled 3 million of the candles in October 1996. The original formulation Clearfire candles did not have a plastic cover over the top of the candle. For more information about the recall, consumers should call Candle-lite at (800) 543-0357. 





The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with the use of
          thousands of types of consumer products under the agency’s jurisdiction. Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product incidents cost the
          nation more than $1 trillion annually. CPSC is committed to protecting consumers and families from products that pose a fire, electrical, chemical or
          mechanical hazard. CPSC's work to help ensure the safety of consumer products - such as toys, cribs, power tools, cigarette lighters and household
          chemicals -– contributed to a decline in the rate of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products over the past 40 years.
Federal law bars any person from selling products subject to a publicly-announced voluntary recall by a manufacturer or a mandatory recall ordered by the
          Commission.
To report a dangerous product or a product-related injury go online to www.SaferProducts.gov or call CPSC's Hotline at 800-638-2772 or teletypewriter at
          301-595-7054 for the hearing impaired. Consumers can obtain news release and recall information at www.cpsc.gov, on Twitter @USCPSC or by subscribing
          to CPSC's free e-mail newsletters.

History[edit]
T. Marzetti started out as an Italian restaurant in Columbus, Ohio, started by Teresa and Joseph Marzetti, recent Italian immigrants, in 1896. Teresa's opening credo was:
"We will start a new place and serve good food. At a profit if we can, at a loss if we must, but we will serve good food."[citation needed]
Marzetti's became a local favorite especially among The Ohio State University students, and grew to become a four star restaurant.
Customers particularly enjoyed Teresa's Johnny Marzetti, a pasta dish named for her brother-in-law as well as her homemade salad dressings. By 1955, Marzetti's dressings had become so renowned[citation needed] that the upstairs kitchen of the restaurant became a full-scale factory and the Marzetti brand of salad dressings found its way into grocery stores throughout Ohio.
After Teresa Marzetti's death in 1972, the restaurant closed, but the factory continued operation.

Receptionists represent your company and create an image of your business.  Having a RUDE receptionist does not help.  Customer Service is key and should be looked at carefully when hiring your first point of contact.

Receptionists represent your company and create an image of your business.  Having a RUDE receptionist does not help.  Customer Service is key and should be looked at carefully when hiring your first point of contact.

Receptionists represent your company and create an image of your business.  Having a RUDE receptionist does not help.  Customer Service is key and should be looked at carefully when hiring your first point of contact.
