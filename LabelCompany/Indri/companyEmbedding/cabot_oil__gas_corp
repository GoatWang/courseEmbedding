Core Operations
Cabot’s exploration, development and production operations are primarily concentrated in two unconventional plays—the Marcellus Shale in northeast Pennsylvania and the Eagle Ford Shale in south Texas. The Company also has non-core operations in various other unconventional and conventional plays throughout the continental United States. Cabot’s 2017 E&P capital budget is approximately $775 million with approximately 79% of spending focused on drilling, completion and facilities and up to $125 million of exploratory leasing/testing capital. For the full year 2017, the Company plans to drill approximately 90 gross wells (90 net wells).

Marcellus Shale

Since the inception of Cabot’s horizontal drilling program in 2008, the Company’s Marcellus Shale position in northeast Pennsylvania has developed into the cornerstone asset of its portfolio and has been the primary driver of record production and reserve growth during this period.
The Company plans to drill approximately 60 net wells in the Marcellus Shale during 2017, with approximately 67% of the Company’s drilling and completion capital allocated to the area.
Cabot has approximately 179,000 net acres in the dry gas window of the Marcellus Shale, primarily in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania. Cabot’s Marcellus Shale properties accounted for 93% of both the Company’s proved reserves and total net production as of year-end 2016.

Current operations[edit]
As of December 31, 2016, the company had 8.576 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved reserves, of which 96.5% was natural gas on an energy-equivalent basis, and 92% were in the Marcellus Shale. In 2016, the company produced 627.1 billion cubic feet equivalent of natural gas.[2]
The company operates in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, where it controls approximately 179,000 net acres[2][3] as well as in the Eagle Ford Shale, where it controls approximately 84,000 net acres.[2][4]
History[edit]
The company became a public company via an initial public offering in 1990.[5]
In 1994, the company acquired Washington Energy Resources in a $180 million stock transaction.[6]
In 1995, the company ousted John Lollar, its chairman and CEO, in part due to the ill-timing of the acquisition of Washington Energy Resources.[7]
In 2008, the company was added to the S&P 500 index.[8]
In 2013, the company sold its assets in the Marmaton play of Oklahoma and West Texas for $160 million.[9]
Controversies[edit]
Environmental damage[edit]
The company has been cited for violations in regard to spills of toxic hydro-fracking fluids in Northeastern Pennsylvania.[10]
The company was cited for improper well construction as a result of polluted drinking water.[11]
Restraining order on anti-fracking activist[edit]
In January 2014, Cabot sought, and a judge granted, a temporary injunction barring anti-fracking activist Vera Scroggins from entering on any land in Pennsylvania owned or leased by Cabot. "In total, 312.5 sq miles are no-go areas for Scroggins under a sweeping court order granted by a local judge that bars her from any properties owned or leased by one of the biggest drillers in the Pennsylvania natural gas rush, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation." It was noted by Cabot during court testimony that Scroggins had violated no laws and that this lawsuit was based on her being considered a "nuisance" due to her reporting and activism at Cabot sites.[12]

Current operations[edit]
As of December 31, 2016, the company had 8.576 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved reserves, of which 96.5% was natural gas on an energy-equivalent basis, and 92% were in the Marcellus Shale. In 2016, the company produced 627.1 billion cubic feet equivalent of natural gas.[2]
The company operates in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, where it controls approximately 179,000 net acres[2][3] as well as in the Eagle Ford Shale, where it controls approximately 84,000 net acres.[2][4]
History[edit]
The company became a public company via an initial public offering in 1990.[5]
In 1994, the company acquired Washington Energy Resources in a $180 million stock transaction.[6]
In 1995, the company ousted John Lollar, its chairman and CEO, in part due to the ill-timing of the acquisition of Washington Energy Resources.[7]
In 2008, the company was added to the S&P 500 index.[8]
In 2013, the company sold its assets in the Marmaton play of Oklahoma and West Texas for $160 million.[9]
Controversies[edit]
Environmental damage[edit]
The company has been cited for violations in regard to spills of toxic hydro-fracking fluids in Northeastern Pennsylvania.[10]
The company was cited for improper well construction as a result of polluted drinking water.[11]
Restraining order on anti-fracking activist[edit]
In January 2014, Cabot sought, and a judge granted, a temporary injunction barring anti-fracking activist Vera Scroggins from entering on any land in Pennsylvania owned or leased by Cabot. "In total, 312.5 sq miles are no-go areas for Scroggins under a sweeping court order granted by a local judge that bars her from any properties owned or leased by one of the biggest drillers in the Pennsylvania natural gas rush, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation." It was noted by Cabot during court testimony that Scroggins had violated no laws and that this lawsuit was based on her being considered a "nuisance" due to her reporting and activism at Cabot sites.[12]

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Hydrocarbon Mapping Co.,LLC is in the business of finding oil and gas reservoirs for its customers.  We have found reservoirs in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Illinois and more that operators are producing. We have found wildcat reservoirs, expanded old fields and helped determine where to drill within old fields for new production.          HYDROCARBON MAPPING CO., LLCWE FIND OIL AND GAS RESERVOIRS.​  WE HAVE PROSPECTS FOR SALE IN OIL COUNTRY.  SEE THE PROSPECS PAGE FOR A LIST.    ALL IMAGES ON THIS WEBSITE ARE COPYRIGHT PROTECTED.  ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________HYDROCARBON MAPPING Hydrocarbon Mapping is a  company formed for the purpose of locating hydrocarbon reservoirs. Our procedure is to 1st define the area that you want surveyed for oil and gas reservoirs. We usually first define the location of faults and fractures. This helps to define probable traps and trends. After this the hydrocarbon survey is done to help determine if there are any potential reservoirs. If there are good hydrocarbon signatures we then define the reservoir size. After this the quality of the reservoir is defined. When a reservoir is located we then work on the probability of production. This is simply defined by the color intensity of a reservoir. Our discovery rate is limited to where a client dictates that Hydrocarbon Mapping Co.,LLC surveys. The clients that have the greatest success are companies that commission regional surveys and companies that are extending reservoirs in known fields or are in oil and gas country where there are known reservoirs. The regional surveys are performed in an effort to locate reservoirs within several thousand acres. Once a reservoir is located then larger scale maps are developed that define these reservoirs in more detail.The exploration methods used by Hydrocarbon Mapping are based on data and methods used by experienced oil finders. One data source is light signature that emanates from every known material in the Universe. Every molecule in the Universe has a unique light signature that defines what it is. Astro physicists are able to study planets and stars and define their material composition. They can define what materials the solids are and what material the gases are made up of. A scientist can determine the material that a planet is composed of from the light signature. Light signature enables definition of oil and gas reservoirs. Oil reservoirs differ in many ways. Gravity, parrifin content, gas content, water content, etc. The DNA, that is light signature, can define separate oil reservoirs and gas reservoirs. This helps to determine multiple stacked reservoirs.Hydrocarbon Mapping Co.,LLC accesses data from tools that are placed on earthorbit satellites. We use all of these tools to incorporate the following information in the finished product: Radar, Infrared (Temperature), Gamma Ray (Radiometrics), Dialectiric Potential (Telluric), Ionization and Geo-Magnetic. The remote sensing data is combined in order to produce reservoir survey results. Hydrocarbon Mapping Co.,LLC also uses a proprietary method of locating and mapping oil and gas reservoirs. This method is proving to be very successful and cost effective.Hydrocarbon Mapping surveys properties for oil and gas companies, mineral owners and oil and gas investors.                                Our company has found many oil & gas reservoirs.  We use several remote sensing techniques                                 to generate a finished product for our customers. The finished product is a hydrocarbon survey                                 presented on Google Earth aerial maps.                                  GPS locations are presented on hot spots if requested.                                Faults and fractures are included on the hydrocarbon survey map.                                Final presentation is emailed so that they can be viewed on your computer.                                We feel like we are the best in the business offering a unique product to our clients.                                                                                                                                                                                      6860 N.
