About Intercept




Intercept is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics to treat progressive non-viral liver diseases.
Intercept’s lead product, OCALIVA® (obeticholic acid), was granted accelerated approval by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May of 2016 for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis, previously known as primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA. OCALIVA is the first PBC therapy that targets the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a key regulator of bile acid, inflammatory, fibrotic and metabolic pathways. For more information, please visit ocaliva.com.
Obeticholic acid (OCA) is also being evaluated for potential indications across a variety of additional chronic liver diseases, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and biliary atresia. The FDA has granted OCA breakthrough therapy designation for the treatment of NASH with liver fibrosis. Intercept owns worldwide rights to OCA outside of Japan, China, and Korea, where it has out-licensed the product candidate to Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma.
Founded in 2002 in New York, New York, Intercept now has operations in the United States, Europe, Canada, and Australia.
OCALIVA is a registered trademark of Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is an American biopharmaceutical company incorporated in 2002, focusing on the development of novel synthetic bile acid analogs to treat chronic liver diseases, such as primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) now called primary biliary cholangitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH), cirrhosis, portal hypertension, primary sclerosing cholangitis and also the intestinal disorder, bile acid diarrhea.

Products[edit]
The company's lead product is obeticholic acid, OCA, also known as 6-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid or INT-747, marketed as Ocaliva. OCA is a potent first-in-class farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist. As of March 2017, Ocaliva is approved in the US and the EU for use in primary biliary cholangitis. It is in phase III studies for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and phase II studies for primary sclerosing cholangitis.
Other products in the development pipeline include INT-767, a dual FXR/TGR5 agonist, and INT-777, a TGR5 agonist.
Initial public offering and stock history[edit]
Intercept trades on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol ICPT. The initial public offering of the stock on October 16, 2012 was at $15.[1] A follow-on public offering at $33 took place on June 24, 2013.
On January 9, 2014, the stock skyrocketed from $72.39 to $275.49, or about 280%, after a planned interim analysis by the independent data safety monitoring board showed that Obeticholic acid met the main goal (improvement of liver histology) at the mid-stage in the FLINT trial in NASH, sponsored by NIDDK.[2][3] The stock continued to climb to $497 over the next few days before falling back to around $317 on March 29, 2014, giving a market capitalization of around $6.2 billion.
In March 2014, the company released the results of the POISE study of Obeticholic acid in PBC, which showed the drug met the trial's primary endpoint of a reduction in serum alkaline phosphatase, a biomarker for the disease.[4] These results were presented at an international liver meeting in April 2014.[5]
As of 31 December 2014, the company had 136 employees.[6]

Pipeline





PipelineNovel compounds being developed for liver diseases







Intercept’s lead product, OCALIVA® (obeticholic acid), was granted accelerated approval by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May of 2016 for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis, previously known as primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA. OCALIVA is the first PBC therapy that targets the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a key regulator of bile acid, inflammatory, fibrotic and metabolic pathways. For more information, please visit ocaliva.com.


Obeticholic acid (OCA) is also being evaluated for potential indications across a variety of additional chronic liver diseases, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and biliary atresia.


The pipeline chart below shows the target indications and current stages of development of all of our product candidates.



*Formerly known as primary biliary cirrhosis.

					Full Description



Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc., incorporated on September 4, 2002, is a biopharmaceutical company. The Company is focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics to treat non-viral, progressive liver diseases. The Company's product candidates have the potential to treat orphan and more prevalent diseases for which there are limited therapeutic solutions. The Company's product candidate, obeticholic acid (OCA), is a bile acid analog, a chemical substance that has a structure based on a naturally occurring human bile acid that selectively binds to and activates the farnesoid X receptor (FXR). In addition to OCA, it is developing other bile acid analog compounds targeting FXR and a second dedicated bile acid receptor called TGR5, which is a target of interest for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and other gastrointestinal indications. The Company is also developing other products INT-767 for the treatment of fibrosis and INT-777 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.OCA is being developed to treat a range of other non-viral progressive liver diseases, such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and biliary atresia. OCA has been tested in five placebo-controlled clinical trials, including a Phase III clinical trial in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and two Phase II clinical trials in patients with NASH or a precursor disease to NASH known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). OCA has received orphan drug designation in the United States and the European Union for the treatment of PBC and PSC and breakthrough therapy designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of NASH patients with liver fibrosis. In addition to PBC and NASH, it continues to invest in research of OCA for additional patient populations with other liver diseases.INT-767 is an orally administered dual FXR and TGR5 agonist that is derived from the primary human bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). This product candidate has been shown to be approximately three times more potent than OCA as an FXR agonist. In animal models of chronic liver, intestinal and kidney diseases, INT-767 has consistently demonstrated greater anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects than OCA. INT-777 is an orally administered TGR5 agonist that is derived from the primary human bile acid cholic acid. It has completed the preclinical studies necessary for the filing of an investigational new drug (IND). In animal models of diabetes, treatment with INT-777 induced glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion, with resulting insulin sensitivity and normalization of glycemic control, increased basal energy expenditure and prevention of weight gain, and a reduction in blood lipid levels together with liver steatosis and fibrosis.The Company competes with Novartis International AG, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Allergan Plc, Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc., ENYO Pharma SAS, Metacrine, Inc., Genfit SA, Cymabay Therapeutics, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., FF Pharmaceuticals BV, GlaxoSmithKline, Novo Nordisk A/S, Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc., Cempra Pharmaceuticals, Islet Sciences, Inc., Galectin Therapeutics Inc., Zydus Pharmaceuticals Inc., NGM Biopharmaceuticals Inc., Galmed Medical Research Ltd., MediciNova, Inc., Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., FibroGen, Inc., Viking Therapeutics, Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Durect Corporation, Immuron Ltd., Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, MiNA Therapeutics, NuSirt Biopharma, Inc., Protalix Biotherapeutics, Medivation, Inc., Acorda Therapeutics, Inc., Dr. Falk Pharma GmbH and Shire plc.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

This is the most exciting time in the history of medicine. Millions of people around the world are benefiting from breakthrough treatments that save, extend and improve life.
Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

THE PROMISE OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE

PhRMA’s member companies are on the leading edge of personalized medicine development– an area that is transforming health care, improving patient outcomes and creating health system efficiencies. In a new video, Dr. Bernie Zeiher, president of development of Astellas, discusses his excitement around the promise of personalized medicine, which uses diagnostic tools to help assess the medical treatments and procedures that may be best for each patient.
“I am very optimistic about the future because the promise of personalized medicine has begun to be seen,” Dr. Zeiher says in the video. “Now, with more personalized-type therapies, you can test the tumor or test the blood to determine that in fact the person has a particular mutation, and then that will guide which therapy you would choose and it also increases the likelihood that the patient will respond.”
Dr. Zeiher’s enthusiasm reflects the commitment of America’s biopharmaceutical companies to the development of these targeted treatments. Although there were only 13 FDA-approved personalized medicines in 2006, today there are more than 140. Additionally, personalized medicines accounted for more than 25 percent of FDA approvals last year, marking a record year for these innovative therapies.
Cancer is an area where personalized medicines are having a particularly big impact, driving tremendous advances for patients with highly aggressive cancers, like non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In fact, research has shown nearly two-thirds of NSLCs have a genetic mutation that can be more effectively targeted with a personalized medicine.
Thanks to the hard work of biopharmaceutical researchers, like Dr. Zeiher, 42 percent of medications currently in the pipeline have the potential to be personalized. While the science has never been more complex, the future of research is bright with personalized medicine becoming a reality.

Product Info



What is Interceptor?Interceptor Flavor Tabs are a palatable once-a-month tablet that prevents heartworm disease, controls adult hookworms, and removes and controls adult roundworms and whipworm infections in dogs. Interceptor for cats is the only oral monthly preventative that protects against heartworms and removes adult roundworms and adult hookworms. Interceptor requires a prescription from your veterinarian.For:Dogs (4 weeks of age and weighing over 2 lbs), Cats (6 weeks of age and weighing over 1.5 lbs)Benefits:Given once a monthEasy to administerBroad spectrum activityHow it Works:Interceptor Flavor Tabs eliminate the tissue stage of heartworm larvae and the adult stage of hookworm, roundworm, and in dogs, whipworm infestations. The anthelmintic activity (destroying parasitic worms) of the active ingredient milbemycin oxime is believed to be a result of interfering with the invertebrates' neurotransmission.Cautions:Side effects of Interceptor are rare, but some animals may show signs of depression, drowsiness, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, hypersalivation, seizures, and weakness. If these or other symptoms develop, contact your veterinarian. Since humans can contract hookworm and roundworm from animals, you should maintain good personal hygiene. To prevent reinfection, cleaning up stool daily is recommended. Don't give your pet Interceptor if you are already administering another heartworm preventative.Brand Name: Interceptor (Elanco Animal Health)Generic Name: Milbemycin Oxime (mil-beh-my-sin ox-eem)What is Interceptor: Interceptor is given once a month for the prevention of heartworm disease in dogs and cats. Interceptor also protects against hookworm, roundworm and in dogs, whipworm. It is recommended by the American Heartworm Society that heartworm prevention be used year round. Interceptor is used "off label" in the treatment of sarcoptic mange in dogs.What should I discuss with my veterinarian before giving Interceptor to my pet: Tell your veterinarian if your pet has ever had an allergic reaction to Interceptor or milbemycin.What is the most important information I should know about Interceptor: Interceptor is a prescription medication FDA approved for use in dogs and cats. Interceptor is available as artificial beef (derived from pork and soy protein) flavored chewable tablets. The usual dose of Interceptor for dogs 2 to 10 pounds is 2.3mg (brown box), 11 to 25 pounds is 5.75mg (green box), 26 to 50 pounds is 11.5mg (yellow box) and 51 to 100 pounds is 23mg (white box) given once a month year round. The usual dose of Interceptor for cats 1.5 to 6 pounds is 5.75mg (green box), 6.1 to 12 pounds is 11.5mg (yellow box) and 12.1 to 25 lbs is 23mg (white box) given once a month year round.How should this medication be given: Give Interceptor exactly as directed by the veterinarian. If you do not understand the directions ask the pharmacist or veterinarian to explain them to you. Heartworm testing should be performed prior to the start of prevention therapy. If your pet is off Interceptor for 6 months or less, start the medication and test after 6 months since microfilaria, that take 6 months to mature, will result in a positive test result. Store Interceptor at room temperature. Do not remove the tablet from its wrapper until ready to give the medicine. Keep this medication away from children and pets. Interceptor is safe for pregnant or lactating pets at a normal dose level.What happens if I miss giving a dose: Give the missed dose as soon as you remember. Do not give a double dose of the medication.What should I avoid while giving Interceptor to my pet: Because humans can contract hookworm and roundworm from animals, it is important to maintain good personal hygiene. It is also important to eliminate fleas on your pet and in the household and to not feed your pet rodents or uncooked meat or fish. To prevent reinfection, daily cleanup of stools is recommended.What are the possible side effects of Interceptor: Side effects of Interceptor are rare although some animals may exhibit depression, drowsiness, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, hypersalivation, seizures and weakness. If these or other symptoms develop contact your veterinarian.What other drugs will affect Interceptor: While Interceptor is safe to use in dogs at risk for MDRI-allele mutation (Australian Shepherds, Collies, Shelties, etc.), unless tested normal, caution is advised if your pet is also being given amiodarone (Cordarone), azole antifungals such as ketoconazole, carvedilol (Coreg), cyclosporine (Atopica), diltiazem (Cardizem), erythromycin (Ery-Tabs) or clarithromycin (Biaxin), quinidine, spironolactone (Aldactone), tamoxifen, and verapamil (Calan). Do not give Interceptor to your pet if your pet is already taking an alternate heartworm medication.

We use this on our Labrador-mix and American Bulldog and have never had an issue with fleas or ticks on them or or us. We also have not had problems with mosquitos or biting flies bothering them.

        Life saver for my Greyhound!
My vet recommended Interceptor as I was convinced my sweet Greyhound became ill every month when I gave her Heart Guard. She would have an upset stomach and diarrhea for days after receiving it. My vet explained I wasn't crazy, some dogs were indeed allergic to the main ingredient in Heart Guard but still need protected from heart worms so suggested Interceptor as it did not possess the ingredient making my dog ill. He was right! Six months now on Interceptor and she happily takes it burried in a piece of cheese (it is a hard chew instead of a soft chew like Heart Guard), and remains ill/symptom free. Wonderful product for a dog with allergies to Heart Guard!!

        Does so much good
Our vet recommended this product to get rid of the worms our dog gets, and also to protect her from heart worms. We live in an area where the mosquitos are healthy and abundant.  Protecting our littler girl from heart worms is very important to us.

Q&A









            My dog hates taking any form of heartworm protection, I can only give them to her orally. How big are this pills? Will they be easy to swallow of will i have to cut them into pieces?
        


Asked by: kcalta

            These pills are not very big. They are also flavored chewables to make it easier for pets to eat. They can be cut up/crushed and given with food if that will help. Just make sure the pet gets the full dose and swallows it, otherwise you will need to try again. Hope this helps.

            We have a new puppy and she's 3 months old. Our vet gave us a sample of  Interceptor Flavor Tabs for puppies (brown box/ for 2-10 lbs). I want to buy more for the coming months but I can't seem to find one for puppies. ??
        


Asked by: Rita

            The puppy and adult Interceptor are the same medication and is dosed by weight.  Since your puppy is still growing, purchasing a 6 month supply at her current weight might not be the most economical since she may outgrow a smaller size before the 6 months is finished.  Our veterinarian recommends purchasing one month at a time based upon the weight until an adult weight is reached.  Many veterinarians sell heartworm prevention in a single dose versus having to purchase 6 months on-line.  Check with your veterinarian at your puppy's next visit, which should be  a month after the last visit/last vaccination date (they need boosters every 3-4 weeks until they are 4 months old).

            My dog is between 8 lbs and 8.5 lbs.
Which product by weight is best.
        


Asked by: Jazzy

            You should use the Interceptor for 2-10 pounds to prevent heartworms and deworm for hookworms, roundworms and tapeworms.  If you want to add flea control, using Trifexis 5-10 pound would be your best product, IMO.

            We are going from Ontario to Florida for 2 weeks.  Our dog was on Interceptor over the summer but not since, our vet recommend one dose of Interceptor - when is the best time to give it?  Her bloodiest is negative for heartworm.  Thanks.
        


Asked by: Joanne

            Since all heartworm preventatives kill the  larval stages acquired during the past month, I recommend that you give your dog the Interceptor table during the first week after you get back home from your trip.

            If a cat has heart worms can u use this product
        


Asked by: Cyndi

            Interceptor is not approved for use on heartworm positive dogs and cats.  However, you can use either Revolution or Advantage Multi as both of those products are approved and safe for use in pets with active heartworm disease.

            Does interceptor control tapeworm&nbsp;
        


Asked by: Tonya

            Regular Interceptor does not control tapeworms, but Interceptor Plus does.

            I used interceptor for my yellow lab puppy when he was picked up for the breeder at 6 weeks old and again at 9 weeks as recommended by the vet. He has now had diarrhea for a full week, is there anything you can suggest?
        


Asked by: Samm

            Interceptor is a very safe product but there is always a chance your puppy can not tolerate it well.  To be certain something else isn't causing the diarrhea, such as a food intolerance, eating something from the garbage or picked up outside, or even certain diseases, a trip to your vet is definitely in order.

Product Info



What is K9 Advantix II? K9 Advantix II is a monthly preventative for dogs that offers comprehensive protection against ticks, fleas, mosquitoes, biting flies, and chewing lice. K9 Advantix II is a top veterinarian-recommended brand because it repels and kills all life stages of fleas (eggs, pupae, larvae, and adult fleas) and ticks (Deer ticks, American dog ticks, Brown dog ticks, and Lone Star ticks). K9 Advantix II kills 98-100 percent of fleas within 12 hours and continues working for one month to prevent infestations. Fleas and ticks are killed on contact with a treated dog, which means that fleas don't have to bite and ticks don't have to attach to die. This helps prevent transmission of flea-borne and tick-borne diseases such as tapeworms, Lyme disease, tick paralysis, ehrlichia, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Killing fleas before they bite may also help prevent skin allergies caused by flea saliva. As well, K9 Advantix II repels mosquitoes before they bite, which may help prevent transmission of heartworms. K9 Advantix II  protects your pet before parasites have a chance to bite, not after.For: Dogs and Puppies (only over 4 lbs and 7 weeks of age or older)Benefits: Repels and kills disease-carrying fleas, ticks, and mosquitoes before they bite Kills all life stages of fleas (eggs, pupae, larvae, and adult fleas) and ticks (Deer ticks, American dog ticks, Brown dog ticks, and Lone Star ticks) Kills 98-100 percent of adult fleas within 12 hoursEnds flea life cycle by preventing flea offspring (eggs, pupae, and larvae) from maturing into adult fleasRepels biting flies and kills chewing liceProvides one month of protection against ticks, fleas, mosquitoes, biting fliesWaterproof - continues working even after your dog becomes wetHow K9 Advantix II Works:K9 Advantix II combines imidacloprid and permethrin to repel and kill fleas, ticks, and mosquitoes. Both ingredients work on contact, attacking parasite nerve cells at different sites. Together these ingredients overwhelm the nervous system killing the parasite. Pyriproxyfen is an insect growth regulator. K9 Advantix II topical solution also repels biting flies and kills lice.Cautions:DO NOT USE ON CATS. Cats cannot metabolize the ingredients used in this product. Cats must be separated from dogs during treatment. Do not allow your cat to come in contact with a treated dog for 24 hours. Some small and medium dogs may have an adverse skin reaction. Brand Name: K9 Advantix II (Bayer)Active Ingredient(s): Imidacloprid (8.8%), Permethrin (44.0%), Pyriproxyfen (0.44%), Other ingredients (46.76%) What is this product used for: K9 Advantix II is for use on dogs and puppies 4 lbs or more and 7 weeks of age or older only. It is used for the topical prevention and treatment of ticks, fleas, mosquitoes, biting flies, and chewing lice on dogs. Repels and kills ticks including deer ticks (the major carrier of Lyme disease), American dog ticks, Brown dog ticks and lone star ticks. K9 Advantix II repels and kills all life stages of fleas, repels and kills mosquitoes, kills chewing lice, and repels biting flies.  Availability: K9 Advantix II is a non-prescription (OTC) product available as 0.014 fl oz (0.4 ml) applicators for dogs 4-10 lbs (Green), 0.034 fl oz (1.0 ml) applicators for dogs 11-20 lbs (Teal), 0.084 fl oz (2.5 ml) applicators for dogs 21-55 lbs (Red), and 0.135 fl oz (4.0 ml) applicators for dogs over 55 lbs (Blue). How this product should be used: For use only on dogs. Do not use on cats or on other animals. Have the dog standing for easy application. Part the hair on the dog's back, between the shoulder blades, until the skin is visible. For dogs up to 20 lbs, apply the entire contents of the applicator tube to 2 or 3 spots on the top of the back from the shoulder to the base of the tail. For dogs 21 lbs and over, apply the entire contents of the applicator tube to 4 or 6 spots on the top of the back from the shoulder to the base of the tail. If the household has cats or other animals, separate from the treated dog for 24 hours.  What are the side effects:  Individual sensitivities, while rare, may occur after using any pesticide product for pets. A small percentage of dogs have had adverse reactions to K9 Advantix II. A sensation of burning, tingling, itching, redness or numbness of the skin may occur after topical application. This sensation usually begins 1-2 hours after application. In addition, reactions have occurred in cats that have been exposed to a medicated dog. That is why it is  important to separate your cat from a medicated dog for 24 hours. Bayer, the manufacturer of K9 Advantix II, indicates that some of these symptoms will dissipate within 48 hours; however, if your pet is experiencing adverse reactions, please complete the following steps:  Stop applying the medication Wash your dog with a detergent based soap (Dawn or Palmolive dish detergents work best). Do not scrub the affected area, as this may cause more skin irritation. Please note: This process is applicable for both dogs and cats. Call your veterinarian Call Bayer Emergency Support Line at 1-800-422-9874. Let Bayer know your dog is having an adverse reaction to K9 Advantix by calling 1-800-422-9874. This line is staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  What special precautions are there: This product is for external use only on dogs and puppies 4 lbs or more and 7 weeks or older. Consult a veterinarian before using on medicated animals and debilitated, aged, pregnant or nursing animals. Do not get this product in dog's eyes or mouth. Do not use this product on animals other than dogs. In households with cats, separate the treated dog for about 24 hours. Due to their unique physiology and inability to metabolize certain compounds, this product must not be used on cats. If applied to a cat, or ingested by a cat which actively grooms a recently treated dog, this product may have serious harmful effects. If this occurs, contact your veterinarian immediately. It is important to apply this product no more than once a month and to use the correct strength for the weight of the dog. This product is harmful to humans if swallowed.

        Greatest Overall Protection!
We live in S. Florida where we are inundated with all types of tiny creatures year round, & our dogs are very susceptible to fleas, ticks, & especially mosquitoes, which here, have been known to carry the Zika virus. This is the only product out there that protects our babies from everything, including mosquitoes; they have never yet had a mosquito bite! Great protection.

        great tasting...
Come to think of it neither dogs ever had a tick.  It must be the product that is successfully protecting my furkids.  Enough about me, let's talk about you, what do you think of me?  PetMeds has really been fiscally supportive by offering top quality products (many choices) at a lower price.  thanks.

Q&A









            Okay so my dog used to have heartworms and I just want to know Can I use this with heart guard plus? or does it protect against them alone? And if so will it work as well as heartguard plus? I don't want her to get heartworms again.&nbsp;
        


Asked by: Anniesmom

            K9 Advantix helps prevent the transmission of heartworms, it does not protect against your dog getting heartworms. Adding Heartgard plus is safe and will work better to protect your dog against getting heartworms.

            Doe K9 advantix II have the tick and fleas and mosquitoes in pill form? Thanks Betty
        


Asked by: none

            The K9 Advantix medication only comes as an applicator to be applied topically on the dog. There is no pill form. There are other medications however that are pills and can be taken orally that work against fleas, ticks, and mosquitos. I would talk to your Vet about these options and what is best for your dog.

            Why is the price almost 20 dollars more today then yesterday when checked? Then u offer a coupon?
        


Asked by: DEBBIE

            It may be that the coupon amount has changed from the usual 10% to 15% (for a limited time) and you caught the website in the process of changing numbers around.

Asked by: Debbie

            its best to get the 12 pk if you can afford it because fleas are around 12 months of the year now, thanks to global warming, the larger pkg the better savings you will get &amp; God forbid if something happen to your family pet you can donate whats left over to your vet office for people that cant afford it. My vet has an angel fund for families that need help.

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is an American biopharmaceutical company incorporated in 2002, focusing on the development of novel synthetic bile acid analogs to treat chronic liver diseases, such as primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) now called primary biliary cholangitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH), cirrhosis, portal hypertension, primary sclerosing cholangitis and also the intestinal disorder, bile acid diarrhea.

Products[edit]
The company's lead product is obeticholic acid, OCA, also known as 6-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid or INT-747, marketed as Ocaliva. OCA is a potent first-in-class farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist. As of March 2017, Ocaliva is approved in the US and the EU for use in primary biliary cholangitis. It is in phase III studies for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and phase II studies for primary sclerosing cholangitis.
Other products in the development pipeline include INT-767, a dual FXR/TGR5 agonist, and INT-777, a TGR5 agonist.
Initial public offering and stock history[edit]
Intercept trades on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol ICPT. The initial public offering of the stock on October 16, 2012 was at $15.[1] A follow-on public offering at $33 took place on June 24, 2013.
On January 9, 2014, the stock skyrocketed from $72.39 to $275.49, or about 280%, after a planned interim analysis by the independent data safety monitoring board showed that Obeticholic acid met the main goal (improvement of liver histology) at the mid-stage in the FLINT trial in NASH, sponsored by NIDDK.[2][3] The stock continued to climb to $497 over the next few days before falling back to around $317 on March 29, 2014, giving a market capitalization of around $6.2 billion.
In March 2014, the company released the results of the POISE study of Obeticholic acid in PBC, which showed the drug met the trial's primary endpoint of a reduction in serum alkaline phosphatase, a biomarker for the disease.[4] These results were presented at an international liver meeting in April 2014.[5]
As of 31 December 2014, the company had 136 employees.[6]

Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is an American biopharmaceutical company incorporated in 2002, focusing on the development of novel synthetic bile acid analogs to treat chronic liver diseases, such as primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) now called primary biliary cholangitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH), cirrhosis, portal hypertension, primary sclerosing cholangitis and also the intestinal disorder, bile acid diarrhea.

Products[edit]
The company's lead product is obeticholic acid, OCA, also known as 6-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid or INT-747, marketed as Ocaliva. OCA is a potent first-in-class farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist. As of March 2017, Ocaliva is approved in the US and the EU for use in primary biliary cholangitis. It is in phase III studies for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and phase II studies for primary sclerosing cholangitis.
Other products in the development pipeline include INT-767, a dual FXR/TGR5 agonist, and INT-777, a TGR5 agonist.
Initial public offering and stock history[edit]
Intercept trades on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol ICPT. The initial public offering of the stock on October 16, 2012 was at $15.[1] A follow-on public offering at $33 took place on June 24, 2013.
On January 9, 2014, the stock skyrocketed from $72.39 to $275.49, or about 280%, after a planned interim analysis by the independent data safety monitoring board showed that Obeticholic acid met the main goal (improvement of liver histology) at the mid-stage in the FLINT trial in NASH, sponsored by NIDDK.[2][3] The stock continued to climb to $497 over the next few days before falling back to around $317 on March 29, 2014, giving a market capitalization of around $6.2 billion.
In March 2014, the company released the results of the POISE study of Obeticholic acid in PBC, which showed the drug met the trial's primary endpoint of a reduction in serum alkaline phosphatase, a biomarker for the disease.[4] These results were presented at an international liver meeting in April 2014.[5]
As of 31 December 2014, the company had 136 employees.[6]
