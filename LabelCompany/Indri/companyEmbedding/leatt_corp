CAPE TOWN, South Africa, May 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- 
Best First Revenue Quarter Since Inception; Strong Start to 2017








Leatt Corporation (OTCQB: LEAT) today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.  Leatt Corporation develops and markets protective equipment and ancillary products for many forms of sports, especially extreme high-velocity sports.  All financial numbers are in U.S. dollars.
For the three months ended March 31, 2017, revenues were $5.82 million, with a net income of $272,000, or $0.05 per share, as compared to revenues of $4.83 million, with a net income of $113,000, or $0.02 per share, for the 2016 first quarter.
"We had an excellent first quarter, our best since the Company's inception in terms of revenue, which made for a very strong and promising start to 2017," said CEO Sean Macdonald. "Our global revenues were up 21 percent and our EBIDTA increased by 82 percent. Our entire team was delighted to see apparel sales--a relatively new category for us--gaining traction, and increases in sales of neck braces, body armor and knee braces during the quarter. While our revenues may fluctuate from quarter to quarter at this stage of our development, we are all energized by the promise and potential for the rest of the year. We continue to build on our strategic goal of expanding our pipeline of unique, precision engineered, extraordinary protective gear designed to enable riders at all levels to push themselves to more physical heights."
First Quarter Highlights

Sales growth in neck brace, body armor and apparel increased revenue by 21 percent; an increase of almost $1 million 
Neck brace revenues increased 26 percent, with growth in both US and international markets 
Body Armor sales increased 26 percent 
Latest generation knee brace, the C-Frame Pro, shipped to customers 
Highly anticipated 3.0 All Mountain Helmets shipped to customers

Macdonald continued, "We have invested in the global bicycle industry, a potentially expansive revenue stream for us. We are aggressively building out our bicycle line of products and our global bicycle distribution network.
"Another key highlight of the 2017 first quarter was the shipping of our highly-anticipated 3.0 All Mountain bicycle helmets to our customers worldwide.  Shortly after the quarter ended, we launched our entire 2017 bicycle line, including the new bicycle helmets, to consumers, dealers and media at the Sea Otter Classic in California."
Founder and Chairman, Dr. Christopher Leatt, added, "We continue to lead in product engineering and innovation, as demonstrated by our latest generation knee brace, the C-Frame Pro, which shipped in the 2017 first quarter. Designed by our biomedical engineering team, this medically certified knee brace is our lightest, slimmest, most durable knee brace, featuring great comfort while eliminating excessive forces to the femur and tibia, reducing potential ACL, MCL and meniscus injuries by reducing rotational forces and lateral loading as well as a better, longer lasting hinge mechanism that replicates the natural motions of the knee joint."
Business Outlook 
Macdonald said, "Based on our strong start and our growing catalogue of innovative products, we believe that 2017 will be an important year in terms of revenue growth and increased shareholder value.  While periodic fluctuations may occur in the coming quarters, we are pleased to see the purchasing patterns and inventory stock holdings of some of our largest international customers begin to stabilize after the negative impact of currency fluctuations in prior periods.
"Our entire team is also very pleased with the favorable reception that our 2018 bicycle line received from some of our bicycle customers who tried out our latest gear on the slopes at our recent bicycle customer conference and praised the unique nature of our innovative features. We continue to push marketing of our new product categories and build brand equity through attendance at such grass roots events.
"I would also like to congratulate our rider, Marvin Musquin, who continues to pile up wins and is appearing on the podium more and more. We are very proud of him, and we are thrilled that he represents the Leatt brand."
Leatt continued to meet its working capital needs from cash on hand and internally generated cash flow from operations.  At March 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 million, a current ratio of 3:1, and there was no long-term debt.
Conference Call: 
The Company will host a conference call at 10:00 am ET on May 12, 2017, to discuss the 2017 first quarter results.  Participants should dial in ten minutes before the scheduled call time, using 1-888-348-8777 (USA) or +1-412-902-4245 (international) to access the call.
Audio Webcast: 
There will also be a simultaneous live webcast through the Company's website, www.leatt-corp.com. Participants should register on the website approximately ten minutes prior to the start of the webcast.
Replay: 
An audio replay of the conference call will be available for seven days and can be accessed by dialing 1-844-512-2921 (USA) or +1-412-317-6671 (international) and using passcode 10106859.

CAPE TOWN, South Africa, Sept. 12, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Leatt Corporation (OTCQB: LEAT), a global developer, marketer and distributor of personal protective equipment for all forms of sports, and whose products include the flagship Leatt-Brace®, announced today that it has expanded its Motocross/Off-Road Range of products for 2017. The new portfolio adds a wide array of apparel designs, as well as high-performance protection gear, including new helmets.








The new launch, which was publicly debuted at Crankworx Whistler in British Columbia, follows Leatt's recent launch of new bicycling products into new, broader consumer markets.
Sean Macdonald, CEO of Leatt Corporation, commented: "We are very pleased with the 2017 Leatt Range of products and would like to take this opportunity to highlight its new additions. As we have done with our new 2017 Bicycle Range, we are reaching out to a broader group of buyers with our new riding gear, while still maintaining our focus on protection, performance and technical innovation. Our new moto/off-road line includes limb, joint and chest protection products, along with four jerseys, two pants, two jackets and five glove selections.  Today, we are much more than a neck brace company. We have expanded into a whole new catalogue of products including gear, backpacks and apparel with new lines of jerseys, pants, jackets and other innovations."
Macdonald added, "The Company also launched an ECE specific and ECE/DOT specific versions of the Off-road GPX 5.5 and 6.5 helmets.  We hope to begin shipment of these helmets during the fourth quarter of 2016 and into 2017. In line with our culture of continuous improvement and innovation, we have enhanced our entire helmet range to appeal to a wider consumer group by refining our sizing, as well as by introducing the lighter ECE version. The new ECE version helmet is fifteen percent lighter than the DOT version and specifically designed for the European market. We believe this will give us a competitive edge in the market."
"In the creation of this new 2017 line, we have paid extra-attention to the needs of a vast array of riders at all levels, and our team riders play an important role in driving these innovation and design efforts," Macdonald stated. "The new apparel range provides great brand exposure due to its high visibility and we expect to continue expanding our engineering and design intelligence beyond protection products as we explore new areas for improvement and expansion."
Further highlights for 2017 is the newly-designed C-Frame Pro Carbon knee brace, with three-point force distribution, and super stiff, forged C-arm, mono-hinged construction designed to sharply reduce knee injuries. It is certified as a medical device in the European Union and the US and CE-tested and certified as impact protection. The new line also includes knee brace pants, knee brace socks and knee brace sleeves that reinforce the brace's protection. All the new Leatt helmet designs incorporate the ground-breaking 360° Turbine Technology. These turbines are set inside the helmet and are made of 3D-molded Armourgel® which stiffens upon impact. The turbines deform to absorb both vertical and rotational impact forces.

Leatt Introduces 2017 Bicycling Range Featuring New Helmet Technology, Cycling Apparel
New Range includes Expanded Protection Gear Product Portfolio, plus 360 Degree Turbine Technology for Helmets to Absorb Vertical and Rotational Impact Forces
PR Newswire
CAPE TOWN, South Africa, Aug. 25, 2016

CAPE TOWN, South Africa, Aug. 25, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Leatt Corporation (OTCQB: LEAT), a global developer, marketer and distributor of personal protective equipment for all forms of sports, and whose products include the flagship Leatt-Brace®, announced today the introduction of its new 2017 Bicycling Range, expanding its existing product portfolio of protection gear, backpacks and gloves to include all-new helmets and, for the first time, a line of cycling apparel designed for a wider group of mountain bike riders.
"The new bicycling products represent the latest in Leatt's strategic initiative to expand its product catalogue into larger consumer markets and new categories, while maintaining its reputation for technologically driven innovative design," noted Sean Macdonald, CEO of Leatt Corporation. 
"Leatt is addressing a new group of consumers," Macdonald said. "We have made the transition in bicycling products, from the Gravity-MTB niche to a wider all-mountain target group, while sticking to our roots.  We continue to offer highly functional gear with lab-proven safety features and technical innovation, but to a much larger, more global market and consumer base." 
"We are building on our areas of strength, in particular on our helmet lines, which have been well received in the marketplace," Macdonald added. "We believe that our ground-breaking 360° Turbine Technology incorporated in the 2017 Bicycling Helmet Range surpasses anything else on the market in terms of advanced design, comfort and protection."
Two models of the DBX 3.0 helmet are available, an All-Mountain half shell and an Enduro version with a removable chin bar that allows riders to easily go from uphill to downhill riding in two clicks.  The new 2017 DBX Enduro and All-Mountain helmets incorporate ground-breaking 360° Turbine Technology set inside the helmet and is made of 3D molded Armourgel® which stiffens on impact. The turbines deform to absorb both vertical and rotational impact forces during a fall.  In Leatt Lab trials this technology reduces up to 30% of head impact at concussion level and up to 40% of rotational acceleration to the head and brain. The helmets are further equipped with 18 ventilation vents, a magnetic Fidlock® buckle, easy custom fitting with the turn of a dial, and an adjustable breakaway visor.
Leatt's 2017 technical apparel line features various styles, including four styles of jerseys, three styles of shorts and two styles of jackets covering a wide range of price points. The 5.0 All Mountain Jersey range includes features such as tape-bonded seams for maximum comfort, quick dry Miharo material, a neck collar designed for use with and without a neck brace, a silicone lined jersey designed to grip the wearer's shorts and zipper pockets with microfiber goggle wiper. 
Leatt shorts have a strong 3D pre-curved fit, cycling specific seamless crotch, and are also available in waterproof hard-shell versions.  The new hard- and soft-shell jackets utilize tech-fabrics developed by Leatt, all constructed to be used with and without a neck brace.
The existing gloves and backpack collection has also been expanded for 2017. Overall four glove styles offer different levels of protection, utilizing over-injected Armourgel® panels. Unique to all of them is a Nanogrip® palm made of fibers that are 7,500 thinner than human hair. Nanogrip® is very breathable and robust like a kevlar-blend and eliminates the need for rubber prints, as it grips well, even when soaking wet. 
An all-new Hydration Cargo 3.0 DBX backpack offers ten liters of storage room, an additional three liters' bladder, a CE Level 2 back protector, and Leatt's unique chest harness system for a solid fit.
About Leatt Corporation

The Leatt-Brace® is an award-winning neck brace system considered the gold standard for neck protection for anyone wearing a crash helmet as a form of protection.
