You'll also incur losses due to leasing commissions, making improvements for new tenants in areas like office design and promotional offers to attract new tenants.

The Best Time to Look for Office Space






Tweet






















The best time to look for new office space depends on your company’s size, needs and location. There is no one-size-fits-all formula for determining when the search for office space should begin, but it is critical not to wait until the last minute. Commercial real estate becomes available at all different times during the year, so you don't have to be concerned with meeting any seasonal deadlines. Selecting office space for your upcoming relocation can be a very complex and unfamiliar endeavor, one that may take months or even years.
For most businesses, the stakes for choosing an optimal location are high. Settling on an office space in the wrong location could be costly to a business, while not accurately planning for growth could mean moving again in a few years, which strains both budget and productivity. The moving process itself can be expensive and time consuming, which is why it’s important to begin the search early. Office space costs are generally the second biggest cost to a company (preceded by employee costs), so it's important to spend enough time evaluating your needs and options.

Tips to Keep in Mind the Next Time You Negotiate Your Lease






Tweet






















Leases can be subject to change from year to year based on your contract terms. As your business approaches its lease renewal, entering into negotiations can be beneficial for both your business and your landlord. The topics of negotiation will vary widely, depending on your business’s needs, your lease terms and the fluctuating real estate market, but one of the best ways to successfully negotiate a lease renewal is to be well researched and prepared. Gaining insight into your business needs and the needs and position of your landlord will make lease negotiations proceed with more ease and clarity. As your business moves forward into the negotiating phase, consider the following five tips:

5 Things to Consider when Deciding to Buy vs. Lease






Tweet






















For most businesses, office space is a necessity. When faced with the possibility of leasing or buying, how should your business decide which is better? Making this decision can be a daunting task, as many factors, both in and out of the business itself, must be carefully weighed and analyzed before a final decision is made. Before making a move, consider the following five questions:
1. What are the chances of relocating, expanding, or downsizing in the foreseeable future?

How to Choose an Office Space Design for Your Type of Business






Tweet






















Increasingly, more companies are looking for efficient and creative ways to use their office space. Smart office space design can mean leaner energy use and more efficient workflow. Alternative workspace arrangements involve moving beyond the standard square foot per associate calculation, integrating spatial, behavioral and technical factors in workspace design and space allocation. The trend has emphasized the importance of collaboration and communication in the workplace. Just how to achieve that harmonious balance varies according to the business and its specific work methods. Offices have transformed from simply a place-to-work to a place-to-innovate, fostering idea sharing and (hopefully) happier employees. The concept of a one size fits all office space is obsolete and inefficient, which is why businesses are taking more interest in office design strategies and the benefits they can bring to a company.

High Tech Companies Responsible for 20% of US Office Leasing Activities in 2014






Tweet






















The thriving technology sector is playing an important role in the recovery of the U.S. office market, as recent rental activity indicates. According to CBRE Group, Inc.'s August 2014 research report, U.S. Tech-Twenty: Measuring Office Market Impact, the high tech sector has created one fourth of all office-using jobs created between 2009 and May 2014. The booming job growth in the tech sector is directly reflected in national office leasing activity. In 2014, the high tech sector accounted for 20% of all U.S. office leasing activity, making it the top office leasing industry in the U.S., and there is little reason to expect that percentage to drop anytime soon.

Tech firms in both the private and public sector are indicating growth in the upcoming years, meaning office expansions are on the horizon, and with the high tech industry far outpacing its peers in growth, the leasing trend is expected to remain strong. What exactly does this growth mean for high tech companies in search of office space? The importance of finding the right office space for current and future needs is becoming increasingly imperative.

Office Move – What Does This Mean to My IT Department?

Technology and office furniture will likely be the two items with the longest lead times for your new space.  They also have significant dependencies on each other, especially as it relates to cabling requirements for furniture.  Make sure that you include team leaders from the technology and office management organizations on your move project team.

The nature of the company's business services requires a significant amount of spending and priority for its data systems control and operations. With two data centers (primary and business continuity), the department utilizes NetApp for its SAN storage and data infrastructure and is constantly on the search for cloud computing alternatives. 

Virtualization of the server environment has helped with department cost management as the cost of enterprise storage increases. The networking group works closely with the storage and server groups as it interfaces with the same technologies. The IT infrastructure group, meanwhile, spends its resources on application services and project management functions.

Style Scores:



D Value | C Growth | A Momentum | C VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
