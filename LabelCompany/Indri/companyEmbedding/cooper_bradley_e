	Do you want to know how to get hair like Bradley Cooper, star of such films as “The Wedding Crashers,” “Midnight Meat Train” and “The Hangover”? Then follow these simple instructions and your hair will be looking like Bradley Cooper's before you know it.


Grow it out. If you want to get hair like Bradley Cooper, first things first: grow out your locks. Cooper’s hair has mostly been medium-length to long. So if you have a buzz cut or a high and tight, lay off the clippers and let those strands grow. You’ll know it’s long enough when hair from the top of your head touches below the top of your ears.

Know your hair type. If your hair is curly, you may need to get it straightened at a salon. If you’re okay with the curly version of hair like Bradley Cooper, feel free to proceed. If your hair is straight, you’ve nothing to worry about. If your hair is naturally wavy, however, be aware that you may need to get extra help to tame it.

Know your hairline. Bradley Cooper has a straight hairline with no widow’s peak or receding spots. Because of this, he can comb his hair straight back. If you have a widow’s peak or receding spots, you can comb straight back too, but be aware that this may result in natural parts that result in your hair hanging on the side of your head. You can still get hair like Bradley Cooper, you just need to know that this will factor into how you style and manage it.

Get it layered. Cooper’s hair is layered. That may sound like a term used only for women’s hairstyles, but the truth is that layering your hair is what will keep it both manageable and presentable. Without layering it, your hair will be the same length all the way around and that will definitely not look attractive, let alone help you get hair like Bradley Cooper. If you’re concerned about money and don’t want to pay big bucks for a high-end salon (not to mention trading in your Man Card), don’t worry. A trip to any commercial salon that offers ten to fifteen dollar men’s haircuts will do the trick.

Blow drying. Once your hair is long enough and layered, the first tip toward styling it like Cooper is to know how to blow dry it properly. You can’t just stand in front of the mirror and shake the dryer around your head. To get the right look, bend over and let your hair hang. Blow it completely dry. When you stand up, if your hair is thick your hair will poof out into a giant afro, but don’t be dismayed. Take a brush and comb your hair straight back on all sides. This will tamp it down just enough that when you put in your hair products, the hair will retain its body. This keeps it from matting down and will give you hair like Bradley Cooper. If your hair is thin, you might experience a small bit of afro, but not much.

Product. You will need at least two types of product to get hair like Bradley Cooper: non-hardening gel or pomade and light hair spray. The non-hardening gel or pomade is essential as this is what will make your hair manageable and further reduce the afro look you get after blow drying. Rub the gel or pomade all over your palms and between your fingers, then slide them through your hair from front to back. Don’t use more than a quarter’s worth, as too much will make your hair heavy and eliminate the body. Once it’s laying down nicely, apply the hair spray in short, quick bursts for a finishing hold. Voila, hair like Bradley Cooper!


	If you want to get hair like Bradley Cooper, you’ll need patience to grow it out and to put in a few minutes of extra work in shaping it every day. This routine should take you no more than five to seven minutes every morning, so you don’t have to deal with a time-consuming process and can still get hair like Bradley Cooper.

Gallery: 7 Things You Probably Didn’t Know About Wonder Woman Gal Gadot









Wonder Woman has critics talking all sorts of good stuff (93 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, anyone?), but one thing that really stands out is star Gal Gadot. Not only is she super talented, but she’s also super hot, and she has quite an interesting background, too. Read some fun facts and see some sexy pics on the following pages.







1. She’s a former Miss Israel: The Israeli model competed in and won the Miss Israel title in 2004, when she was 18 years old. Anyone with eyes can easily see why she took home the crown!







2. She wasn’t feeling the Miss Universe pageant at all: When she represented Israel at the competition in Ecuador, Gadot didn’t really try to win because she decided the pageant life wasn’t for her. “I’m just not that type of girl,” she told Jimmy Kimmel in 2016.







3. Like the role she plays in the movie, she’s pretty badass in real life, too: Gadot served two years in the Israeli Defense Forces. "Part of being Israeli is to go to the army,” she told People magazine. “All my friends went, my parents went and my grandparents went.” In related news, she caused a bit of a stir when she posed for Maxim magazine’s “Women of Israel Defense Forces” photo feature in 2007.







4. She’s smart AF: Gadot actually studied law and international relations in college. When a casting director approached her for a role, she thought she was “too serious and smart to be an actress," she told W magazine.







5. She’s not afraid of a little action: Gadot did her own stunts for the Fast & Furious movies. “The adrenaline was just incredible and I enjoyed being able to do the stuff that in real life you can’t,” she told Real Style Network in 2013. In a separate interview, she said she wanted to be a “tough girl.” “I want to have gunshots, I want to fly up in the air, on the motorcycle, whatever. I want to do it all, by myself—no stuntwoman.” Certainly none was required for the stunt she pulls in the Fast Five clip above.







6. She’s a taken lady: Gadot met her husband, real estate developer Yaron Varsano, in the desert. As she told Glamour, the couple was introduced through mutual friends at a “very strange” desert party in Israel. “It was all about yoga, chakras, and eating healthy — we didn’t exactly find ourselves there, but we found each other.” The couple have been married for nearly nine years and have two daughters.







7. She’s loaded: In 2015, the couple sold their luxury hotel, the Varsano, for a reported $26 million. The buyer? Russian billionaire and Leonardo DiCaprio’s yacht king BFF Roman Abramovich, who, according to the Daily Mail, purchased the Tel Aviv property to convert into his own Israeli home. Hot, smart and rich? Diana Prince herself would be proud.

Bradley Cooper

Actor


                        1/5/1975 (42 years old) Abington, Pennsylvania, United States
                    


        This handsome actor began working professionally before graduating from the Actors Studio Drama School at New School University, missing commencement because he was off filming Wet Hot American Summer. Guest appearances on numerous TV series followed, but it was his supporting role on Alias that introduced him to a wider audience. After leaving the drama in 2003, Cooper played Christine Lahti's much younger love interest on Jack & Bobby and finally landed his first leading role on the short-lived sitcom Kitchen Confidential. In 2006 he took a brief screen hiatus to make his Broadway debut opposite Julia Roberts in Three Days of Rain, though his appearance was overshadowed by Roberts' own, highly publicized debut on the Great White Way. However, more success in moving pictures followed, with starring roles in the fifth season of Nip/Tuck, Yes Man (2008) and the 2009 box-office hit The Hangover, and the plum part of Templeton "Faceman" Peck in the 2010 film adaptation of the 1980s TV series The A-Team.

Hollywood celebs make looking good look so easy—but they have hordes of assistants to prep them for the bright lights of the red carpet. For example, Oscar nominee Bradley Cooper rocked his appearances while promoting American Sniper. (And it didn't hurt that he was sporting some impressive new muscles. Find out How Bradley Cooper Gained 40 Pounds for American Sniper.)
But even genetically blessed guys like Cooper can’t look perfect all the time. Here’s what Cooper got right and what he could work on, as well as how you can pull off the same A-list look at home—without the entourage.

1. With no sign of acne or dryness, this 40 year old's skin regimen is on point, even in trouble areas, like the forehead and eyes.
Want to emulate this spotless look? Start by washing your face with a mild cleanser like Cetaphil Daily Moisturizer twice a day. Then rehydrate your skin by applying a moisturizer like CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion, which will give your skin the healthy glow and elasticity seen here. 
2. The trickiest part of wearing long hair with little or no facial hair is trimming your sideburns—a detail that Cooper pulls off perfectly. They’re even, not too long (halfway down your ear is ideal), and blended perfectly into his haircut.
Achieve the same kind of symmetry with a trimmer like the Norelco Multigroom Grooming Kit. Use no guard on your face, then apply a guard (three-quarter inch is a good start) to blend them into your hair, never trimming above the top of your ear. 
3. This Philadelphia native's day-old scruff looks sharp yet rugged, but one area he might have rushed is shaving the bottom of his neck. The bit of reddish irritation he has is common in that area, mostly because beard hairs grow in different directions.
Avoid redness by applying a shave oil like Jack Black MP10 Nourishing Oil to soften the hairs before putting on your shave cream. You should also note the direction your hairs grow in and always shave with the grain to avoid irritation.
4. Cooper’s signature longish hair is enviable, but it doesn’t appear this good when he wakes up in the morning. Miraculously, he hasn’t lost an inch on his hairline, which is impressive for having just turned 40.
Maintain your mane by using a thickening shampoo like Suave Men Heritage Edition Thick & Full 2-in-1. Follow that up by applying a light-hold, no-shine product like Fellow Barber Styling Cream to damp hair. Lock in the look by applying a blow dryer on medium heat until dry. 
5. Don’t neglect the most visible hair on your face: your brows. Cooper’s grow out sparsely and a bit uneven—a problem that’s easily handled by a variety of methods—the most time-tested of which is tweezing.
After taking a warm shower to soften your skin and hair, tweeze any hairs that fall outside your brow’s natural pattern with this Tweezerman Slant Tweezer. Just pluck one hair at a time (pulling upwards) and don’t trim right before a big event, or you’ll show up with a red, irritated face.

ArticleBradley Cooper answers important questions (about Jennifer Aniston and his hair)Mandi Bierly•@EWMandiBierlyPosted on June 29, 2009 at 11:58pm EDT 
ShareTweetEmail 





 



 Because I needed a break from the current news cycle, I decided to go to my happy place, which is currently The Hangover‘s Bradley Cooper. While the answer to Best Week Ever’s Michelle Collins’ NSFW query remains a mystery, Cooper did recently comment on two other burning questions: What was he doing having dinner with Jennifer Aniston (don’t even pretend like you didn’t send that link to friends with a frowny face) and what hair product does he use? 
As for Aniston, he told People, in French, apparently, since he was at a Louis Vuitton menswear event in Paris, “She’s a friend of mine. Simply, simply, just a friend….In America, it’s not like it is here. She’s someone who is super, super known. Famous. If someone says ‘hello’ to her, it’s given that he’s fallen in love with her. So, no. No. She’s a very, very interesting woman, but she’s simply a friend.” (Point for saying that Aniston isn’t A-list in France; point taken away for referring to her as “very, very interesting.” Pretty sure she’s one “very” — tops.)
Moving on to “the hair,” we go to Allure‘s Daily Beauty Reporter blog. They cornered him at the Whitney Art Party in NYC, and asked how he creates that “perfectly messy lion’s mane.” Cooper told them it’s a two-step process: Redken Rewind 06 Pliable Styling Paste and “the other is this product I discovered years ago on a set — you can only buy it online, but I can’t say what it is because it’s a secret.” (Point for how color-coordinated our bathroom sink would be since I’m a Redken Rough Paste 12 Working Material girl; point taken away for him using more product than me.)

Shayk kept it casual, opting for black sweats and a pair of black sunglasses. She jazzed up her ensemble with the gorgeous emerald sparkler on her left ring finger, which sparked engagement speculation the past.The 42-year-old actor and the 31-year-old model were first romantically linked back in May of 2015 when they were spotted kissing in New York City. Shayk celebrated her pregnancy last month with a "beautiful" baby shower. Cooper attended the soiree and was "hanging with his mother, making sure everything went smoothly," a source told E! News, adding, "He is always very chill and relaxed." 


While they only just welcomed their baby girl, the happy couple plans on having more little bundles of joy in the future. "Bradley and Irina love each other so much and this is not gonna be the only kid—there will be a few more after this one," our insider shared. "Both families are very happy."Congratulations to the happy couple and their growing family!
