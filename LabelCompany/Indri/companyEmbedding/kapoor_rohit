History[edit]
Founding and executive history[edit]
EXL was co-founded in 1999 by Vikram Talwar after serving as the India country manager for Bank of America.[5]
After formation in 1999, Vikram Talwar served as chief executive officer (CEO) and vice-chairman of the company.[1][5] As of 2013[update], the company's CEO and vice-chairman was Rohit Kapoor.[6] Kapoor had previously held the position of president in the company.[1][7]
As of 2007[update], the holders of selected executive positions were: chief financial officer, Matthew W. Appel; chairman, Steven Gruber; chief sales and marketing officer, Pramode Metre; general counsel, Amit Shashank.[1]
As of 2014[update], the vice-president of EXL Services Private Limited was Sanjeev Punn.[8]
Corporate history and business models[edit]
EXL has been described as being part of a "fourth wave of BPO start-ups" in India, characterized by backing from American venture capitalists experimenting with remote service delivery.[9]
In August 2001, Conseco acquired EXL and operated it as a wholly owned subsidiary. In 2002, Oak Hill Capital Partners and FTVentures acquired the company from Conseco,[5] making it as third party pure-play business process outsourcing service provider. The company stock started trading on the NASDAQ exchange on October 20, 2006 under the symbol EXLS.[5]
Shortly before EXL's debut on NASDAQ, it started down the path of growth through acquisitions with the purchase of the peer company Inductis.[7] This acquisition was aimed at diversifying the revenue stream for EXL; prior to acquisition, 90% of EXL's revenues were from business process outsourcing (BPO), while after, BPO accounted for 70% with the balance in research and analytics and advisory services.[7]
As of 2010[update], EXL's best recognized activities were in providing insurance-related services to British and American companies.[9]
In 2011, EXL expanded their delivery footprint in Eastern Europe and South East Asia through acquisition of OPI.[10] This acquisition was also a play to increase the scale at which EXL could deliver services.[10]
In 2013, in reaction to the establishment of the Affordable Care Act and its mandate that all Americans acquire health insurance, EXL was reported to have planned a major run of acquisitions in the United States healthcare industry.[6] At the time of this report in 2013, EXL drew ~10% of its revenues from the healthcare industry.[6]
In 2014, EXL expanded into Latin America through a strategic joint venture with CT&S through which EXL's technology experience would be combined with CT&S's local knowledge and brand image.[3] This joint venture also supported the growing customer base of EXL for Spanish language services.[3]

EXL has offices in US (Headquarters), UK, India, Philippines, Czech Republic, Romania, Bulgaria, Malaysia, Singapore, Latin America, Australia and South Africa. The majority of its staff are employed in India and Philippines.[15][self-published source]
Competition[edit]
Around 2006, EXL's primary competitors were Genpact, IBM and Accenture.[7]
As of 2013[update], EXL was one of three companies offering business process outsourcing services and listed on stock exchanges in the United States, the other two being Genpact and WNS Global Services.[6] WNS started trading in the United States in July 2006, three months before EXL joined the NASDAQ exchange.[5]

History[edit]
Founding and executive history[edit]
EXL was co-founded in 1999 by Vikram Talwar after serving as the India country manager for Bank of America.[5]
After formation in 1999, Vikram Talwar served as chief executive officer (CEO) and vice-chairman of the company.[1][5] As of 2013[update], the company's CEO and vice-chairman was Rohit Kapoor.[6] Kapoor had previously held the position of president in the company.[1][7]
As of 2007[update], the holders of selected executive positions were: chief financial officer, Matthew W. Appel; chairman, Steven Gruber; chief sales and marketing officer, Pramode Metre; general counsel, Amit Shashank.[1]
As of 2014[update], the vice-president of EXL Services Private Limited was Sanjeev Punn.[8]
Corporate history and business models[edit]
EXL has been described as being part of a "fourth wave of BPO start-ups" in India, characterized by backing from American venture capitalists experimenting with remote service delivery.[9]
In August 2001, Conseco acquired EXL and operated it as a wholly owned subsidiary. In 2002, Oak Hill Capital Partners and FTVentures acquired the company from Conseco,[5] making it as third party pure-play business process outsourcing service provider. The company stock started trading on the NASDAQ exchange on October 20, 2006 under the symbol EXLS.[5]
Shortly before EXL's debut on NASDAQ, it started down the path of growth through acquisitions with the purchase of the peer company Inductis.[7] This acquisition was aimed at diversifying the revenue stream for EXL; prior to acquisition, 90% of EXL's revenues were from business process outsourcing (BPO), while after, BPO accounted for 70% with the balance in research and analytics and advisory services.[7]
As of 2010[update], EXL's best recognized activities were in providing insurance-related services to British and American companies.[9]
In 2011, EXL expanded their delivery footprint in Eastern Europe and South East Asia through acquisition of OPI.[10] This acquisition was also a play to increase the scale at which EXL could deliver services.[10]
In 2013, in reaction to the establishment of the Affordable Care Act and its mandate that all Americans acquire health insurance, EXL was reported to have planned a major run of acquisitions in the United States healthcare industry.[6] At the time of this report in 2013, EXL drew ~10% of its revenues from the healthcare industry.[6]
In 2014, EXL expanded into Latin America through a strategic joint venture with CT&S through which EXL's technology experience would be combined with CT&S's local knowledge and brand image.[3] This joint venture also supported the growing customer base of EXL for Spanish language services.[3]
