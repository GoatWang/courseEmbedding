Overview | Caladrius
























































































 























Overview








Caladrius Biosciences is developing cellular therapeutics to treat certain diseases. We leverage our internal specialized cell therapy clinical development expertise to select and develop early-stage cell therapy candidates with the intention of partnering these candidates post proof-of-concept in humans.CLBS03Our current lead product candidate, CLBS03, is an autologous ex vivo polyclonal T regulatory cell ("Treg") clinical phase 2 therapy targeting adolescents with recent-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus (“T1D”). This program is based on the use of Tregs to treat diseases caused by imbalances in an individual's immune system. This novel approach seeks to restore immune balance by enhancing Treg number and function.CLBS12Our CD34 cell technology has led to the development of therapeutic candidates designed to address diseases and conditions caused by ischemia. Ischemia occurs when the supply of oxygenated blood to healthy tissue is restricted. Through the administration of CD34 cells, we seek to promote the development and formation of new blood vessels and thereby increase blood flow to the impacted area. Our Clinical Trial Notification for a pivotal Phase 2 trial investigating CLBS12 (a candidate for CLI) was submitted to the Japanese Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Agency ("PMDA") and was cleared to proceed.

					Full Description



Caladrius Biosciences, Inc. incorporated on October 18, 1980, is a cell therapy development company with product candidates in development based on multiple technology platforms and targeting autoimmune and cardiology indications. The Company's lead product candidate, CLBS03, is a T regulatory cell (Treg) clinical Phase II therapy targeting adolescents with recent-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) using the patient's own numerically and functionally enhanced Tregs. This therapy is based on a platform technology for immunomodulation.The Company is focused on commencing The Sanford Project: T-Rex Study, a Phase II prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial to evaluate its Treg product candidate, CLBS03, in adolescents with recent onset T1D. The Company plans to develop its product candidate, CLBS12, in Japan, which is an autologous therapy that derives its cells from peripheral blood through apheresis. The Company's T Regulatory Cell Technology is applicable to multiple autoimmune and allergic diseases beyond its target indication of TID. Its other technologies include tumor cell/dendritic cell technology for immuno-oncology and CD34 technology for ischemic repair. The Company operates over two facilities, approximately one in Allendale, New Jersey, and over one in Mountain View, California.The Company competes with Lonza Group Ltd. and WuXi AppTec.
