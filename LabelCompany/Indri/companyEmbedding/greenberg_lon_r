 VALLEY FORGE, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      UGI Corporation (NYSE: UGI) today announced that Lon R. Greenberg will
      retire as Chief Executive Officer effective April 1, 2013. As previously
      announced, Mr. Greenberg will continue to serve UGI as non-executive
      Chairman of its Board of Directors. Mr. Greenberg will also serve as
      non-executive Chairman of the Boards of Directors of AmeriGas Propane,
      Inc. and UGI Utilities, Inc.


John L. Walsh, UGI’s President and Chief Operating Officer, will be
      named President and Chief Executive Officer of UGI effective April 1,
      2013. Lon R. Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of UGI
      said, “John is an exceptional executive and proven leader. I am thrilled
      that he will succeed me as CEO and I look forward to the company's
      continued success under his leadership.”
    

      Mr. Greenberg, 62, has been UGI’s Chief Executive Officer since 1995 and
      Chairman of its Board of Directors since 1996. Mr. Greenberg joined UGI
      in 1980 as Corporate Development Counsel and has served the company for
      over three decades in various senior management roles including General
      Counsel (1983-1987), Vice President – Legal and Corporate Development
      (1987-1989), Senior Vice President – Legal and Corporate Development
      (1989-1994), President (1994-2005) and Vice Chairman of the Board
      (1995-1996).
    

Marvin O. Schlanger, UGI’s Presiding Director, said, “UGI’s total
      shareholder return during Lon’s tenure was over 1,000% or 14.6% per
      year, a period of truly remarkable growth and value creation for UGI’s
      shareholders. In addition to this track record of financial success, Lon
      has instilled a culture of excellence at UGI and has developed a strong
      management team that will serve UGI shareholders for the foreseeable
      future. This team will be led by John Walsh, a talented executive and a
      worthy successor to Lon as CEO. Although we wish Lon a long, happy and
      healthy retirement, we are very pleased that UGI shareholders will
      continue to benefit from Lon’s leadership as Chairman of UGI’s Board of
      Directors.”

Methodology: 
Compensation rank is based on total compensation for latest fiscal year. Total compensation for each chief executive includes the following: salary and bonuses; other compensation, such as vested restricted stock grants, LTIP payouts and perks; and stock gains, the value realized by exercising stock options. Efficiency rank is based on our chief executive's performance/pay score. Ranks are given only to chief executives who have a six-year tenure and six-year compensation history. The most efficient rank is 1 and least efficient is 189.


Footnotes: 
Compensation data is from the latest available proxy statements filed through April 9, 2010. Total returns and value of stock owned (including all classes) is based on Apr. 8, 2010 stock price. Compensation percent change is based on combined salary and bonus. Annualized total return during tenure covers the tenure of the executive or from the time of the IPO or available stock history. Relative to market is the ending value of $100 invested in the stock, divided by the ending value of $1 invested in the S & P 500 (a score of 100 = the S & P 500). NA: Not available or not applicable.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
