Aiello & Sons: Wholesale Produce Albany NY Fruit Vegetables



















 



                  About Us
Hello and welcome to our site.  I would like to take this space to personally thank you for clicking in.  Hopefully either we are currently engaged in, or about to, begin, a business relationship.  Before I do that however, I would like to tell you a little about myself, and my company.
As you may or may not have read, this family business has been around in some form since 1914.  Originally my Great Uncle John Aiello ventured north from New York City about 1912.  Getting accustomed to the landscape he sent for his brother, my Grandfather and the original Joe Aiello, (who’s the Joseph Aiello of Joseph Aiello & Sons) and in 1914 they set up John Aiello & Brother, the original Aiello produce company.  As both families grew, John’s sons, one being tragically killed and another opting for a more scholarly profession, did not succeed their father, while Joseph’s sons (my father and Uncle) took up the profession.  My Uncle, A. George Aiello, who passed in 2004, could regale you with great, colorful stories about the “olden days,” in the produce business.  He would recall with great detail about how they used to deliver fresh vegetables with horse and wagon.  He had very vivid dreams (maybe sometimes nightmares) about loads of strawberries, cantaloupes and iceberg lettuce- which by the way received its moniker from the mountains of ice they used to load on top of the product when it was placed in railcars.  Sorry to say however that with the passing of the “Boys” in the early part of the decade, all that is left is nostalgia.  The stories were far livelier when the two “Sons” were together.
Thus the “roots,” no pun intended, were planted very deep for the third generation of Aiello’s to break into the business.  With good labor always at a premium, I was recruited early and often as a young man, being on the loading docks at the age of 13.  My father and Uncle were always very proud of my academic accomplishments, first at St. Catherine of Siena School, then at Christian Brothers Academy, and encouraged me very openly to choose another life than the one they had lead.  Yet during all this encouragement, the “boys” would readily recall all the good times they had working together, the various characters they met and employed over the years, and the advantages to their own health in being surrounded by a plethora of fresh fruit and vegetables.  Thus after 4 years at Colgate University where I was awarded a Bachelor of Arts in History, I came back out of loyalty to both my father and Uncle, and to help them as they struggled with the plight of tackling the day to day challenges of business.
So here I am today, scribing this introductory piece for our company website.  It is hard to imagine that I can speak simultaneously to a variety of people using this mass of silicon and optic wiring, when only about 70 years ago we were using horse drawn carriages to transfer product between our warehouse and your establishment.  I hope to continue to embrace all the new technology available, and maybe some day one of my sons will use this space to project live images of strawberries being received and shipped, or iceberg lettuce as it arrives at our distribution center.  There are days, however, when I wonder if it would be the right thing to do to encourage a fourth generation.  If you could ask my Great Uncle John and my Grandfather Joseph if they could have imagined their success four generations later, I wonder what they would say?
Joseph J. Aiello Jr.

                  2015
PS.  If you would like to gather further insight into my life, including hobbies, interests, and loyalties, please feel free to email me = jaiello@aiellos.com.  I am fairly well read on subjects such as nutrition, politics, sports, business including marketing and investments, and I make it a priority to attend the Saratoga thoroughbred-racing meet.  You can also catch me on the various squash courts around the area as not only do I sell squash, but also play it as well.  Sometimes I get confused! JA

I wish they would document features more clearly. I can't figure out how to disable the auto-standby time even though it was added in this update.
And I randomly found out in the comments section of a review that you can change the sleep timeout to 60min by holding down the desk/stand button until the lights blink. But no sign of that in any KEF documents I've seen.
The ability to turn off the startup/shutdown strum sound would be a good feature too.

I found how to configure out how to configure auto standby by looking at the FAQ's for the speaker.  Odd place to put it but thats where it is.  They must have just added it in.

Okay I just tried the update and it's the same version as are installed my my speakers from the last update so nothing new here.  I think though the thing I missed about this is that the Mac updater is now wireless.  It seems to me when I did the last update via a Windows laptop I had to connect the speaker to the laptop via USB.  This is 100 times better.

We don't know for sure the OS X and Windows update are the same.They have the same date for both and we know the Mac version just came out.The release notes are so minimal as to tell us practically nothing.Just saying its the same point version doesn't mean its the exact same code, they can give it whatever number they want.I didn't notice the Mac version as wireless, the directions said to do it by USB cable and turn on wireless but the update looks like it took place over usb and wireless was too be turned on to make sure that component was updated.  That was my assumption anyway.Anyway I'm glad to see it finally had some sort of update along with the iOS app.My next step is to connect a Microrendu to mine for Roon.I'm also getting some isoacoustic stands and maybe higher end power cords.

When I tried the update the updater said the version on my speakers was the same as the one in the updater so I did not do it.  Not sure what you mean about the directions needing USB.  It is 100% wireless on a MAC.  I was able to access the speakers without a USB cable connected.

I'm saying the directions say to connect directly to the speakers via USB and also select wifi as the source.On another note. I changed auto standby to 60 minutes which worked st first but now they just stay on all the time. Nice work Kef.  Still issues with the speakers retaining settings. I would e-mail them but there never seems to be a reply.

Are you using Windows or a MAC.  When I did the update via Windows it was via USB.  When I tried it via the Mac it was wireless.

Well then all you did was read the directions because the updater is wireless.
