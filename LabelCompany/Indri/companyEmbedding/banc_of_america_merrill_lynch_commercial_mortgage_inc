Commercial real estate financing



   Commercial mortgages at competitive rates  




Financing to help you fund your future — provided by Business Real Estate Financing Apply for financing of up to $750,000 to purchase, refinance, or leverage the equity in commercial property that is either owner-occupied or investment. Take advantage of our competitive rates on loans and lines of credit with low closing costs, secured by commercial property valued up to $5 million.  No application fee and no appraisal fee Low 1% origination fee, maximum $5,000 due at closing Fixed-rate and Prime-based loans with a variety of terms  Feel confident that you are getting the most competitive offer. We’ll match or beat a competing offer (rate and fee combination) when a competitor’s formal written approval is provided to us — or pay you $200.


  Questions? Ready to apply? Call 1-877-322-4648, Monday – Friday, 6:00 am – 6:00 pm, Pacific Time.   Financing from $50,000 to $750,000 for purchase and refinance loans in first lien position; $50,000 to $500,000 for lines of credit, equity loans, and refinance loans in second lien position. Maximum $500,000 for cash-out. All financing is subject to credit approval.  Low closing costs and competitive rates are based upon analysis of application, appraisal and origination fees, and interest rates, for competing U.S. lenders as compiled by an independent third-party research firm on a quarterly basis, beginning April 2016.  You will need to pay a deposit of up to $1,000 when accepting the terms of any loan or line of credit. The deposit is nonrefundable, unless the loan closes; in that case, the unused portion of the deposit (if any) will be returned or credited after closing in the same form as your original deposit. If environmental insurance is required, you will be responsible for this one-time fee of $1,866. You will also be responsible for the cost of any mortgage or deed of trust filing fee imposed by a state or other taxing authority. In states that require attorney closings, you will be responsible for title-related costs and attorney title work that exceeds $375. For purchase loans, you will be responsible for title and escrow fees. In addition, for purchase loans you will need to provide proof of funds for any required down payment. All financing is subject to credit approval.  Prepayment or early closure fees may apply. Contact your banker for details.

We strive to provide you with information about products and services you might find interesting and useful. Relationship-based ads and online behavioral advertising help us do that.
Here's how it works: We gather information about your online activities, such as the searches you conduct on our Sites and the pages you visit.

Advertising Practices
We strive to provide you with information about products and services you might find interesting and useful. Relationship-based ads and online behavioral advertising help us do that.
Here's how it works: We gather information about your online activities, such as the searches you conduct on our Sites and the pages you visit. This information may be used to deliver advertising on our Sites and offline (for example, by phone, email and direct mail) that's customized to meet specific interests you may have.
If you prefer that we do not use this information, you may opt out of online behavioral advertising. If you opt out, though, you may still receive generic advertising. In addition, financial advisors/Client Managers may continue to use information collected online to provide product and service information in accordance with account agreements.
Also, if you opt out of online behavioral advertising, you may still see ads when you sign in to your account, for example through Online Banking or MyMerrill. These ads are based on your specific account relationships with us.
To learn more about relationship-based ads, online behavioral advertising and our privacy practices, please review the Bank of America Online Privacy Notice and our Online Privacy FAQs.

Commercial real estate financing



   Commercial mortgages at competitive rates  




Financing to help you fund your future — provided by Business Real Estate Financing Apply for financing of up to $750,000 to purchase, refinance, or leverage the equity in commercial property that is either owner-occupied or investment. Take advantage of our competitive rates on loans and lines of credit with low closing costs, secured by commercial property valued up to $5 million.  No application fee and no appraisal fee Low 1% origination fee, maximum $5,000 due at closing Fixed-rate and Prime-based loans with a variety of terms  Feel confident that you are getting the most competitive offer. We’ll match or beat a competing offer (rate and fee combination) when a competitor’s formal written approval is provided to us — or pay you $200.


  Questions? Ready to apply? Call 1-877-322-4648, Monday – Friday, 6:00 am – 6:00 pm, Pacific Time.   Financing from $50,000 to $750,000 for purchase and refinance loans in first lien position; $50,000 to $500,000 for lines of credit, equity loans, and refinance loans in second lien position. Maximum $500,000 for cash-out. All financing is subject to credit approval.  Low closing costs and competitive rates are based upon analysis of application, appraisal and origination fees, and interest rates, for competing U.S. lenders as compiled by an independent third-party research firm on a quarterly basis, beginning April 2016.  You will need to pay a deposit of up to $1,000 when accepting the terms of any loan or line of credit. The deposit is nonrefundable, unless the loan closes; in that case, the unused portion of the deposit (if any) will be returned or credited after closing in the same form as your original deposit. If environmental insurance is required, you will be responsible for this one-time fee of $1,866. You will also be responsible for the cost of any mortgage or deed of trust filing fee imposed by a state or other taxing authority. In states that require attorney closings, you will be responsible for title-related costs and attorney title work that exceeds $375. For purchase loans, you will be responsible for title and escrow fees. In addition, for purchase loans you will need to provide proof of funds for any required down payment. All financing is subject to credit approval.  Prepayment or early closure fees may apply. Contact your banker for details.
