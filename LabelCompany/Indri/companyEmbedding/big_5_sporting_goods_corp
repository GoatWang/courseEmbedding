		Prepare to go big this hunting season with the proper gear and an adventurous state of mind. Big 5 Sporting Goods has a selection of competitively priced sporting arms, ammunition, targets, gun maintenance and accessories to get you ready for hunting season and help keep your firearm in top shape during the closed season.

		Every hunter has to equip for the hunt with the proper sporting arms and ammunition. Find firearms with the specific bore diameter, caliber, gauge and action you need at Big 5 Sporting Goods. Choose a lever-action rifle or bolt- action rifle for hunting large game. Rifles have a small impact area with a long range and high accuracy. If birds and fowl are your target, choose a pump-action shotgun. Shotguns spread the shots during flight, giving shotguns a larger area of impact compared to rifles. In addition to choosing the correct firearm, be sure to stock up on quality rounds of ammunition.

		Improve your shooting accuracy and precision with targets, optics, spotting scopes, binoculars and range finders. Before your next hunting trip, aim your rifle at a paper target at the shooting range or practice your precision with a shotgun by shooting at clay targets in the field or hunting range. When it’s hunting season, use a decoy to encourage birds and fowl to land within your range. Spot and narrow in on your target with binoculars, rangefinders or spotting scopes.

		Ensure your firearm is kept ready for hunting season year after year with the correct gun maintenance and storage. Use a complete cleaning kit to properly clean your pistol, rifle or shotgun. When your firearm is not in use, keep it safe and protected in a multi gun cabinet or safe.

		Make sure you have the necessary hunting apparel and boots for a successful hunt. Conceal yourself in the brush with camouflage jackets, pants, hats and gloves. Wear hunting boots in order to trek across the roughest terrain while staying concealed.

		Find everything you need for hunting season at competitive prices from brands you trust including Under Armour, Ruger, Savage, Smith & Wesson, Winchester, Bushnell and more.

Needed to get a tent for an upcoming camping trip.  Did some research online and found a tent that I liked on Big 5's website.  Called the store to see if they had it in stock and they did.  Sean grabbed it and kept it by the front desk.  A half hour later, I showed up and bought the tent.  Didn't even have to walk past the cashier's desk.  Sean was super friendly and helpful.







The customer service was horrible, except for Anthony, who was helpful in answering questions. Thanks Anthony!

Upon arrival, the woman at the register (didn't catch her name but she was, tall, heavyset, and never smiled) didn't acknowledge us. We had to roam around the messy store to find someone who could help us find an all-terrain wagon. Finally, Anthony was able to help us, he was the only helpful person in the store.

Upon checkout, the cashier just did the basics (rung our items, totaled us out, handed the receipt), no "did you find everything ok?" Or "Thank you, have a great day."

While in the parking lot, we took our wagon out of the box and noticed there was dirt on the wheels, so it was clearly used. We returned to the store to let the unfriendly cashier know, and she looked at us dumbfounded then called the manager over. The manager, Nora,had a similar attitude as the cashier, but was even worse by giving us attitude. There was no apology for selling us a used item or having to come back to the store to return it. They didn't have another item in stock, and Nora basically had a "take it or leave it" attitude. We had already spent nearly an hour in the store waiting for someone to help us and dealing with a used item, plus we had plans for the day, so I told her we'll take the used one if we can get it discounted. Nora seemed irritated bc we already used a coupon, and it seemed that we inconvenienced her by asking to receive a discount on their USED item that they SOLD to us. She literally said, "You guys already used a coupon... ok I'll just give you 10% off but it's final sale."

There's a difference between leadership and management. This store clearly has no leadership or direction. They also lack any ounce of customer service. No wonder their reviews are so negative.







Seriously the WORST customer service I've ever experienced in my life. Wish that were an exaggeration. When I walk in, I was greeted gloomily by someone at the main entrance. She didn't ask me if I needed help so I just kept walking. I go straight to the shoes, nobody is around. I try to look for soccer cleats and they are nowhere to be found. I walk back to the clearly unhappy with her job cashier to as for assistance, to her response, "go back there" and nothing else. No please, no I'll call someone just a minute. I go back to footwear and no one is still around. I wait for a couple minutes, and all I can hear is a bunch of employees behind the employees only door horsing around and cursing really loudly. Someone finally comes out, looking confused, I asked him for some cleats and he looks at me and says we probably don't have those I guess in an attempt to not have to go to the back and search for them? I just left, this was the worst experience I've ever had, I'd be happy to speak to a manager about this

TL;DR : don't come here after work on a weekday! Nobody is around and nobody wants to help you.







My partner and I came inside with $800 in cash ready to buy a kayak and other equipment and I needed to use the restroom facilities so I asked, "excuse me sir where are the restroom facilities?" He says "no public bathroom" in a very rude tone. So my partner says, "she's about to spend good deal of money here the least you can do is let her use the restroom". Their selection was also quite terrible and most kayaks lacked price tags and the employees couldn't be bothered to help. These guys lost a customer!







First thing you notice about this Big 5 is that it's a pretty basic/jenky looking store in the middle of a jenky looking parking lot. 

All things considered though, this place is always great for deals and quantity. I came here recently to check out good bargains on camelbaks and hydration packs, and I noticed that this Big 5 had everything I was looking for in stock. That's a huge plus, especially when places are always out of items.

Business is pretty slow here and so you might not see many customers or even employees. However if you catch one, he or she will probably help you out gladly.

Tl;dr this is a decent store to buy your sporting goods and outdoor activity gear. It's not the nicest looking shop but it has what you need.

Shop well and prosper,







Overpriced sporting goods!!! I spent over $50 on little league pants, socks & belts for two kids. I had to hunt someone down to find things because their store has really small signs. They could organize their store better or put bigger signs of categories. Also, the guy who worked the cashier stand wasn't very friendly and seemed distracted. There isn't too many sporting goods stores now a days so I am limited. They also seem to have a lot more team apparel than anything else so Warrior fans, plenty of gear here!







Since they closed the sports authority in Sunnyvale we have to shop at this store now and it is very disappointing . Customer service is awful, as if the people working their do not want to be there or be bothered. 
  In our recent visit to this store we were not approached by any of the staff and when I finally asked for help the staff member answered very rudely and walked away . 
  This store is disappointing overall minimal sports items, no variety what so ever and horrible customer service.







The selections here are HUGE! You could literally find anything for great deals! (Not much women's shoes though) I found sweat pants for under 10! The store is well organized and don't miss their clearance section!

Clothes, equipments, and shoes!







This place was a dump and filthy went to try and buy shoes stuff was thrown all over nothing where it should be and a big mess. Looked like a decent size store but could not bring myself to walk around it since I need a tetanus shot.







This store really needs to improve the customer service, especially the manager, he gave a very bad attitude to me today, because I asked him to help me to find an exchange for the not working helicopter I bought in this store on Thanksgiving day. I don't feel he try to help customers at all, and he doesn't care either.

I will never step into this store.







This is a tucked-away store, on Sunnyvale-Saratoga and El Camino in Sunnyvale.

It's definitely not a super-sporting store, but they have a lot of merchandise and clothing.

The store sometimes has sections that are in disarray or being rotated, with signage/pricing stacked up on displays when I've been here. Being that the store is already jam-packed full of stuff it can look a bit unruly in areas.

Like some of the others have written, the shoes keep some of us coming back! I look though the clothing and the shoes when I'm here for deals.

Staff is nice, very helpful. They'll leave you to your shopping but if you have a question, they're not hard to locate.

Big lot, one side of it's not too busy, so parking is easy-peasy.







Horrible staff and manager. Called over the phone to have staff check for life vests and I was told they don't have "ANY". I went in the store anyways to check for myself and the first thing I saw hanging was life Vests exactly the one I wanted. I told the manager and she did not care at all! I work across the street and I will def make sure none of my friends go here.







Tim in the shoe section not only helped us find the perfect pair of shoes for my husband and I but he found the ones that we needed on SALE!!!  EXCELLENT customer service.  So very helpful in finding the exact shoes that we need. We will be shopping here from this point on.







I have made three visits to this store in the last month. All three have been to make ammunition and gun cleaning kit purchases in the firearm department. The city of sunnyvale requires finger-printing for simple ammunition purchases so that already in and of itself creates a tense strange privacy encroachment situation. That and their overpriced ammo I was willing to let slide for the convenient location. However there is a thin-moustached dude that works in the firearms deptartment there who has an annoyingly condescending and judgemental  attitude that is frankly pissing me off. On my third and LAST visit there he seemed to be bothered and/or had a weird bad-cop unfriendly and confrontational attitude. Hey I've had it, I am simply not going to ever shop there any more and deal with his egotistical condescending and suspicious raising bullshit, period. I'm taking my business some place else. You all need to remember that you need good customer service skills in order to attract repeat customers and run a succesful business. Having jerks like these as salesmen is not helping you. Have a good life guys.







Decent selection. Horrible customer service. Big store, clothes all over, needs to be cleaned up.







This is a good store to find quality sneakers when your teens outgrow them every two months. But search for sales and don't pay full price. Find the 10% off coupon online and print it before you go in. Just type in bigfivesportinggoodscoupons. The weekly coupons only pertain to either cyber purchases or sales of that week. Sometimes they have bins of shoes on sale which is worth checking out. Expect to pay $25-37 on good sneakers.  Join their mailing list and keep up with upcoming sales.







I am very pleased with the customer service I received while looking for new walking shoes. I recently sold my car and now walk just about everywhere. I went through three shoe returns to find the shoes that were perfect for me. I chose two different styles of Asics and they are so comfortable! But I really want to give shout outs to Mike, Tim, Sandra, Omar and Gino for all of their professional assistance and patience with my questions and shoe returns. I definitely would refer friends to this store and for a very good reason: A happy customer!  :-)







Not even worth the trip.

The clothing selection was terrible! There was basically nothing even worth looking at and an even more abysmal sale. I was looking for Nike pro shorts (norts...yes this is a thing) to add to my recently started collection. 

What Big 5 is actually good for:

Maybe come here if you want swimsuits. They have tons of speed and body glove...and some of the body glove items were on sale.

Shoes...they have a larger selection.

Actual sports equipment. 

It is not the location is tiny, it is just that the clothing is terrible.







Great deals - I got sandals for $15.49 (originally $24.99), and walking shoes for $26.99 (originally $59.99).

I saw a good selection of Skechers, Nike, Fila, New Balance, and Spenco. I even saw Dr. Scholl's shoes.

The store was a bit cluttered, though items weren't difficult to locate.

The employees were quick to offer assistance in the shoe section. I saw a walking shoe, and as soon as I picked it up, an employee approached me and asked what size I was looking for. The couple next to me received fast service as well.

While I was trying on shoes, I overheard another employee tell a customer that though they were sold out of his size in a particular running shoe, the employee had located his size at the Big Five on Blossom Hill, and that he'd called and asked that location to hold the shoes for the customer until the end of the day. 

There were two cashiers, so the lines moved fast. One lady tried to cut to the front of the line that I was in, and the cashier immediately told her that she needed to go to the back of the line. 

My cashier asked me if I found everything that was looking for, thanked me for shopping there, and told me to have a great day.

I've been going to this Big 5 for 33 years.  I usually purchase only national name brands that know.  Specifically Wilson tennis shoes.  I loved their Wilson Extreme DST 02 shoes, and when they went out of production a few years ago, looked at every big 5 store in the Bay Area for them, as did my fellow tennis league players.   

One day I went into the store, and saw on sale display a pair of 2012 Wilson Tour Vision II tennis shoes, size 8.  I read the reviews,  purchased them, and took them home to break them in.  After two weeks, I took them back -too narrow for my feet.  I exchanged them for size 8.5, and wore them to a USTA league match the next day.  I was so impressed at the $60 Big 5 discounted price ($up to $90 on Amazon) that I purchased a second pair here, and two more pairs in other big 5 stores, while the shoe was on sale.     

Note that these shoes were premium brand shoes, not advertised in the newspaper, due to limited quantities, and intended for serious players, hence the high price, compared to your $20-$40 ordinary Wilson tennis shoes intended for the weekend players.  The same shoes sold at Sunnyvale Tennis Center two blocks away for $100+ in 2012.

Other things I get here are tennis balls -usually Dunlop at $2.15 a can, in a case of 24, when they are on sale, and tennis racket grips.  Once a month, they have an extra 10% coupon off for their e-mail customers, with no restrictions, usually in the middle of the week for just 1 or 2 days.    

I also look to purchase New Balance trail running shoes, extra sturdy with extra padding, and also extra wide, size 8.5, width 4E, as these fit better than the regular running shoes of Nike, Asics, and other brands.  

Note that you can also purchase shoes Saturday, the day before the Sunday ad goes into effect, at the sale price, if you show the ad to the cashier, so that they can adjust the price in the computer -I get the Sunday ads in my Saturday delivery.  

I have purchased and occasionally returned many shoes at this store in my 33 years, and have never had a problem returning shoes, as long as they were in new condition with spotless bottom treads, the original receipt, in the original box.

And I always make sure I scrub the shoe bottoms spic and span clean before returning them, particularly the shoes with white bottoms!

Needed to get a tent for an upcoming camping trip.  Did some research online and found a tent that I liked on Big 5's website.  Called the store to see if they had it in stock and they did.  Sean grabbed it and kept it by the front desk.  A half hour later, I showed up and bought the tent.  Didn't even have to walk past the cashier's desk.  Sean was super friendly and helpful.

The customer service was horrible, except for Anthony, who was helpful in answering questions. Thanks Anthony!Upon arrival, the woman at the register (didn't catch her name but she was, tall, heavyset, and never smiled) didn't acknowledge us. We had to roam around the messy store to find someone who could help us find an all-terrain wagon. Finally, Anthony was able to help us, he was the only helpful person in the store.Upon checkout, the cashier just did the basics (rung our items, totaled us out, handed the receipt), no "did you find everything ok?" Or "Thank you, have a great day."While in the parking lot, we took our wagon out of the box and noticed there was dirt on the wheels, so it was clearly used. We returned to the store to let the unfriendly cashier know, and she looked at us dumbfounded then called the manager over. The manager, Nora,had a similar attitude as the cashier, but was even worse by giving us attitude. There was no apology for selling us a used item or having to come back to the store to return it. They didn't have another item in stock, and Nora basically had a "take it or leave it" attitude. We had already spent nearly an hour in the store waiting for someone to help us and dealing with a used item, plus we had plans for the day, so I told her we'll take the used one if we can get it discounted. Nora seemed irritated bc we already used a coupon, and it seemed that we inconvenienced her by asking to receive a discount on their USED item that they SOLD to us. She literally said, "You guys already used a coupon... ok I'll just give you 10% off but it's final sale."There's a difference between leadership and management. This store clearly has no leadership or direction. They also lack any ounce of customer service. No wonder their reviews are so negative.

Seriously the WORST customer service I've ever experienced in my life. Wish that were an exaggeration. When I walk in, I was greeted gloomily by someone at the main entrance. She didn't ask me if I needed help so I just kept walking. I go straight to the shoes, nobody is around. I try to look for soccer cleats and they are nowhere to be found. I walk back to the clearly unhappy with her job cashier to as for assistance, to her response, "go back there" and nothing else. No please, no I'll call someone just a minute. I go back to footwear and no one is still around. I wait for a couple minutes, and all I can hear is a bunch of employees behind the employees only door horsing around and cursing really loudly. Someone finally comes out, looking confused, I asked him for some cleats and he looks at me and says we probably don't have those I guess in an attempt to not have to go to the back and search for them? I just left, this was the worst experience I've ever had, I'd be happy to speak to a manager about thisTL;DR : don't come here after work on a weekday! Nobody is around and nobody wants to help you.

My partner and I came inside with $800 in cash ready to buy a kayak and other equipment and I needed to use the restroom facilities so I asked, "excuse me sir where are the restroom facilities?" He says "no public bathroom" in a very rude tone. So my partner says, "she's about to spend good deal of money here the least you can do is let her use the restroom". Their selection was also quite terrible and most kayaks lacked price tags and the employees couldn't be bothered to help. These guys lost a customer!

First thing you notice about this Big 5 is that it's a pretty basic/jenky looking store in the middle of a jenky looking parking lot. All things considered though, this place is always great for deals and quantity. I came here recently to check out good bargains on camelbaks and hydration packs, and I noticed that this Big 5 had everything I was looking for in stock. That's a huge plus, especially when places are always out of items.Business is pretty slow here and so you might not see many customers or even employees. However if you catch one, he or she will probably help you out gladly.Tl;dr this is a decent store to buy your sporting goods and outdoor activity gear. It's not the nicest looking shop but it has what you need.Shop well and prosper,

Overpriced sporting goods!!! I spent over $50 on little league pants, socks & belts for two kids. I had to hunt someone down to find things because their store has really small signs. They could organize their store better or put bigger signs of categories. Also, the guy who worked the cashier stand wasn't very friendly and seemed distracted. There isn't too many sporting goods stores now a days so I am limited. They also seem to have a lot more team apparel than anything else so Warrior fans, plenty of gear here!

Since they closed the sports authority in Sunnyvale we have to shop at this store now and it is very disappointing . Customer service is awful, as if the people working their do not want to be there or be bothered.   In our recent visit to this store we were not approached by any of the staff and when I finally asked for help the staff member answered very rudely and walked away .   This store is disappointing overall minimal sports items, no variety what so ever and horrible customer service.

This store really needs to improve the customer service, especially the manager, he gave a very bad attitude to me today, because I asked him to help me to find an exchange for the not working helicopter I bought in this store on Thanksgiving day. I don't feel he try to help customers at all, and he doesn't care either.I will never step into this store.

This is a tucked-away store, on Sunnyvale-Saratoga and El Camino in Sunnyvale.It's definitely not a super-sporting store, but they have a lot of merchandise and clothing.The store sometimes has sections that are in disarray or being rotated, with signage/pricing stacked up on displays when I've been here. Being that the store is already jam-packed full of stuff it can look a bit unruly in areas.Like some of the others have written, the shoes keep some of us coming back! I look though the clothing and the shoes when I'm here for deals.Staff is nice, very helpful. They'll leave you to your shopping but if you have a question, they're not hard to locate.Big lot, one side of it's not too busy, so parking is easy-peasy.

Horrible staff and manager. Called over the phone to have staff check for life vests and I was told they don't have "ANY". I went in the store anyways to check for myself and the first thing I saw hanging was life Vests exactly the one I wanted. I told the manager and she did not care at all! I work across the street and I will def make sure none of my friends go here.

Tim in the shoe section not only helped us find the perfect pair of shoes for my husband and I but he found the ones that we needed on SALE!!!  EXCELLENT customer service.  So very helpful in finding the exact shoes that we need. We will be shopping here from this point on.

I have made three visits to this store in the last month. All three have been to make ammunition and gun cleaning kit purchases in the firearm department. The city of sunnyvale requires finger-printing for simple ammunition purchases so that already in and of itself creates a tense strange privacy encroachment situation. That and their overpriced ammo I was willing to let slide for the convenient location. However there is a thin-moustached dude that works in the firearms deptartment there who has an annoyingly condescending and judgemental  attitude that is frankly pissing me off. On my third and LAST visit there he seemed to be bothered and/or had a weird bad-cop unfriendly and confrontational attitude. Hey I've had it, I am simply not going to ever shop there any more and deal with his egotistical condescending and suspicious raising bullshit, period. I'm taking my business some place else. You all need to remember that you need good customer service skills in order to attract repeat customers and run a succesful business. Having jerks like these as salesmen is not helping you. Have a good life guys.

Decent selection. Horrible customer service. Big store, clothes all over, needs to be cleaned up.

This is a good store to find quality sneakers when your teens outgrow them every two months. But search for sales and don't pay full price. Find the 10% off coupon online and print it before you go in. Just type in bigfivesportinggoodscoupons. The weekly coupons only pertain to either cyber purchases or sales of that week. Sometimes they have bins of shoes on sale which is worth checking out. Expect to pay $25-37 on good sneakers.  Join their mailing list and keep up with upcoming sales.

I am very pleased with the customer service I received while looking for new walking shoes. I recently sold my car and now walk just about everywhere. I went through three shoe returns to find the shoes that were perfect for me. I chose two different styles of Asics and they are so comfortable! But I really want to give shout outs to Mike, Tim, Sandra, Omar and Gino for all of their professional assistance and patience with my questions and shoe returns. I definitely would refer friends to this store and for a very good reason: A happy customer!  :-)

Not even worth the trip.The clothing selection was terrible! There was basically nothing even worth looking at and an even more abysmal sale. I was looking for Nike pro shorts (norts...yes this is a thing) to add to my recently started collection. What Big 5 is actually good for:Maybe come here if you want swimsuits. They have tons of speed and body glove...and some of the body glove items were on sale.Shoes...they have a larger selection.Actual sports equipment. It is not the location is tiny, it is just that the clothing is terrible.

Great deals - I got sandals for $15.49 (originally $24.99), and walking shoes for $26.99 (originally $59.99).I saw a good selection of Skechers, Nike, Fila, New Balance, and Spenco. I even saw Dr. Scholl's shoes.The store was a bit cluttered, though items weren't difficult to locate.The employees were quick to offer assistance in the shoe section. I saw a walking shoe, and as soon as I picked it up, an employee approached me and asked what size I was looking for. The couple next to me received fast service as well.While I was trying on shoes, I overheard another employee tell a customer that though they were sold out of his size in a particular running shoe, the employee had located his size at the Big Five on Blossom Hill, and that he'd called and asked that location to hold the shoes for the customer until the end of the day. There were two cashiers, so the lines moved fast. One lady tried to cut to the front of the line that I was in, and the cashier immediately told her that she needed to go to the back of the line. My cashier asked me if I found everything that was looking for, thanked me for shopping there, and told me to have a great day.Located by Boudin SF and Aaron Brothers Art & Framing.

            Listed in Tennis


I've been going to this Big 5 for 33 years.  I usually purchase only national name brands that know.  Specifically Wilson tennis shoes.  I loved their Wilson Extreme DST 02 shoes, and when they went out of production a few years ago, looked at every big 5 store in the Bay Area for them, as did my fellow tennis league players.   One day I went into the store, and saw on sale display a pair of 2012 Wilson Tour Vision II tennis shoes, size 8.  I read the reviews,  purchased them, and took them home to break them in.  After two weeks, I took them back -too narrow for my feet.  I exchanged them for size 8.5, and wore them to a USTA league match the next day.  I was so impressed at the $60 Big 5 discounted price ($up to $90 on Amazon) that I purchased a second pair here, and two more pairs in other big 5 stores, while the shoe was on sale.     Note that these shoes were premium brand shoes, not advertised in the newspaper, due to limited quantities, and intended for serious players, hence the high price, compared to your $20-$40 ordinary Wilson tennis shoes intended for the weekend players.  The same shoes sold at Sunnyvale Tennis Center two blocks away for $100+ in 2012.Other things I get here are tennis balls -usually Dunlop at $2.15 a can, in a case of 24, when they are on sale, and tennis racket grips.  Once a month, they have an extra 10% coupon off for their e-mail customers, with no restrictions, usually in the middle of the week for just 1 or 2 days.    I also look to purchase New Balance trail running shoes, extra sturdy with extra padding, and also extra wide, size 8.5, width 4E, as these fit better than the regular running shoes of Nike, Asics, and other brands.  Note that you can also purchase shoes Saturday, the day before the Sunday ad goes into effect, at the sale price, if you show the ad to the cashier, so that they can adjust the price in the computer -I get the Sunday ads in my Saturday delivery.  I have purchased and occasionally returned many shoes at this store in my 33 years, and have never had a problem returning shoes, as long as they were in new condition with spotless bottom treads, the original receipt, in the original box.And I always make sure I scrub the shoe bottoms spic and span clean before returning them, particularly the shoes with white bottoms!

We've always had good luck shopping here, finding needed items at great prices and even getting competent  customer service. Parking is easy, the cashiers friendly, and the overall shopping experience is greater than at must discount stores but less than at Nordstrom.







I guess things have changed, last time I bought an airsoft gun there was about 13 years ago, and it was a pretty normal experience. I went to buy a gun today and felt like I was 16 years old again. The sales guy that helped me was clueless and slightly arrogant. Will find another place to buy my toys.







Awful just awful, this white small guy trying to act tuff ask me if I was from around their lol wtf that have to do with be buying shoes.







So I bought a pair of Coleman Lagoon sandals late last year and never wore them until this June.  (Yes, I know, I should have known better!)  It turns out that they were worse than a piece of junk - after wearing them about five times, the footbed padding had compressed so badly that the plastic rim ended up cutting my heels (and no, I'm not overweight).  The left one was cut so deeply that it bled and got inflamed.  The day before leaving for a vacation!  Lucky, I guess, because I was going to bring those sandals?!??

After I got back from my vacation, I tried to return them.  If you've read previous reviews, you can guess that the manager was less than interested and less than polite.  Needless to say, I still have both the scar on my heel AND the sandals.  I can't wear them, and I don't want to give them away even though they're barely worn.  

Note to self: do not buy cheap sandals.  Or at least, do not buy them at Big 5.

Two stars for some cheap stuff, if you must buy it there.  Just be totally, absolutely sure that it fits and doesn't injure you.  And don't buy Coleman Lagoon sandals anywhere, ever.







I've been to BIG sporting places and small, buying winter stuff, summer, shoes, ammunition, gym clothes, and so much more - and I somehow always seem to find it @ this Big 5 store.  I went there one time on a lark (my glasses kept running down the bridge of my nose) and I was looking for those band - not really sure what to call them, etc., etc One I talked to to clerk and VIOLA!!!







Truly horrible service from the management. I wanted to get a replacement for shoes I received as a gift (for sizing). I was told that I could get a replacement by a few workers.  These associates let me try a bunch of shoes out and were very polite. 

I was going to check out and was being rung up by a manager. He proceeded to tell me that I had to pay an extra $15 to replace the shoes. I was taken back by this because I was told otherwise by the other workers. When he saw my response, he started nagging me about not having a receipt. He tried to look something up, got distracted by something else, then went back to me after a few minutes to nag me some more. 

It's a horrible customer service practice to nag your customers, especially when you don't know their circumstances (like the fact that I received these as gifts) and don't even bother to explain your exchange policy. I didn't experience any rudeness at another store, which is good because I know that there are other Big 5 stores that won't treat me like a disappointing son-in-law.







It doesn't look like much from the outside, but this little store has IT ALL.   We have bought countless sports shoes (usually marked down), knee pads, balls, athletic wear, ski clothes, ball pumps, camping gear. ..you name it.  We probably go in there once a month on average, and someone at the front always greets us and instantly directs us to the location of our item.  There is always a good selection (more than one brand/type to choose from) and we walk out with what we need.   So refreshing after walking aimlessly around Sports Authority where no one makes eye contact with you and the racks have limited sizes/colors.







I was fumbling through a rack looking for shorts in my size, saw the girl at the counter look at me then look back down.. thanks.. for nothing. After walking past her, I realized she had been doing her homework so she didnt have time to help me or acknowledge me.

Won't be returning.







Just like the Big 5 close to home, this store has great service and a nice selection of running shoes.  They always have good sales too.  I found a nice pair of New Balance Trail Runners for $75 - bargain!!  Hubby bought two pairs of shoes and a couple of trinkets.  Easy parking too!







The management at this Big 5 knows how to handle customer service. I have grown up with this store, and somehow they are able to keep up with my changing needs.

A great store and a great team.







They have a lot of stuff.  That is the nicest think I can say.  Prob ok if you know exactly what you want...not ok if you need any help/advice.  (and if you don't need help/advice, than I don't know why you are not just shopping online in the first place)

Very few associates to help.  The associate I could find did not know how childrens shoe sizing worked, did not seem very confident in helping me fit a 4 yr old.  There were no loaner socks to try and when I asked that he bring a few diff brands for us to try, he brought one - I am almost certain the most expensive not on sale one.

We left without buying shoes - no one noticed.  That sums it up.







Extraordinary selection, with constant sales of heavily-discounted items. I routinely find excellent deals on shoes, sleeping bags, etc.
Customer service is generally very good. You may occasionally have to hunt for an employee, but they are very helpful otherwise.
Good store representing a great company.







This place was really good to me! :) i needed to buy 14 soccer balls as the prize for the winners of my soccer camp and they were so nice! I couldn't carry them all, and the manager helped me up to the register as we as out to my car. Thanks guys i really appreciate it! :)







I really like this place. It doesn't seem like as many people go here as some of the other busier Big 5s, like say the one on Stevens Creek. Which means that when there are sales there is always more selection/surplus here then some of the other stores. Oops maybe I shouldn't have said that but its the truth, so there you have it







5 stars for...

1. Absolutely amazing friendly service.
2. The most unbelievably cheap sporting goods ever.

Coming to Big 5, you have to set your expectations straight. This is no REI, so you won't be seeing every variety of every product on their shelves. No road bike gloves and shorts, no World Cup 2010 official Fifa soccer balls... 

What you WILL find are unbeatable prices for basic running and hiking shoes, great prices on assorted goggles and tennis rackets (even cheaper than those on sale at Sports Authority), tons of brand name athletic clothes on sale, among other things like bocce balls!

While this location isn't as big as some others, they are one of the friendliest. Big 5 is the Trader Joe's of sporting good stores. Love it.







I just had the worst customer service experience here. Unfortunately I had to enter this establishment and will not be returning. If I need any of the odd items this store carries I will now be taking my business online even though I am a true shop local person... I can not continue to support a business with no pulse.







I'm not a sporty-type, so I haven't needed to come in that many times.  Both visits for something particular were successful, in part due to good service.

I just bought new shoes for kickboxing.  My running shoes weren't cutting it and I got some advice from the fitness instructor. A sales associate quickly asked if I needed help and when I explained my problem, he said the same thing that my instructor did.  Answers my questions well and quickly got me the shoes I was interested in.  He was also helping other customers during this time.  When I was done he pointed out where the socks were, if I was interested.

Last year I went in for softball mitts.  I had to seek out an employee (who was helping many other customers too) but was able to get good help on choosing a mitt.  They had some great sales and I'm very happy with what I bought.

The store itself is relatively dingy/old, and doesn't have a huge selection for any one item since they carry so much.  In a different (less connoisseur) area, this place would seem great, but if you expect a Palo Alto or Menlo Park "type" of store, you might be disappointed.







I Love this place! All the employees are very nice,  and helpful.  Never had a bad experience here,  and iv been going here since I was a baby to buy shoes and sporting equipment







Unlike Target, they actually have a boxing/martial arts section. And for me, it's the most convenient sporting goods store... This area seems kind of light on them, surprisingly. The prices are fair, at least for what I bought ($6 for lady boxing handwraps). This would be my first stop for any sort of sports equipment or apparel!







My DH purchased a ladder golf, corn hole set approx. 1 month ago. The product cost was $50. After very little use, stored outside but in a covered patio, the thing fell apart. I went to the store with the intention of alerting their buyer that the product was of poor quality...that they ought to stop selling it. I did not have a receipt and was not expecting a refund. As I was in line, an older gentleman behind the counter yelled at me "if you don't have a receipt, we can't do anything for you." It was incredibly rude. I tried to tell him that I only wanted to show them how bad the product and that they shouldn't sell it. He would not let me get a word in and just kept repeating that if I don't have receipt, he can't do anything. Ugh! It was such a poor customer service exchange. It's too bad. I try to buy local (vs. ordering on Amazon), but they lost me as a customer for life.

We've always had good luck shopping here, finding needed items at great prices and even getting competent  customer service. Parking is easy, the cashiers friendly, and the overall shopping experience is greater than at must discount stores but less than at Nordstrom.

I guess things have changed, last time I bought an airsoft gun there was about 13 years ago, and it was a pretty normal experience. I went to buy a gun today and felt like I was 16 years old again. The sales guy that helped me was clueless and slightly arrogant. Will find another place to buy my toys.

So I bought a pair of Coleman Lagoon sandals late last year and never wore them until this June.  (Yes, I know, I should have known better!)  It turns out that they were worse than a piece of junk - after wearing them about five times, the footbed padding had compressed so badly that the plastic rim ended up cutting my heels (and no, I'm not overweight).  The left one was cut so deeply that it bled and got inflamed.  The day before leaving for a vacation!  Lucky, I guess, because I was going to bring those sandals?!??After I got back from my vacation, I tried to return them.  If you've read previous reviews, you can guess that the manager was less than interested and less than polite.  Needless to say, I still have both the scar on my heel AND the sandals.  I can't wear them, and I don't want to give them away even though they're barely worn.  Note to self: do not buy cheap sandals.  Or at least, do not buy them at Big 5.Two stars for some cheap stuff, if you must buy it there.  Just be totally, absolutely sure that it fits and doesn't injure you.  And don't buy Coleman Lagoon sandals anywhere, ever.

I've been to BIG sporting places and small, buying winter stuff, summer, shoes, ammunition, gym clothes, and so much more - and I somehow always seem to find it @ this Big 5 store.  I went there one time on a lark (my glasses kept running down the bridge of my nose) and I was looking for those band - not really sure what to call them, etc., etc One I talked to to clerk and VIOLA!!!

Truly horrible service from the management. I wanted to get a replacement for shoes I received as a gift (for sizing). I was told that I could get a replacement by a few workers.  These associates let me try a bunch of shoes out and were very polite. I was going to check out and was being rung up by a manager. He proceeded to tell me that I had to pay an extra $15 to replace the shoes. I was taken back by this because I was told otherwise by the other workers. When he saw my response, he started nagging me about not having a receipt. He tried to look something up, got distracted by something else, then went back to me after a few minutes to nag me some more. It's a horrible customer service practice to nag your customers, especially when you don't know their circumstances (like the fact that I received these as gifts) and don't even bother to explain your exchange policy. I didn't experience any rudeness at another store, which is good because I know that there are other Big 5 stores that won't treat me like a disappointing son-in-law.

It doesn't look like much from the outside, but this little store has IT ALL.   We have bought countless sports shoes (usually marked down), knee pads, balls, athletic wear, ski clothes, ball pumps, camping gear. ..you name it.  We probably go in there once a month on average, and someone at the front always greets us and instantly directs us to the location of our item.  There is always a good selection (more than one brand/type to choose from) and we walk out with what we need.   So refreshing after walking aimlessly around Sports Authority where no one makes eye contact with you and the racks have limited sizes/colors.

Just like the Big 5 close to home, this store has great service and a nice selection of running shoes.  They always have good sales too.  I found a nice pair of New Balance Trail Runners for $75 - bargain!!  Hubby bought two pairs of shoes and a couple of trinkets.  Easy parking too!

5 stars for...1. Absolutely amazing friendly service.2. The most unbelievably cheap sporting goods ever.Coming to Big 5, you have to set your expectations straight. This is no REI, so you won't be seeing every variety of every product on their shelves. No road bike gloves and shorts, no World Cup 2010 official Fifa soccer balls... What you WILL find are unbeatable prices for basic running and hiking shoes, great prices on assorted goggles and tennis rackets (even cheaper than those on sale at Sports Authority), tons of brand name athletic clothes on sale, among other things like bocce balls!While this location isn't as big as some others, they are one of the friendliest. Big 5 is the Trader Joe's of sporting good stores. Love it.

I just had the worst customer service experience here. Unfortunately I had to enter this establishment and will not be returning. If I need any of the odd items this store carries I will now be taking my business online even though I am a true shop local person... I can not continue to support a business with no pulse.

I'm not a sporty-type, so I haven't needed to come in that many times.  Both visits for something particular were successful, in part due to good service.I just bought new shoes for kickboxing.  My running shoes weren't cutting it and I got some advice from the fitness instructor. A sales associate quickly asked if I needed help and when I explained my problem, he said the same thing that my instructor did.  Answers my questions well and quickly got me the shoes I was interested in.  He was also helping other customers during this time.  When I was done he pointed out where the socks were, if I was interested.Last year I went in for softball mitts.  I had to seek out an employee (who was helping many other customers too) but was able to get good help on choosing a mitt.  They had some great sales and I'm very happy with what I bought.The store itself is relatively dingy/old, and doesn't have a huge selection for any one item since they carry so much.  In a different (less connoisseur) area, this place would seem great, but if you expect a Palo Alto or Menlo Park "type" of store, you might be disappointed.

Unlike Target, they actually have a boxing/martial arts section. And for me, it's the most convenient sporting goods store... This area seems kind of light on them, surprisingly. The prices are fair, at least for what I bought ($6 for lady boxing handwraps). This would be my first stop for any sort of sports equipment or apparel!

My DH purchased a ladder golf, corn hole set approx. 1 month ago. The product cost was $50. After very little use, stored outside but in a covered patio, the thing fell apart. I went to the store with the intention of alerting their buyer that the product was of poor quality...that they ought to stop selling it. I did not have a receipt and was not expecting a refund. As I was in line, an older gentleman behind the counter yelled at me "if you don't have a receipt, we can't do anything for you." It was incredibly rude. I tried to tell him that I only wanted to show them how bad the product and that they shouldn't sell it. He would not let me get a word in and just kept repeating that if I don't have receipt, he can't do anything. Ugh! It was such a poor customer service exchange. It's too bad. I try to buy local (vs. ordering on Amazon), but they lost me as a customer for life.

I don't know what it is about the Big 5 newspaper ad that compels me to read it - I rarely shop there.  But there's something about that ad that draws my attention like a tractor beam.  It's not the biggest sporting goods store on earth - if you're looking to go clothes shopping, I'd go elsewhere.  But when your kids need cleats, helmets, mitts, etc, they've got you covered (with pretty reasonable prices too.)







Ive been back here for more stuff which went pretty good but today i was getting a little piss listening to this asian lady in the front being snappy at a customer. If the sale from the previous week is over, take the damn tags down. Its not the customers fault you didn't do your job. I don't know if the asian lady is a manager or not but someone needs to have a talk with her about acting like one. This lady is pissing off people who want to spend their money there. If it wasn't for my kids really wanting this thing I bought I would've walked out . I want to feel welcome at a store not come to find someone with a bitchy attitude.







I was in a hurry to pick up a pair of running shoes and Steven was friendly and courteous with assisting me in getting the right shoes.  At the register I had a few more questions and the store manager was willing to stop what he was doing and help.
I appreciate the quality of service and felt compelled to write this review.

GOOD SERVICE deserves recognition!







I used to work nearby and the storefront was along the path I would take when I needed to take a short walk to stretch my legs and I would duck in there and look around if my schedule permitted.  The staff was always friendly and were willing to help and answer my dumb questions about store policies and coupons.  The managers rotate from one store to another and are still are able to keep track of your face and pick up conversations from where you left off three weeks ago.







I was overwhelmed from the moment I walked in,  this store is extremely disorganized and messy. Looked at some sweaters and not only is their selection sparse but found many items with defects (broken zippers, thread coming loose etc.). Shoes all over the place and barely any room to walk. I saw one employee and he looked very stressed/overwhelmed. I remember this store being way more organized and pleasant when I was younger. Will not be returning.







Good place and great sales. Picked up a bike helmet on sale and a Frisbee. No problem with service. The place is a little small, need more inventory. I never particularly like shoes from Big 5, so, I stay away from these. I'd rather spend more money on comfort and durability. They have a clearance section for athletic wear, although, I think Ross has better deals. Lots of room for parking.

Overall: Good service, Great prices







This place is just okay. Honestly, I go here to kill time when the family is at Kohl's next door. The staff is friendly, I can usually get at least two people to acknowledge me but it is a super small store and I'd be offended if no one asked me if I needed assistance or at the very least say hello.







Went in again....Should have known better.... Looked around for some crabbing gear, didn't see any then asked the cashier. She was knowledgeable, and was aware that there were none in stock, however she walked with me over to the fishing section and physically confirmed they were out of stock.

What this tells me is that they are aware they are out of stock and likely several people have asked for them, and they have made no attempt to order more.







I think they're a great go to for your kids. Better quality gear than Kmart or Walmart. 

Staff's always helpful. 

I go there for jump ropes. They've a good selection.







The great thing about Big 5, is they are all over, relatively speaking. And it seems, whoever was hoarding all the ammo, has slowed down their roll. If my local Big 5, is out a particular caliber, a nearby store may have it in stock. Most times they even call for me, isn't that nice. A far as the rest of the store goes, they have a pretty good selection of various sporting goods, despite the small size of the store (face it, you are never going to confuse this place with a Cabelas or Bass Pro).  All in all, the folks who run this store do it very well, I am always greeted at the door and I appreciate the job that Adam does managing the store.







I pretty much despise Big 5, but I'll give them an extra star for providing a decent choice of family tents for excellent prices. I picked up a Coleman 8-person tent here for only $130. We'll lend it out for others who have school trips (and to everyone we know), and it may be trashed in a couple of years, but that's OK for this price.

Otherwise this Big 5 is not an impressive place. It has a very small store footprint, small selection and terrible service. I got zero help, other than someone pointing in the general direction of the camping section. The tent prices were unmarked, and the lazy counter dude didn't have a clue, so he made me lug the damn thing all the way up front so he could scan it. Good thing I scored on my first try.







Disastrous experience here.  Had a defective bat that I tried to return - twice - and was blown off - twice.  The two managers I spoke to told me they would follow up and showed me the door. Actually first they offered my 6 year old and I an opportunity to wait at the gun counter.  No thanks.  I won't be shopping here again.







Doug was the sales guy to help me and he was awesome. I was asking for snow gear and it's not out yet. Instead of telling me it's not in stock he goes and brings out boxes and got me everything I needed and asked for. He was great , would come back again.







Very small store. Poorly organized. No clear signs. Open boxes in aisles with no one around. Small rifle/gunshop area but no one behind the counter to help. Prices are not anything special even on the clearance rack. Same complex as kohl toys r us and babies r us. Will go somewhere else for my sporting gear.







This is a really good Big 5. They reminded me of my email coupons and scanned it from my phone. I needed some stuff that was totally hard to reach and they were jumping to help me. Everyone was on point taking care of business. Had to review because I don't get the two stars!?!







Really bad customer service from the assistant manager, Brandon.

Would not recommend this place!







Horrible service.  With the exception of the nice older gentleman, everyone else is rude and refuses to help.  There is never enough people staffing the store and even when I do find someone to ask a question, they don't know the answer.  They don't know their own products.







Big 5 is a great store. They always have great weekly sales and you can always find decent athletic shoes at fantastic prices.

This Big 5 is next to Kohl's in the part of the shopping center that faces the freeway.







Bad service.my advice to big 5 managers is learn california laws when it comes to selling firearms.

 I walked in the store with my fiancé asked to see a shotgun. store manager handed it to me I looked at it passed it on to my fiancé asked her if she liked it,she says yes so then I told manager we will take it. Manager asked who was gonna do paper work I said she was he then denied us both the sale. It's not illegal for my girlfriend to have someone go along with her to purchase a firearm or to ask for his opinion. After denied sale like that we felt like criminals we went to another big 5 in San Mateo and they were notified that we may be going their next and were also denied. They really maid me upset. Big 5 did not stop us from getting what we wanted ohh we got it but never again will we attempt to buy firearms from big 5 . Learn you're california laws.







Really? Managers sitting around chatting and laughing at some I am sure sorry story. Me and poor register guy waiting for him to say yes my $50.00 bill is real. I ask the kid at the register if I should just walk the bill up to him, he responded I wish you could.
Top off the whole thing manager grabs bill from kid looks and then throws it on top of the register, no respect for the guy working the register who must humor me whilst I wait all ticked off.
Last time in that shop for me!

I don't know what it is about the Big 5 newspaper ad that compels me to read it - I rarely shop there.  But there's something about that ad that draws my attention like a tractor beam.  It's not the biggest sporting goods store on earth - if you're looking to go clothes shopping, I'd go elsewhere.  But when your kids need cleats, helmets, mitts, etc, they've got you covered (with pretty reasonable prices too.)

Updated review



Ive been back here for more stuff which went pretty good but today i was getting a little piss listening to this asian lady in the front being snappy at a customer. If the sale from the previous week is over, take the damn tags down. Its not the customers fault you didn't do your job. I don't know if the asian lady is a manager or not but someone needs to have a talk with her about acting like one. This lady is pissing off people who want to spend their money there. If it wasn't for my kids really wanting this thing I bought I would've walked out . I want to feel welcome at a store not come to find someone with a bitchy attitude.

Use to be a good store but now when I go in all I see is most of the workers talking to each other and if you need help you got to seek one out. one time I went in with  my son and my son picked up a hat and some fell the ground and a worker there said hey pick that up rudely. One big thing I feel here is that this place don't care if they get a sale or not. definitely needs a new manager !

I was in a hurry to pick up a pair of running shoes and Steven was friendly and courteous with assisting me in getting the right shoes.  At the register I had a few more questions and the store manager was willing to stop what he was doing and help.I appreciate the quality of service and felt compelled to write this review.GOOD SERVICE deserves recognition!

I used to work nearby and the storefront was along the path I would take when I needed to take a short walk to stretch my legs and I would duck in there and look around if my schedule permitted.  The staff was always friendly and were willing to help and answer my dumb questions about store policies and coupons.  The managers rotate from one store to another and are still are able to keep track of your face and pick up conversations from where you left off three weeks ago.

I was overwhelmed from the moment I walked in,  this store is extremely disorganized and messy. Looked at some sweaters and not only is their selection sparse but found many items with defects (broken zippers, thread coming loose etc.). Shoes all over the place and barely any room to walk. I saw one employee and he looked very stressed/overwhelmed. I remember this store being way more organized and pleasant when I was younger. Will not be returning.

Good place and great sales. Picked up a bike helmet on sale and a Frisbee. No problem with service. The place is a little small, need more inventory. I never particularly like shoes from Big 5, so, I stay away from these. I'd rather spend more money on comfort and durability. They have a clearance section for athletic wear, although, I think Ross has better deals. Lots of room for parking.Overall: Good service, Great prices

This place is just okay. Honestly, I go here to kill time when the family is at Kohl's next door. The staff is friendly, I can usually get at least two people to acknowledge me but it is a super small store and I'd be offended if no one asked me if I needed assistance or at the very least say hello.

            Listed in Fishing needs


Went in again....Should have known better.... Looked around for some crabbing gear, didn't see any then asked the cashier. She was knowledgeable, and was aware that there were none in stock, however she walked with me over to the fishing section and physically confirmed they were out of stock.What this tells me is that they are aware they are out of stock and likely several people have asked for them, and they have made no attempt to order more.

Lat year i used to come here for all of  my saltwater fishing needs, the fishing section was kinda a mess, but they had what i needed. Went there recently and found that the fishing section looks good, but its now focused on freshwater fishing, which doesn't make any sense given the fact that we are only 45 minutes from the coast, and there really isn't any freshwater fish that can be eaten around here for hundreds of miles. Needless to say, i didn't buy anything. Kmart has a better selection.

The great thing about Big 5, is they are all over, relatively speaking. And it seems, whoever was hoarding all the ammo, has slowed down their roll. If my local Big 5, is out a particular caliber, a nearby store may have it in stock. Most times they even call for me, isn't that nice. A far as the rest of the store goes, they have a pretty good selection of various sporting goods, despite the small size of the store (face it, you are never going to confuse this place with a Cabelas or Bass Pro).  All in all, the folks who run this store do it very well, I am always greeted at the door and I appreciate the job that Adam does managing the store.

            Listed in Redwood City - everything but the restaurants


I pretty much despise Big 5, but I'll give them an extra star for providing a decent choice of family tents for excellent prices. I picked up a Coleman 8-person tent here for only $130. We'll lend it out for others who have school trips (and to everyone we know), and it may be trashed in a couple of years, but that's OK for this price.Otherwise this Big 5 is not an impressive place. It has a very small store footprint, small selection and terrible service. I got zero help, other than someone pointing in the general direction of the camping section. The tent prices were unmarked, and the lazy counter dude didn't have a clue, so he made me lug the damn thing all the way up front so he could scan it. Good thing I scored on my first try.

Disastrous experience here.  Had a defective bat that I tried to return - twice - and was blown off - twice.  The two managers I spoke to told me they would follow up and showed me the door. Actually first they offered my 6 year old and I an opportunity to wait at the gun counter.  No thanks.  I won't be shopping here again.

Very small store. Poorly organized. No clear signs. Open boxes in aisles with no one around. Small rifle/gunshop area but no one behind the counter to help. Prices are not anything special even on the clearance rack. Same complex as kohl toys r us and babies r us. Will go somewhere else for my sporting gear.

Horrible service.  With the exception of the nice older gentleman, everyone else is rude and refuses to help.  There is never enough people staffing the store and even when I do find someone to ask a question, they don't know the answer.  They don't know their own products.

Big 5 is a great store. They always have great weekly sales and you can always find decent athletic shoes at fantastic prices.This Big 5 is next to Kohl's in the part of the shopping center that faces the freeway.

Bad service.my advice to big 5 managers is learn california laws when it comes to selling firearms. I walked in the store with my fiancé asked to see a shotgun. store manager handed it to me I looked at it passed it on to my fiancé asked her if she liked it,she says yes so then I told manager we will take it. Manager asked who was gonna do paper work I said she was he then denied us both the sale. It's not illegal for my girlfriend to have someone go along with her to purchase a firearm or to ask for his opinion. After denied sale like that we felt like criminals we went to another big 5 in San Mateo and they were notified that we may be going their next and were also denied. They really maid me upset. Big 5 did not stop us from getting what we wanted ohh we got it but never again will we attempt to buy firearms from big 5 . Learn you're california laws.

Really? Managers sitting around chatting and laughing at some I am sure sorry story. Me and poor register guy waiting for him to say yes my $50.00 bill is real. I ask the kid at the register if I should just walk the bill up to him, he responded I wish you could.Top off the whole thing manager grabs bill from kid looks and then throws it on top of the register, no respect for the guy working the register who must humor me whilst I wait all ticked off.Last time in that shop for me!

I've been coming to big 5 since I was a lil kid always had a good experience decent pricing friendly staff and always loved there gun section hehe great athletic equipment also







I came here with my FSC and all documents on hand, ready to purchase a rifle. The store didn't seem busy and I was greeted at the front register. I walk directly to the firearm area and looked for a few rifles I wanted to take a look at. After spending about 10-15 minutes browsing  as I waited for someone to come by and help me, I decided to leave the store empty handed. I was disappointed that no one ever came by to ask if I needed any help, even though I noticed employees walking from the front to the back of the store multiple times. 

Clearly I could have went off to seek for help, but isn't it a standard to check up on customers every few minutes? I felt like they wanted to avoid helping customers and just get through their shift with doing as little work as possible. Sadly I don't think I'd come back to this store again.







This is my go to place when I need sporting supplies fast and at a decent price.
I would give it 4 stars but most the time the help their doesn't really want to give you the time of day. If you know what you're looking for, run in and get  and run out.







Customer service sucks at this location. Young crew that just stand out in the front and talk smack about other coworkers. No greet or help, very displeased especially at this location. 3/17/17 11:45am







Selection here is decent and prices are competitive. It's one of the few places I can get firearm supplies outside of Bass Pro.







We were just looking for hand warmers. When we walked in, they welcomed us to the store. We asked the employees and they located them for us quickly. They were friendly and helpful. What more could we ask for? Checkout was fast.







Stevens Creek has the Best and friendliest people. We shopped there recently before a camping trip and previously for soccer equipment. Good prices and decent selection for such a small store. I hope it outlasts all the construction in the area, we really like this place.







Unbelievably worst experience I've ever had at a sporting goods store. The manager, Austin, told me he could not get my ping-pong table I wanted to buy because he was the only manager and couldn't leave the store to go in the back and get it, even though there were other employees present. I don't know how someone walks into a store wanting to spend $300 and is told I'm sorry I can't help you. Absolutely incredible.







Have to add one more for NO customer service. We went in needing to buy bats and bat bags. While we shopped our daughter needed to use the bathroom. We were told it was through a back door in the shop. We stood at the locked bathroom door thinking someone must inside. An employee was there with her feet kicked up looking at her phone. She knew we were there and said nothing. I finally walked out and my husband took her to use the bathroom. He asked the employee if there was a key to get in and she ignored him. 3 times. They were in a very small space. She could hear him. He finally raised his voice higher than he needed to and she said the key was at the front. He walked out front and was told the key was lost. By the same people who told him where the bathroom was. We set our $200 of merchandise down and walked out. Spent that money at Sports Authority. Won't return.







While on a bike ride we decided to stop here and check out some items, but there was no bike rack outside to lock up our bikes.  Is it just me, or should a sporting good store have a bike rack?

I like Big 5.  I find their prices comparable to other stores in the area and they do have great email coupons.  

Don't ride your bike here.







IF your looking for name brand cheap shoes come here!  Just understand  what you see is what you get. There is no overstock.

Great place to find camping stuff, sporting goods and guns. My son and husband and son can spend shours here and still not want to leave

They have some really good sales on tents sometimes and lounge chairs







I know you don't know me, but trust me. Do yourself a big favor and don't go here, unless if you want to ruin your day.







Love the weekly shoe sale's they offer. I've bought many pair of sneakers here over the years.







We need to get some sleeping bag for our kids for our Relay for Life event which was coming up very soon. 

I seen in an ad that they were on sale here at Big 5, I know I have gotten some great deals in the past so decided to give Big 5 another try. 

To my surprise, the lady at the counter as we entered was very friendly and helpful, so we took a look around and asked her if somebody can meet us within the sleep bag or camping section, she call and right away somebody was there to help us. We found exactly what we were looking for and went to pay for it after a quick stop at the racquetball area for my 2 year old to get something to throw at home, lol. 

We were in and out within 20 minutes without anybody trying to sell us something we did not need, but instead of something we asked for and they were more than helpful to get for us. We are looking forward to our next trip here and get more supplies for our next event or camping trip.







Received awesome Customer Service by Maria and a very polite gentleman (sorry do not recall his name) They went above and beyond with a 'Can Do' attitude. This store did not have the Coleman Instant Shelter canopy I wanted but Maria made sure I left happy by calling other stores to locate one for me. She had them put it on hold with my name on it. Campbell Big 5 pulled it and had my name on it ready for me as I walked in the door. Both store employees on 'On the ball' and I appreciate that. Thank you Maria and the rest of the gang who helped me out. I told her I was going to Yelp her...here it is lady....keep doing what your doing.







Horrible customer service! 

I had the worst experience here and I am still kicking myself for making my purchase and not just walking out.

I stopped by to purchase a pair of swimming goggles, simple enough. I walk up to the cashier with my goggles and said hello.  The cashier let out the biggest exhale and groan. Yes, she was multitasking and i didn't mean to interrupt but what was i suppose to do. 

The cashier never looked up, never acknowledge my greeting and the only words spoken was $14.04. 

Ironically,, the 1st time I had been to a Big 5 was about a year ago when I was purchasing  nonetheless, wait for it.... swimming goggles. Since then I considered myself a regular shopper purchasing camping equipment, clothing and the random air-horn. 

Sorry Big 5 but i am going back to REI and Sports Basement.







If you value your time, don't come here. What a terrible customer service experience coming to this Big 5 was. What was supposed to be and "in and out" trip turned into a 30 minute wait. 

We came for a sleeping bag, found the one we were looking for in 2 minutes. They don't have them boxed up ready to grab - you need a sales associate to get you one from the back. Okay... That's not a big deal. Wrong! It's not a big deal if it doesn't take you 5 minutes just to track someone down, then wait 20 mins for them to come to you, then another 5 mins for them to bring you said item. Thats exactly what happened when we went on a non busy afternoon. I really wanted to walk out after 10 mins of waiting but my patient husband made us stick around. After waiting 20 mins my husband heard a sales associated go to someone by the shoe dept and ask if they needed help - he went over and said a manager had said someone would be with us next. The guy looked confused, the manager heard and apologized to my husband and told his employee that we were indeed next as we had been waiting for a while. Had my husband not overheard him going to another customer we may have had to wait 30 mins. Ridiculous. I hated the fact that we gave them our business and will never go back for anything.







Overall, I like Big5 Sporting Goods. I have bought a number of items over the years, hiking boots, sunglasses, swim suits and goggles, snow gear, camping gear, watches, etc. 
I would recommend the store for the value of the item they sell, and they actually most of the time have items that I like and fit, for a good price, especially so when on sale. In general these stores are of smaller size, and fun for me to visit. They tend to be a little messy but cozy still. I have found items that I was not able to find at bigger store such as Sport Basement. 
I read several complaints about the staff; I did not have problems with it on my visits, but did not have many questions for them either, or expect that they would know everything about they items they sell in the store. 
One more big plus is their multiple locations in the bay and their website that list their products, and can help getting research done before visiting the store too. Their ad format is nice as well.
Happy shopping! ;-)







I was at this store and I saw a man who I think is the manager being extremely rude to one of his sales clerks, being very loud and in front of a lot of customers, it seemed very disrespectful and inappropriate to be doing in front of customers, i don't know if I will be coming back here







So one star for prices... Nothing more. I came in looking for shoes. After a short search I came up with a couple possibilities. I scan the floor for a salesman, just to catch the only employee I see kicking open the stockroom door and disappearing behind it.

Being fully aware he could be assisting another customer, I wait my turn. After a ten minute wait I catch a young lady heading back into the same room. I ask her if anyone is working in the shoe department. She tells me she'll get someone for me and disappears also.

A few minutes later she comes back out and walks away. I catch her and ask her if she found someone to help me. I tell her nobody has assisted me still. She goes into the stockroom only to immediately run back out, ducking and dodging me to run to the front, where I find her chatting with another employee.

Again I follow her and ask if I can PLEASE get some help. She waves her hand toward the shoe department and informs me, "There's like three people over there." with a big huff... There's still nobody in the department...

So at this point the assistant manager (Patrick I believe) walks over and (I am not embellishing) asks every customer in the department except me (hovering near the stockroom door) if they need help, and proceeds to walk back to the front. 

Obviously at this point I was tired of standing around holding shoe displays and being ignored so I dropped the shoes and left. Not too quickly to overhear the manager complaining to another associate that the customers really need to start paying attention to the sale signs and stop bothering him for details... See ya!

Clearly I could have went off to seek for help, but isn't it a standard to check up on customers every few minutes? I felt like they wanted to avoid helping customers and just get through their shift with doing as little work as possible. Sadly I don't think I'd come back to this store again.

This is my go to place when I need sporting supplies fast and at a decent price.I would give it 4 stars but most the time the help their doesn't really want to give you the time of day. If you know what you're looking for, run in and get  and run out.

Customer service sucks at this location. Young crew that just stand out in the front and talk smack about other coworkers. No greet or help, very displeased especially at this location. 3/17/17 11:45am

We were just looking for hand warmers. When we walked in, they welcomed us to the store. We asked the employees and they located them for us quickly. They were friendly and helpful. What more could we ask for? Checkout was fast.

Stevens Creek has the Best and friendliest people. We shopped there recently before a camping trip and previously for soccer equipment. Good prices and decent selection for such a small store. I hope it outlasts all the construction in the area, we really like this place.

Unbelievably worst experience I've ever had at a sporting goods store. The manager, Austin, told me he could not get my ping-pong table I wanted to buy because he was the only manager and couldn't leave the store to go in the back and get it, even though there were other employees present. I don't know how someone walks into a store wanting to spend $300 and is told I'm sorry I can't help you. Absolutely incredible.

Have to add one more for NO customer service. We went in needing to buy bats and bat bags. While we shopped our daughter needed to use the bathroom. We were told it was through a back door in the shop. We stood at the locked bathroom door thinking someone must inside. An employee was there with her feet kicked up looking at her phone. She knew we were there and said nothing. I finally walked out and my husband took her to use the bathroom. He asked the employee if there was a key to get in and she ignored him. 3 times. They were in a very small space. She could hear him. He finally raised his voice higher than he needed to and she said the key was at the front. He walked out front and was told the key was lost. By the same people who told him where the bathroom was. We set our $200 of merchandise down and walked out. Spent that money at Sports Authority. Won't return.

While on a bike ride we decided to stop here and check out some items, but there was no bike rack outside to lock up our bikes.  Is it just me, or should a sporting good store have a bike rack?I like Big 5.  I find their prices comparable to other stores in the area and they do have great email coupons.  Don't ride your bike here.

We need to get some sleeping bag for our kids for our Relay for Life event which was coming up very soon. I seen in an ad that they were on sale here at Big 5, I know I have gotten some great deals in the past so decided to give Big 5 another try. To my surprise, the lady at the counter as we entered was very friendly and helpful, so we took a look around and asked her if somebody can meet us within the sleep bag or camping section, she call and right away somebody was there to help us. We found exactly what we were looking for and went to pay for it after a quick stop at the racquetball area for my 2 year old to get something to throw at home, lol. We were in and out within 20 minutes without anybody trying to sell us something we did not need, but instead of something we asked for and they were more than helpful to get for us. We are looking forward to our next trip here and get more supplies for our next event or camping trip.

Received awesome Customer Service by Maria and a very polite gentleman (sorry do not recall his name) They went above and beyond with a 'Can Do' attitude. This store did not have the Coleman Instant Shelter canopy I wanted but Maria made sure I left happy by calling other stores to locate one for me. She had them put it on hold with my name on it. Campbell Big 5 pulled it and had my name on it ready for me as I walked in the door. Both store employees on 'On the ball' and I appreciate that. Thank you Maria and the rest of the gang who helped me out. I told her I was going to Yelp her...here it is lady....keep doing what your doing.

Horrible customer service! I had the worst experience here and I am still kicking myself for making my purchase and not just walking out.I stopped by to purchase a pair of swimming goggles, simple enough. I walk up to the cashier with my goggles and said hello.  The cashier let out the biggest exhale and groan. Yes, she was multitasking and i didn't mean to interrupt but what was i suppose to do. The cashier never looked up, never acknowledge my greeting and the only words spoken was $14.04. Ironically,, the 1st time I had been to a Big 5 was about a year ago when I was purchasing  nonetheless, wait for it.... swimming goggles. Since then I considered myself a regular shopper purchasing camping equipment, clothing and the random air-horn. Sorry Big 5 but i am going back to REI and Sports Basement.

If you value your time, don't come here. What a terrible customer service experience coming to this Big 5 was. What was supposed to be and "in and out" trip turned into a 30 minute wait. We came for a sleeping bag, found the one we were looking for in 2 minutes. They don't have them boxed up ready to grab - you need a sales associate to get you one from the back. Okay... That's not a big deal. Wrong! It's not a big deal if it doesn't take you 5 minutes just to track someone down, then wait 20 mins for them to come to you, then another 5 mins for them to bring you said item. Thats exactly what happened when we went on a non busy afternoon. I really wanted to walk out after 10 mins of waiting but my patient husband made us stick around. After waiting 20 mins my husband heard a sales associated go to someone by the shoe dept and ask if they needed help - he went over and said a manager had said someone would be with us next. The guy looked confused, the manager heard and apologized to my husband and told his employee that we were indeed next as we had been waiting for a while. Had my husband not overheard him going to another customer we may have had to wait 30 mins. Ridiculous. I hated the fact that we gave them our business and will never go back for anything.

Overall, I like Big5 Sporting Goods. I have bought a number of items over the years, hiking boots, sunglasses, swim suits and goggles, snow gear, camping gear, watches, etc. I would recommend the store for the value of the item they sell, and they actually most of the time have items that I like and fit, for a good price, especially so when on sale. In general these stores are of smaller size, and fun for me to visit. They tend to be a little messy but cozy still. I have found items that I was not able to find at bigger store such as Sport Basement. I read several complaints about the staff; I did not have problems with it on my visits, but did not have many questions for them either, or expect that they would know everything about they items they sell in the store. One more big plus is their multiple locations in the bay and their website that list their products, and can help getting research done before visiting the store too. Their ad format is nice as well.Happy shopping! ;-)

So one star for prices... Nothing more. I came in looking for shoes. After a short search I came up with a couple possibilities. I scan the floor for a salesman, just to catch the only employee I see kicking open the stockroom door and disappearing behind it.Being fully aware he could be assisting another customer, I wait my turn. After a ten minute wait I catch a young lady heading back into the same room. I ask her if anyone is working in the shoe department. She tells me she'll get someone for me and disappears also.A few minutes later she comes back out and walks away. I catch her and ask her if she found someone to help me. I tell her nobody has assisted me still. She goes into the stockroom only to immediately run back out, ducking and dodging me to run to the front, where I find her chatting with another employee.Again I follow her and ask if I can PLEASE get some help. She waves her hand toward the shoe department and informs me, "There's like three people over there." with a big huff... There's still nobody in the department...So at this point the assistant manager (Patrick I believe) walks over and (I am not embellishing) asks every customer in the department except me (hovering near the stockroom door) if they need help, and proceeds to walk back to the front. Obviously at this point I was tired of standing around holding shoe displays and being ignored so I dropped the shoes and left. Not too quickly to overhear the manager complaining to another associate that the customers really need to start paying attention to the sale signs and stop bothering him for details... See ya!

Hmm, I'm bit perplexed by the really bad reviews with respect to customer service. Maybe management has cleaned up since the bad reviews?

Nonetheless, I've been here on multiple occasions being the gym rat that I am and am in the process of turning my garage into a home gym. I've bought rubber mats, dumbbells and other things in the past. There was one time in which I didn't have the receipt for a return but the items were not opened and they had no problem with me exchanging it.

To the people who are complaining on returning opened items. Well, it must suck even if it's only been a day or two but most retail stores in general will not make an exception on opened products. That's just the way it goes.

Big 5 has always had good prices and they often mail me discount coupons (ex: 10% off, 5 bucks off orders more than 50 etc). Can't beat that.







A smaller Big 5 branch. One thing I always appreciate about Big 5 is their SUPER CHEAP prices for brand names like Adidas, Nike, and Under Armour. 

With that said, I came in looking for kneepads. They had a selection of volleyball kneepads, and I was able to find what I was looking for after searching around the store. The merchandise layout is a little confusing and some directional signage would be incredibly helpful for customers navigating the store.

Customer service could have been better. No one asked me if I needed help even though I spend several minutes actively looking, until approached a staff member. The cashier was pretty curt too.







This is a smaller Big 5, but I kind of like that because it's easier to get in and out quickly and is still has everything I need! I came in to buy hiking boots and there was enough selection and the workers were really nice and helpful. They were able to give advice on different types of hiking boots and the benefits of each. Upon checkout, I was next in line with one other person behind me and they were nice enough to open another cash register for me!







I'm giving a 5 star due to the awesome customer service I had. In case management reads it's cashier 1026843 who you should thank! 

Normally when I return and can't find my receipt (bad habit) I get such a look and given grief. She was patient and asked if o knew when how much etc. I was able to pull the info up and thankful as it was just above $70. She went to the back and was able to pull the receipt and give me a full refund. She could have said no, rolled her eyes, given me a hard time but didn't. I commend her and will be more than happy to shop here in future due to her customer service!!! 

Note: I was able to pull up my back info to show date, amount and card. I understand without this this could have been a different situation but since I was she was able to assist.







My kids just started basketball camp this week and we needed a new ball for the backyard hoop. Admittedly, I usually buy online, but was in the plaza for other shopping needs so decided to drop in. The store manager Austin was extremely patient and helpful, dude is very knowledgeable, and we spent several minutes discussing the best basketball option for my kids. I'll certainly reconsider buying online as my first thought and will definitely be stopping by Big 5 first next time. Thanks Austin!







I went in looking for pink soccer cleats, they didn't have any but I found the cutest pink Nike Shin guards and Pink Adidas socks. Then after shopping around everywhere, Big 5 was the last store in my list and found everything  needed exempt my shoes. David and Eddie helped me out. They are the reason I'm giving them 5 stars! I was very grateful they helped me out. I will defiantly be coming back for more soccer supplies.







Was in the area and needed to replace my nike duffle bag. While in the store I was overlooking the shoe section when I observed an employee continuously disrespecting another employee who was actually working and trying to clean up the area. He just kept trying to instigate and pry at the employee clean up/work on the shoe area. The shit talking employee was not doing shit pushing his way in front of the other employee to help customers. It was like watching a bad episode of high school bullying. The shit talker looked like a low self esteem meth head. Avoid this store, if they can't take care of their own employees what makes you think they can take care of you, trust me they won't. Horrible experience and wont be back...ever. Plenty of better places to buy things with non bullying work/customer environments.







Stopped by to check out some duffel bags.  Asked a sales person if there were other colors available and he became rude and condescending, saying they are all the same and starting tossing bags towards me even though they weren't the right size.  The store manager apologized for the others guys rudeness when I complained.  So much for trying to support our local stores.  I left without purchasing the bag.  I don't think I will be returning anytime soon.







Based on the other reviews, it does not look like Big 5 is going to change their customer service policy anytime soon. Just walked in, 1 manager and 2 associates. No hello or offer to ask for help. Decided I'd make my purchase elsewhere.







WARNING: The return policy here sucks! They don't allow returns on anything that has been opened at all!

Yesterday I came to this store to look for some free weights. They didn't really have any small ones for women! They had some weights, but they weren't what I was looking for. The closest thing that they had to a light fee weight was this As Seen on TV shaker that was so light, there was no way that thing would ever get me toned at all! 

On the plus side, there is a decent selection of other items such as stuff for tennis, sports apparel for men, women, and kids, basketball, camping stuff, shoes, and more. The issue with finding free weights wasn't the main problem though. I settled on almost buying this strange looking pilates thing that comes with two ropes attached to the base that claimed it was good for toning everything as well loosing inches. I also almost bought a pilates mat to go with it. 

Anyways, I was skeptical buying the pilates contraption thing since it looked like something that I might end up getting tangled in or something like that. So I asked the cashier what their return policy is and if I could return it for a refund if I don't like it. She then told me no, but then when I said sorry, I don't want it anymore, she said that I can bring it back if it's still in selling condition. I almost bought it then, but then the manager of the store happened to be in the area and he overheard most of everything. I think that she asked him about their policy too and he said that it can't be returned if it's been opened. 

So I almost ended up wasting almost $30 on that product alone! I'm so glad that I asked about their return policy! I don't like stores that have this kind of policy. I think that's to strict and a huge inconvenience to customers. I won't be coming back there again.







The worst customer service EVER!!! We walked in looking for a specific sized pop up canopy and the 2 lazy cashiers told us to walk into the back employees only room and find one ourselves. What???? When we decided on which one we wanted , Brett our cashier was so irritated that we had the nerve to even ask for a carry out. Really? Will not be shopping here ever again. Please fix your customer service Big 5. It's lacking.







Today I went in on my lunch (about 12:30pm) to look at firearms that were on sale. I was greeted with an unenthusiastic hello from the cashier. 

I went over to the firearms department and waited for any sort of associate to appear. Another gentlemen joined me and after about 5 minutes of waiting had better sense than I to cut his losses there and find a new store. While leaning over the counter to get a better look at prices I had an older man who I can only assume was in a managerial role force his way buy me, open the employee door and quickly retreat into a back room which out so much as a hello or how can I help you or any even marginal attempt at customer service. 

I will never go here again, and from other reviews from people looking to purchase firearms neither should you.







They have a decent selection  of a variety of just enough items to find a median quality version of whatever you're looking for. The coupons sent to you are a motivatir at times to shop....and selective sales items are a deal at times! I've been here 40 Times.The only draw back is they typically are under staffed and you will wait for help and to check out so give yourself some extra time to shop....







So I need a new pair of running shoes and since my son also wanted a new pair of skater shoes, I came to our neighborhood Big 5. Now mind you, I live about 2 blocks away and actually frequent this particular store due to my 16 year old's never ending need for new shoes. 

So, I walk in after a bit of shopping at Nob Hill and an appointment at EWC, and am greeted by a really sweet female cashier. 
I go to the shoe section and find a pair of my son's usual skater shoes and begin to check out the running shoes. 

The whole time there are not 1 but 2 guys working in the shoe department. Now I'm the only customer there as of this time, so of course  I'm expecting some level of customer service. 
Ummmm... No greeting. No eye contact. No anything. Total avoidance is what I received. Now, I don't think I'm at all intimidating at 5'2. But perhaps I'm wrong. 

As I continue to stand and test the flexibility of the shoes an elderly woman of another persuasion comes and begins to look at the shoes next to me...so please tell me why both of the sales associates greet  her and ask if they can be of assistance!! Really now?!? 
I know for a fact that I don't look to be impoverished, nor do I look as if I am just a window shopper. So, what gives? Anyway the younger of the two assists her, while the balding gentleman continues to straighten the shoe display on the wall( mind you they were already straight). So I take it upon myself to greet him and ever so kindly ask him to retrieve 3 pairs of shoes from the back. He does so with a sigh. Whatever!!! 

Basically the only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because of the great customer service and the $10.00 discount I received from the cashier. I wish I had asked her name.







Big 5 has all the usual stuff a sporting goods store should have.  Today I stopped by  to pick up some paper bb's.  I use them in my bb handgun to shoot targets.  The store is very nice and  staff waited on me efficiently.  Try it out. Lot's of other stores around here also.  Limited supply of "air guns".  Large supply of different kinds of ammo.







I'm writing to let you know how disappointed I am with the customer service quality given by the Management at the Big 5 Sporting Goods at 1600 W Campbell Ave. Campbell Ca 95008.  I came there seeking to purchase a firearm and was handled with disrespect and a lack of quality in customer service. Both encounters with management had the ability to process firearms.  The first encounter with a manager on duty, a woman on 02/14/13 (night shift), was rude and had a demeanor that she did not want to help me or be there. She was also rude in answering questions.  This poor customer service made me come back another day to purchase the firearm. 

The second encounter was today, older man 02/18/13 (morning shift), was also rude as he gave off a demeanor that he was not interested in helping me. He also wasn't careful with the firearm as I watched him hit the rails when placing it back.  I understand that the firearm (shotgun) will attain such cosmetic wear, but he had no regard in keeping my firearm from further damage.  As I was processing my DROS, he was rude and it felt that I was hassling in doing the process. By this time, I became upset and decided to take my ID away from him and do my business elsewhere. This lack of customer service will deter me from this store and not recommend it to anyone.  In the best interest of your company, please re-train them in quality customer service. 

I just want everyone to know to stay leery from this one.  I know this may be my first review, but keep in mind, it isnt my first time with customer service. 
Hope this helps.







The service at this Big 5 in Campbell is hit or miss, meaning that it can be good here and there but other times it isn't. Normally, I don't stop in the store unless I really need something. It has the usual assortment of sporting goods that any other similar retailer should have. Prices may be okay, but like the service, it can be hit or miss, though sometimes they may run sales on select items.







This store's return policy inspires me to spend my money at one of the other Big 5s next time around.

Picked up a pair of Reeboks here, wore them for TWO DAYS, got a blister.  Did a thorough job cleaning them up, but the manager wouldn't give a refund because "you can already see the crease" near the toes.  I know it's less than optimal, but sheesh, isn't that going a bit overboard, especially considering I was returning it for what is arguably a defect?  The Menlo Park and Sunnyvale Big 5s, just to name two, are far more generous.

The rank-and-file staff here are quite cool, though.







I bought my son a .22lr rifle here for his birthday.  The manager was fairly well educated on guns, the buying process, and everything involved.  It was relatively simple of a process.  However the front staff could be trained better on how to deal with pickups and purchasing firearms.







I walked into this Big 5 a while back, and have never been back.
Being somewhat of a fitness noob, I heard about kettlebells as a good fitness tool.  I walked into Big 5, hoping someone could help me find one.  There were three employees hanging around the front when I walked in. I asked them if they had any kettlebells.  They all looked at me like I was an alien. One guy said "do you mean...kettleWEIGHTS?" and I hadn't necessarily heard that term in reference to the kettlebells, so I shrugged and said "yes, i suppose".  He looked baffled, making me feel like an idiot.
He walked me over to the weights, and there were several boxes. Every single one of the brands said KETTLEBELLS! not one said kettleWEIGHTS! I then turned around to walk out, and said to the remaining guys up front that all of the boxes said kettlebells and left.
Terrible, unfriendly service, and I haven't been back since.

Well, it must suck even if it's only been a day or two but most retail stores in general will not make an exception on opened products. That's just the way it goes.Big 5 has always had good prices and they often mail me discount coupons (ex: 10% off, 5 bucks off orders more than 50 etc). Can't beat that.

A smaller Big 5 branch. One thing I always appreciate about Big 5 is their SUPER CHEAP prices for brand names like Adidas, Nike, and Under Armour. With that said, I came in looking for kneepads. They had a selection of volleyball kneepads, and I was able to find what I was looking for after searching around the store. The merchandise layout is a little confusing and some directional signage would be incredibly helpful for customers navigating the store.Customer service could have been better. No one asked me if I needed help even though I spend several minutes actively looking, until approached a staff member. The cashier was pretty curt too.

This is a smaller Big 5, but I kind of like that because it's easier to get in and out quickly and is still has everything I need! I came in to buy hiking boots and there was enough selection and the workers were really nice and helpful. They were able to give advice on different types of hiking boots and the benefits of each. Upon checkout, I was next in line with one other person behind me and they were nice enough to open another cash register for me!

I'm giving a 5 star due to the awesome customer service I had. In case management reads it's cashier 1026843 who you should thank! Normally when I return and can't find my receipt (bad habit) I get such a look and given grief. She was patient and asked if o knew when how much etc. I was able to pull the info up and thankful as it was just above $70. She went to the back and was able to pull the receipt and give me a full refund. She could have said no, rolled her eyes, given me a hard time but didn't. I commend her and will be more than happy to shop here in future due to her customer service!!! Note: I was able to pull up my back info to show date, amount and card. I understand without this this could have been a different situation but since I was she was able to assist.

My kids just started basketball camp this week and we needed a new ball for the backyard hoop. Admittedly, I usually buy online, but was in the plaza for other shopping needs so decided to drop in. The store manager Austin was extremely patient and helpful, dude is very knowledgeable, and we spent several minutes discussing the best basketball option for my kids. I'll certainly reconsider buying online as my first thought and will definitely be stopping by Big 5 first next time. Thanks Austin!

I went in looking for pink soccer cleats, they didn't have any but I found the cutest pink Nike Shin guards and Pink Adidas socks. Then after shopping around everywhere, Big 5 was the last store in my list and found everything  needed exempt my shoes. David and Eddie helped me out. They are the reason I'm giving them 5 stars! I was very grateful they helped me out. I will defiantly be coming back for more soccer supplies.

Was in the area and needed to replace my nike duffle bag. While in the store I was overlooking the shoe section when I observed an employee continuously disrespecting another employee who was actually working and trying to clean up the area. He just kept trying to instigate and pry at the employee clean up/work on the shoe area. The shit talking employee was not doing shit pushing his way in front of the other employee to help customers. It was like watching a bad episode of high school bullying. The shit talker looked like a low self esteem meth head. Avoid this store, if they can't take care of their own employees what makes you think they can take care of you, trust me they won't. Horrible experience and wont be back...ever. Plenty of better places to buy things with non bullying work/customer environments.

Stopped by to check out some duffel bags.  Asked a sales person if there were other colors available and he became rude and condescending, saying they are all the same and starting tossing bags towards me even though they weren't the right size.  The store manager apologized for the others guys rudeness when I complained.  So much for trying to support our local stores.  I left without purchasing the bag.  I don't think I will be returning anytime soon.

Based on the other reviews, it does not look like Big 5 is going to change their customer service policy anytime soon. Just walked in, 1 manager and 2 associates. No hello or offer to ask for help. Decided I'd make my purchase elsewhere.

WARNING: The return policy here sucks! They don't allow returns on anything that has been opened at all!Yesterday I came to this store to look for some free weights. They didn't really have any small ones for women! They had some weights, but they weren't what I was looking for. The closest thing that they had to a light fee weight was this As Seen on TV shaker that was so light, there was no way that thing would ever get me toned at all! On the plus side, there is a decent selection of other items such as stuff for tennis, sports apparel for men, women, and kids, basketball, camping stuff, shoes, and more. The issue with finding free weights wasn't the main problem though. I settled on almost buying this strange looking pilates thing that comes with two ropes attached to the base that claimed it was good for toning everything as well loosing inches. I also almost bought a pilates mat to go with it. Anyways, I was skeptical buying the pilates contraption thing since it looked like something that I might end up getting tangled in or something like that. So I asked the cashier what their return policy is and if I could return it for a refund if I don't like it. She then told me no, but then when I said sorry, I don't want it anymore, she said that I can bring it back if it's still in selling condition. I almost bought it then, but then the manager of the store happened to be in the area and he overheard most of everything. I think that she asked him about their policy too and he said that it can't be returned if it's been opened. So I almost ended up wasting almost $30 on that product alone! I'm so glad that I asked about their return policy! I don't like stores that have this kind of policy. I think that's to strict and a huge inconvenience to customers. I won't be coming back there again.

The worst customer service EVER!!! We walked in looking for a specific sized pop up canopy and the 2 lazy cashiers told us to walk into the back employees only room and find one ourselves. What???? When we decided on which one we wanted , Brett our cashier was so irritated that we had the nerve to even ask for a carry out. Really? Will not be shopping here ever again. Please fix your customer service Big 5. It's lacking.

Today I went in on my lunch (about 12:30pm) to look at firearms that were on sale. I was greeted with an unenthusiastic hello from the cashier. I went over to the firearms department and waited for any sort of associate to appear. Another gentlemen joined me and after about 5 minutes of waiting had better sense than I to cut his losses there and find a new store. While leaning over the counter to get a better look at prices I had an older man who I can only assume was in a managerial role force his way buy me, open the employee door and quickly retreat into a back room which out so much as a hello or how can I help you or any even marginal attempt at customer service. I will never go here again, and from other reviews from people looking to purchase firearms neither should you.

They have a decent selection  of a variety of just enough items to find a median quality version of whatever you're looking for. The coupons sent to you are a motivatir at times to shop....and selective sales items are a deal at times! I've been here 40 Times.The only draw back is they typically are under staffed and you will wait for help and to check out so give yourself some extra time to shop....

So I need a new pair of running shoes and since my son also wanted a new pair of skater shoes, I came to our neighborhood Big 5. Now mind you, I live about 2 blocks away and actually frequent this particular store due to my 16 year old's never ending need for new shoes. So, I walk in after a bit of shopping at Nob Hill and an appointment at EWC, and am greeted by a really sweet female cashier. I go to the shoe section and find a pair of my son's usual skater shoes and begin to check out the running shoes. The whole time there are not 1 but 2 guys working in the shoe department. Now I'm the only customer there as of this time, so of course  I'm expecting some level of customer service. Ummmm... No greeting. No eye contact. No anything. Total avoidance is what I received. Now, I don't think I'm at all intimidating at 5'2. But perhaps I'm wrong. As I continue to stand and test the flexibility of the shoes an elderly woman of another persuasion comes and begins to look at the shoes next to me...so please tell me why both of the sales associates greet  her and ask if they can be of assistance!! Really now?!? I know for a fact that I don't look to be impoverished, nor do I look as if I am just a window shopper. So, what gives? Anyway the younger of the two assists her, while the balding gentleman continues to straighten the shoe display on the wall( mind you they were already straight). So I take it upon myself to greet him and ever so kindly ask him to retrieve 3 pairs of shoes from the back. He does so with a sigh. Whatever!!! Basically the only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because of the great customer service and the $10.00 discount I received from the cashier. I wish I had asked her name.

Big 5 has all the usual stuff a sporting goods store should have.  Today I stopped by  to pick up some paper bb's.  I use them in my bb handgun to shoot targets.  The store is very nice and  staff waited on me efficiently.  Try it out. Lot's of other stores around here also.  Limited supply of "air guns".  Large supply of different kinds of ammo.

I'm writing to let you know how disappointed I am with the customer service quality given by the Management at the Big 5 Sporting Goods at 1600 W Campbell Ave. Campbell Ca 95008.  I came there seeking to purchase a firearm and was handled with disrespect and a lack of quality in customer service. Both encounters with management had the ability to process firearms.  The first encounter with a manager on duty, a woman on 02/14/13 (night shift), was rude and had a demeanor that she did not want to help me or be there. She was also rude in answering questions.  This poor customer service made me come back another day to purchase the firearm. The second encounter was today, older man 02/18/13 (morning shift), was also rude as he gave off a demeanor that he was not interested in helping me. He also wasn't careful with the firearm as I watched him hit the rails when placing it back.  I understand that the firearm (shotgun) will attain such cosmetic wear, but he had no regard in keeping my firearm from further damage.  As I was processing my DROS, he was rude and it felt that I was hassling in doing the process. By this time, I became upset and decided to take my ID away from him and do my business elsewhere. This lack of customer service will deter me from this store and not recommend it to anyone.  In the best interest of your company, please re-train them in quality customer service. I just want everyone to know to stay leery from this one.  I know this may be my first review, but keep in mind, it isnt my first time with customer service. Hope this helps.

The service at this Big 5 in Campbell is hit or miss, meaning that it can be good here and there but other times it isn't. Normally, I don't stop in the store unless I really need something. It has the usual assortment of sporting goods that any other similar retailer should have. Prices may be okay, but like the service, it can be hit or miss, though sometimes they may run sales on select items.

This store's return policy inspires me to spend my money at one of the other Big 5s next time around.Picked up a pair of Reeboks here, wore them for TWO DAYS, got a blister.  Did a thorough job cleaning them up, but the manager wouldn't give a refund because "you can already see the crease" near the toes.  I know it's less than optimal, but sheesh, isn't that going a bit overboard, especially considering I was returning it for what is arguably a defect?  The Menlo Park and Sunnyvale Big 5s, just to name two, are far more generous.The rank-and-file staff here are quite cool, though.

I bought my son a .22lr rifle here for his birthday.  The manager was fairly well educated on guns, the buying process, and everything involved.  It was relatively simple of a process.  However the front staff could be trained better on how to deal with pickups and purchasing firearms.

        10/19/2011
    

I walked into this Big 5 a while back, and have never been back.Being somewhat of a fitness noob, I heard about kettlebells as a good fitness tool.  I walked into Big 5, hoping someone could help me find one.  There were three employees hanging around the front when I walked in. I asked them if they had any kettlebells.  They all looked at me like I was an alien. One guy said "do you mean...kettleWEIGHTS?" and I hadn't necessarily heard that term in reference to the kettlebells, so I shrugged and said "yes, i suppose".  He looked baffled, making me feel like an idiot.He walked me over to the weights, and there were several boxes. Every single one of the brands said KETTLEBELLS! not one said kettleWEIGHTS! I then turned around to walk out, and said to the remaining guys up front that all of the boxes said kettlebells and left.Terrible, unfriendly service, and I haven't been back since.

How To YieldBoost BGFV From 2.7% To 15.5% Using Options
Shareholders of Big 5 Sporting Goods Corp looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.7% annualized dividend yield can sell the July 2017 covered call at the $20 strike and collect the premium based on the $1.40 bid, which annualizes to an additional 12.7% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost), for a total of 15.5% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $20 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but BGFV shares would have to advance 9.5% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 17.1% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

Big 5 Sporting Goods Corp Company Profile


   Big 5 Sporting Goods has outgrown its name. The company, which started out with five army surplus shops in California in 1955, is a leading sporting goods retailer with some 415 stores in a dozen mostly western states, including California, Washington, and Arizona. The company sells brand-name (adidas, Coleman, Easton) and private-label equipment, apparel, and footwear for indoor and outdoor activities such as camping, hunting, fishing, tennis, golf, and snowboarding. Big 5 has stuck with a neighborhood-store format (averaging approximately 11,000 sq. ft.) instead of opening massive superstores. Big 5 Sporting Goods is run by its chairman and CEO Steven Miller, the son of company co-founder Robert Miller.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .

<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
