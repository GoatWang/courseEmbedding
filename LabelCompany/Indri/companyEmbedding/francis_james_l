We’re a coaching and training company that specializes in helping normal people to create online businesses around their passion so they can live their ideal lifestyle.
And no – we’re not some bogus “get rich quick” scheme!
It’s all about identifying the best niche market for you, finding out what problems people have in that niche, then selling solutions to those problems in the form of video courses, e-books, software and more.
Because it’s all digital, you don’t need a huge warehouse, a physical store or the massive overheads that come with it. Plus you can get started by selling other people’s products for a commission!
Since 2008, we’ve helped over 100,000 entrepreneurs and small businesses to start and grow their digital product businesses – but we’re not stopping there. Our mission is to share our proven knowledge and experience to revolutionize the industry, so people don’t have to struggle with growing their online businesses any more.

About Us | Information Marketing Blog - By James Francis









































































About UsYou are here: Home / About Us





Hey – I’m James Francis, the Founder & CEO of Digital Prosperity. Nice to meet you!
Through our training programs, we currently help tens of thousands of people from all over the world turn their knowledge and expertise into a successful online information marketing business while living their perfect lifestyle – and I make a cool six figures per year doing the same things myself.
Whether you’re a coach, consultant, expert, or just an average person who’d like to turn their passion into profits, I can help you cut the crap and follow a proven system to achieve your goals, just like I’ve done for my other clients and customers.
But I wasn’t always in this ideal situation…
When I started my online business at the age of 18, I was studying topics I hated at college all day and working a minimum-wage job at a local supermarket on the evenings.
(Stacking shelves with bread is exactly as boring as it sounds!)
Desperate to find a way out and create a better life for myself, I began researching the true ways to become successful with an online business.
It took me over two years to sift through all the lies and misinformation, then after much trial and error, I finally had a working system which provided a dependable monthly profit from selling digital information products (e.g. video courses, e-books, software, coaching programs, and similar) to people who needed them.
Once that moment came, my life changed forever – and the rest is history. That’s when Digital Prosperity was born.
Our driving force is to make a difference to other people’s lives.
In fact, it’s so important to us that we’ve integrated it into our company ethos…
Mission Statement:
To mentor our customers to succeed selling digital products and services in their online business, while living their ideal lifestyle.
Vision Statement:
Our 5 year vision is to inspire, teach and help 1,000 entrepreneurs to achieve financial freedom by selling digital products in their online business while living their ideal lifestyle. We aim to provide a high quality service that goes above and beyond our customers’ expectations and we endeavour to do so with integrity and trust.
Core Values:

Help, support, and respect our customers to the highest standards.
Improve yourself and your skills every day.
Be positive, resilient and optimistic.
Support your team and collaborate with them.
Make decisions and be accountable to them.
Empower and inspire people to make positive changes.
Celebrate the victories, regardless of size.
Know the reasons why.
Always show integrity.

The foundation of all of this is focused on one simple principle…
 
“You will get all you want in life if you help enough other people get what they want.”
– Zig Ziglar

 
That’s why you’ll always see us over-delivering by providing massive value in our training, using a step-by-step teaching method without anything left out.
The secret to my success (and to yours)?
Find a proven system, implement it to the very end while ignoring all distractions, reap the profits, then scale up.
Your success is closer than ever before.
To your success!

James Francis.
Founder & CEO, Digital Prosperity.

What is the best niche for a beginner with no expertise in anything (but serving tables) to go into and actually have a chance to be relevant. I have no miracle cure, i'm not a body builder and if i knew how to make money online, i would not be spending my days in a day job serving people coffee and cleaning the post apocalyptic wasteland they leave after themselves.

Thank you James.

James Watson, Francis Crick, Maurice Wilkins, and Rosalind Franklin
These four scientists—Watson, Crick, Franklin, and Wilkins—codiscovered the double-helix structure of DNA, which formed the basis for modern biotechnology.  












 









Home / Learn / Historical Biographies
At King’s College London, Rosalind Franklin obtained images of DNA using X-ray crystallography, an idea first broached by Maurice Wilkins. Franklin’s images allowed James Watson and Francis Crick to create their famous two-strand, or double-helix, model.
In 1962 Watson (b. 1928), Crick (1916–2004), and Wilkins (1916–2004) jointly received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their 1953 determination of the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Wilkins’s colleague Franklin (1920–1958), who died from cancer at the age of 37, was not so honored. The reasons for her exclusion are unclear.
Discovering the Structure of DNA
The molecule that is the basis for heredity, DNA, contains the patterns for constructing proteins in the body, including the various enzymes. A new understanding of heredity and hereditary disease was possible once it was determined that DNA consists of two chains twisted around each other, or double helixes, of alternating phosphate and sugar groups, and that the two chains are held together by hydrogen bonds between pairs of organic bases—adenine (A) with thymine (T), and guanine (G) with cytosine (C). Modern biotechnology also has its basis in the structural knowledge of DNA—in this case the scientist’s ability to modify the DNA of host cells that will then produce a desired product, for example, insulin.
The background for the work of the four scientists was formed by several scientific breakthroughs: the progress made by X-ray crystallographers in studying organic macromolecules; the growing evidence supplied by geneticists that it was DNA, not protein, in chromosomes that was responsible for heredity; Erwin Chargaff’s experimental finding that there are equal numbers of A and T bases and of G and C bases in DNA; and Linus Pauling’s discovery that the molecules of some proteins have helical shapes—arrived at through the use of atomic models and a keen knowledge of the possible disposition of various atoms.

Rosalind Franklin
Of the four DNA researchers, only Rosalind Franklin had any degrees in chemistry. She was born into a prominent London banking family, where all the children—girls and boys—were encouraged to develop their individual aptitudes. She attended Newnham College, one of the women’s colleges at Cambridge University. She completed her degree in 1941 in the middle of World War II and undertook graduate work at Cambridge with Ronald Norrish, a future Nobel laureate. She resigned her research scholarship in just one year to contribute to the war effort at the British Coal Utilization Research Association. There she performed fundamental investigations on the properties of coal and graphite. She returned briefly to Cambridge, where she presented a dissertation based on this work and was granted a PhD in physical chemistry. After the war, through a French friend, she gained an appointment at the Laboratoire Centrale des Services Chimiques de l’Etat in Paris, where she was introduced to the technique of X-ray crystallography (see video on this page) and rapidly became a respected authority in this field. In 1951 she returned to England to King’s College London, where her charge was to upgrade the X-ray crystallographic laboratory there for work with DNA.

Maurice Wilkins

Already at work at King’s College was Maurice Wilkins, a New Zealand–born but Cambridge-educated physicist. As a new PhD he worked during World War II on the improvement of cathode-ray tube screens for use in radar and then was shipped out to the United States to work on the Manhattan Project. Like many other nuclear physicists, he became disillusioned with his subject when it was applied to the creation of the atomic bomb; he turned instead to biophysics, working with his Cambridge mentor, John T. Randall—who had undergone a similar conversion—first at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and then at King’s College London. It was Wilkins’s idea to study DNA by X-ray crystallographic techniques, which he had already begun to implement when Franklin was appointed by Randall. The relationship between Wilkins and Franklin was unfortunately a poor one and probably slowed their progress. 
James Watson and Francis Crick
Meanwhile, in 1951, 23-year-old James Watson, a Chicago-born American, arrived at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge. Watson had two degrees in zoology: a bachelor’s degree from the University of Chicago and a doctorate from Indiana University, where he became interested in genetics. He had worked under Salvador E. Luria at Indiana on bacteriophages, the viruses that invade bacteria in order to reproduce—a topic for which Luria received a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1969. Watson went to Denmark for postdoctoral work, to continue studying viruses and to remedy his relative ignorance of chemistry. At a conference in the spring of 1951 at the Zoological Station at Naples, Watson heard Wilkins talk on the molecular structure of DNA and saw his recent X-ray crystallographic photographs of DNA. He was hooked.

Watson soon moved to the Cavendish Laboratory, where several important X-ray crystallographic projects were in progress. Under the leadership of William Lawrence Bragg, Max Perutz was investigating hemoglobin and John Kendrew was studying myoglobin, a protein in muscle tissue that stores oxygen. (Perutz and Kendrew received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work in the same year that the prize was awarded to the DNA researchers—1962.) Working under Perutz was Francis Crick, who had earned a bachelor’s degree in physics from University College London and had helped develop radar and magnetic mines during World War II. Crick, another physicist in biology, was supposed to be writing a dissertation on the X-ray crystallography of hemoglobin when Watson arrived, eager to recruit a colleague for work on DNA. Inspired by Pauling’s success in working with molecular models, Watson and Crick rapidly put together several models of DNA and attempted to incorporate all the evidence they could gather. Franklin’s excellent X-ray photographs, to which they had gained access without her permission, were critical to the correct solution. The four scientists announced the structure of DNA in articles that appeared together in the same issue of Nature.
Separate Career Paths
Then they moved off in different directions. Franklin went to Birkbeck College, London, to work in J. D. Bernal’s laboratory, a much more congenial setting for her than King’s College. Before her untimely death from cancer she made important contributions to the X-ray crystallographic analysis of the structure of the tobacco mosaic virus, a landmark in the field. By the end of her life she had become friends with Francis Crick and his wife and had moved her laboratory to Cambridge, where she undertook dangerous work on the poliovirus. Wilkins applied X-ray techniques to the structural determination of nerve cell membranes and of ribonucleic acid (RNA)—a molecule that is associated with chemical synthesis in the living cell—while rising in rank and responsibility at King’s College. Watson’s subsequent career eventually took him to the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) of Quantitative Biology on Long Island, New York, where as director from 1968 onward he led it to new heights as a center of research in molecular biology. From 1988 to 1992 he headed the National Center for Human Genome Research at the National Institutes of Health. Afterward he returned to CSHL, from which he retired in 2007. During Crick’s long tenure at Cambridge, he made fundamental contributions to unlocking the genetic code. He and Sydney Brenner demonstrated that each group of three adjacent bases on a single DNA strand codes for one specific amino acid. He also correctly hypothesized the existence of “transfer” RNA, which mediates between “messenger” RNA and amino acids. After 20 years at Cambridge, with several visiting professorships in the United States, Crick joined the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California.
Further Recognition
In 2005 James Watson was honored with the Othmer Gold Medal from CHF, for his scientific talent, which has given the world a new intellectual understanding of the nature of life, making possible modern biotechnology and a better life for all mankind.
