Murder: A Socratic Dialogue...

I was on an email discussion this morning with some free-market economists and some economically literate fans of free markets. One of them surprised me with this statement:
I always tell my students the Henry Ford $5 a day story in 1914, a great example of management looking out for labor and a "win win" formula for success.  It stopped Marxism's two big arguments:  that capitalists exploit workers and that capitalism alienates workers, forcing them to produce products they can't afford themselves.  But when Ford overnight raised workers pay to $5 a day, it was the first big example of sharing the profits -- and Ford workers could buy Model T's for the first time, thus destroying the Marxist argument of alienation. 
There's nothing necessarily incorrect in his actual statement above. But there is something misleading. It may well be the case that Ford workers could buy Model Ts for the first time because of the increased wages, but he makes it sound as if that was Henry Ford's motive. That's unlikely to have been Ford's motive because the number of Ford workers was probably well under 1% of the number of potential buyers. Would it really make sense to pay more than necessary to get workers so that your number of potential buyers can increase slightly, especially when the downside is that with the higher wages come higher costs and your larger potential market is likely to shrink?

I think it was a fortunate accident that Ford's workers were able to buy Fords. The reason I've read for Ford's success is that Ford was plagued with high turnover and high absenteeism and paying above market reduced turnover and absenteeism substantially. One can imagine this being particularly important in a relatively new industry and certainly an industry with a relatively new production method--the assembly line--because there was probably a bigger gain than normal from keeping people on the job who gradually got very good at it.
If you still think the "pay them more so they can buy the product" argument makes sense, then consider what Henry Hazlitt wrote on this issue in his 1946 classic, Economics in One Lesson:
Some sponsors of the theory seem to imply that the workers in each industry should receive enough to buy back the particular product they make. But they surely cannot mean that the makers of cheap dresses should get enough to buy back cheap dresses and the makers of mink coats enough to buy back mink coats; or that the men in the Ford plant should receive enough to buy Fords and the men in the Cadillac plant enough to buy Cadillacs. 
So a question for the person I quoted above, based on Hazlitt's quote, is this: Were Cadillac workers more alienated than Ford workers?

A few years ago, I used Hazlitt as a supplement to my main text and we covered this chapter. Remember that my students are largely military officers and disproportionately Naval officers. One U.S. Navy student had a great example to make Hazlitt's point. He pointed out it's not a good idea to pay workers making aircraft carriers high enough wages that each of them could buy an aircraft carrier.
Here's an earlier discussion of the issue.

Also, the "buy back the product" argument is literally incoherent. Wages enough to buy the product OVER WHAT TIME PERIOD? Should a person who makes a car be paid enough to buy a new car every year? Every day? Every century?
In fact, everyone is paid enough to buy the product, if you just assume a sufficiently long time horizon. Every worker who contributes to building an aircraft carrier IS paid enough to buy an aircraft carrier, if he just works long enough. (Which may be a thousand years, but who's counting? Not the socialists. They literally don't consider this issue, as far as I know.)

@Michael Makovi,
I think you're not considering consumer behavior. Consumers have their own preferences and these change with income.  A person earning half your wage isn't going to match your consumption habits (just at half the speed) even if they were your clone.
Intuitively, someone living paycheck-to-paycheck may not be willing to wipe out their savings in exchange for a machine that adds costs to their lives and has a declining resale value.
In terms used in economics:
a) People earning low wages usually have higher discount rates than people earning high wages and so purchases of expensive durable goods will seem more attractive to people as their wages rise.
b) Going back to first year economics a consumer's indifference curve for automobiles may intersect with their budget constraint at q=0, and this is less likely the more income someone has.

The Ford example is one that drives me crazy. As Dr. Henderson noted the wage increase was to retain experienced workers. This helped keep the prices low enough that the workers who didn't work for Ford were able to buy the product.

fralupo,
I think adding consumer preferences just makes socialism even worse. 
For example, some socialists will advocate worker control of the firm. The problem is, many workers don't want to control the firm. They'd prefer to make certain, guaranteed wages rather than uncertain, varying profits (and losses). Whether the firm makes a profit or a loss this firm, they'd rather just receive their salary.
And as many professors can attest, having to serve on a governing committee can be awfully bothersome. Many workers would probably prefer to avoid the burden of having to help run the company.
So I think there's a general problem with socialism, viz. that many consumers don't want what socialists think they ought to want.

I would argue that low wage people should do as you say. An unfortunate number of them live paycheck to paycheck due to poor choices. Rent to own big screen TV instead of cash for a smaller or used unit for example. In my case, I bought a Silverado back when making $5.40 an hour, stupid and still embarrassing if I think about it. .

We should keep in mind that the Ford assembly line was VERY different from traditional hand-crafted "carriage" manufacture.  He needed workers who were very on-the-ball, because a small screw-up could "stop the line".  And it is likely that assembly line work, though more efficient, was probably very boring to do one small task hundreds of times per day compared with doing a wider range of handcrafting at a more relaxed pace.
Ford also had a kind of "secret service" who investigated the "moral character" of his employees.  He paid a lot, but he expected a lot as well.
I believe Ford did sell is $5 day as some kind of benificence to his employees, but it was only the improved productivity of the assembly line that could allow it, and the stringent requirements of the assembly line also demanded it to bring in the best workers.

My favorite argument against the "pay them more so they can buy the product" version is: even in the best-case scenario where every penny of the wage increase goes towards a Model T, all Ford has done is find an indirect method of giving away cars.

Tim Worstall had a bit of fun with this a few years back:
"Car production in the year before the pay rise was 170,000, in the year of it 202,000. As we can see above the total labour establishment was only 14,000 anyway. Even if all of his workers bought a car every year it wasn't going to make any but a marginal difference to the sales of the firm.
"We can go further too. As we've seen the rise in the daily wage was from $2.25 to $5 (including the bonuses etc). Say 240 working days in the year and 14,000 workers and we get a rise in the pay bill of  $9 1/4 million over the year. A Model T cost between $550 and $450 (depends on which year we're talking about). 14,000 cars sold at that price gives us $7 3/4 million to $6 1/4 million in income to the company.
"It should be obvious that paying the workforce an extra $9 million so that they can then buy $7 million's worth of company production just isn't a way to increase your profits. It's a great way to increase your losses though."

If the goal is to pay workers enough to buy back the product, and many minimum wage workers work in fast food (or other food service jobs), where the products are often $1 or just a little more, wouldn't that necessarily imply reducing the minimum wage?

It'd be cool to own my own aircraft carrier and it would flesh out the resume quite nicely but I was unable to run a flower shop so I think I'll pass.

Uneducated as he was, Henry Ford understood production. With a turnover rate approaching 300% in his work force the slowdown on the assembly line as they trained new workers was very costly. Hence the $5 wage. It ended turnover and production increased accordingly and profits increased.

Michael   writes:
                            




Might it have had a psychological impact?
Cars, unlike airliners, were a new product that Ford workers could surely see a use for in their own lives. Getting paid enough to actually being able to afford to buy one might improve workers' job satisfaction.

The funny thing is, $15 minimum wage proponents suddenly remember the actual reason why Ford raised wages when talking about low wage jobs. (And assume it was the wage, not the worker the wage was attracting that led to the improvements.) It's one of those great stories: It can mean anything you want it to depending on how you tell it.

@Hasdrubal
Agreed, although there is an aspect of the argument minimum wage proponents who try to tout the minimum wage as an efficiency wage miss: the efficiency wage increases productivity by increasing unemployment.  
An efficiency wage is not much more than a self-imposed price floor, whose job is to limit workers shirking on the job.  The idea is, if a firm pays above-market wages, then a worker will work harder for fear of losing his job and being forced to take less pay somewhere else.  If all firms pay this efficiency wage, a worker will work harder because there is now unemployment in the labor market; there are others who are willing and able to take his job.  
So, when minimum wage proponents make the efficiency wage argument, they are implicitly allowing (indeed, calling for) unemployment to increase.

Nothing like hijacking one of David’s posts for a short rant…..
The “pay them enough to buy what they make” is an obviously silly argument. But our econ 101 answer, “pay them their marginal revenue product”, isn't helpful--it  doesn't do much to explain Ford's wages and leaves students vulnerable to bogus stories like this.
 As an opening sentence in a long novel on labor markets “w=MRP” is only slightly better than “It was a dark and stormy night.” Maybe it’s true, maybe it’s not. But it’s boring and misses all the color, passion and drama that are part of the story of real labor markets. Things like efficiency wages, various types of human capital, signaling and the non pecuniary aspects of work matter much more than the first derivative of a profit function with labor as an independent variable. 
There’s nothing wrong with teaching simple optimization. These are useful life skills that every freshman or MBA student should have. But when teaching labor don’t leave out the sex and violence parts of the novel just because it’s hard to think up good multiple choice questions. 
…rant concluded. (BTW not accusing David of ignoring this stuff in his teaching and writing.)

I believe Ford did sell is $5 day as some kind of benificence to his employees, but it was only the improved productivity of the assembly line that could allow it, and the stringent requirements of the assembly line also demanded it to bring in the best workers.

My favorite argument against the "pay them more so they can buy the product" version is: even in the best-case scenario where every penny of the wage increase goes towards a Model T, all Ford has done is find an indirect method of giving away cars.

Tim Worstall had a bit of fun with this a few years back:
"Car production in the year before the pay rise was 170,000, in the year of it 202,000. As we can see above the total labour establishment was only 14,000 anyway. Even if all of his workers bought a car every year it wasn't going to make any but a marginal difference to the sales of the firm.
"We can go further too. As we've seen the rise in the daily wage was from $2.25 to $5 (including the bonuses etc). Say 240 working days in the year and 14,000 workers and we get a rise in the pay bill of  $9 1/4 million over the year. A Model T cost between $550 and $450 (depends on which year we're talking about). 14,000 cars sold at that price gives us $7 3/4 million to $6 1/4 million in income to the company.
"It should be obvious that paying the workforce an extra $9 million so that they can then buy $7 million's worth of company production just isn't a way to increase your profits. It's a great way to increase your losses though."

If the goal is to pay workers enough to buy back the product, and many minimum wage workers work in fast food (or other food service jobs), where the products are often $1 or just a little more, wouldn't that necessarily imply reducing the minimum wage?

It'd be cool to own my own aircraft carrier and it would flesh out the resume quite nicely but I was unable to run a flower shop so I think I'll pass.

Uneducated as he was, Henry Ford understood production. With a turnover rate approaching 300% in his work force the slowdown on the assembly line as they trained new workers was very costly. Hence the $5 wage. It ended turnover and production increased accordingly and profits increased.

Might it have had a psychological impact?
Cars, unlike airliners, were a new product that Ford workers could surely see a use for in their own lives. Getting paid enough to actually being able to afford to buy one might improve workers' job satisfaction.

The funny thing is, $15 minimum wage proponents suddenly remember the actual reason why Ford raised wages when talking about low wage jobs. (And assume it was the wage, not the worker the wage was attracting that led to the improvements.) It's one of those great stories: It can mean anything you want it to depending on how you tell it.

@Hasdrubal
Agreed, although there is an aspect of the argument minimum wage proponents who try to tout the minimum wage as an efficiency wage miss: the efficiency wage increases productivity by increasing unemployment.  
An efficiency wage is not much more than a self-imposed price floor, whose job is to limit workers shirking on the job.  The idea is, if a firm pays above-market wages, then a worker will work harder for fear of losing his job and being forced to take less pay somewhere else.  If all firms pay this efficiency wage, a worker will work harder because there is now unemployment in the labor market; there are others who are willing and able to take his job.  
So, when minimum wage proponents make the efficiency wage argument, they are implicitly allowing (indeed, calling for) unemployment to increase.

Nothing like hijacking one of David’s posts for a short rant…..
The “pay them enough to buy what they make” is an obviously silly argument. But our econ 101 answer, “pay them their marginal revenue product”, isn't helpful--it  doesn't do much to explain Ford's wages and leaves students vulnerable to bogus stories like this.
 As an opening sentence in a long novel on labor markets “w=MRP” is only slightly better than “It was a dark and stormy night.” Maybe it’s true, maybe it’s not. But it’s boring and misses all the color, passion and drama that are part of the story of real labor markets. Things like efficiency wages, various types of human capital, signaling and the non pecuniary aspects of work matter much more than the first derivative of a profit function with labor as an independent variable. 
There’s nothing wrong with teaching simple optimization. These are useful life skills that every freshman or MBA student should have. But when teaching labor don’t leave out the sex and violence parts of the novel just because it’s hard to think up good multiple choice questions. 
…rant concluded. (BTW not accusing David of ignoring this stuff in his teaching and writing.)

But before you start sending out dozens of emails and making phone calls, sit down and think about your project. What's your budget? What is the scope of your project? Will you need more than one type of professional to complete your home improvement project? Can you afford to complete the full project now, or should you tackle it bit by bit?Once you've settled on your project’s priorities, budget and scope, it's time to start researching home design professionals. Don't sell yourself short and settle on the first professional you set your sights on. Make sure that you're working with someone local, who can get to the jobsite easily and efficiently. Look into the person’s reviews, ask to speak with former clients and to see previous jobs in person. Take a good look at their portfolio photos: How similar are these projects to your own?

Comparing multiple Chester, NJ professionals' bids and experiences can help you find the one that’s best for you. Ask a lot of questions now, so you won't have unexpected answers later.Find a home design professional on Houzz. Narrow down your search by type of professional and location.

What does an interior designer do?A good home design professional will hone your style down to its very essence and be able to choose a functional layout that feels natural to you. Interior design companies can be involved as much or as little as the client desires. Many clients who hire an interior decorator in Chester, NJ — particularly those who are remodeling — have a good sense of how the room should look and what products they should use. Often clients will insist that interior decorators use the products already present in the house. Other times a designer will need to start from scratch — especially if this is a newly purchased or just-built home. An interior design company will need to figure out exactly what the client needs, which includes organizing rooms, picking flooring and wall colors, and finding furniture to complement it all. Sometimes that means he or she will have to recruit help from other Chester, NJ home professionals to help create the perfect look for your renovation. Here are some related professionals and vendors to complement the work of interior designers & decorators: Architects & Building Designers, General Contractors, Home Builders, Design-Build Firms, Photographers.Do your research before meeting with an interior designer or home decorator in Chester, NJ. Ask yourself what you want your space to become and what it will be used for. Figure out the extent of what you need help with, what your must-haves are and what your budget is. Interior design services can add up fast, so be up front with a potential design firm or individual from the beginning. Also, pick an interior decorator that fits your style. Browse through the portfolios of different Chester interior design firms and decide if you would live in those houses. Just because you like something doesn’t mean you could live in it. There's a big difference! You can find more interior designers & decorators in Parsippany, Plainfield, South Plainfield, Somerset and North Plainfield.Questions to ask when you meet with local Chester interior designers: Can you give me a referral? (It makes a big difference to talk with a client who's worked with the designer before.) Can I see your design portfolio? When will the home renovation be done? Do you charge an hourly rate or a flat rate, or use the cost-plus method or a mixed method?Find an interior designer or home decorator in Chester, NJ on Houzz. Narrow your search in the Professionals section to find Chester interior designers near you. You can also look through Chester, NJ photos to find a room you like, then contact the design firm who designed it. Professional Categories in Chester

                                            I went to high school with Brian at Jessie Stuart. He was a great guy. The opening picture is how I remember him looking. Of course we were young, in out teens, back then. Prayers for his wife and family for love and comfort. I'll be praying for you all. He was such a great guy. May he RIP. Love you Brian, Pixie.

My heart hurts for all of us who will miss him everyday, but we will keep him in our thoughts always. "Take a deep seat, a short rein, and a far away look in your eye". Rest easy, my Friend.

You have so been on my heart since I heard about your son's death.  My heart aches with yours and I understand this is your second son who has died! I cannot imagine.. But I know God will carry you and give you peace in the midst of your anguish. Just know I am praying earnestly for you today as I see today is his earthly birthday and also his memorial. 
Sincerely

                                            Seeing the face of a dear friend of my youth and  adulthood.  Studying the features that are still very much like the young self, brings me this comforting thought: the next time I hope to see his face he will be the younger man I knew and confided in, laughed with, played and studied with. He will be even better than his younger self for he will, as will I at that point, be renewed in his heavenly body...no more aging, no more sickness, no more sadness, no more parting. What a day that will be. Bryan was always his own man and not steered by peer pressure.  That's why his life was so successful. I hope my class of 1977 Stuart High School can all celebrate together with Jesus one day in heaven.

                                            Bryan, 
I have many treasured memories, both from High School and more recently.  I'm so glad we met up again through Facebook and managed to see each other again. I wish it had been more. I'm going to miss your unique voice, your smile and your crazy fun. I will cherish those special memories forever. Praying that Jeanne, Cindy, your parents and family will have peace in your passing. I'm going to miss you. RIP  Until we meet again .... I will always love you!

                                            Oh sweet Cindy! I am aching for you and your family and I pray that the long arms of the Lord wrap you all up in His love and peace and carries you gently and peacefully through this valley. I know how much you adored your brother Bryan and how he must have adored you. The tribute to him is nothing short of amazing and shows he lived life large. He impacted all those around him and enjoyed life and what it had to offer. How fitting to celebrate his birthday in the presence of the KING. As you close this chapter and start a new 'normal' please know I am here for you - always- and will continue to pray for the journey ahead. I love you girl and wish I could be in Texas with you and your sweet parents right now, hug your necks, and hold your hands. Prayers my friend!

                                            Cindy, I don't have words to say to comfort you in this trying time that you and your family are going through.    I wish I could be there, just present, to offer a little comfort as you did me when I lost Lisa.   I know your faith is strong and that you know  your brother is in a better place and will be waiting to see you again.    May God be with you all and comfort you as  you begin, again, to  understand what normal will be.

                                            Bryan was one of really wonderful people one meets while navigating life.  I was a shipmate in the late 70's on the USS Independence, and enjoyed my time with him.  My prayers go out to his wife Jeanne and his other friends and family.  I'll always smile when I hear his name.

Fair winds and following seas my friend.

                                            Through tha past three score years, from your tower perch, you have skillfully guided me and my family home on many occasions, helping us to dodge storms and other air traffic. Through these occasions you became a friend, sometimes breaking radio protocol to inquire about life's events and changes. We pilots will most miss the friendly "Welcome Home" in your distinctive, comforting voice at the conclusion of our next flying adventure. May God now welcome you home with equal peace and comfort.

                                            I don't really know what to say about all of this.  Bryan and Jeanne are a part of my heart, and now the part he occupied is missing.  My heart selfishly breaks for my own loss of Bryan, and it breaks even more for the loss of my friend, Jeanne and my new sister, Cindy.  

I will miss Bryan so very much, his smile, his laugh, his hugs, the quirky smile he always had on his face.  I will miss the way he loved my sister, Jeanne.  It was so beautiful to watch and inspired me and others to know that a love like that actually existed and could be found in this crazy world.   

My thoughts, prayers and actions are with Jeanne and Bryan's family, friends, loved ones, and Comrades.  As a veteran, I cannot imagine what it would have been like to have honorably served with such a decorated Sailor as Bryan.  I have lost more than a friend, I have lost a brother, and a brother in arms.  

Rest quietly, dear friend.  You will be missed, but never, ever forgotten.  You will always, always be loved.

                                            Jeanne, I'm so very sorry for your loss. You were still honeymooning, and it is just not fair for this to happen to such a wonderful couple. You two were always on the go, you looked so happy together. The time you both had together was so interesting, Jumping out of planes.....the travel.....and you could tell you were both so happy when I saw you both at Mo's wedding. 
Again, I'm so sorry.

                                            Oh Cindy, it seems counter intuitive in a way to celebrate your loved one's life when those left behind are grieving so deeply.  I was so sad to hear of your beloved brother's sudden passing.  I hope God's peace and comfort surround you now and in the coming days and months.  May all of the sweet, funny, and precious memories of your brother help you celebrate him every day going forward.

                                            Very sorry for your loss.  Bryan and I were friends a long time ago on the USS Kitty Hawk.  We went on Liberty together in Nice, France (via train from Cannes) and then hung out for a time in Philadelphia and New Jersey after that deployment.  A great guy and good and loyal friend.

He will be greatly missed.

The time went so fast as we are both chatter boxes. You were one my most favorites when it comes to cousins. RIP SWEET SOUL

I will lift your bride up daily in my prayers, as I know countless others will be doing. Say hi to Chris for me, would ya? :-)
