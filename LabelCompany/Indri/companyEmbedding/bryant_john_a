Courage is nothing more than your faith, reaching through your fear, displaying itself as action in your life.


					John Hope Bryant

 
 
 
 



					

 

There is a difference being broke and being poor.  Being broke is a temporary economic condition, but being poor is a disabling frame of mind, and a depressed condition of your spirit, and we must vow to never, ever be poor again.


					John Hope Bryant

 
 
 
 



					

Success is going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.

From bestselling book "Love Leadership: The New Way to Lead In A Fear-Based World" (Jossey-Bass)

How The Poor Can Save Capitalism
An inspiring and critically acclaimed new book builds a compelling economic argument for investing in America’s least wealthy consumers.

Available Now

 








John Hope Bryant has made a wonderful, original, and visionary contribution for all of those who want to see economic inequality shrink in their lifetime.

Ambassador Andrew Young

 
 
 




When John Hope Bryant talks about how to expand the middle class, I listen. I urge everyone to read this book and discover for themselves John’s great ideas for creating an America with more shared opportunity and shared responsibility.
President Bill Clinton

 
 
 




One of the few and best plans for addressing poverty is outlined in this book. It lays out a clear and actionable path to address some of the issues that led my father to call for a poor people’s campaign shortly before his assassination. You will have a different perspective on poverty and ‘poor people’ when you finish reading this book and realize that in order to secure our economy, we must ensure that everyone is given a fair and just opportunity to prosper.
Dr. Bernice A. King

 
 
 




John Hope Bryant offers a compelling argument to build both capitalism and communities through the advancement of financial literacy among the poor and middle class. With the vision that all people should have the opportunity to participate fully in our economy, he enlivens the American dream.
William H. Rogers
Chairman, President & CEO, SunTrust Banks, Inc.
 
 
 
 
 
 











Love Leadership 
In a world where leaders are leading by fear, a dynamic young leader shows how leading with love and respect creates success in business and life.
