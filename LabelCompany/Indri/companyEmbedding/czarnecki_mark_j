Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement.

What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Mark Czarnecki, M&T Bank Corp.'s President, COO, Dies at 61
By Stephen Miller

More stories by Stephen Miller





February 27, 2017, 5:31 PM EST










                He joined the bank in 1977 as an assistant branch manager
            



                Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has a 3.49 percent stake
            



Mark J. Czarnecki, who rose from assistant branch manager to president and chief operating officer at M&T Bank during four decades at the lender, has died. He was 61.He died Sunday at a hospital in Buffalo, New York, after an extended illness, the bank announced Monday in a statement. He had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.Czarnecki was responsible for managing M&T’s daily operations, including consumer lending, business banking, investment and mortgage activities. He also oversaw the Buffalo-based company’s technology, human resources and marketing departments.








“Throughout his career -- and throughout his life -- Mark distinguished himself as a leader and a servant of others,” Robert G. Wilmers, M&T’s chairman and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “Both his leadership and his service will be missed greatly -- by his family, his colleagues and his community.”Czarnecki, who became M&T’s president in 2007, was named COO in January 2014 when Vice Chairman Michael Pinto stepped down, citing a serious medical condition. The promotion put Czarnecki in line to succeed Wilmers, 82.Growth StrategyDuring Czarnecki’s tenure as a key executive at the bank, M&T pursued a strategy of rapid expansion. In 2015 the bank acquired Hudson City Bancorp, based in Paramus, New Jersey, for $5.3 billion. Earlier, M&T had added Delaware-based Wilmington Trust and K Bank and Bradford Bank, both based in Baltimore, to its stable.




M&T reported net income of $1.3 billion and total assets of $123.4 billion, as of Dec. 31. The company operates 775 offices in eight eastern states and the District of Columbia and has more than 17,000 employees. Formerly known as Manufacturers and Traders Bank, M&T is one of the 20 largest commercial bank holding companies in the nation, according to its website.“The culture of the bank is to lend to people we know, build on the relationships, with a relatively conservative credit culture,” Czarnecki said, according to 2010 Buffalo News story. “It’s pervasive through every credit product that we have.”Buffett Stake




M&T’s largest shareholders include billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., with a stake of 3.49 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Czarnecki received a bachelor’s degree from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 1977 and an MBA from Canisius College, also in Buffalo, in 1991.He entered M&T in 1977 as an assistant branch manager, joined the bank’s investment group in 1994 and was named president of M&T Securities the following year, according to a company biography.Czarnecki was chairman of the New York Bankers Association in 2010. He served on the board of trustees at Canisius College and the University at Buffalo Foundation Inc. and was a former chairman of the Buffalo Zoo.Survivors include his wife, Elizabeth, and two sons, Christopher and Gregory.

BUFFALO, N.Y., Feb. 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- With deep sadness, M&T Bank announced that President and Chief Operating Officer Mark J. Czarnecki died yesterday after an extended illness. He was 61. 
Mr. Czarnecki served as President of M&T Bank, the principal banking subsidiary of M&T Bank Corporation (NYSE:    MTB) ("M&T"), for the past decade. He was a member of the Boards of Directors of M&T and M&T Bank, and sat on M&T's Management Committee.










 







							 		Mark J. Czarnecki President and Chief Operating Officer M&T Bank
							  



 

 
 



"Throughout his career—and throughout his life—Mark distinguished himself as a leader and a servant of others," said M&T's Chairman and CEO, Robert G. Wilmers. "Both his leadership and his service will be missed greatly—by his family, his colleagues, and his community. But his life and his legacy will live on in all of us, as we carry forth Mark's example, seeking first to enrich the lives of others, then together to grow and improve our company, and finally to create a better and stronger community."  
A 40-year veteran of the company, Mr. Czarnecki began his career as an assistant branch manager, and went on to hold numerous managerial positions in retail banking, business banking, commercial lending, securities, and investments. He was named President in 2007 and Chief Operating Officer in January 2014.
Mr. Czarnecki served as chairman of the New York Bankers Association in 2010. He was active in the community, serving as chairman of the Westminster Foundation and the Westminster Community Charter School, both in partnership with Buffalo Promise Neighborhood. He was past chairman of the Buffalo Zoo, vice chairman of the University at Buffalo Council and a director of the Buffalo Niagara Partnership. 
A Buffalo, New York native, Mr. Czarnecki earned a Bachelor of Science from the State University of New York at Buffalo and a Master of Business Administration from Canisius College.
Mr. Czarnecki is survived by his wife of 38 years, Elizabeth, and their children, Christopher and his wife Jill (Bowman), and Gregory and his fiancée Rosanna Monachino. 
In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made in Mr. Czarnecki's name to the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (pancan.org).
