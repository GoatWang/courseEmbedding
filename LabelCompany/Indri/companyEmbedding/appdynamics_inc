Contact us.Datadog takes care of the complex task of managing a metrics back-end. Instead of figuring out how and where to store data, we get to focus on actually using the data to make better decisions.Arup Chakrabarti, Head of Operations Engineering, Pagerduty Datadog has made it possible for us to find and fix problems quickly.Dario Simonassi, Architecture Manager, Mercado Libre With Datadog we can trace a problem back to its root cause—all the way back to a single database call.Kiril Savino, CTO, GameChanger Common QuestionsHow do you define a host?A host is any physical or virtual OS instance that you monitor with Datadog.How do I monitor containers?The Datadog Agent runs in a container alongside any number of other containers on a host. From there it can collect metrics from its neighboring containers and from the host itself. Depending on your plan, you can monitor 10 or 20 containers free for each host license.Additional containers will be billed at $0.002 per container per hour. In addition, you can purchase prepaid containers at $1 per container per month.What is a custom metric?Datadog was designed to allow you to monitor your own custom applications and business metrics—not just your infrastructure. You can send any and all of your organization's important metrics to Datadog for graphing, alerting, correlation, anomaly detection and more. Example uses: monitoring ad revenue, the rate at which shopping carts are abandoned, or the health of an in-game economy. Many customers find these metrics invaluable, especially when combined with infrastructure metrics.How can I send custom metrics and events?You can send Datadog custom metrics in three ways:1) The Datadog Agent ships with DogStatsD so you can submit custom metrics via the Agent’s non-blocking API functions for many programming languages. 2) The Datadog Agent allows for the creation of custom integrations via plugins to the agent. This plugin system allows the agent to collect custom metrics on your behalf. Integrations which are contributed back to Datadog Agent convert to standard metrics.3) Datadog also has a full-featured API that you can send your metrics to—either directly over HTTP or with a language-specific library.How can I be sure my data is secure?Security is our top priority. This includes, universal HTTPS, strong TLS configuration, and HTTP Strict Transport Security. Our agent is open-source, which means it can be reviewed to ensure it meets your security requirements.Are there other billing options?Annual, monthly and hourly plans are available. We can customize billing plans to meet your needs. For a detailed explanation of billing, please see our Billing FAQ.Do you have special offerings for partners?We’re always looking to partner with technology and service providers and resellers. See our Partners page for more.Still Have Questions?ASK OUR EXPERTSThanks, we'll be in touch soon.×Get Started with DatadogProduct Overview | AppDynamicsSubscriptionsProfileCompany AdminSign outUniversityDownloadsSupport PortalAbout Cisco  AppDynamics is now part of Cisco Learn MoreProduct Product FeaturesOverview Application Performance Management End-User Monitoring Business Performance MonitoringAPP iQ PLATFORMVisibility and dashboards for managing application, customer experience, and business performanceLEARN MOREPricingOverviewFAQSolutions Use CasesDevOpsMonitoring Business PerformanceMicroservicesIT OperationsCloud Migration and ScalingContinuous DeliveryCloud MonitoringFor DevelopersJava.NetPHPNode.jsC++PythonApache Web ServerGoSecurity and AvailabilityBusiness TransactionsExtensibilityIndustryFinancial ServicesGovernmentHealthcareInsuranceRetailMedia and EntertainmentTelecomRoleIT OperationsCIOApp DevelopmentBusiness Owner and AnalystMobile DevelopmentCMOResources Resources OverviewCommunityAppDynamics UniversityAppDynamics EssentialsGetting StartedUser GroupsWebinarsDocumentationExtensionsTake a Guided TourThis quick guided tour walks you through AppDynamics APM’s industry-leading features and benefitsTake a tourCustomers See All Case Studies RETAIL | Container Store TECHNOLOGY | Cisco Financial Services | NasdaqCompany OverviewWhat is AppDynamics?LeadershipPressBlogPartnersCareersContact UsAppD Summit New YorkJoin us on Oct 19 at Pier 36 in New York City for AppD Summit New York.Register NowSTART FREE TRIAL My Subscriptions Log InSign inAccount Support About Cisco  AppDynamics is now part of Cisco Learn MoreSTART FREE TRIAL My Subscriptions Log InSTART FREE TRIAL My Subscriptions Log In Product Product Features Overview Application Performance Management End-User Monitoring Business Performance MonitoringAPP iQ PLATFORMPricing Overview FAQSolutions Use Cases DevOps Monitoring Business Performance Microservices IT Operations Cloud Migration and Scaling Continuous Delivery Cloud MonitoringFor Developers Java .Net PHP Node.js C++ Python Apache Web Server Go Security and Availability Business Transactions ExtensibilityIndustry Financial Services Government Healthcare Insurance Retail Media and Entertainment TelecomRole IT Operations CIO App Development Business Owner and Analyst Mobile Development CMOResources Resources Overview Community AppDynamics University AppDynamics Essentials Getting Started User Groups Webinars Documentation Extensions Take a Guided TourCustomers See All Case StudiesRETAIL | Container Store TECHNOLOGY | Cisco Financial Services | NasdaqCompany Overview What is AppDynamics?

The team is responsible for managing the site’s performance and capacity, quickly finding the root cause of issues and fixing problems fast to ensure seamless service.ChallengesCisco Security Cloud Operations blocks over 250 million threats per day. The team’s main challenge was actioning the 88,000 alerts generated annually by their existing monitoring tools. Valuable time and resources were being wasted, as 96% of these were false positives. The sheer volume of data processed across CWS’s 23 global data centers raised obvious management challenges for the team. With 2,000 physical servers and 5,000 VMs serving more than 200 applications in total, Cisco required a scalable APM solution able to support its complex environment.AppDynamics was rolled out globally across 23 data centers — deploying a total of 15,000 agents in just one week — all to a single AppDynamics report server.At the same time, the organization has witnessed a 12% increase in users over the past year, with average daily transactions growing from 5.5 billion to 6.37 billion. Constantly upscaling compute power in order to meet this demand was not sustainable. Cisco needed a way to scale effectively and manage traffic, while ensuring flawless execution.SolutionCisco Security Cloud Operations required a robust, next-generation Application Performance Management solution able to cope with the scale of its infrastructure and high volumes of daily traffic.The organization first engaged AppDynamics in May 2013, deciding to run a proof-of-concept across its main security scanners, using AppDynamics in a performance environment to spot issues. Nitin Thakur, technical operations manager, Cisco Security Technology Group, said, “From our initial evaluation, it was clear AppDynamics was able to provide the functionality we required to cope with the sheer volume of transactions we handle on a daily basis. We evaluated other products on the market, but for us, AppDynamics provided true end-to-end visibility, and we were impressed with the ease of deployment. Crucially, its future roadmap meant the company was best placed to help us scale for future growth.” After a successful proof-of-concept, AppDynamics was rolled out globally across the organization’s 23 data centers — deploying a total of 15,000 agents — in just one week, and all reporting into a single AppDynamics-hosted SaaS controller.  AppDynamics has enabled us to move towards data-driven troubleshooting rather than ‘gut-feels.’ The solution gives us the application intelligence to know when things aren’t functioning optimally.Benefits: Increased performance, collaboration, and visibilityPreviously, Cisco received 88,000 alerts a year from standard monitoring tools, of which only 3,000 were genuine alerts requiring remedial action. Through implementing AppDynamics, Cisco has been able to dramatically reduce false positives over the past twelve months. “Prior to AppDynamics, our network operations center team was working overtime looking in the wrong places, at the wrong problems. Even if the NOC team only spent an average of five minutes looking at each erroneous alert, that amounts to over 7,000 man hours per year of effort that could be better spent either working on critical issues, or helping to drive innovation forward. Since introducing the AppDynamics platform, we have been able to identify problems we weren’t even looking for. AppDynamics has enabled us to move towards data-driven troubleshooting rather than ‘gut-feels.’ The solution gives us visibility when we need it and the application intelligence to know when things aren’t functioning optimally,” said Thakur. Since introducing AppDynamics, Cisco has identified unique slow business transactions affecting services, as well as addressing multiple configuration errors. For example, Thakur explained, “We spotted a configuration issue which meant 17 million requests were being sent back to our central hub unnecessarily. With AppDynamics, it took just five minutes to find and fix this issue. We were not even looking for this problem and only identified it when it was presented to us.” Among other benefits, this has resulted in a four-to-five percent increase in memory utilization across the entire platform. AppDynamics gives us great visibility into what is happening on the estate, helping us to dramatically reduce the number of escalations.“AppDynamics provides a common language between operations, development, and test. Introducing the platform has helped enable us to move towards a DevOps model, which in turn had a positive impact on employee collaboration,” said Thakur. “The visibility gleaned from AppDynamics has made employees feel more empowered to reach problem resolution and able to influence business outcomes. “Because we make application releases so frequently, for us, it was critical to have APM in production. AppDynamics gives us great visibility into what is happening on the estate, helping us to dramatically reduce the number of escalations and continue delivering a seamless service to our customers.” Future plansCisco sees Application Runbook Automation (RBA) as a critical part of the monitoring solution, and intends to roll this out extensively in the near future. “The goal is have no alerts that humans interact with directly, ensuring issues are automatically remediated and routed to development teams where necessary,” said Thakur. “My goal is to be able to let Chaos Monkey loose and sit back to watch AppDynamics monitor and automate the required remediation,” added Thakur. AppDynamics provides the functionality required to cope with the sheer volume of transactions we handle on a daily basis.Cisco also plans to further integrate AppDynamics with more Security Cloud Operations products.Learn moreBlog - Dev and Ops Continue to Revisit Their Roles in the Enterprise in 2017Docs - AppDynamics App iQ Platform DocumentationeBook - 10 Things Your CIO Should Know About DevOpsCisco | Case Study | AppDynamicsSubscriptionsProfileCompany AdminSign outUniversityDownloadsSupport PortalAbout Cisco  AppDynamics is now part of Cisco Learn MoreProduct Product FeaturesOverview Application Performance Management End-User Monitoring Business Performance MonitoringAPP iQ PLATFORMVisibility and dashboards for managing application, customer experience, and business performanceLEARN MOREPricingOverviewFAQSolutions Use CasesDevOpsMonitoring Business PerformanceMicroservicesIT OperationsCloud Migration and ScalingContinuous DeliveryCloud MonitoringFor DevelopersJava.NetPHPNode.jsC++PythonApache Web ServerGoSecurity and AvailabilityBusiness TransactionsExtensibilityIndustryFinancial ServicesGovernmentHealthcareInsuranceRetailMedia and EntertainmentTelecomRoleIT OperationsCIOApp DevelopmentBusiness Owner and AnalystMobile DevelopmentCMOResources Resources OverviewCommunityAppDynamics UniversityAppDynamics EssentialsGetting StartedUser GroupsWebinarsDocumentationExtensionsTake a Guided TourThis quick guided tour walks you through AppDynamics APM’s industry-leading features and benefitsTake a tourCustomers See All Case Studies RETAIL | Container Store TECHNOLOGY | Cisco Financial Services | NasdaqCompany OverviewWhat is AppDynamics?LeadershipPressBlogPartnersCareersContact UsAppD Summit New YorkJoin us on Oct 19 at Pier 36 in New York City for AppD Summit New York.Register NowSTART FREE TRIAL My Subscriptions Log InSign inAccount Support CustomersCiscoAbout Cisco  AppDynamics is now part of Cisco Learn MoreSTART FREE TRIAL My Subscriptions Log InSTART FREE TRIAL My Subscriptions Log In Product Product Features Overview Application Performance Management End-User Monitoring Business Performance MonitoringAPP iQ PLATFORMPricing Overview FAQSolutions Use Cases DevOps Monitoring Business Performance Microservices IT Operations Cloud Migration and Scaling Continuous Delivery Cloud MonitoringFor Developers Java .Net PHP Node.js C++ Python Apache Web Server Go Security and Availability Business Transactions ExtensibilityIndustry Financial Services Government Healthcare Insurance Retail Media and Entertainment TelecomRole IT Operations CIO App Development Business Owner and Analyst Mobile Development CMOResources Resources Overview Community AppDynamics University AppDynamics Essentials Getting Started User Groups Webinars Documentation Extensions Take a Guided TourCustomers See All Case StudiesRETAIL | Container Store TECHNOLOGY | Cisco Financial Services | NasdaqCompany Overview What is AppDynamics?

Nasdaq is the single largest U.S. stock exchange by volume. That’s how most people know it. But there’s a lot more to Nasdaq than the exchange whose numbers are reported on the nightly business report.Nasdaq software technology powers over 70 marketplaces, regulators, central securities depositories, and clearing houses in over 50 countries. Companies listed on the exchange and those who aren’t, including private companies, use Nasdaq’s suite of solutions for investor relations, public relations, and corporate governance, as well as its specialized tools and platforms. From every perspective, Nasdaq is a software-driven business.Challenges: Slow, Cumbersome Log Analytics, Home-Built ToolsNasdaq’s Corporate Solutions Technology group manages a sizable portfolio of applications used by companies on and off its exchange, as well as its private markets technology and its corporate web properties. Such a multitude of software created over time, plus new innovations Nasdaq is continuously introducing, results in a diverse and complex ecosystem of technologies and infrastructure. Understanding the application environment holistically is a challenge, and pinpointing issues impacting performance and availability can be difficult given the level of interconnectivity and breadth of the platforms.Traditionally, Nasdaq has monitored and managed its applications using a variety of somewhat disparate monitoring, alerting and log aggregation tools. This broad ecosystem creates inefficiencies in tracing a problem to their root cause.“It’s the classic challenge of having to piece together monitoring and logging data across separate systems, tools, and layers in the architecture, and even if the data is there, in many cases it is difficult to directly connect the chain of events and cause and effect,” says Heather Abbott, Senior Vice President of Corporate Solutions Technology. “It can be hard, if not impossible, to put the puzzle together. There’s frustration, especially at the management level, since we are held accountable for application stability, performance, and the ability to get to root causes and resolution quickly.”It was simple to deploy. It took minutes, literally. On our first proof-of-concept, we saw results within an hour.Doing the analysis could take lots of person-hours, sidetracking development and operations team members from more important projects, according to Eric Poon, Director of Operations Analytics. “AppDynamics enables an innovative approach to how we monitor a modern application stack. Using AppDynamics allows us to harvest the valuable business data that only application metrics could provide,” says Poon.Solution: Powerful Out-of-the-Box Functionality Delivers Results in Less Than an HourWhen Nasdaq decided to go outside for an application performance management (APM) solution, it was looking for something that offered high value right out of the box. The team scrutinized how the solution was architected to gather data, and what kind of usability and traceability it offered right out of the box.“It can be gathering all this great data, but if it can’t trace transactions (that may be failing) through the system to the potential issue, then it’s probably not going to be too heavily used,” Abbott says. “At least not widely across all our constituents from engineering to operations, QA business stakeholders, and management.”After looking at several of the leading APM solutions, AppDynamics quickly rose to the top. The AppDynamics Application Intelligence Platform immediately demonstrated its ability to deliver value right out of the box.“It worked as it was advertised and it worked very easily,” Poon says. “It was simple to deploy. It took minutes, literally. On our first proof-of-concept, we saw results within an hour.”Comparing it to the other tools in the market, Poon says, “It really stood very well within a DevOps model, in this day and age where there is a lot of complexity within a given application architecture. The flow map that came out of the box just really sold the product during the POC. By seeing how an application interacts with the different components inside or outside of the environment helps our new application development, and it helps in working with legacy code that a developer may not be the original designer for.”It really stood very well within a DevOps model, in this day and age where there is a lot of complexity within a given application architecture. The flow map that came out of the box just really sold the product...Today, the AppDynamics platform gives Nasdaq visibility across its highly complex and extended application environment, both locally in its data centers and in the cloud, predominantly for Java and .NET applications. Nasdaq uses the platform to see and understand application health, to quickly trace transactions and diagnose issues, and to provide performance insights in pre-production scenarios.Benefits: Speed, Visibility, and a Compelling RoadmapVisibility and rapid time to resolution are the primary benefits AppDynamics brings to Nasdaq, along with the potential to access a whole new level of actionable data. Teams have been freed from the onerous task of scouring logs to pinpoint issues, and time to resolution has been dramatically slashed — from hours or days, down to minutes. The platform quickly points to the offending issues, whether in the code, with remote services, or a database.Abbott cites “the ability to trace a transaction visually and intuitively through the interface” as a major benefit that AppDynamics delivers. That visibility was especially valuable when Nasdaq was migrating a platform from its internal infrastructure to Amazon.“We used AppDynamics extensively to understand how the platform was functioning on Amazon,” Abbott said. “Measuring its performance and understanding how the system was behaving on a completely new infrastructure platform.”It’s a tool that offers seamless traceability and a view that bridge both the APM and the Business product usage effectively.The team and users at Nasdaq speak highly of the AppDynamics platform. Poon reports that the developers who were involved in the proof-of-concept said, “flat out, it’s one of the best tools we’ve deployed here to maximize our application performance.” Abbott says, “It’s a tool that offers seamless traceability and a view that bridge both the APM and the Business product usage effectively.”Going forward, Nasdaq sees strong alignment between the direction AppDynamics is going and the direction Nasdaq wants its technology to go.“We continue to work with innovative companies such as AppDynamics to support the Business and leverage Devops, Poon Says.We used AppDynamics extensively to understand how the platform was functioning on Amazon.Nasdaq | Case Study | AppDynamicsSubscriptionsProfileCompany AdminSign outUniversityDownloadsSupport PortalAbout Cisco  AppDynamics is now part of Cisco Learn MoreProduct Product FeaturesOverview Application Performance Management End-User Monitoring Business Performance MonitoringAPP iQ PLATFORMVisibility and dashboards for managing application, customer experience, and business performanceLEARN MOREPricingOverviewFAQSolutions Use CasesDevOpsMonitoring Business PerformanceMicroservicesIT OperationsCloud Migration and ScalingContinuous DeliveryCloud MonitoringFor DevelopersJava.NetPHPNode.jsC++PythonApache Web ServerGoSecurity and AvailabilityBusiness TransactionsExtensibilityIndustryFinancial ServicesGovernmentHealthcareInsuranceRetailMedia and EntertainmentTelecomRoleIT OperationsCIOApp DevelopmentBusiness Owner and AnalystMobile DevelopmentCMOResources Resources OverviewCommunityAppDynamics UniversityAppDynamics EssentialsGetting StartedUser GroupsWebinarsDocumentationExtensionsTake a Guided TourThis quick guided tour walks you through AppDynamics APM’s industry-leading features and benefitsTake a tourCustomers See All Case Studies RETAIL | Container Store TECHNOLOGY | Cisco Financial Services | NasdaqCompany OverviewWhat is AppDynamics?LeadershipPressBlogPartnersCareersContact UsAppD Summit New YorkJoin us on Oct 19 at Pier 36 in New York City for AppD Summit New York.Register NowSTART FREE TRIAL My Subscriptions Log InSign inAccount Support CustomersNasdaqAbout Cisco  AppDynamics is now part of Cisco Learn MoreSTART FREE TRIAL My Subscriptions Log InSTART FREE TRIAL My Subscriptions Log In Product Product Features Overview Application Performance Management End-User Monitoring Business Performance MonitoringAPP iQ PLATFORMPricing Overview FAQSolutions Use Cases DevOps Monitoring Business Performance Microservices IT Operations Cloud Migration and Scaling Continuous Delivery Cloud MonitoringFor Developers Java .Net PHP Node.js C++ Python Apache Web Server Go Security and Availability Business Transactions ExtensibilityIndustry Financial Services Government Healthcare Insurance Retail Media and Entertainment TelecomRole IT Operations CIO App Development Business Owner and Analyst Mobile Development CMOResources Resources Overview Community AppDynamics University AppDynamics Essentials Getting Started User Groups Webinars Documentation Extensions Take a Guided TourCustomers See All Case StudiesRETAIL | Container Store TECHNOLOGY | Cisco Financial Services | NasdaqCompany Overview What is AppDynamics?

Nasdaq uses the platform to see and understand application health, to quickly trace transactions and diagnose issues, and to provide performance insights in pre-production scenarios.Benefits: Speed, Visibility, and a Compelling RoadmapVisibility and rapid time to resolution are the primary benefits AppDynamics brings to Nasdaq, along with the potential to access a whole new level of actionable data. Teams have been freed from the onerous task of scouring logs to pinpoint issues, and time to resolution has been dramatically slashed — from hours or days, down to minutes. The platform quickly points to the offending issues, whether in the code, with remote services, or a database.Abbott cites “the ability to trace a transaction visually and intuitively through the interface” as a major benefit that AppDynamics delivers. That visibility was especially valuable when Nasdaq was migrating a platform from its internal infrastructure to Amazon.“We used AppDynamics extensively to understand how the platform was functioning on Amazon,” Abbott said. “Measuring its performance and understanding how the system was behaving on a completely new infrastructure platform.”It’s a tool that offers seamless traceability and a view that bridge both the APM and the Business product usage effectively.The team and users at Nasdaq speak highly of the AppDynamics platform. Poon reports that the developers who were involved in the proof-of-concept said, “flat out, it’s one of the best tools we’ve deployed here to maximize our application performance.” Abbott says, “It’s a tool that offers seamless traceability and a view that bridge both the APM and the Business product usage effectively.”Going forward, Nasdaq sees strong alignment between the direction AppDynamics is going and the direction Nasdaq wants its technology to go.“We continue to work with innovative companies such as AppDynamics to support the Business and leverage Devops, Poon Says.We used AppDynamics extensively to understand how the platform was functioning on Amazon.

History and Founding[edit]
AppDynamics was founded in 2008 by Jyoti Bansal, a former lead software architect at Wily Technologies, a provider of application performance management technology.[5] AppDynamics received five rounds of funding totaling $206.5 Million.[6]
In 2016, AppDynamics was ranked #9 on the Forbes Cloud 100 list.[7]
On January 24, 2017 Cisco announced their intention to acquire AppDynamics for $3.7 billion just days before it was set to IPO. [8]
Controversies[edit]
On April 10, 2013, CA Technologies (formerly Computer Associates) filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the Eastern District in New York. The lawsuit claims that AppDynamics violated three patents that came into CA Technologies' possession through acquisitions.[9] This was the second action CA Technologies filed in connection with alleged infringement of patents obtained in the acquisition of Wily Technology. In November 2012, CA Technologies filed a lawsuit asserting patent infringement of the same three APM patents against software company, New Relic. On April 20, 2015 AppDynamics and CA settled the two-year-old patent dispute. AppDynamics said that it paid a "modest fixed payment." [10]
On February 2, 2015, Jonah Kowall, research Vice President in Gartner's IT Operations Research group and lead in evaluating Application Performance Management vendors in the Gartner APM Magic Quadrant took a market development and thought leadership position within AppDynamics.[11][12] Later on February 17, 2015, AppDynamics hired a second APM industry analyst John Rakowski of Forrester Research also into a marketing role.[13]

History and Founding[edit]
AppDynamics was founded in 2008 by Jyoti Bansal, a former lead software architect at Wily Technologies, a provider of application performance management technology.[5] AppDynamics received five rounds of funding totaling $206.5 Million.[6]
In 2016, AppDynamics was ranked #9 on the Forbes Cloud 100 list.[7]
On January 24, 2017 Cisco announced their intention to acquire AppDynamics for $3.7 billion just days before it was set to IPO. [8]
Controversies[edit]
On April 10, 2013, CA Technologies (formerly Computer Associates) filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the Eastern District in New York. The lawsuit claims that AppDynamics violated three patents that came into CA Technologies' possession through acquisitions.[9] This was the second action CA Technologies filed in connection with alleged infringement of patents obtained in the acquisition of Wily Technology. In November 2012, CA Technologies filed a lawsuit asserting patent infringement of the same three APM patents against software company, New Relic. On April 20, 2015 AppDynamics and CA settled the two-year-old patent dispute. AppDynamics said that it paid a "modest fixed payment." [10]
On February 2, 2015, Jonah Kowall, research Vice President in Gartner's IT Operations Research group and lead in evaluating Application Performance Management vendors in the Gartner APM Magic Quadrant took a market development and thought leadership position within AppDynamics.[11][12] Later on February 17, 2015, AppDynamics hired a second APM industry analyst John Rakowski of Forrester Research also into a marketing role.[13]

AppDynamics Spring ‘17 Release Empowers Application Teams to Ship Faster and More Reliably Throughout the Modern Software Development Lifecycle
Apr 5 17
AppDynamics announced its Spring ‘17 release, including the AppDynamics Developer Toolkit and major updates to Enterprise iQ and Business iQ. The latest release empowers application teams to deliver impactful customer experiences faster while laying the foundation for unprecedented scale. Now, the entire business can quickly align around a single goal: continuously delivering high quality mobile and web applications faster than ever. AppDynamics customers can quickly build, deploy, measure and improve their customer experiences regardless of the environment. With the new Developer Toolkit, the AppDynamics Spring ‘17 release provides application teams unmatched application development lifecycle transparency, from the code to end-user experiences and the business outcomes. With this newfound visibility, every team member can see the impact their work has on the business in real time, and ultimately deliver better applications that create value for the organization. The new Developer Toolkit spans tools for build, test, analysis and continuous improvement: Build: Support for new languages and development tools enables application developers to transform ideas into better apps faster. Go Support — Go’s (or Golang’s) popularity continues to rise because it’s powerful yet easy to understand and maintain. With AppDynamics for Go, application teams now have the patented Business Transaction (BT) detection and tracing for Go applications. They can now gain insight with reports on errors generated by bad requests, providing better end-to-end coverage across distributed application environments. Xamarin Support — Comprehensive support for Xamarin allows mobile application developers to embed AppDynamics in native iOS and Android mobile applications and monitor and drive application performance from a single code base. Android Studio Plugin — Developers can now automate the instrumentation process for Android applications, thereby reducing errors and making it easier for developers to deliver performant Android mobile apps. Integration and Test: New extensions to BTs empower app teams to focus on the user journeys and code that move the needle the most, improving customer outcomes and speeding release velocity. Developer Mode Business Transactions — With new Developer Mode BTs, application teams now have deep-code diagnostics for specific Business Transactions in both pre-production and production environments enabling them to quickly address bottlenecks and remediate any issues found in testing. Live Mode Business Transactions — Live Mode BTs deliver faster and more accurate configuration by detecting and defining rules according to live application data to identify critical Business Transactions. Automated Analysis: With new crash analysis tools, applications teams will spend less time on unplanned work and troubleshooting, and more time building new features that can impact the business. Smart Crash Alerts — When instrumenting new mobile applications, Smart Crash Alerts are set up by default to save time and effort post-instrumentation. Spend less time configuring alerts. Unique Crashes in Business iQ — New crash reports in Business iQ correlate app crashes to business metrics like conversion rates, revenue or anything else the business tracks. Now app teams have new visibility into crashes so they can prioritize fixing the issues that matter the most to the business. Smarter Continuous Improvement with Business iQ: The best apps are continuously refined and tuned to improve the user experience. The AppDynamics Developer Toolkit provides unmatched intelligence into customer journeys so app teams know which updates will matter the most to customers and the business. Real User Insights — New session summary dashboards track individual customer sessions while capturing scrolls, taps and other gestures so developers and business leaders gain unparalleled insight into how customers experience applications. Mobile Scorecard — Major updates to the mobile scorecard show the metrics that matter, at a glance. The new mobile scorecard makes it easy to see crash rate, number of crashes, network request performance, and error rates for every mobile application at a glance. Enterprise iQ and Business iQ Enhancements: The Spring ‘17 release also features updates to Enterprise iQ that provide powerful new capabilities and scale for modern enterprises including: License Management — Provides the flexibility required for DevOps environments by assigning licenses based on business unit. With powerful configuration rules and a simple to read dashboard, license keys can be easily assigned or reassigned so that teams never run out of licenses when they need it. Universal Agent — Deploying, upgrading, and maintaining agents is now significantly easier. A single package can now be deployed to any machine that requires monitoring, and the universal agent will coordinate with the AppDynamics controller to automatically deploy and configure it so teams spend less time configuring and more time innovating. Universal agent supports the Java and Machine agent types, with other agents expected to be supported in future releases. More Powerful Business iQ Metrics — Baselines become even more powerful with the Spring ‘17 release. By leveraging the power of the AppDynamics Query Language (ADQL) in Business iQ, application teams can build powerful dashboards and establish health rules faster than ever. Now application teams have even more intelligence into how application changes are impacting the business.

From there it can collect metrics from its neighboring containers and from the host itself. Depending on your plan, you can monitor 10 or 20 containers free for each host license.Additional containers will be billed at $0.002 per container per hour. In addition, you can purchase prepaid containers at $1 per container per month.What is a custom metric?Datadog was designed to allow you to monitor your own custom applications and business metrics—not just your infrastructure. You can send any and all of your organization's important metrics to Datadog for graphing, alerting, correlation, anomaly detection and more. Example uses: monitoring ad revenue, the rate at which shopping carts are abandoned, or the health of an in-game economy. Many customers find these metrics invaluable, especially when combined with infrastructure metrics.How can I send custom metrics and events?You can send Datadog custom metrics in three ways:1) The Datadog Agent ships with DogStatsD so you can submit custom metrics via the Agent’s non-blocking API functions for many programming languages. 2) The Datadog Agent allows for the creation of custom integrations via plugins to the agent. This plugin system allows the agent to collect custom metrics on your behalf. Integrations which are contributed back to Datadog Agent convert to standard metrics.3) Datadog also has a full-featured API that you can send your metrics to—either directly over HTTP or with a language-specific library.How can I be sure my data is secure?Security is our top priority. This includes, universal HTTPS, strong TLS configuration, and HTTP Strict Transport Security. Our agent is open-source, which means it can be reviewed to ensure it meets your security requirements.Are there other billing options?Annual, monthly and hourly plans are available. We can customize billing plans to meet your needs. For a detailed explanation of billing, please see our Billing FAQ.Do you have special offerings for partners?We’re always looking to partner with technology and service providers and resellers.

History and Founding[edit]
AppDynamics was founded in 2008 by Jyoti Bansal, a former lead software architect at Wily Technologies, a provider of application performance management technology.[5] AppDynamics received five rounds of funding totaling $206.5 Million.[6]
In 2016, AppDynamics was ranked #9 on the Forbes Cloud 100 list.[7]
On January 24, 2017 Cisco announced their intention to acquire AppDynamics for $3.7 billion just days before it was set to IPO. [8]
Controversies[edit]
On April 10, 2013, CA Technologies (formerly Computer Associates) filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the Eastern District in New York. The lawsuit claims that AppDynamics violated three patents that came into CA Technologies' possession through acquisitions.[9] This was the second action CA Technologies filed in connection with alleged infringement of patents obtained in the acquisition of Wily Technology. In November 2012, CA Technologies filed a lawsuit asserting patent infringement of the same three APM patents against software company, New Relic. On April 20, 2015 AppDynamics and CA settled the two-year-old patent dispute. AppDynamics said that it paid a "modest fixed payment." [10]
On February 2, 2015, Jonah Kowall, research Vice President in Gartner's IT Operations Research group and lead in evaluating Application Performance Management vendors in the Gartner APM Magic Quadrant took a market development and thought leadership position within AppDynamics.[11][12] Later on February 17, 2015, AppDynamics hired a second APM industry analyst John Rakowski of Forrester Research also into a marketing role.[13]

In 2017, Cisco announced its intent to acquire AppDynamics for $3.7 billion.[3]

History and Founding[edit]
AppDynamics was founded in 2008 by Jyoti Bansal, a former lead software architect at Wily Technologies, a provider of application performance management technology.[5] AppDynamics received five rounds of funding totaling $206.5 Million.[6]
In 2016, AppDynamics was ranked #9 on the Forbes Cloud 100 list.[7]
On January 24, 2017 Cisco announced their intention to acquire AppDynamics for $3.7 billion just days before it was set to IPO. [8]
Controversies[edit]
On April 10, 2013, CA Technologies (formerly Computer Associates) filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the Eastern District in New York. The lawsuit claims that AppDynamics violated three patents that came into CA Technologies' possession through acquisitions.[9] This was the second action CA Technologies filed in connection with alleged infringement of patents obtained in the acquisition of Wily Technology. In November 2012, CA Technologies filed a lawsuit asserting patent infringement of the same three APM patents against software company, New Relic. On April 20, 2015 AppDynamics and CA settled the two-year-old patent dispute. AppDynamics said that it paid a "modest fixed payment." [10]
On February 2, 2015, Jonah Kowall, research Vice President in Gartner's IT Operations Research group and lead in evaluating Application Performance Management vendors in the Gartner APM Magic Quadrant took a market development and thought leadership position within AppDynamics.[11][12] Later on February 17, 2015, AppDynamics hired a second APM industry analyst John Rakowski of Forrester Research also into a marketing role.[13]

History and Founding[edit]
AppDynamics was founded in 2008 by Jyoti Bansal, a former lead software architect at Wily Technologies, a provider of application performance management technology.[5] AppDynamics received five rounds of funding totaling $206.5 Million.[6]
In 2016, AppDynamics was ranked #9 on the Forbes Cloud 100 list.[7]
On January 24, 2017 Cisco announced their intention to acquire AppDynamics for $3.7 billion just days before it was set to IPO. [8]
Controversies[edit]
On April 10, 2013, CA Technologies (formerly Computer Associates) filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the Eastern District in New York. The lawsuit claims that AppDynamics violated three patents that came into CA Technologies' possession through acquisitions.[9] This was the second action CA Technologies filed in connection with alleged infringement of patents obtained in the acquisition of Wily Technology. In November 2012, CA Technologies filed a lawsuit asserting patent infringement of the same three APM patents against software company, New Relic. On April 20, 2015 AppDynamics and CA settled the two-year-old patent dispute. AppDynamics said that it paid a "modest fixed payment." [10]
On February 2, 2015, Jonah Kowall, research Vice President in Gartner's IT Operations Research group and lead in evaluating Application Performance Management vendors in the Gartner APM Magic Quadrant took a market development and thought leadership position within AppDynamics.[11][12] Later on February 17, 2015, AppDynamics hired a second APM industry analyst John Rakowski of Forrester Research also into a marketing role.[13]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
