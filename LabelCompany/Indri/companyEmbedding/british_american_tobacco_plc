Next Generation Products




		We are BAT – our company video

		The people who help make us the company we are today take centre stage in our company video, We are BAT.

		The video presents our business through the eyes of our employees and those we work with around the world. Among those we hear from are a farmer whose family has been supplying us with tobacco for three generations and BAT scientists involved in developing a next generation of potentially less harmful nicotine products.

		We believe their stories show who we are: a progressive company that’s proud of its heritage and excited about the future.

		Our brands

		World-famous tobacco brands and innovative Next Generation Products





				Our brand portfolio is at the heart of our company's vision to ‘be the world's best at satisfying consumer moments in tobacco and beyond’.


    

 
	We make the cigarettes chosen by around one in eight of the world’s one billion adult smokers. Our world-famous tobacco brands drive our year-on-year share growth in our key global markets by meeting the needs of our consumers.

	We are also investing in a portfolio of Next Generation Product brands to meet consumer demand for potentially less risky alternatives to regular cigarettes, including Vapour and Tobacco Heating Products.

	These innovations demonstrate our commitment to meeting all of the differing preferences of our consumers with a choice of tobacco and nicotine products.

	Leading tobacco brands

	Our business isn’t about getting more people to smoke or encouraging those that do smoke to smoke more. It’s about really understanding and meeting the preferences of adult smokers with high quality, innovative products so that we can continue to increase our global market share.

	Our five leading tobacco brands – our Global Drive Brands (GDBs) – are Dunhill, Kent, Lucky Strike, Pall Mall and Rothmans.

	They play a key role in our growth strategy and in 2016 accounted for 49% of all the cigarettes we sold, up from 32% in 2011.






Dunhill


			Dunhill’s roots date back to 1907 when Dunhill Tobacco of London Limited was established on Gentlemen’s Row in London. More than a century later, Dunhill is our premium international brand.






Kent


			Kent symbolises progress through technology in the cigarette category and stands out as the most innovative and forward-looking brand in the industry. It’s a pioneering brand, which has led the way since 1952.








Lucky Strike


			Based on its rich legacy dating back to 1871 when the brand was created by its founder RA Patterson, Lucky Strike stands for the true and original American cigarette.






Pall Mall


			Pall Mall is the third biggest cigarette brand in the world. For more than 115 years its core proposition has been centred on offering adult smokers round the world a combination of value and high quality.








Rothmans


			Rothmans is an iconic brand established in London in 1890. A timeless classic with high-quality standards, Rothmans is finding increasing appeal among adult smokers worldwide thanks to a contemporary proposition.



			Other brands

			Our portfolio of tobacco brands also includes other popular international brands with strong market positions in many countries. They include Vogue, Viceroy, Kool, Peter Stuyvesant, Craven A, Benson & Hedges, John Player Gold Leaf, State Express 555 and Shuang Xi.



	Other Tobacco Products

	As well as cigarettes, our core tobacco product range also includes Fine Cut (roll-your-own and make-your-own tobacco), Swedish-style snus and cigars.

	Next Generation Products

	Alongside our traditional tobacco business, we are also developing products that address consumer demand for potentially less risky alternatives to regular cigarettes. We call them Next Generation Products and our portfolio includes Vapour Products such as e-cigarettes and Tobacco Heating Products.

	Following the launch of our first Vapour Product brand – Vype – in the UK in 2013, we now have a range of products available across a number of international markets, including France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Colombia, Guatemala, Kuwait, Bahrain and the Philippines.

	In December 2016 we opened our first Vype-branded store – in Milan, Italy – at the same time as launching a new type of Vapour Product, Vype Pebble.

	Our Tobacco Heating Product brands are iFuse – launched in Romania in 2015 – and glo, which we launched in Japan in November 2016.

		Opening the doors to a flagship store



 
	Take a look inside our world-first Vype store in Milan and hear about the rewards and challenges of launching a new product in a new market.
 
    
 
	In 2015, Italy became one of the first countries to sell our Vype range of Vapour Products outside the UK. Following a successful pilot in the city of Florence, Vype products have been rolled out to 10 new cities, reaching over 2,000 retailers, as well as being available nationally online.

	In November 2016, our first ever Vype flagship store in Milan opened to coincide with the international launch of our Vype Pebble, a small, portable and simple-to-use vaping device.

	Luca Angiolillo, Head of Next Generation Products at BAT Italy, explains: “The store is not only a place for consumers to buy Vype products, but also to learn more about the category.

	“It was a fantastic culmination of over two years of work in building our Vype business in Italy, from developing new supply chain and distribution channels, to training our marketing agencies in our Vapour Products Marketing Principles to ensure full compliance.

	“Being such a new category, there is still a lot of debate and misunderstanding among both regulators and the general public, so we’re particularly proud of our successes in building a constructive and transparent dialogue on regulation and product standards with the Ministry of Health and the National Institute of Health, based on expertise and scientific evidence.

	“It’s been no easy undertaking and we’ve still much more to do, including further expansion across the country and introducing new devices and flavours in 2017.

	“For me, it’s been a very challenging, yet incredibly fulfilling time and I’m excited to see where the future will take us.”

	In the past five years, we have invested over US$1 billion in building our Next Generation Products business and developing a range of products – including Vapour and Tobacco Heating Products.

	We launched Vype in the UK in 2013 and by the end of 2016 we had six different Vype devices available to consumers, while the range was in ten markets worldwide. We also became the leading Vapour Products business in Europe, covering the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Poland.

		Human rights and Modern Slavery Act 

		Respecting and recognising fundamental freedoms





				We must always conduct our operations in ways that respect the human rights of our employees, the people we work with and the communities in which we operate.


    

 
	We have had a long-standing commitment to respect fundamental human rights, as affirmed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

	Given that we have operations located in some challenging environments and an agricultural supply chain, human rights is particularly important for our business and one we’ve long been focused on addressing.

	That’s why we welcome the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights , and legislation such as the UK Modern Slavery Act , as they clearly articulate the expectations placed on businesses today, as well as providing a roadmap for them to follow and be held account to.

	Our Modern Slavery Act statement

	We are aware of slavery in the world today and take a zero tolerance approach to it in all forms. This encompasses slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour and human trafficking, which affects some of the world’s most vulnerable individuals and groups, often through exploitation by criminal gangs.

	Our first statement in accordance with the requirements of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, covering BAT plc and subsidiary Group companies, details the steps taken by the BAT Group between 1 January and 31 December 2016 to prevent slavery and human trafficking occurring within our business and supply chain1.

Modern Slavery Act statement.pdf (544 kb) 


		Policy: our human rights policy commitments for our own operations and suppliers

		Due Diligence: the steps we take to identify, prevent, mitigate and account for addressing human rights business impacts

		Remedy: the steps we take to remediate any adverse human rights impacts identified.


	Our policies

	Our Statement of Business Principles sets out our beliefs and values as an organisation. It includes our long-standing commitment to respect fundamental human rights, as affirmed by the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.

	Our Human Rights Policy forms part of our Standards of Business Conduct (SoBC) and details our commitments for our most salient human rights issues, including no child labour or exploitation of labour, and respect for freedom of association, as well as covering our management of human rights risks.

	Our Supplier Code of Conduct sets out the minimum standards we expect all our suppliers to adhere to, including specific human rights criteria, and is incorporated into our contractual arrangements with them.

	Due diligence

	Our due diligence processes enable us to monitor the effectiveness of, and compliance to, our Policy commitments, as well as to identify, prevent and mitigate human rights risks and impacts.

	Tobacco leaf agricultural supply chain

	With the highest risks for human rights abuses in our tobacco leaf supply chain, due diligence is conducted on 100% of our first-tier suppliers through the industry-wide Sustainable Tobacco Programme.

	Non-agricultural supply chain

	In 2016, we worked to build upon and strengthen our existing supplier assessment programme for strategic direct materials suppliers, to be better aligned to the UN Guiding Principles and extending it to cover all of our 70,000+ non-agricultural first-tier suppliers worldwide.

	This included working with experts from Verisk Maplecroft, a respected independent consultancy, to develop a systematic, integrated supply chain due diligence (SCDD) process. The starting point for SCDD is to assess each supplier’s inherent human rights risk based on the type of supplier and the country where it operates. To do this, we use a series of Verisk Maplecroft’s human rights indices, including the Modern Slavery Index.

	We then prioritise those suppliers identified as being exposed to the highest risks and ask them to complete a self-assessment questionnaire. The latter is structured around the key areas of our Supplier Code of Conduct and provides us with information on the policies, procedures and practices the supplier has in place to effectively manage these risks.

	Where the results of the self-assessment highlight minor areas for improvement, we work with the supplier to develop corrective actions and agree a timescale for material progress towards compliance.

	Where the results reveal more significant issues, an on-site audit will be conducted by our independent auditor, Intertek. This includes criteria covering forced labour, child labour, wages and hours, health and safety, environment and management systems.

	Should the audit identify areas of concern, we agree an action plan with the supplier that includes clear timescales for improvements to be made. In the event of serious and/or persistent non-compliance, or where suppliers fail to demonstrate a willingness to improve performance, we reserve the right to terminate the business relationship.

	Having successfully tested the process in 2016, we are now conducting a phased roll-out to all our non-agricultural suppliers worldwide.

	In addition to audits triggered by the SCDD process, all of our strategic direct materials suppliers, as part of our existing supplier assessment programme, have to undergo the same audit, also
	conducted by Intertek, in order to be appointed as a new supplier to BAT. They are then re-audited every three to four years.

	BAT subsidiary companies

	All BAT subsidiaries are reviewed annually against country-level human rights risk indicators for businesses by Verisk Maplecroft , an independent global risk analytics consultancy. This includes Maplecroft’s key human rights risk indices, covering issues relating to the labour rights, such as freedom of association, child labour and modern slavery; issues relating to safety and security, such as occupational health and safety, levels of criminality, conflict severity, terrorism intensity, and abuse of human rights by security forces; and issues relating to equal opportunities and fair treatment, such as discrimination in the workplace and the rights of vulnerable minority groups.

	The highest risk countries are then reviewed by our Board Audit Committee, and the performance of our companies in managing human rights in those countries is monitored by our Regional Audit and CSR committees.

	It is also a specific requirement of our key business controls, which apply to all Group companies, for human rights risk assessments and risk mitigation action plans to be in place in countries of concern and for processes to be in place to demonstrate that human rights are managed effectively in the workplace and supply chain. All BAT business units are required to report compliance against the controls annually. 

	Remedy

	Anyone working for, or with the BAT Group, can raise any concerns or grievances in confidence and without fear of reprisal through:


		Our Whistleblowing Policy and procedures as set out in our SoBC

		Worker/employee groups and trades unions

		Our supplier relationship management processes

		Our on-the-ground agricultural Extension Services and expert field technicians for our contracted farmers

		Engagement and consultation with stakeholders directly affected by our operations supplier or farmer groups/associations and, when appropriate, local communities.


	To strengthen and increase the accessibility of our grievance mechanisms, we plan to implement a new third-party managed 'Speak Up' hotline and website by end 2017.

	We conduct detailed investigations of all reported incidents and, in the event of any adverse human rights impacts being identified, we take steps to remediate them, including working collaboratively with the relevant stakeholder where appropriate. Examples include:

	Supplier corrective action plans

	We use the results of supplier self-assessments and audits to work collaboratively with suppliers to agree an action plan with the supplier that includes clear timescales for improvements to be made. In the event of any serious and/or persistent issues, or where suppliers fail to demonstrate a willingness to improve performance, we reserve the right to terminate the business relationship.

	Breaches of our Standards

	For any cases established to be breaches of our Standards, the appropriate action will vary from case to case but will include, depending on the circumstances, dismissal or disciplinary action and, where appropriate, reporting the case to the relevant authorities. Where any weakness in internal controls is identified, appropriate measures are taken to strengthen them.

	Community projects and multi-stakeholder partnerships

	Some human rights issues, particularly in our agricultural supply chain such as child labour, have more endemic root causes which one company – or even one sector – cannot tackle alone. So implementing long-term community based projects and multi-stakeholder partnerships is central to our approach.

		Human rights and Modern Slavery Act 

		Respecting and recognising fundamental freedoms





				We must always conduct our operations in ways that respect the human rights of our employees, the people we work with and the communities in which we operate.


    

 
	We have had a long-standing commitment to respect fundamental human rights, as affirmed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

	Given that we have operations located in some challenging environments and an agricultural supply chain, human rights is particularly important for our business and one we’ve long been focused on addressing.

	That’s why we welcome the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights , and legislation such as the UK Modern Slavery Act , as they clearly articulate the expectations placed on businesses today, as well as providing a roadmap for them to follow and be held account to.

	Our Modern Slavery Act statement

	We are aware of slavery in the world today and take a zero tolerance approach to it in all forms. This encompasses slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour and human trafficking, which affects some of the world’s most vulnerable individuals and groups, often through exploitation by criminal gangs.

	Our first statement in accordance with the requirements of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, covering BAT plc and subsidiary Group companies, details the steps taken by the BAT Group between 1 January and 31 December 2016 to prevent slavery and human trafficking occurring within our business and supply chain1.

		Policy: our human rights policy commitments for our own operations and suppliers

		Due Diligence: the steps we take to identify, prevent, mitigate and account for addressing human rights business impacts

		Remedy: the steps we take to remediate any adverse human rights impacts identified.


	Our policies

	Our Statement of Business Principles sets out our beliefs and values as an organisation. It includes our long-standing commitment to respect fundamental human rights, as affirmed by the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.

	Our Human Rights Policy forms part of our Standards of Business Conduct (SoBC) and details our commitments for our most salient human rights issues, including no child labour or exploitation of labour, and respect for freedom of association, as well as covering our management of human rights risks.

	Our Supplier Code of Conduct sets out the minimum standards we expect all our suppliers to adhere to, including specific human rights criteria, and is incorporated into our contractual arrangements with them.

	Due diligence

	Our due diligence processes enable us to monitor the effectiveness of, and compliance to, our Policy commitments, as well as to identify, prevent and mitigate human rights risks and impacts.

	Tobacco leaf agricultural supply chain

	With the highest risks for human rights abuses in our tobacco leaf supply chain, due diligence is conducted on 100% of our first-tier suppliers through the industry-wide Sustainable Tobacco Programme.

	Non-agricultural supply chain

	In 2016, we worked to build upon and strengthen our existing supplier assessment programme for strategic direct materials suppliers, to be better aligned to the UN Guiding Principles and extending it to cover all of our 70,000+ non-agricultural first-tier suppliers worldwide.

	This included working with experts from Verisk Maplecroft, a respected independent consultancy, to develop a systematic, integrated supply chain due diligence (SCDD) process. The starting point for SCDD is to assess each supplier’s inherent human rights risk based on the type of supplier and the country where it operates. To do this, we use a series of Verisk Maplecroft’s human rights indices, including the Modern Slavery Index.

	We then prioritise those suppliers identified as being exposed to the highest risks and ask them to complete a self-assessment questionnaire. The latter is structured around the key areas of our Supplier Code of Conduct and provides us with information on the policies, procedures and practices the supplier has in place to effectively manage these risks.

	Where the results of the self-assessment highlight minor areas for improvement, we work with the supplier to develop corrective actions and agree a timescale for material progress towards compliance.

	Where the results reveal more significant issues, an on-site audit will be conducted by our independent auditor, Intertek. This includes criteria covering forced labour, child labour, wages and hours, health and safety, environment and management systems.

	Should the audit identify areas of concern, we agree an action plan with the supplier that includes clear timescales for improvements to be made. In the event of serious and/or persistent non-compliance, or where suppliers fail to demonstrate a willingness to improve performance, we reserve the right to terminate the business relationship.

	Having successfully tested the process in 2016, we are now conducting a phased roll-out to all our non-agricultural suppliers worldwide.

	In addition to audits triggered by the SCDD process, all of our strategic direct materials suppliers, as part of our existing supplier assessment programme, have to undergo the same audit, also
	conducted by Intertek, in order to be appointed as a new supplier to BAT. They are then re-audited every three to four years.

	BAT subsidiary companies

	All BAT subsidiaries are reviewed annually against country-level human rights risk indicators for businesses by Verisk Maplecroft , an independent global risk analytics consultancy. This includes Maplecroft’s key human rights risk indices, covering issues relating to the labour rights, such as freedom of association, child labour and modern slavery; issues relating to safety and security, such as occupational health and safety, levels of criminality, conflict severity, terrorism intensity, and abuse of human rights by security forces; and issues relating to equal opportunities and fair treatment, such as discrimination in the workplace and the rights of vulnerable minority groups.

	The highest risk countries are then reviewed by our Board Audit Committee, and the performance of our companies in managing human rights in those countries is monitored by our Regional Audit and CSR committees.

	It is also a specific requirement of our key business controls, which apply to all Group companies, for human rights risk assessments and risk mitigation action plans to be in place in countries of concern and for processes to be in place to demonstrate that human rights are managed effectively in the workplace and supply chain. All BAT business units are required to report compliance against the controls annually. 

	Remedy

	Anyone working for, or with the BAT Group, can raise any concerns or grievances in confidence and without fear of reprisal through:


		Our Whistleblowing Policy and procedures as set out in our SoBC

		Worker/employee groups and trades unions

		Our supplier relationship management processes

		Our on-the-ground agricultural Extension Services and expert field technicians for our contracted farmers

		Engagement and consultation with stakeholders directly affected by our operations supplier or farmer groups/associations and, when appropriate, local communities.


	To strengthen and increase the accessibility of our grievance mechanisms, we plan to implement a new third-party managed 'Speak Up' hotline and website by end 2017.

	We conduct detailed investigations of all reported incidents and, in the event of any adverse human rights impacts being identified, we take steps to remediate them, including working collaboratively with the relevant stakeholder where appropriate. Examples include:

	Supplier corrective action plans

	We use the results of supplier self-assessments and audits to work collaboratively with suppliers to agree an action plan with the supplier that includes clear timescales for improvements to be made. In the event of any serious and/or persistent issues, or where suppliers fail to demonstrate a willingness to improve performance, we reserve the right to terminate the business relationship.

	Breaches of our Standards

	For any cases established to be breaches of our Standards, the appropriate action will vary from case to case but will include, depending on the circumstances, dismissal or disciplinary action and, where appropriate, reporting the case to the relevant authorities. Where any weakness in internal controls is identified, appropriate measures are taken to strengthen them.

	Community projects and multi-stakeholder partnerships

	Some human rights issues, particularly in our agricultural supply chain such as child labour, have more endemic root causes which one company – or even one sector – cannot tackle alone. So implementing long-term community based projects and multi-stakeholder partnerships is central to our approach.

History[edit]
1902 to 2000[edit]




James Buchanan Duke


The company was formed in 1902, when the United Kingdom's Imperial Tobacco Company and the American Tobacco Company of the United States agreed to form a joint venture, the British-American Tobacco Company Ltd.[7] The parent companies agreed not to trade in each other's domestic territory and to assign trademarks, export businesses and overseas subsidiaries to the joint venture. James Buchanan Duke became its chairman and the British American Tobacco business began life in countries as diverse as Canada, China, Germany, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, but not in the United Kingdom or in the United States.[7]
In China, BAT inherited a factory in the Pudong district of Shanghai from W.D. & H.O. Wills, one of the precursor companies of Imperial Tobacco.[8] Under the management of James Augustus Thomas from Rockingham, North Carolina, USA, by 1919 the Shanghai factory was producing more than 243 million cigarettes per week.[9] Thomas worked closely with the local Wing Tai Vo Tobacco Company, which developed into BAT's principal Chinese partner after its success with the "Ruby Queen" cigarette brand.[10]
In 1911 the American Tobacco Company sold its share of the company. Imperial Tobacco gradually reduced its shareholding, but it was not until 1980 that it divested its remaining interests in the company.[7]
At its peak, in 1937 BAT manufactured and distributed 55 billion cigarettes in China. The company's assets were seized by the Japanese in 1941 following their 1937 invasion. In 1953 the company was ejected from China following the foundation of the People's Republic.[8]
In 1976 the group companies were reorganised under a new holding company, B.A.T Industries. In 1994 BAT acquired its former parent, American Tobacco Company (though reorganised after anti-trust proceedings). This brought the Lucky Strike and Pall Mall brands into BAT's portfolio.[11]
In 1999 it merged with Rothmans International,[12] which included a share in a factory in Burma. This made it the target of criticism from human rights groups. It sold its share of the factory on 6 November 2003 after an "exceptional request" from the British government.[13]
2000 to present[edit]




The Globe House: British American Tobacco's current headquarters


In 2002, BAT lost a lawsuit about the right to sell cigarettes under the Marlboro brand name in the UK. It had acquired Rothmans, which had previously bought a licence to use the name from Philip Morris. Philip Morris' attorneys invoked a get-out clause for the case of a major change of ownership.[14]
In 2003, BAT acquired Ente Tabacchi Italiani (ETI) S.p.A, Italy's state tobacco company. The important acquisition would elevate BAT to the number two position in Italy, the second largest tobacco market in the European Union. The scale of the enlarged operations would bring significant opportunities to compete and grow ETI's local brands and BAT's international brands.[15]
In August 2003, BAT acquired a 67.8% holding in the Serbian tobacco company Duvanska Industrija Vranje (DIV), allowing local manufacture of its brands, freeing them from import duties. In the longer term, export opportunities are planned as neighbouring countries in south east Europe developed free trade agreements.[16]
In July 2004 the U.S. business of British American Tobacco (Brown & Williamson) was combined with that of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (R. J. Reynolds), under the R. J. Reynolds name. R. J. Reynolds and Brown & Williamson were the second and third-ranking U.S. tobacco companies prior to the combination. When they combined, R. J. Reynolds became a subsidiary of Reynolds American, with BAT holding a 42% share. In January 2007, BAT closed its remaining UK production plant in Southampton with the loss of over 600 jobs. However, the global Research and Development operation and some financial functions will continue on the site.[17]
Then in 2008 BAT acquired Turkey's state-owned cigarette maker Tekel.
In July 2008, BAT acquired the cigarette and snus operations of the Scandinavian Tobacco Company.[18]
BAT acquired 60% of Indonesia's Bentoel Group in 2009[19] before increasing its stake to 100% the following year.[20]
In May 2011 BAT acquired the Colombian company Productora Tabacalera de Tabacos S.A. (Protabaco).[21]
In October 2016, BAT offered to buy the remaining 57.8 percent of U.S. cigarette maker Reynolds American in a $47 billion takeover that would create the world's biggest listed tobacco company with brands including Newport, Lucky Strike and Pall Mall.[22] In January 2017, Reynolds agreed to an increased $49.4 billion deal, expected to close in the third quarter of the year after approval from both companies' boards of directors.[23]
In April 2017 the company announced the acquisition of a number of Bulgarian cigarette brands from Bulgartabac for more than €100 million.[24]

Current[edit]




One of British American Tobacco's most popular products "Lucky Strike"


International Brands include Dunhill, Kent, North State Lucky Strike, Pall Mall, Vogue, Rothmans International, Winfield, State Express 555, KOOL, and Viceroy. However, British American Tobacco does not necessarily own the rights to all of these brands in every nation they are marketed.

Former[edit]
BAT has diversified into various fields at different times in its history. Its U.S. retail division, BATUS Retail Group, acquired Gimbels, Kohl's, and Saks Fifth Avenue in the 1970s and Marshall Field's and its divisions in 1982. The United Kingdom retail chain Argos was purchased in 1979. Kohl's grocery stores were sold to A&P in 1983. In 1986, BATUS sold the Kohl's department stores and two Marshall Field's divisions, The Crescent and Frederick & Nelson; BATUS closed Gimbels the same year, with many locations being absorbed by sister division Marshall Field's, as well as Allied Stores' Stern's and Pomeroy's divisions. In 1990 Marshall Field's was sold to Dayton Hudson Corporation (now Target Corporation), Ivey's (another Marshall Field's division) was sold to Dillard's, Saks Fifth Avenue was sold to Investcorp S.A., and Argos was demerged (Argos was acquired by previous parent company GUS plc in 1998).
The group was a major financial services company with the acquisitions of Eagle Star (1984),[26] Allied Dunbar (1985) and the Farmers Group, Inc. (1988). Around 1996 British American Tobacco merged their financial operations into a single operating unit, British American Financial Services (BAFS). This division was merged with Zurich Insurance Company in 1998 to form the Zurich Financial Services Group.[27] B.A.T still owns the minority interest in Zurich.
Senior management[edit]
Nicandro Durante became the chief executive in March 2011.[28]
Sponsorships[edit]
BAT have found many imaginative ways over the years to keep its brands in the public eye. ITC Limited, in which BAT holds a minority share, as recently as 1996 secured an arrangement to sponsor the Cricket World Cup which was branded the "Wills World Cup" and thereby achieved a high level of brand recognition for the Wills cigarette brand in India where young cricket fans were a key target market.[29]
BAT also sponsor the London Symphony Orchestra.[30]
Motorsport[edit]




Jacques Villeneuve driving for BAR at the 1999 Canadian Grand Prix.


In 1997 BAT brought its participation in the sport to new levels with the purchase of the Tyrrell team for approximately £30 million. The team raced as Tyrrell for the 1998 season before being renamed as British American Racing (BAR).[31]
Although Formula One is an exceptionally expensive sport,[clarification needed] for BAT the high cost of running an F1 team was justified as a promotional expense because there were few other opportunities for brand promotion. However, in 2005 a European Union (EU) directive was brought into force which required national governments to legislate to prevent tobacco sponsorship.[32]
In 2004 BAR announced that technology partner Honda had purchased a 45% stake and in September 2005 it announced that Honda would be buying the remaining 55% stake. The team raced as Honda Racing F1 Team in 2006, the last year of the Lucky Strike sponsorship before leaving the sport. For the 2006 season, the team was renamed as Honda F1 Racing Team, with BAT only advertised at a couple of races. All links between the two companies were severed for 2007.[33]
Controversies[edit]
Smoking bans[edit]
Industry documents from the 1970s to the late 1990s shows that tobacco companies were seriously concerned about fatwas against smoking by Muslim jurists in Muslim majority countries.[34] In 1996, an internal document from British American Tobacco warned that, because of the spread of “extremist views” from fundamentalists in countries such as Afghanistan, the industry would have to “prepare to fight a hurricane”.[34] BAT currently states that the study, does not represent the company's views, policies and positions
Nigerian lawsuit[edit]
The Nigerian federal government filed a lawsuit against BAT and two other tobacco companies in 2007. Nigeria is seeking $42.4 billion, $34.4 billion of which the government seeks in anticipation of the future cost of treating Nigerians for tobacco-related illnesses. They are also seeking $1.04 billion as a fine for the companies' advertising and marketing campaign allegedly targeting Nigerian youth, and has asked the companies to fund an awareness campaign to educate young people about the dangers of their product. Several Nigerian state governments have filed similar petitions.[35]
Marketing practices[edit]
In 2008 the company was the subject of a BBC Two documentary, in which Duncan Bannatyne investigated the marketing practices of the company in Africa and specifically the way the company targets younger Africans with branded music events, competitions and the sale of single cigarette sticks. Many of the practices uncovered by Bannatyne appeared to break BAT's own code of conduct and company standards. Towards the end of the programme, Bannatyne interviewed Dr Chris Proctor, Head of Science and Regulation, in which Proctor admitted that advertisements targeting children from three African countries were 'disappointing'.[36] In many of these undeveloped countries, the awareness of health risks from smoking is very low or nonexistent.[37]
In September 2001, BAT invested $7.1m in North Korean state-owned enterprise called the Korea Sogyong Trading Corporation, which employs 200 people in Pyongyang to produce up to two billion cigarettes a year. The operation is run by BAT's Singapore Division. Brands of cigarettes produced are Kumgansan, Craven A and Viceroy. BAT claims that the cigarettes are produced only for consumption in North Korea, although there are allegations that the cigarettes are smuggled for sale overseas.[38]
British American Tobacco was declared the winner of the 2008 Roger Award, the award for the worst transnational corporation operating in New Zealand.[39]
British American Tobacco spent more than €700,000 lobbying the EU in 2008, up to four times as much as the company declared on the EU's register of interest representatives, according to a report by Corporate Europe Observatory. The report argues that BAT's hidden lobbying activities, which are clearly not in the public interest, should be exposed to public scrutiny.[40]
Canadian class action lawsuit[edit]
The three largest Canadian tobacco companies, Imperial Tobacco Canada (a division of British American Tobacco), JTI-Macdonald Corp and Rothmans Benson & Hedges, are the subject of the largest class action lawsuit in Canadian history. The case started on 12 March 2012 in Quebec Superior Court, and the companies face a potential payout of C$27 billion (US $27.30 billion) in damages and penalties. In addition, a number of Canadian provinces are teaming up to sue tobacco companies to recover healthcare costs caused by smoking.[41]
On 1 June 2015, Quebec Superior Court Justice Brian Riordan has awarded more than $15 billion to Quebec smokers in a landmark case that pitted them against three Canadian cigarette giants, including JTI-Macdonald Corp.[42][43]
Australian lawsuit[edit]
During 2012 British American Tobacco, along with Philip Morris and Imperial Tobacco, sued the Australian Commonwealth government. At the High Court, they argued that the Commonwealth's plain packaging legislation was unconstitutional because it usurped the companies' intellectual property rights and good will on other than just terms. However, the challenge was unsuccessful.[44]
HMRC Fine for Oversupply[edit]
In November 2014, the HMRC fined BAT £650,000 after it was found to be oversupplying its tobacco products in the Belgium market with the likelihood these products would illegally find themselves back into the UK market, with UK excise taxes not paid. The event highlighted a tobacco-smuggling issue that many anti-tobacco activists have been attempting to bring to light for years. Following several investigations, the HMRC reportedly seized more than 1.4 billion cigarettes and 330 tons of hand rolling tobacco in 2013-2014. BAT denied all claims and described the allegation and fine as “unjustified”[45]
Bribery and threats in Africa[edit]
In late November 2015, an episode of BBC’s Panorama program alleged that BAT was bribing officials in Rwanda, Burundi and Kenya in exchange for their limiting the implementation of the WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in their respective countries. The episode showed documents provided by whistleblower Paul Hopkins, who worked for BAT in Kenya for 13 years. BAT denied the claims.[46]
In 2017 it was reported that BAT and other tobacco companies used a mixture of threats and bullying behaviour to stop or lessen the implementation of anti-smoking legislation in at least eight African countries.[47] One document showed that in Uganda BAT stated that the Tobacco Control Act flew in the face of the country's constitution. Another document showed that lawyers acting on behalf of BAT requested that the high court in Kenya "quash in its entirety" anti-smoking legislation.[47]
Pakistani lobbying efforts[edit]
In April 2015 medical experts and anti-tobacco campaigners accused Philip Barton, the British High Commissioner to Pakistan, of lobbying for BAT interests. Pictures were released showing Barton attending a meeting on March 13 in Islamabad, where BAT executives attempted to convince the Pakistani Finance and Health Minister to prevent plans to print large health warnings on cigarette packets.[48] This activity was deemed contrary to FCO policy. It followed an earlier incident when the British Ambassador to Panama was reprimanded for similar activity on BAT’s behalf.[49]

History[edit]
1902 to 2000[edit]




James Buchanan Duke


The company was formed in 1902, when the United Kingdom's Imperial Tobacco Company and the American Tobacco Company of the United States agreed to form a joint venture, the British-American Tobacco Company Ltd.[7] The parent companies agreed not to trade in each other's domestic territory and to assign trademarks, export businesses and overseas subsidiaries to the joint venture. James Buchanan Duke became its chairman and the British American Tobacco business began life in countries as diverse as Canada, China, Germany, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, but not in the United Kingdom or in the United States.[7]
In China, BAT inherited a factory in the Pudong district of Shanghai from W.D. & H.O. Wills, one of the precursor companies of Imperial Tobacco.[8] Under the management of James Augustus Thomas from Rockingham, North Carolina, USA, by 1919 the Shanghai factory was producing more than 243 million cigarettes per week.[9] Thomas worked closely with the local Wing Tai Vo Tobacco Company, which developed into BAT's principal Chinese partner after its success with the "Ruby Queen" cigarette brand.[10]
In 1911 the American Tobacco Company sold its share of the company. Imperial Tobacco gradually reduced its shareholding, but it was not until 1980 that it divested its remaining interests in the company.[7]
At its peak, in 1937 BAT manufactured and distributed 55 billion cigarettes in China. The company's assets were seized by the Japanese in 1941 following their 1937 invasion. In 1953 the company was ejected from China following the foundation of the People's Republic.[8]
In 1976 the group companies were reorganised under a new holding company, B.A.T Industries. In 1994 BAT acquired its former parent, American Tobacco Company (though reorganised after anti-trust proceedings). This brought the Lucky Strike and Pall Mall brands into BAT's portfolio.[11]
In 1999 it merged with Rothmans International,[12] which included a share in a factory in Burma. This made it the target of criticism from human rights groups. It sold its share of the factory on 6 November 2003 after an "exceptional request" from the British government.[13]
2000 to present[edit]




The Globe House: British American Tobacco's current headquarters


In 2002, BAT lost a lawsuit about the right to sell cigarettes under the Marlboro brand name in the UK. It had acquired Rothmans, which had previously bought a licence to use the name from Philip Morris. Philip Morris' attorneys invoked a get-out clause for the case of a major change of ownership.[14]
In 2003, BAT acquired Ente Tabacchi Italiani (ETI) S.p.A, Italy's state tobacco company. The important acquisition would elevate BAT to the number two position in Italy, the second largest tobacco market in the European Union. The scale of the enlarged operations would bring significant opportunities to compete and grow ETI's local brands and BAT's international brands.[15]
In August 2003, BAT acquired a 67.8% holding in the Serbian tobacco company Duvanska Industrija Vranje (DIV), allowing local manufacture of its brands, freeing them from import duties. In the longer term, export opportunities are planned as neighbouring countries in south east Europe developed free trade agreements.[16]
In July 2004 the U.S. business of British American Tobacco (Brown & Williamson) was combined with that of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (R. J. Reynolds), under the R. J. Reynolds name. R. J. Reynolds and Brown & Williamson were the second and third-ranking U.S. tobacco companies prior to the combination. When they combined, R. J. Reynolds became a subsidiary of Reynolds American, with BAT holding a 42% share. In January 2007, BAT closed its remaining UK production plant in Southampton with the loss of over 600 jobs. However, the global Research and Development operation and some financial functions will continue on the site.[17]
Then in 2008 BAT acquired Turkey's state-owned cigarette maker Tekel.
In July 2008, BAT acquired the cigarette and snus operations of the Scandinavian Tobacco Company.[18]
BAT acquired 60% of Indonesia's Bentoel Group in 2009[19] before increasing its stake to 100% the following year.[20]
In May 2011 BAT acquired the Colombian company Productora Tabacalera de Tabacos S.A. (Protabaco).[21]
In October 2016, BAT offered to buy the remaining 57.8 percent of U.S. cigarette maker Reynolds American in a $47 billion takeover that would create the world's biggest listed tobacco company with brands including Newport, Lucky Strike and Pall Mall.[22] In January 2017, Reynolds agreed to an increased $49.4 billion deal, expected to close in the third quarter of the year after approval from both companies' boards of directors.[23]
In April 2017 the company announced the acquisition of a number of Bulgarian cigarette brands from Bulgartabac for more than €100 million.[24]
Operations[edit]
Current[edit]




One of British American Tobacco's most popular products "Lucky Strike"


International Brands include Dunhill, Kent, North State Lucky Strike, Pall Mall, Vogue, Rothmans International, Winfield, State Express 555, KOOL, and Viceroy. However, British American Tobacco does not necessarily own the rights to all of these brands in every nation they are marketed.

On 11 June 2006, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company announced that it would be manufacturing Camel brand snus in Sweden in partnership with British American Tobacco; the product would be test-marketed in Portland, Oregon and Austin, Texas by the end of the month.[25]
The Bentoel Group products include Bentoel Biru, Bentoel Mild, Bentoel Sejati, Star Mild, X Mild, 1 Indonesia Masyarakat Dahulukan Pencapaian Dahulukan (taking the principle of 1Malaysia) (neO Mild, unO Mild, and One Mild), Club Mild, Dunhill Fine Cut Mild, Bintang Buana, Tali Jagat, Pr1nsip, Joged, Rawit, Ardath, Benson & Hedges, and Country.
The Gelora Djaja products include Wismilak Spesial, Wismilak Slim, Wismilak Diplomat, Galan Slim, Galan Mild, and MilDay.
Former[edit]
BAT has diversified into various fields at different times in its history. Its U.S. retail division, BATUS Retail Group, acquired Gimbels, Kohl's, and Saks Fifth Avenue in the 1970s and Marshall Field's and its divisions in 1982. The United Kingdom retail chain Argos was purchased in 1979. Kohl's grocery stores were sold to A&P in 1983. In 1986, BATUS sold the Kohl's department stores and two Marshall Field's divisions, The Crescent and Frederick & Nelson; BATUS closed Gimbels the same year, with many locations being absorbed by sister division Marshall Field's, as well as Allied Stores' Stern's and Pomeroy's divisions. In 1990 Marshall Field's was sold to Dayton Hudson Corporation (now Target Corporation), Ivey's (another Marshall Field's division) was sold to Dillard's, Saks Fifth Avenue was sold to Investcorp S.A., and Argos was demerged (Argos was acquired by previous parent company GUS plc in 1998).
The group was a major financial services company with the acquisitions of Eagle Star (1984),[26] Allied Dunbar (1985) and the Farmers Group, Inc. (1988). Around 1996 British American Tobacco merged their financial operations into a single operating unit, British American Financial Services (BAFS). This division was merged with Zurich Insurance Company in 1998 to form the Zurich Financial Services Group.[27] B.A.T still owns the minority interest in Zurich.
Senior management[edit]
Nicandro Durante became the chief executive in March 2011.[28]
Sponsorships[edit]
BAT have found many imaginative ways over the years to keep its brands in the public eye. ITC Limited, in which BAT holds a minority share, as recently as 1996 secured an arrangement to sponsor the Cricket World Cup which was branded the "Wills World Cup" and thereby achieved a high level of brand recognition for the Wills cigarette brand in India where young cricket fans were a key target market.[29]
BAT also sponsor the London Symphony Orchestra.[30]
Motorsport[edit]




Jacques Villeneuve driving for BAR at the 1999 Canadian Grand Prix.


In 1997 BAT brought its participation in the sport to new levels with the purchase of the Tyrrell team for approximately £30 million. The team raced as Tyrrell for the 1998 season before being renamed as British American Racing (BAR).[31]
Although Formula One is an exceptionally expensive sport,[clarification needed] for BAT the high cost of running an F1 team was justified as a promotional expense because there were few other opportunities for brand promotion. However, in 2005 a European Union (EU) directive was brought into force which required national governments to legislate to prevent tobacco sponsorship.[32]
In 2004 BAR announced that technology partner Honda had purchased a 45% stake and in September 2005 it announced that Honda would be buying the remaining 55% stake. The team raced as Honda Racing F1 Team in 2006, the last year of the Lucky Strike sponsorship before leaving the sport. For the 2006 season, the team was renamed as Honda F1 Racing Team, with BAT only advertised at a couple of races. All links between the two companies were severed for 2007.[33]
Controversies[edit]
Smoking bans[edit]
Industry documents from the 1970s to the late 1990s shows that tobacco companies were seriously concerned about fatwas against smoking by Muslim jurists in Muslim majority countries.[34] In 1996, an internal document from British American Tobacco warned that, because of the spread of “extremist views” from fundamentalists in countries such as Afghanistan, the industry would have to “prepare to fight a hurricane”.[34] BAT currently states that the study, does not represent the company's views, policies and positions
Nigerian lawsuit[edit]
The Nigerian federal government filed a lawsuit against BAT and two other tobacco companies in 2007. Nigeria is seeking $42.4 billion, $34.4 billion of which the government seeks in anticipation of the future cost of treating Nigerians for tobacco-related illnesses. They are also seeking $1.04 billion as a fine for the companies' advertising and marketing campaign allegedly targeting Nigerian youth, and has asked the companies to fund an awareness campaign to educate young people about the dangers of their product. Several Nigerian state governments have filed similar petitions.[35]
Marketing practices[edit]
In 2008 the company was the subject of a BBC Two documentary, in which Duncan Bannatyne investigated the marketing practices of the company in Africa and specifically the way the company targets younger Africans with branded music events, competitions and the sale of single cigarette sticks. Many of the practices uncovered by Bannatyne appeared to break BAT's own code of conduct and company standards. Towards the end of the programme, Bannatyne interviewed Dr Chris Proctor, Head of Science and Regulation, in which Proctor admitted that advertisements targeting children from three African countries were 'disappointing'.[36] In many of these undeveloped countries, the awareness of health risks from smoking is very low or nonexistent.[37]
In September 2001, BAT invested $7.1m in North Korean state-owned enterprise called the Korea Sogyong Trading Corporation, which employs 200 people in Pyongyang to produce up to two billion cigarettes a year. The operation is run by BAT's Singapore Division. Brands of cigarettes produced are Kumgansan, Craven A and Viceroy. BAT claims that the cigarettes are produced only for consumption in North Korea, although there are allegations that the cigarettes are smuggled for sale overseas.[38]
British American Tobacco was declared the winner of the 2008 Roger Award, the award for the worst transnational corporation operating in New Zealand.[39]
British American Tobacco spent more than €700,000 lobbying the EU in 2008, up to four times as much as the company declared on the EU's register of interest representatives, according to a report by Corporate Europe Observatory. The report argues that BAT's hidden lobbying activities, which are clearly not in the public interest, should be exposed to public scrutiny.[40]
Canadian class action lawsuit[edit]
The three largest Canadian tobacco companies, Imperial Tobacco Canada (a division of British American Tobacco), JTI-Macdonald Corp and Rothmans Benson & Hedges, are the subject of the largest class action lawsuit in Canadian history. The case started on 12 March 2012 in Quebec Superior Court, and the companies face a potential payout of C$27 billion (US $27.30 billion) in damages and penalties. In addition, a number of Canadian provinces are teaming up to sue tobacco companies to recover healthcare costs caused by smoking.[41]
On 1 June 2015, Quebec Superior Court Justice Brian Riordan has awarded more than $15 billion to Quebec smokers in a landmark case that pitted them against three Canadian cigarette giants, including JTI-Macdonald Corp.[42][43]
Australian lawsuit[edit]
During 2012 British American Tobacco, along with Philip Morris and Imperial Tobacco, sued the Australian Commonwealth government. At the High Court, they argued that the Commonwealth's plain packaging legislation was unconstitutional because it usurped the companies' intellectual property rights and good will on other than just terms. However, the challenge was unsuccessful.[44]
HMRC Fine for Oversupply[edit]
In November 2014, the HMRC fined BAT £650,000 after it was found to be oversupplying its tobacco products in the Belgium market with the likelihood these products would illegally find themselves back into the UK market, with UK excise taxes not paid. The event highlighted a tobacco-smuggling issue that many anti-tobacco activists have been attempting to bring to light for years. Following several investigations, the HMRC reportedly seized more than 1.4 billion cigarettes and 330 tons of hand rolling tobacco in 2013-2014. BAT denied all claims and described the allegation and fine as “unjustified”[45]
Bribery and threats in Africa[edit]
In late November 2015, an episode of BBC’s Panorama program alleged that BAT was bribing officials in Rwanda, Burundi and Kenya in exchange for their limiting the implementation of the WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in their respective countries. The episode showed documents provided by whistleblower Paul Hopkins, who worked for BAT in Kenya for 13 years. BAT denied the claims.[46]
In 2017 it was reported that BAT and other tobacco companies used a mixture of threats and bullying behaviour to stop or lessen the implementation of anti-smoking legislation in at least eight African countries.[47] One document showed that in Uganda BAT stated that the Tobacco Control Act flew in the face of the country's constitution. Another document showed that lawyers acting on behalf of BAT requested that the high court in Kenya "quash in its entirety" anti-smoking legislation.[47]
Pakistani lobbying efforts[edit]
In April 2015 medical experts and anti-tobacco campaigners accused Philip Barton, the British High Commissioner to Pakistan, of lobbying for BAT interests. Pictures were released showing Barton attending a meeting on March 13 in Islamabad, where BAT executives attempted to convince the Pakistani Finance and Health Minister to prevent plans to print large health warnings on cigarette packets.[48] This activity was deemed contrary to FCO policy. It followed an earlier incident when the British Ambassador to Panama was reprimanded for similar activity on BAT’s behalf.[49]

History[edit]
1902 to 2000[edit]




James Buchanan Duke


The company was formed in 1902, when the United Kingdom's Imperial Tobacco Company and the American Tobacco Company of the United States agreed to form a joint venture, the British-American Tobacco Company Ltd.[7] The parent companies agreed not to trade in each other's domestic territory and to assign trademarks, export businesses and overseas subsidiaries to the joint venture. James Buchanan Duke became its chairman and the British American Tobacco business began life in countries as diverse as Canada, China, Germany, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, but not in the United Kingdom or in the United States.[7]
In China, BAT inherited a factory in the Pudong district of Shanghai from W.D. & H.O. Wills, one of the precursor companies of Imperial Tobacco.[8] Under the management of James Augustus Thomas from Rockingham, North Carolina, USA, by 1919 the Shanghai factory was producing more than 243 million cigarettes per week.[9] Thomas worked closely with the local Wing Tai Vo Tobacco Company, which developed into BAT's principal Chinese partner after its success with the "Ruby Queen" cigarette brand.[10]
In 1911 the American Tobacco Company sold its share of the company. Imperial Tobacco gradually reduced its shareholding, but it was not until 1980 that it divested its remaining interests in the company.[7]
At its peak, in 1937 BAT manufactured and distributed 55 billion cigarettes in China. The company's assets were seized by the Japanese in 1941 following their 1937 invasion. In 1953 the company was ejected from China following the foundation of the People's Republic.[8]
In 1976 the group companies were reorganised under a new holding company, B.A.T Industries. In 1994 BAT acquired its former parent, American Tobacco Company (though reorganised after anti-trust proceedings). This brought the Lucky Strike and Pall Mall brands into BAT's portfolio.[11]
In 1999 it merged with Rothmans International,[12] which included a share in a factory in Burma. This made it the target of criticism from human rights groups. It sold its share of the factory on 6 November 2003 after an "exceptional request" from the British government.[13]
2000 to present[edit]




The Globe House: British American Tobacco's current headquarters


In 2002, BAT lost a lawsuit about the right to sell cigarettes under the Marlboro brand name in the UK. It had acquired Rothmans, which had previously bought a licence to use the name from Philip Morris. Philip Morris' attorneys invoked a get-out clause for the case of a major change of ownership.[14]
In 2003, BAT acquired Ente Tabacchi Italiani (ETI) S.p.A, Italy's state tobacco company. The important acquisition would elevate BAT to the number two position in Italy, the second largest tobacco market in the European Union. The scale of the enlarged operations would bring significant opportunities to compete and grow ETI's local brands and BAT's international brands.[15]
In August 2003, BAT acquired a 67.8% holding in the Serbian tobacco company Duvanska Industrija Vranje (DIV), allowing local manufacture of its brands, freeing them from import duties. In the longer term, export opportunities are planned as neighbouring countries in south east Europe developed free trade agreements.[16]
In July 2004 the U.S. business of British American Tobacco (Brown & Williamson) was combined with that of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (R. J. Reynolds), under the R. J. Reynolds name. R. J. Reynolds and Brown & Williamson were the second and third-ranking U.S. tobacco companies prior to the combination. When they combined, R. J. Reynolds became a subsidiary of Reynolds American, with BAT holding a 42% share. In January 2007, BAT closed its remaining UK production plant in Southampton with the loss of over 600 jobs. However, the global Research and Development operation and some financial functions will continue on the site.[17]
Then in 2008 BAT acquired Turkey's state-owned cigarette maker Tekel.
In July 2008, BAT acquired the cigarette and snus operations of the Scandinavian Tobacco Company.[18]
BAT acquired 60% of Indonesia's Bentoel Group in 2009[19] before increasing its stake to 100% the following year.[20]
In May 2011 BAT acquired the Colombian company Productora Tabacalera de Tabacos S.A. (Protabaco).[21]
In October 2016, BAT offered to buy the remaining 57.8 percent of U.S. cigarette maker Reynolds American in a $47 billion takeover that would create the world's biggest listed tobacco company with brands including Newport, Lucky Strike and Pall Mall.[22] In January 2017, Reynolds agreed to an increased $49.4 billion deal, expected to close in the third quarter of the year after approval from both companies' boards of directors.[23]
In April 2017 the company announced the acquisition of a number of Bulgarian cigarette brands from Bulgartabac for more than €100 million.[24]
Operations[edit]
Current[edit]




One of British American Tobacco's most popular products "Lucky Strike"


International Brands include Dunhill, Kent, North State Lucky Strike, Pall Mall, Vogue, Rothmans International, Winfield, State Express 555, KOOL, and Viceroy. However, British American Tobacco does not necessarily own the rights to all of these brands in every nation they are marketed.

On 11 June 2006, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company announced that it would be manufacturing Camel brand snus in Sweden in partnership with British American Tobacco; the product would be test-marketed in Portland, Oregon and Austin, Texas by the end of the month.[25]
The Bentoel Group products include Bentoel Biru, Bentoel Mild, Bentoel Sejati, Star Mild, X Mild, 1 Indonesia Masyarakat Dahulukan Pencapaian Dahulukan (taking the principle of 1Malaysia) (neO Mild, unO Mild, and One Mild), Club Mild, Dunhill Fine Cut Mild, Bintang Buana, Tali Jagat, Pr1nsip, Joged, Rawit, Ardath, Benson & Hedges, and Country.
The Gelora Djaja products include Wismilak Spesial, Wismilak Slim, Wismilak Diplomat, Galan Slim, Galan Mild, and MilDay.
Former[edit]
BAT has diversified into various fields at different times in its history. Its U.S. retail division, BATUS Retail Group, acquired Gimbels, Kohl's, and Saks Fifth Avenue in the 1970s and Marshall Field's and its divisions in 1982. The United Kingdom retail chain Argos was purchased in 1979. Kohl's grocery stores were sold to A&P in 1983. In 1986, BATUS sold the Kohl's department stores and two Marshall Field's divisions, The Crescent and Frederick & Nelson; BATUS closed Gimbels the same year, with many locations being absorbed by sister division Marshall Field's, as well as Allied Stores' Stern's and Pomeroy's divisions. In 1990 Marshall Field's was sold to Dayton Hudson Corporation (now Target Corporation), Ivey's (another Marshall Field's division) was sold to Dillard's, Saks Fifth Avenue was sold to Investcorp S.A., and Argos was demerged (Argos was acquired by previous parent company GUS plc in 1998).
The group was a major financial services company with the acquisitions of Eagle Star (1984),[26] Allied Dunbar (1985) and the Farmers Group, Inc. (1988). Around 1996 British American Tobacco merged their financial operations into a single operating unit, British American Financial Services (BAFS). This division was merged with Zurich Insurance Company in 1998 to form the Zurich Financial Services Group.[27] B.A.T still owns the minority interest in Zurich.
Senior management[edit]
Nicandro Durante became the chief executive in March 2011.[28]
Sponsorships[edit]
BAT have found many imaginative ways over the years to keep its brands in the public eye. ITC Limited, in which BAT holds a minority share, as recently as 1996 secured an arrangement to sponsor the Cricket World Cup which was branded the "Wills World Cup" and thereby achieved a high level of brand recognition for the Wills cigarette brand in India where young cricket fans were a key target market.[29]
BAT also sponsor the London Symphony Orchestra.[30]
Motorsport[edit]




Jacques Villeneuve driving for BAR at the 1999 Canadian Grand Prix.


In 1997 BAT brought its participation in the sport to new levels with the purchase of the Tyrrell team for approximately £30 million. The team raced as Tyrrell for the 1998 season before being renamed as British American Racing (BAR).[31]
Although Formula One is an exceptionally expensive sport,[clarification needed] for BAT the high cost of running an F1 team was justified as a promotional expense because there were few other opportunities for brand promotion. However, in 2005 a European Union (EU) directive was brought into force which required national governments to legislate to prevent tobacco sponsorship.[32]
In 2004 BAR announced that technology partner Honda had purchased a 45% stake and in September 2005 it announced that Honda would be buying the remaining 55% stake. The team raced as Honda Racing F1 Team in 2006, the last year of the Lucky Strike sponsorship before leaving the sport. For the 2006 season, the team was renamed as Honda F1 Racing Team, with BAT only advertised at a couple of races. All links between the two companies were severed for 2007.[33]
Controversies[edit]
Smoking bans[edit]
Industry documents from the 1970s to the late 1990s shows that tobacco companies were seriously concerned about fatwas against smoking by Muslim jurists in Muslim majority countries.[34] In 1996, an internal document from British American Tobacco warned that, because of the spread of “extremist views” from fundamentalists in countries such as Afghanistan, the industry would have to “prepare to fight a hurricane”.[34] BAT currently states that the study, does not represent the company's views, policies and positions
Nigerian lawsuit[edit]
The Nigerian federal government filed a lawsuit against BAT and two other tobacco companies in 2007. Nigeria is seeking $42.4 billion, $34.4 billion of which the government seeks in anticipation of the future cost of treating Nigerians for tobacco-related illnesses. They are also seeking $1.04 billion as a fine for the companies' advertising and marketing campaign allegedly targeting Nigerian youth, and has asked the companies to fund an awareness campaign to educate young people about the dangers of their product. Several Nigerian state governments have filed similar petitions.[35]
Marketing practices[edit]
In 2008 the company was the subject of a BBC Two documentary, in which Duncan Bannatyne investigated the marketing practices of the company in Africa and specifically the way the company targets younger Africans with branded music events, competitions and the sale of single cigarette sticks. Many of the practices uncovered by Bannatyne appeared to break BAT's own code of conduct and company standards. Towards the end of the programme, Bannatyne interviewed Dr Chris Proctor, Head of Science and Regulation, in which Proctor admitted that advertisements targeting children from three African countries were 'disappointing'.[36] In many of these undeveloped countries, the awareness of health risks from smoking is very low or nonexistent.[37]
In September 2001, BAT invested $7.1m in North Korean state-owned enterprise called the Korea Sogyong Trading Corporation, which employs 200 people in Pyongyang to produce up to two billion cigarettes a year. The operation is run by BAT's Singapore Division. Brands of cigarettes produced are Kumgansan, Craven A and Viceroy. BAT claims that the cigarettes are produced only for consumption in North Korea, although there are allegations that the cigarettes are smuggled for sale overseas.[38]
British American Tobacco was declared the winner of the 2008 Roger Award, the award for the worst transnational corporation operating in New Zealand.[39]
British American Tobacco spent more than €700,000 lobbying the EU in 2008, up to four times as much as the company declared on the EU's register of interest representatives, according to a report by Corporate Europe Observatory. The report argues that BAT's hidden lobbying activities, which are clearly not in the public interest, should be exposed to public scrutiny.[40]
Canadian class action lawsuit[edit]
The three largest Canadian tobacco companies, Imperial Tobacco Canada (a division of British American Tobacco), JTI-Macdonald Corp and Rothmans Benson & Hedges, are the subject of the largest class action lawsuit in Canadian history. The case started on 12 March 2012 in Quebec Superior Court, and the companies face a potential payout of C$27 billion (US $27.30 billion) in damages and penalties. In addition, a number of Canadian provinces are teaming up to sue tobacco companies to recover healthcare costs caused by smoking.[41]
On 1 June 2015, Quebec Superior Court Justice Brian Riordan has awarded more than $15 billion to Quebec smokers in a landmark case that pitted them against three Canadian cigarette giants, including JTI-Macdonald Corp.[42][43]
Australian lawsuit[edit]
During 2012 British American Tobacco, along with Philip Morris and Imperial Tobacco, sued the Australian Commonwealth government. At the High Court, they argued that the Commonwealth's plain packaging legislation was unconstitutional because it usurped the companies' intellectual property rights and good will on other than just terms. However, the challenge was unsuccessful.[44]
HMRC Fine for Oversupply[edit]
In November 2014, the HMRC fined BAT £650,000 after it was found to be oversupplying its tobacco products in the Belgium market with the likelihood these products would illegally find themselves back into the UK market, with UK excise taxes not paid. The event highlighted a tobacco-smuggling issue that many anti-tobacco activists have been attempting to bring to light for years. Following several investigations, the HMRC reportedly seized more than 1.4 billion cigarettes and 330 tons of hand rolling tobacco in 2013-2014. BAT denied all claims and described the allegation and fine as “unjustified”[45]
Bribery and threats in Africa[edit]
In late November 2015, an episode of BBC’s Panorama program alleged that BAT was bribing officials in Rwanda, Burundi and Kenya in exchange for their limiting the implementation of the WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in their respective countries. The episode showed documents provided by whistleblower Paul Hopkins, who worked for BAT in Kenya for 13 years. BAT denied the claims.[46]
In 2017 it was reported that BAT and other tobacco companies used a mixture of threats and bullying behaviour to stop or lessen the implementation of anti-smoking legislation in at least eight African countries.[47] One document showed that in Uganda BAT stated that the Tobacco Control Act flew in the face of the country's constitution. Another document showed that lawyers acting on behalf of BAT requested that the high court in Kenya "quash in its entirety" anti-smoking legislation.[47]
Pakistani lobbying efforts[edit]
In April 2015 medical experts and anti-tobacco campaigners accused Philip Barton, the British High Commissioner to Pakistan, of lobbying for BAT interests. Pictures were released showing Barton attending a meeting on March 13 in Islamabad, where BAT executives attempted to convince the Pakistani Finance and Health Minister to prevent plans to print large health warnings on cigarette packets.[48] This activity was deemed contrary to FCO policy. It followed an earlier incident when the British Ambassador to Panama was reprimanded for similar activity on BAT’s behalf.[49]

History[edit]
1902 to 2000[edit]




James Buchanan Duke


The company was formed in 1902, when the United Kingdom's Imperial Tobacco Company and the American Tobacco Company of the United States agreed to form a joint venture, the British-American Tobacco Company Ltd.[7] The parent companies agreed not to trade in each other's domestic territory and to assign trademarks, export businesses and overseas subsidiaries to the joint venture. James Buchanan Duke became its chairman and the British American Tobacco business began life in countries as diverse as Canada, China, Germany, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, but not in the United Kingdom or in the United States.[7]
In China, BAT inherited a factory in the Pudong district of Shanghai from W.D. & H.O. Wills, one of the precursor companies of Imperial Tobacco.[8] Under the management of James Augustus Thomas from Rockingham, North Carolina, USA, by 1919 the Shanghai factory was producing more than 243 million cigarettes per week.[9] Thomas worked closely with the local Wing Tai Vo Tobacco Company, which developed into BAT's principal Chinese partner after its success with the "Ruby Queen" cigarette brand.[10]
In 1911 the American Tobacco Company sold its share of the company. Imperial Tobacco gradually reduced its shareholding, but it was not until 1980 that it divested its remaining interests in the company.[7]
At its peak, in 1937 BAT manufactured and distributed 55 billion cigarettes in China. The company's assets were seized by the Japanese in 1941 following their 1937 invasion. In 1953 the company was ejected from China following the foundation of the People's Republic.[8]
In 1976 the group companies were reorganised under a new holding company, B.A.T Industries. In 1994 BAT acquired its former parent, American Tobacco Company (though reorganised after anti-trust proceedings). This brought the Lucky Strike and Pall Mall brands into BAT's portfolio.[11]
In 1999 it merged with Rothmans International,[12] which included a share in a factory in Burma. This made it the target of criticism from human rights groups. It sold its share of the factory on 6 November 2003 after an "exceptional request" from the British government.[13]
2000 to present[edit]




The Globe House: British American Tobacco's current headquarters


In 2002, BAT lost a lawsuit about the right to sell cigarettes under the Marlboro brand name in the UK. It had acquired Rothmans, which had previously bought a licence to use the name from Philip Morris. Philip Morris' attorneys invoked a get-out clause for the case of a major change of ownership.[14]
In 2003, BAT acquired Ente Tabacchi Italiani (ETI) S.p.A, Italy's state tobacco company. The important acquisition would elevate BAT to the number two position in Italy, the second largest tobacco market in the European Union. The scale of the enlarged operations would bring significant opportunities to compete and grow ETI's local brands and BAT's international brands.[15]
In August 2003, BAT acquired a 67.8% holding in the Serbian tobacco company Duvanska Industrija Vranje (DIV), allowing local manufacture of its brands, freeing them from import duties. In the longer term, export opportunities are planned as neighbouring countries in south east Europe developed free trade agreements.[16]
In July 2004 the U.S. business of British American Tobacco (Brown & Williamson) was combined with that of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (R. J. Reynolds), under the R. J. Reynolds name. R. J. Reynolds and Brown & Williamson were the second and third-ranking U.S. tobacco companies prior to the combination. When they combined, R. J. Reynolds became a subsidiary of Reynolds American, with BAT holding a 42% share. In January 2007, BAT closed its remaining UK production plant in Southampton with the loss of over 600 jobs. However, the global Research and Development operation and some financial functions will continue on the site.[17]
Then in 2008 BAT acquired Turkey's state-owned cigarette maker Tekel.
In July 2008, BAT acquired the cigarette and snus operations of the Scandinavian Tobacco Company.[18]
BAT acquired 60% of Indonesia's Bentoel Group in 2009[19] before increasing its stake to 100% the following year.[20]
In May 2011 BAT acquired the Colombian company Productora Tabacalera de Tabacos S.A. (Protabaco).[21]
In October 2016, BAT offered to buy the remaining 57.8 percent of U.S. cigarette maker Reynolds American in a $47 billion takeover that would create the world's biggest listed tobacco company with brands including Newport, Lucky Strike and Pall Mall.[22] In January 2017, Reynolds agreed to an increased $49.4 billion deal, expected to close in the third quarter of the year after approval from both companies' boards of directors.[23]
In April 2017 the company announced the acquisition of a number of Bulgarian cigarette brands from Bulgartabac for more than €100 million.[24]
Operations[edit]
Current[edit]




One of British American Tobacco's most popular products "Lucky Strike"


International Brands include Dunhill, Kent, North State Lucky Strike, Pall Mall, Vogue, Rothmans International, Winfield, State Express 555, KOOL, and Viceroy. However, British American Tobacco does not necessarily own the rights to all of these brands in every nation they are marketed.

On 11 June 2006, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company announced that it would be manufacturing Camel brand snus in Sweden in partnership with British American Tobacco; the product would be test-marketed in Portland, Oregon and Austin, Texas by the end of the month.[25]
The Bentoel Group products include Bentoel Biru, Bentoel Mild, Bentoel Sejati, Star Mild, X Mild, 1 Indonesia Masyarakat Dahulukan Pencapaian Dahulukan (taking the principle of 1Malaysia) (neO Mild, unO Mild, and One Mild), Club Mild, Dunhill Fine Cut Mild, Bintang Buana, Tali Jagat, Pr1nsip, Joged, Rawit, Ardath, Benson & Hedges, and Country.
The Gelora Djaja products include Wismilak Spesial, Wismilak Slim, Wismilak Diplomat, Galan Slim, Galan Mild, and MilDay.
Former[edit]
BAT has diversified into various fields at different times in its history. Its U.S. retail division, BATUS Retail Group, acquired Gimbels, Kohl's, and Saks Fifth Avenue in the 1970s and Marshall Field's and its divisions in 1982. The United Kingdom retail chain Argos was purchased in 1979. Kohl's grocery stores were sold to A&P in 1983. In 1986, BATUS sold the Kohl's department stores and two Marshall Field's divisions, The Crescent and Frederick & Nelson; BATUS closed Gimbels the same year, with many locations being absorbed by sister division Marshall Field's, as well as Allied Stores' Stern's and Pomeroy's divisions. In 1990 Marshall Field's was sold to Dayton Hudson Corporation (now Target Corporation), Ivey's (another Marshall Field's division) was sold to Dillard's, Saks Fifth Avenue was sold to Investcorp S.A., and Argos was demerged (Argos was acquired by previous parent company GUS plc in 1998).
The group was a major financial services company with the acquisitions of Eagle Star (1984),[26] Allied Dunbar (1985) and the Farmers Group, Inc. (1988). Around 1996 British American Tobacco merged their financial operations into a single operating unit, British American Financial Services (BAFS). This division was merged with Zurich Insurance Company in 1998 to form the Zurich Financial Services Group.[27] B.A.T still owns the minority interest in Zurich.
Senior management[edit]
Nicandro Durante became the chief executive in March 2011.[28]
Sponsorships[edit]
BAT have found many imaginative ways over the years to keep its brands in the public eye. ITC Limited, in which BAT holds a minority share, as recently as 1996 secured an arrangement to sponsor the Cricket World Cup which was branded the "Wills World Cup" and thereby achieved a high level of brand recognition for the Wills cigarette brand in India where young cricket fans were a key target market.[29]
BAT also sponsor the London Symphony Orchestra.[30]
Motorsport[edit]




Jacques Villeneuve driving for BAR at the 1999 Canadian Grand Prix.


In 1997 BAT brought its participation in the sport to new levels with the purchase of the Tyrrell team for approximately £30 million. The team raced as Tyrrell for the 1998 season before being renamed as British American Racing (BAR).[31]
Although Formula One is an exceptionally expensive sport,[clarification needed] for BAT the high cost of running an F1 team was justified as a promotional expense because there were few other opportunities for brand promotion. However, in 2005 a European Union (EU) directive was brought into force which required national governments to legislate to prevent tobacco sponsorship.[32]
In 2004 BAR announced that technology partner Honda had purchased a 45% stake and in September 2005 it announced that Honda would be buying the remaining 55% stake. The team raced as Honda Racing F1 Team in 2006, the last year of the Lucky Strike sponsorship before leaving the sport. For the 2006 season, the team was renamed as Honda F1 Racing Team, with BAT only advertised at a couple of races. All links between the two companies were severed for 2007.[33]
Controversies[edit]
Smoking bans[edit]
Industry documents from the 1970s to the late 1990s shows that tobacco companies were seriously concerned about fatwas against smoking by Muslim jurists in Muslim majority countries.[34] In 1996, an internal document from British American Tobacco warned that, because of the spread of “extremist views” from fundamentalists in countries such as Afghanistan, the industry would have to “prepare to fight a hurricane”.[34] BAT currently states that the study, does not represent the company's views, policies and positions
Nigerian lawsuit[edit]
The Nigerian federal government filed a lawsuit against BAT and two other tobacco companies in 2007. Nigeria is seeking $42.4 billion, $34.4 billion of which the government seeks in anticipation of the future cost of treating Nigerians for tobacco-related illnesses. They are also seeking $1.04 billion as a fine for the companies' advertising and marketing campaign allegedly targeting Nigerian youth, and has asked the companies to fund an awareness campaign to educate young people about the dangers of their product. Several Nigerian state governments have filed similar petitions.[35]
Marketing practices[edit]
In 2008 the company was the subject of a BBC Two documentary, in which Duncan Bannatyne investigated the marketing practices of the company in Africa and specifically the way the company targets younger Africans with branded music events, competitions and the sale of single cigarette sticks. Many of the practices uncovered by Bannatyne appeared to break BAT's own code of conduct and company standards. Towards the end of the programme, Bannatyne interviewed Dr Chris Proctor, Head of Science and Regulation, in which Proctor admitted that advertisements targeting children from three African countries were 'disappointing'.[36] In many of these undeveloped countries, the awareness of health risks from smoking is very low or nonexistent.[37]
In September 2001, BAT invested $7.1m in North Korean state-owned enterprise called the Korea Sogyong Trading Corporation, which employs 200 people in Pyongyang to produce up to two billion cigarettes a year. The operation is run by BAT's Singapore Division. Brands of cigarettes produced are Kumgansan, Craven A and Viceroy. BAT claims that the cigarettes are produced only for consumption in North Korea, although there are allegations that the cigarettes are smuggled for sale overseas.[38]
British American Tobacco was declared the winner of the 2008 Roger Award, the award for the worst transnational corporation operating in New Zealand.[39]
British American Tobacco spent more than €700,000 lobbying the EU in 2008, up to four times as much as the company declared on the EU's register of interest representatives, according to a report by Corporate Europe Observatory. The report argues that BAT's hidden lobbying activities, which are clearly not in the public interest, should be exposed to public scrutiny.[40]
Canadian class action lawsuit[edit]
The three largest Canadian tobacco companies, Imperial Tobacco Canada (a division of British American Tobacco), JTI-Macdonald Corp and Rothmans Benson & Hedges, are the subject of the largest class action lawsuit in Canadian history. The case started on 12 March 2012 in Quebec Superior Court, and the companies face a potential payout of C$27 billion (US $27.30 billion) in damages and penalties. In addition, a number of Canadian provinces are teaming up to sue tobacco companies to recover healthcare costs caused by smoking.[41]
On 1 June 2015, Quebec Superior Court Justice Brian Riordan has awarded more than $15 billion to Quebec smokers in a landmark case that pitted them against three Canadian cigarette giants, including JTI-Macdonald Corp.[42][43]
Australian lawsuit[edit]
During 2012 British American Tobacco, along with Philip Morris and Imperial Tobacco, sued the Australian Commonwealth government. At the High Court, they argued that the Commonwealth's plain packaging legislation was unconstitutional because it usurped the companies' intellectual property rights and good will on other than just terms. However, the challenge was unsuccessful.[44]
HMRC Fine for Oversupply[edit]
In November 2014, the HMRC fined BAT £650,000 after it was found to be oversupplying its tobacco products in the Belgium market with the likelihood these products would illegally find themselves back into the UK market, with UK excise taxes not paid. The event highlighted a tobacco-smuggling issue that many anti-tobacco activists have been attempting to bring to light for years. Following several investigations, the HMRC reportedly seized more than 1.4 billion cigarettes and 330 tons of hand rolling tobacco in 2013-2014. BAT denied all claims and described the allegation and fine as “unjustified”[45]
Bribery and threats in Africa[edit]
In late November 2015, an episode of BBC’s Panorama program alleged that BAT was bribing officials in Rwanda, Burundi and Kenya in exchange for their limiting the implementation of the WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in their respective countries. The episode showed documents provided by whistleblower Paul Hopkins, who worked for BAT in Kenya for 13 years. BAT denied the claims.[46]
In 2017 it was reported that BAT and other tobacco companies used a mixture of threats and bullying behaviour to stop or lessen the implementation of anti-smoking legislation in at least eight African countries.[47] One document showed that in Uganda BAT stated that the Tobacco Control Act flew in the face of the country's constitution. Another document showed that lawyers acting on behalf of BAT requested that the high court in Kenya "quash in its entirety" anti-smoking legislation.[47]
Pakistani lobbying efforts[edit]
In April 2015 medical experts and anti-tobacco campaigners accused Philip Barton, the British High Commissioner to Pakistan, of lobbying for BAT interests. Pictures were released showing Barton attending a meeting on March 13 in Islamabad, where BAT executives attempted to convince the Pakistani Finance and Health Minister to prevent plans to print large health warnings on cigarette packets.[48] This activity was deemed contrary to FCO policy. It followed an earlier incident when the British Ambassador to Panama was reprimanded for similar activity on BAT’s behalf.[49]

History[edit]
1902 to 2000[edit]




James Buchanan Duke


The company was formed in 1902, when the United Kingdom's Imperial Tobacco Company and the American Tobacco Company of the United States agreed to form a joint venture, the British-American Tobacco Company Ltd.[7] The parent companies agreed not to trade in each other's domestic territory and to assign trademarks, export businesses and overseas subsidiaries to the joint venture. James Buchanan Duke became its chairman and the British American Tobacco business began life in countries as diverse as Canada, China, Germany, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, but not in the United Kingdom or in the United States.[7]
In China, BAT inherited a factory in the Pudong district of Shanghai from W.D. & H.O. Wills, one of the precursor companies of Imperial Tobacco.[8] Under the management of James Augustus Thomas from Rockingham, North Carolina, USA, by 1919 the Shanghai factory was producing more than 243 million cigarettes per week.[9] Thomas worked closely with the local Wing Tai Vo Tobacco Company, which developed into BAT's principal Chinese partner after its success with the "Ruby Queen" cigarette brand.[10]
In 1911 the American Tobacco Company sold its share of the company. Imperial Tobacco gradually reduced its shareholding, but it was not until 1980 that it divested its remaining interests in the company.[7]
At its peak, in 1937 BAT manufactured and distributed 55 billion cigarettes in China. The company's assets were seized by the Japanese in 1941 following their 1937 invasion. In 1953 the company was ejected from China following the foundation of the People's Republic.[8]
In 1976 the group companies were reorganised under a new holding company, B.A.T Industries. In 1994 BAT acquired its former parent, American Tobacco Company (though reorganised after anti-trust proceedings). This brought the Lucky Strike and Pall Mall brands into BAT's portfolio.[11]
In 1999 it merged with Rothmans International,[12] which included a share in a factory in Burma. This made it the target of criticism from human rights groups. It sold its share of the factory on 6 November 2003 after an "exceptional request" from the British government.[13]
2000 to present[edit]




The Globe House: British American Tobacco's current headquarters


In 2002, BAT lost a lawsuit about the right to sell cigarettes under the Marlboro brand name in the UK. It had acquired Rothmans, which had previously bought a licence to use the name from Philip Morris. Philip Morris' attorneys invoked a get-out clause for the case of a major change of ownership.[14]
In 2003, BAT acquired Ente Tabacchi Italiani (ETI) S.p.A, Italy's state tobacco company. The important acquisition would elevate BAT to the number two position in Italy, the second largest tobacco market in the European Union. The scale of the enlarged operations would bring significant opportunities to compete and grow ETI's local brands and BAT's international brands.[15]
In August 2003, BAT acquired a 67.8% holding in the Serbian tobacco company Duvanska Industrija Vranje (DIV), allowing local manufacture of its brands, freeing them from import duties. In the longer term, export opportunities are planned as neighbouring countries in south east Europe developed free trade agreements.[16]
In July 2004 the U.S. business of British American Tobacco (Brown & Williamson) was combined with that of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (R. J. Reynolds), under the R. J. Reynolds name. R. J. Reynolds and Brown & Williamson were the second and third-ranking U.S. tobacco companies prior to the combination. When they combined, R. J. Reynolds became a subsidiary of Reynolds American, with BAT holding a 42% share. In January 2007, BAT closed its remaining UK production plant in Southampton with the loss of over 600 jobs. However, the global Research and Development operation and some financial functions will continue on the site.[17]
Then in 2008 BAT acquired Turkey's state-owned cigarette maker Tekel.
In July 2008, BAT acquired the cigarette and snus operations of the Scandinavian Tobacco Company.[18]
BAT acquired 60% of Indonesia's Bentoel Group in 2009[19] before increasing its stake to 100% the following year.[20]
In May 2011 BAT acquired the Colombian company Productora Tabacalera de Tabacos S.A. (Protabaco).[21]
In October 2016, BAT offered to buy the remaining 57.8 percent of U.S. cigarette maker Reynolds American in a $47 billion takeover that would create the world's biggest listed tobacco company with brands including Newport, Lucky Strike and Pall Mall.[22] In January 2017, Reynolds agreed to an increased $49.4 billion deal, expected to close in the third quarter of the year after approval from both companies' boards of directors.[23]
In April 2017 the company announced the acquisition of a number of Bulgarian cigarette brands from Bulgartabac for more than €100 million.[24]
Operations[edit]
Current[edit]




One of British American Tobacco's most popular products "Lucky Strike"


International Brands include Dunhill, Kent, North State Lucky Strike, Pall Mall, Vogue, Rothmans International, Winfield, State Express 555, KOOL, and Viceroy. However, British American Tobacco does not necessarily own the rights to all of these brands in every nation they are marketed.

On 11 June 2006, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company announced that it would be manufacturing Camel brand snus in Sweden in partnership with British American Tobacco; the product would be test-marketed in Portland, Oregon and Austin, Texas by the end of the month.[25]
The Bentoel Group products include Bentoel Biru, Bentoel Mild, Bentoel Sejati, Star Mild, X Mild, 1 Indonesia Masyarakat Dahulukan Pencapaian Dahulukan (taking the principle of 1Malaysia) (neO Mild, unO Mild, and One Mild), Club Mild, Dunhill Fine Cut Mild, Bintang Buana, Tali Jagat, Pr1nsip, Joged, Rawit, Ardath, Benson & Hedges, and Country.
The Gelora Djaja products include Wismilak Spesial, Wismilak Slim, Wismilak Diplomat, Galan Slim, Galan Mild, and MilDay.
Former[edit]
BAT has diversified into various fields at different times in its history. Its U.S. retail division, BATUS Retail Group, acquired Gimbels, Kohl's, and Saks Fifth Avenue in the 1970s and Marshall Field's and its divisions in 1982. The United Kingdom retail chain Argos was purchased in 1979. Kohl's grocery stores were sold to A&P in 1983. In 1986, BATUS sold the Kohl's department stores and two Marshall Field's divisions, The Crescent and Frederick & Nelson; BATUS closed Gimbels the same year, with many locations being absorbed by sister division Marshall Field's, as well as Allied Stores' Stern's and Pomeroy's divisions. In 1990 Marshall Field's was sold to Dayton Hudson Corporation (now Target Corporation), Ivey's (another Marshall Field's division) was sold to Dillard's, Saks Fifth Avenue was sold to Investcorp S.A., and Argos was demerged (Argos was acquired by previous parent company GUS plc in 1998).
The group was a major financial services company with the acquisitions of Eagle Star (1984),[26] Allied Dunbar (1985) and the Farmers Group, Inc. (1988). Around 1996 British American Tobacco merged their financial operations into a single operating unit, British American Financial Services (BAFS). This division was merged with Zurich Insurance Company in 1998 to form the Zurich Financial Services Group.[27] B.A.T still owns the minority interest in Zurich.
Senior management[edit]
Nicandro Durante became the chief executive in March 2011.[28]
Sponsorships[edit]
BAT have found many imaginative ways over the years to keep its brands in the public eye. ITC Limited, in which BAT holds a minority share, as recently as 1996 secured an arrangement to sponsor the Cricket World Cup which was branded the "Wills World Cup" and thereby achieved a high level of brand recognition for the Wills cigarette brand in India where young cricket fans were a key target market.[29]
BAT also sponsor the London Symphony Orchestra.[30]
Motorsport[edit]




Jacques Villeneuve driving for BAR at the 1999 Canadian Grand Prix.


In 1997 BAT brought its participation in the sport to new levels with the purchase of the Tyrrell team for approximately £30 million. The team raced as Tyrrell for the 1998 season before being renamed as British American Racing (BAR).[31]
Although Formula One is an exceptionally expensive sport,[clarification needed] for BAT the high cost of running an F1 team was justified as a promotional expense because there were few other opportunities for brand promotion. However, in 2005 a European Union (EU) directive was brought into force which required national governments to legislate to prevent tobacco sponsorship.[32]
In 2004 BAR announced that technology partner Honda had purchased a 45% stake and in September 2005 it announced that Honda would be buying the remaining 55% stake. The team raced as Honda Racing F1 Team in 2006, the last year of the Lucky Strike sponsorship before leaving the sport. For the 2006 season, the team was renamed as Honda F1 Racing Team, with BAT only advertised at a couple of races. All links between the two companies were severed for 2007.[33]
Controversies[edit]
Smoking bans[edit]
Industry documents from the 1970s to the late 1990s shows that tobacco companies were seriously concerned about fatwas against smoking by Muslim jurists in Muslim majority countries.[34] In 1996, an internal document from British American Tobacco warned that, because of the spread of “extremist views” from fundamentalists in countries such as Afghanistan, the industry would have to “prepare to fight a hurricane”.[34] BAT currently states that the study, does not represent the company's views, policies and positions
Nigerian lawsuit[edit]
The Nigerian federal government filed a lawsuit against BAT and two other tobacco companies in 2007. Nigeria is seeking $42.4 billion, $34.4 billion of which the government seeks in anticipation of the future cost of treating Nigerians for tobacco-related illnesses. They are also seeking $1.04 billion as a fine for the companies' advertising and marketing campaign allegedly targeting Nigerian youth, and has asked the companies to fund an awareness campaign to educate young people about the dangers of their product. Several Nigerian state governments have filed similar petitions.[35]
Marketing practices[edit]
In 2008 the company was the subject of a BBC Two documentary, in which Duncan Bannatyne investigated the marketing practices of the company in Africa and specifically the way the company targets younger Africans with branded music events, competitions and the sale of single cigarette sticks. Many of the practices uncovered by Bannatyne appeared to break BAT's own code of conduct and company standards. Towards the end of the programme, Bannatyne interviewed Dr Chris Proctor, Head of Science and Regulation, in which Proctor admitted that advertisements targeting children from three African countries were 'disappointing'.[36] In many of these undeveloped countries, the awareness of health risks from smoking is very low or nonexistent.[37]
In September 2001, BAT invested $7.1m in North Korean state-owned enterprise called the Korea Sogyong Trading Corporation, which employs 200 people in Pyongyang to produce up to two billion cigarettes a year. The operation is run by BAT's Singapore Division. Brands of cigarettes produced are Kumgansan, Craven A and Viceroy. BAT claims that the cigarettes are produced only for consumption in North Korea, although there are allegations that the cigarettes are smuggled for sale overseas.[38]
British American Tobacco was declared the winner of the 2008 Roger Award, the award for the worst transnational corporation operating in New Zealand.[39]
British American Tobacco spent more than €700,000 lobbying the EU in 2008, up to four times as much as the company declared on the EU's register of interest representatives, according to a report by Corporate Europe Observatory. The report argues that BAT's hidden lobbying activities, which are clearly not in the public interest, should be exposed to public scrutiny.[40]
Canadian class action lawsuit[edit]
The three largest Canadian tobacco companies, Imperial Tobacco Canada (a division of British American Tobacco), JTI-Macdonald Corp and Rothmans Benson & Hedges, are the subject of the largest class action lawsuit in Canadian history. The case started on 12 March 2012 in Quebec Superior Court, and the companies face a potential payout of C$27 billion (US $27.30 billion) in damages and penalties. In addition, a number of Canadian provinces are teaming up to sue tobacco companies to recover healthcare costs caused by smoking.[41]
On 1 June 2015, Quebec Superior Court Justice Brian Riordan has awarded more than $15 billion to Quebec smokers in a landmark case that pitted them against three Canadian cigarette giants, including JTI-Macdonald Corp.[42][43]
Australian lawsuit[edit]
During 2012 British American Tobacco, along with Philip Morris and Imperial Tobacco, sued the Australian Commonwealth government. At the High Court, they argued that the Commonwealth's plain packaging legislation was unconstitutional because it usurped the companies' intellectual property rights and good will on other than just terms. However, the challenge was unsuccessful.[44]
HMRC Fine for Oversupply[edit]
In November 2014, the HMRC fined BAT £650,000 after it was found to be oversupplying its tobacco products in the Belgium market with the likelihood these products would illegally find themselves back into the UK market, with UK excise taxes not paid. The event highlighted a tobacco-smuggling issue that many anti-tobacco activists have been attempting to bring to light for years. Following several investigations, the HMRC reportedly seized more than 1.4 billion cigarettes and 330 tons of hand rolling tobacco in 2013-2014. BAT denied all claims and described the allegation and fine as “unjustified”[45]
Bribery and threats in Africa[edit]
In late November 2015, an episode of BBC’s Panorama program alleged that BAT was bribing officials in Rwanda, Burundi and Kenya in exchange for their limiting the implementation of the WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in their respective countries. The episode showed documents provided by whistleblower Paul Hopkins, who worked for BAT in Kenya for 13 years. BAT denied the claims.[46]
In 2017 it was reported that BAT and other tobacco companies used a mixture of threats and bullying behaviour to stop or lessen the implementation of anti-smoking legislation in at least eight African countries.[47] One document showed that in Uganda BAT stated that the Tobacco Control Act flew in the face of the country's constitution. Another document showed that lawyers acting on behalf of BAT requested that the high court in Kenya "quash in its entirety" anti-smoking legislation.[47]
Pakistani lobbying efforts[edit]
In April 2015 medical experts and anti-tobacco campaigners accused Philip Barton, the British High Commissioner to Pakistan, of lobbying for BAT interests. Pictures were released showing Barton attending a meeting on March 13 in Islamabad, where BAT executives attempted to convince the Pakistani Finance and Health Minister to prevent plans to print large health warnings on cigarette packets.[48] This activity was deemed contrary to FCO policy. It followed an earlier incident when the British Ambassador to Panama was reprimanded for similar activity on BAT’s behalf.[49]

History[edit]
1902 to 2000[edit]




James Buchanan Duke


The company was formed in 1902, when the United Kingdom's Imperial Tobacco Company and the American Tobacco Company of the United States agreed to form a joint venture, the British-American Tobacco Company Ltd.[7] The parent companies agreed not to trade in each other's domestic territory and to assign trademarks, export businesses and overseas subsidiaries to the joint venture. James Buchanan Duke became its chairman and the British American Tobacco business began life in countries as diverse as Canada, China, Germany, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, but not in the United Kingdom or in the United States.[7]
In China, BAT inherited a factory in the Pudong district of Shanghai from W.D. & H.O. Wills, one of the precursor companies of Imperial Tobacco.[8] Under the management of James Augustus Thomas from Rockingham, North Carolina, USA, by 1919 the Shanghai factory was producing more than 243 million cigarettes per week.[9] Thomas worked closely with the local Wing Tai Vo Tobacco Company, which developed into BAT's principal Chinese partner after its success with the "Ruby Queen" cigarette brand.[10]
In 1911 the American Tobacco Company sold its share of the company. Imperial Tobacco gradually reduced its shareholding, but it was not until 1980 that it divested its remaining interests in the company.[7]
At its peak, in 1937 BAT manufactured and distributed 55 billion cigarettes in China. The company's assets were seized by the Japanese in 1941 following their 1937 invasion. In 1953 the company was ejected from China following the foundation of the People's Republic.[8]
In 1976 the group companies were reorganised under a new holding company, B.A.T Industries. In 1994 BAT acquired its former parent, American Tobacco Company (though reorganised after anti-trust proceedings). This brought the Lucky Strike and Pall Mall brands into BAT's portfolio.[11]
In 1999 it merged with Rothmans International,[12] which included a share in a factory in Burma. This made it the target of criticism from human rights groups. It sold its share of the factory on 6 November 2003 after an "exceptional request" from the British government.[13]
2000 to present[edit]




The Globe House: British American Tobacco's current headquarters


In 2002, BAT lost a lawsuit about the right to sell cigarettes under the Marlboro brand name in the UK. It had acquired Rothmans, which had previously bought a licence to use the name from Philip Morris. Philip Morris' attorneys invoked a get-out clause for the case of a major change of ownership.[14]
In 2003, BAT acquired Ente Tabacchi Italiani (ETI) S.p.A, Italy's state tobacco company. The important acquisition would elevate BAT to the number two position in Italy, the second largest tobacco market in the European Union. The scale of the enlarged operations would bring significant opportunities to compete and grow ETI's local brands and BAT's international brands.[15]
In August 2003, BAT acquired a 67.8% holding in the Serbian tobacco company Duvanska Industrija Vranje (DIV), allowing local manufacture of its brands, freeing them from import duties. In the longer term, export opportunities are planned as neighbouring countries in south east Europe developed free trade agreements.[16]
In July 2004 the U.S. business of British American Tobacco (Brown & Williamson) was combined with that of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (R. J. Reynolds), under the R. J. Reynolds name. R. J. Reynolds and Brown & Williamson were the second and third-ranking U.S. tobacco companies prior to the combination. When they combined, R. J. Reynolds became a subsidiary of Reynolds American, with BAT holding a 42% share. In January 2007, BAT closed its remaining UK production plant in Southampton with the loss of over 600 jobs. However, the global Research and Development operation and some financial functions will continue on the site.[17]
Then in 2008 BAT acquired Turkey's state-owned cigarette maker Tekel.
In July 2008, BAT acquired the cigarette and snus operations of the Scandinavian Tobacco Company.[18]
BAT acquired 60% of Indonesia's Bentoel Group in 2009[19] before increasing its stake to 100% the following year.[20]
In May 2011 BAT acquired the Colombian company Productora Tabacalera de Tabacos S.A. (Protabaco).[21]
In October 2016, BAT offered to buy the remaining 57.8 percent of U.S. cigarette maker Reynolds American in a $47 billion takeover that would create the world's biggest listed tobacco company with brands including Newport, Lucky Strike and Pall Mall.[22] In January 2017, Reynolds agreed to an increased $49.4 billion deal, expected to close in the third quarter of the year after approval from both companies' boards of directors.[23]
In April 2017 the company announced the acquisition of a number of Bulgarian cigarette brands from Bulgartabac for more than €100 million.[24]
Operations[edit]
Current[edit]




One of British American Tobacco's most popular products "Lucky Strike"


International Brands include Dunhill, Kent, North State Lucky Strike, Pall Mall, Vogue, Rothmans International, Winfield, State Express 555, KOOL, and Viceroy. However, British American Tobacco does not necessarily own the rights to all of these brands in every nation they are marketed.

On 11 June 2006, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company announced that it would be manufacturing Camel brand snus in Sweden in partnership with British American Tobacco; the product would be test-marketed in Portland, Oregon and Austin, Texas by the end of the month.[25]
The Bentoel Group products include Bentoel Biru, Bentoel Mild, Bentoel Sejati, Star Mild, X Mild, 1 Indonesia Masyarakat Dahulukan Pencapaian Dahulukan (taking the principle of 1Malaysia) (neO Mild, unO Mild, and One Mild), Club Mild, Dunhill Fine Cut Mild, Bintang Buana, Tali Jagat, Pr1nsip, Joged, Rawit, Ardath, Benson & Hedges, and Country.
The Gelora Djaja products include Wismilak Spesial, Wismilak Slim, Wismilak Diplomat, Galan Slim, Galan Mild, and MilDay.
Former[edit]
BAT has diversified into various fields at different times in its history. Its U.S. retail division, BATUS Retail Group, acquired Gimbels, Kohl's, and Saks Fifth Avenue in the 1970s and Marshall Field's and its divisions in 1982. The United Kingdom retail chain Argos was purchased in 1979. Kohl's grocery stores were sold to A&P in 1983. In 1986, BATUS sold the Kohl's department stores and two Marshall Field's divisions, The Crescent and Frederick & Nelson; BATUS closed Gimbels the same year, with many locations being absorbed by sister division Marshall Field's, as well as Allied Stores' Stern's and Pomeroy's divisions. In 1990 Marshall Field's was sold to Dayton Hudson Corporation (now Target Corporation), Ivey's (another Marshall Field's division) was sold to Dillard's, Saks Fifth Avenue was sold to Investcorp S.A., and Argos was demerged (Argos was acquired by previous parent company GUS plc in 1998).
The group was a major financial services company with the acquisitions of Eagle Star (1984),[26] Allied Dunbar (1985) and the Farmers Group, Inc. (1988). Around 1996 British American Tobacco merged their financial operations into a single operating unit, British American Financial Services (BAFS). This division was merged with Zurich Insurance Company in 1998 to form the Zurich Financial Services Group.[27] B.A.T still owns the minority interest in Zurich.
Senior management[edit]
Nicandro Durante became the chief executive in March 2011.[28]
Sponsorships[edit]
BAT have found many imaginative ways over the years to keep its brands in the public eye. ITC Limited, in which BAT holds a minority share, as recently as 1996 secured an arrangement to sponsor the Cricket World Cup which was branded the "Wills World Cup" and thereby achieved a high level of brand recognition for the Wills cigarette brand in India where young cricket fans were a key target market.[29]
BAT also sponsor the London Symphony Orchestra.[30]
Motorsport[edit]




Jacques Villeneuve driving for BAR at the 1999 Canadian Grand Prix.


In 1997 BAT brought its participation in the sport to new levels with the purchase of the Tyrrell team for approximately £30 million. The team raced as Tyrrell for the 1998 season before being renamed as British American Racing (BAR).[31]
Although Formula One is an exceptionally expensive sport,[clarification needed] for BAT the high cost of running an F1 team was justified as a promotional expense because there were few other opportunities for brand promotion. However, in 2005 a European Union (EU) directive was brought into force which required national governments to legislate to prevent tobacco sponsorship.[32]
In 2004 BAR announced that technology partner Honda had purchased a 45% stake and in September 2005 it announced that Honda would be buying the remaining 55% stake. The team raced as Honda Racing F1 Team in 2006, the last year of the Lucky Strike sponsorship before leaving the sport. For the 2006 season, the team was renamed as Honda F1 Racing Team, with BAT only advertised at a couple of races. All links between the two companies were severed for 2007.[33]
Controversies[edit]
Smoking bans[edit]
Industry documents from the 1970s to the late 1990s shows that tobacco companies were seriously concerned about fatwas against smoking by Muslim jurists in Muslim majority countries.[34] In 1996, an internal document from British American Tobacco warned that, because of the spread of “extremist views” from fundamentalists in countries such as Afghanistan, the industry would have to “prepare to fight a hurricane”.[34] BAT currently states that the study, does not represent the company's views, policies and positions
Nigerian lawsuit[edit]
The Nigerian federal government filed a lawsuit against BAT and two other tobacco companies in 2007. Nigeria is seeking $42.4 billion, $34.4 billion of which the government seeks in anticipation of the future cost of treating Nigerians for tobacco-related illnesses. They are also seeking $1.04 billion as a fine for the companies' advertising and marketing campaign allegedly targeting Nigerian youth, and has asked the companies to fund an awareness campaign to educate young people about the dangers of their product. Several Nigerian state governments have filed similar petitions.[35]
Marketing practices[edit]
In 2008 the company was the subject of a BBC Two documentary, in which Duncan Bannatyne investigated the marketing practices of the company in Africa and specifically the way the company targets younger Africans with branded music events, competitions and the sale of single cigarette sticks. Many of the practices uncovered by Bannatyne appeared to break BAT's own code of conduct and company standards. Towards the end of the programme, Bannatyne interviewed Dr Chris Proctor, Head of Science and Regulation, in which Proctor admitted that advertisements targeting children from three African countries were 'disappointing'.[36] In many of these undeveloped countries, the awareness of health risks from smoking is very low or nonexistent.[37]
In September 2001, BAT invested $7.1m in North Korean state-owned enterprise called the Korea Sogyong Trading Corporation, which employs 200 people in Pyongyang to produce up to two billion cigarettes a year. The operation is run by BAT's Singapore Division. Brands of cigarettes produced are Kumgansan, Craven A and Viceroy. BAT claims that the cigarettes are produced only for consumption in North Korea, although there are allegations that the cigarettes are smuggled for sale overseas.[38]
British American Tobacco was declared the winner of the 2008 Roger Award, the award for the worst transnational corporation operating in New Zealand.[39]
British American Tobacco spent more than €700,000 lobbying the EU in 2008, up to four times as much as the company declared on the EU's register of interest representatives, according to a report by Corporate Europe Observatory. The report argues that BAT's hidden lobbying activities, which are clearly not in the public interest, should be exposed to public scrutiny.[40]
Canadian class action lawsuit[edit]
The three largest Canadian tobacco companies, Imperial Tobacco Canada (a division of British American Tobacco), JTI-Macdonald Corp and Rothmans Benson & Hedges, are the subject of the largest class action lawsuit in Canadian history. The case started on 12 March 2012 in Quebec Superior Court, and the companies face a potential payout of C$27 billion (US $27.30 billion) in damages and penalties. In addition, a number of Canadian provinces are teaming up to sue tobacco companies to recover healthcare costs caused by smoking.[41]
On 1 June 2015, Quebec Superior Court Justice Brian Riordan has awarded more than $15 billion to Quebec smokers in a landmark case that pitted them against three Canadian cigarette giants, including JTI-Macdonald Corp.[42][43]
Australian lawsuit[edit]
During 2012 British American Tobacco, along with Philip Morris and Imperial Tobacco, sued the Australian Commonwealth government. At the High Court, they argued that the Commonwealth's plain packaging legislation was unconstitutional because it usurped the companies' intellectual property rights and good will on other than just terms. However, the challenge was unsuccessful.[44]
HMRC Fine for Oversupply[edit]
In November 2014, the HMRC fined BAT £650,000 after it was found to be oversupplying its tobacco products in the Belgium market with the likelihood these products would illegally find themselves back into the UK market, with UK excise taxes not paid. The event highlighted a tobacco-smuggling issue that many anti-tobacco activists have been attempting to bring to light for years. Following several investigations, the HMRC reportedly seized more than 1.4 billion cigarettes and 330 tons of hand rolling tobacco in 2013-2014. BAT denied all claims and described the allegation and fine as “unjustified”[45]
Bribery and threats in Africa[edit]
In late November 2015, an episode of BBC’s Panorama program alleged that BAT was bribing officials in Rwanda, Burundi and Kenya in exchange for their limiting the implementation of the WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in their respective countries. The episode showed documents provided by whistleblower Paul Hopkins, who worked for BAT in Kenya for 13 years. BAT denied the claims.[46]
In 2017 it was reported that BAT and other tobacco companies used a mixture of threats and bullying behaviour to stop or lessen the implementation of anti-smoking legislation in at least eight African countries.[47] One document showed that in Uganda BAT stated that the Tobacco Control Act flew in the face of the country's constitution. Another document showed that lawyers acting on behalf of BAT requested that the high court in Kenya "quash in its entirety" anti-smoking legislation.[47]
Pakistani lobbying efforts[edit]
In April 2015 medical experts and anti-tobacco campaigners accused Philip Barton, the British High Commissioner to Pakistan, of lobbying for BAT interests. Pictures were released showing Barton attending a meeting on March 13 in Islamabad, where BAT executives attempted to convince the Pakistani Finance and Health Minister to prevent plans to print large health warnings on cigarette packets.[48] This activity was deemed contrary to FCO policy. It followed an earlier incident when the British Ambassador to Panama was reprimanded for similar activity on BAT’s behalf.[49]

 Shareholders back British American Tobacco buying Reynolds

Shareholders of British American Tobacco and Reynolds American Inc. on Wednesday approved merging into the world's largest publicly traded tobacco company.Shareholders of both companies approved London-headquartered BAT buying the 57.8 percent of Reynolds it does not already own. The purchase is expected to become effective next week. Each Reynolds share will convert to $29.44 in cash and 0.5260 BAT shares.The $49 billion cash-and-stock offer announced in January valued each Reynolds share at $59.64, up from $56.50 offered in October. The price is nearly 40 percent above the value of Reynolds shares before the October offer, BAT said in a disclosure to U.S. securities regulators."We look forward to welcoming Reynolds group employees to British American Tobacco and to realising the benefits of operating these two great companies as one stronger, global tobacco and Next Generation Products business," BAT Chief Executive Nicandro Durante said in a prepared statement.

Here's a look at the companies and the takeover:THE IMPACTThe takeover is the latest in the string of consolidations that has seen the number of cigarette companies shrink this century. The deal gives BAT greater access to the U.S. market, where cigarette prices and taxes are low relative to consumer incomes but the customer base in shrinking. The combined company gains strength to increase sales in developing countries, where health restrictions aren't as strict. The combination also improves the sales push of vapor and nicotine replacement products and development of other new products.BAT projects saving at least $400 million a year through cost-cutting of corporate operations, increased purchasing power, and other supply-chain efficiencies. BAT also expects to add about $38 billion of debt with the acquisition on top of nearly $22 billion at the end of last year, the company said in a securities filing last month.

THE BRANDSBAT sells Dunhill, Rothmans, Kent, Benson & Hedges and Lucky Strike cigarettes. The company said its cigarettes reach about 12 percent of the world's 1 billion smokers. The company also sells roll-your-own cut tobacco, snus, cigars, and vapor products.Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based Reynolds is the second-largest U.S. cigarette company and owns the Camel and Pall Mall cigarette brands. Reynolds estimates that about half of its consolidated net sales last year were from menthol cigarettes, driven by segment-leader Newport. The company also sells smokeless tobacco, Natural American Spirit cigarettes and nicotine replacement products.ORIGIN STORIESBritish-American Tobacco was established in 1902 and spread across the former British Empire including India and East Africa.Reynolds traces its roots to 1875, when Richard Joshua Reynolds started a chewing tobacco company in the city that has been its headquarters since. The takeover marks an end for what became R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, which stamped its home state of North Carolina as a center during a bygone era of smoking's popularity through its Winston and Salem brands.The company's links with British American Tobacco date to 2004, when R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. merged with BAT's Brown & Williamson unit, creating Reynolds American. The two companies already have a technology-sharing agreement in the development of electronic cigarettes.

Camel cigarette maker Reynolds American Inc. is being acquired by British American Tobacco. File/AP


RALEIGH — The consolidation of Big Tobacco companies looking as much to nicotine replacements and e-cigarettes for revenues as traditional smokes continued Wednesday with what will become the world's largest publicly traded tobacco company.Shareholders approved British American Tobacco taking over Winston-Salem-based Reynolds American Inc., the latest in a string of mergers that has seen the number of cigarette companies shrink this century.The deal gives London-based BAT greater access to the U.S. market, where cigarette prices and taxes are low relative to consumer incomes, but the customer base is shrinking. The combined company gains strength to increase sales in developing countries, where health regulations aren't as strict. The combination also improves the sales push of vapor and nicotine replacement products and development of other new products."We look forward to welcoming Reynolds group employees to British American Tobacco and to realizing the benefits of operating these two great companies as one stronger, global tobacco and Next Generation Products business," BAT chief executive Nicandro Durante said in a prepared statement.BAT sells Dunhill, Rothmans, Kent, Benson & Hedges and Lucky Strike cigarettes. The company said its cigarettes reach about 12 percent of the world's 1 billion smokers. The company also sells roll-your-own cut tobacco, snus, cigars, and vapor products.Reynolds is the second-largest U.S. cigarette company and owns the Camel and Pall Mall cigarette brands. Reynolds estimates that about half of its consolidated net sales last year were from menthol cigarettes, driven by segment-leader Newport. The company also sells smokeless tobacco, Natural American Spirit cigarettes and nicotine replacement products.British-American Tobacco was established in 1902 and spread across the former British Empire including India and East Africa.Reynolds traces its roots to 1875, when Richard Joshua Reynolds started a chewing tobacco company in the city that has been its headquarters since. The takeover marks an end for what became R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, which stamped its home state of North Carolina as a center during a bygone era of smoking's popularity through its Winston and Salem brands.The company's links with British American Tobacco date to 2004, when R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. merged with BAT's Brown & Williamson unit, creating Reynolds American. The two companies already have a technology-sharing agreement in the development of electronic cigarettes.BAT projects saving at least $400 million a year from its latest acquisition through cost-cutting of corporate operations, increased purchasing power, and other supply-chain efficiencies. BAT also expects to add about $38 billion of debt with the acquisition on top of nearly $22 billion at the end of last year, the company said in a securities filing last month.Shareholders of both companies approved BAT buying the 57.8 percent of Reynolds it does not already own. The cash-and-stock deal is expected to become effective next week.The $49 billion announced in January valued each Reynolds share at $59.64, up from $56.50 offered in October. The price is nearly 40 percent above the value of Reynolds shares before the October offer, BAT said in a disclosure to U.S. securities regulators.

British American Tobacco: The Best Of Big Tobacco? - British American Tobacco p.l.c. (American Depository Receipts) (NYSEMKT:BTI) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»British American Tobacco: The Best Of Big Tobacco?Jun.12.17 | About: British American (BTI) Christopher Monaco Long only, value, Growth, growth at reasonable priceLinkedin AccountSummaryStrong product lineup and brands coupled with upcoming merger should continue to fuel BAT's success.Favorable positioning in alternative cigarette products such as vaporizers and heat-not-burn.A switch to quarterly dividend payments next year should generate even more interest amongst income investors.Stock is fully valued; wait for a more attractive entry point.

 While it's no secret that the tobacco industry has historically been a gold mine for investors, one company seems to continuously fly underneath the radar: British American Tobacco (NYSEMKT:BTI). Despite impressive performance, those within the SA community have shown little interest in the global behemoth. While its counterpart, Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM), garners most of the attention, BAT has arguably more attractive fundamentals and catalysts to propel it to future growth. During full-year 2016, cigarette volumes at BAT increased 0.2%. Even with a volatile British Pound, constant revenue and profit rates were up 6.9% and 4.1%, respectively. Comparatively, Philip Morris reported less impressive results across the board: cigarette volumes declined 4.1% while constant revenue declined 0.4% and profit increased 0.9%. Despite both companies having faced significant currency fluctuations, British American Tobacco had an outstanding 2016. As reflected by volume, BAT is showing organic growth in an industry where it is hard to come by. Their four major brands, Pall Mall, Kent, Lucky Strike, and Dunhill are gaining popularity as consumers in emerging markets transition into higher end tobacco products. Despite the numbers though, Philip Morris continues to garner a significantly higher valuation. 


 This is a result of two major factors: more excitement for Philip Morris' future products and their steadier dividend. Bonnie Herzog, a Wells Fargo analyst, recently released a research note in which she stated that Philip Morris' next generation iQOS smoking platforms have the potential to add an additional $40 to PM's current stock price. As you can see below, so far this year, both stocks have absolutely crushed the broader indices with Philip Morris up about 7% over BAT. Much of that difference can be attributed to the dollar having weakened 5% year to date. A weak dollar is good news for Philip Morris International as all of its revenues are earned in foreign currencies. 

 The Merger After plenty of speculation, earlier this year it was announced that Reynolds American (NYSE:RAI) had agreed for BAT to purchase the existing 58% of the company it didn't already own. This is tremendous for BAT as it will instantly gain a large foothold in one of the most profitable markets in the industry. Outside of China, The United States is currently the most attractive cigarette and tobacco market. Despite a long decline in usage, high purchasing power has more than offset taxes and litigation. Roughly two packs of cigarettes sold in America generates the same amount of revenue as the equivalent to thirteen packs sold in emerging/underdeveloped markets. Once the merger is completed, BAT will become the largest tobacco company on earth as well as the only one with a global reach that extends into the United States. Since its spinoff in 2008 from Altria (NYSE:MO), Philip Morris International no longer generates any revenue in America. Although the deal is still pending shareholder approval, with BAT already owning 42% of existing RAI shares, the merger will assuredly be approved later this year.
 Next Generation Products 

 In addition to market share, BAT will also gain access to Reynolds' next generation products and technology. While BAT already has a very promising group of non-cigarette products such as the Vype Pebble, Reynolds has been at the forefront of technological innovation. They themselves have an industry leading vaporizing product called Vuse. Roughly 42% of all electronic smoking devices sold in America are manufactured by Reynolds American. Once combined, BAT will have the largest vapor business worldwide. In North America, over the next five years, the vape industry is projected to grow at a whopping CAGR of roughly 27%. 

 By far the most interesting products in the industry however, are those in the "heat-not-burn" category. Staying true to the name, these handheld devices heat sticks of tobacco taking the combustible factor out of the equation. This results in a unique experience that provides the nicotine kick found in cigarettes without many of the negatives such as the release of harmful toxins and smell. While Philip Morris and their iQOS heat-not-burn have been capturing headlines, BAT's own heat-not-burn product, glo, has also been doing extremely well. Using Sendai, Japan as its initial testing ground, response from customers was so great that some waited overnight outside of convenience stores to purchase one. With plans to roll glo out to the rest of Japan by the end of the year, early results have been incredibly promising. As of last tally, one in five smokers in Sendai has already purchased a glo since December. Market saturation however may become an issue as Japan Tobacco (OTCPK:JAPAY) plans on releasing their own heat-not-burn product, Ploom TECH, in the coming months.
 Even despite the positive reception of these products, at this point their future is still somewhat uncertain. While smokers have generally been positive on iQOS and glo, it remains to be seen just how much healthier they actually are. Claims from Big Tobacco are to be taken with a grain of salt at this point. A recent article from The Daily Mail revealed that heat-not-burn products may not be as revolutionary as some may think. Last week, the FDA began its study on the iQOS to conclude if claims from Philip Morris are indeed accurate. If they are proven to be true, look for next generation smoking products to significantly expand in popularity. Results are expected to be released in about a year. ITC LTD 

 Another exciting development within BAT is their 30% (~$17.2 billion dollar) stake in ITC LTD. Formerly known as the Indian Tobacco Company, ITC is a conglomerate and one of the largest public companies in India. In addition to tobacco, ITC offers a wide array of goods and services within India including packaged food and personal care products. Arguably the most compelling emerging market at the moment, India has a population that is expected to reach 1.5 billion by 2050. Due to government regulation, it's unlikely BAT will ever be able to fully acquire ITC however, the current stake that they own gives them a nice foothold in a difficult to access market. Earlier this year, Philip Morris was blindsided when Indian courts ruled that they were planning on tightening regulations on foreign investment in their tobacco industry. Philip Morris has since threatened significant changes even suggesting that they may pull out of the region all together if the new protectionist rules are implemented. ITC, which already controls 80% of the Indian tobacco market, could have an even larger stranglehold if Philip Morris decides to leave.
 The Dividend A major reason why American investors have shied away from British American Tobacco in lieu of Philip Morris is in part because of their unsteady dividend distributions. Being a foreign ADR, the company distributes a dividend semiannually as opposed to the American standard of quarterly. This has turned off income investors looking for a stable source of income. Depending on the exchange rate between the GBP and USD later this year (when the second dividend is distributed), BAT's dividend yield is likely to be roughly around 3% (the lowest its been in years); also lower than both Altria's and Philip Morris'. If you look at BAT's recent dividend distributions dating back to 2013, you'll find an inconsistent and generally declining/stagnant dividend. 

 This however is a direct result of the weakening British Pound versus the U.S. Dollar. Looking at BAT's distributions via their London based shares tells a different story: 

 Over the past 5 years, BAT has actually grown their dividend by 6% y/y. Unfortunately for us American investors though, the recent stagnation/decline in BAT's American dividend distributions has perfectly coincided with the decline of the British Pound starting in 2014. 


 The good news is that British American Tobacco announced earlier this year that they will begin distributing dividends quarterly beginning in 2018. This move will allow investors to receive a steadier stream of income for their portfolios. If the British Pound continues to weaken versus the dollar however, it may be a while before we begin to see any significant dividend growth. Conclusion As governments across the world continue to crackdown on traditional cigarette usage, BAT is incredibly well positioned to weather the effects. Even as litigation costs begin to rise in the alternative product categories this is actually considered a positive for BAT. In fact, rising litigation expenses are viewed as a positive for Big Tobacco because they are the only companies with enough resources to accommodate the costs associated with regulation. Regardless of how things shake out politically in the U.K., British American Tobacco will be amongst one of the best companies to ride out the wave of uncertainty. So long as yields remain low, look for tobacco stocks to continue to work favorably in this market.
