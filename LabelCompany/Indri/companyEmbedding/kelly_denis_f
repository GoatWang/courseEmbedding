Welcome



Today you are one step closer to a new you where you feel empowered and on a positive path to growth and well-being.


My goal is to help you uncover your true potential and lead a life that is worth celebrating. While we can't change difficult situations of the past, we can work together to better understand and resolve challenges in your life. The counseling work in which you and I will engage focuses on helping you understand and change ways of thinking and behaving that may not be "helpful". This type of counseling is very collaborative in that you and I are a "team" working together to help you make the changes that will help you live a more effective and happy life.


If you're looking for extra support and guidance through a challenging situation or you're just ready to move in a new direction in your life, I look forward to working with you to achieve your goals.


Please call or email me for an individual, couples or family therapy consultation today.

 Do we really know pornography when we see it? Pornography is condemned for being "too close" while erotica is defended as "leaving room for the imagination." And the art of the nude is treated as something much more special, located even further away from the potential of arousal. Art/Porn argues that these distinctions are based on an age-old antithesis between sight and touch, an antithesis created and maintained for centuries by art criticism. Art has always elicited a struggle between the senses, between something to be viewed and something to be touched, between visual and visceral pleasure. Images compel the senses in ways that are both taboo and intrinsic to art. Contemporary responses to images of the nude embody this longstanding tension. Our fears about the materiality of art when in close proximity to our own bodies exist in tandem with a regulation of sensory response which dates back to Antiquity. Art/Porn  reveals how--from fondling statues in Antiquity to point-and-click Internet pornography--the worlds of art and pornography are much closer than we think.
