Our laboratory 
                    is interested in microbial pathogenesis, studying both viral 
                    and bacterial diseases. Our basic approach is to conduct molecular 
                    genetic analyses of individual microbial gene products it 
                    order to determine their structure and function within the 
                    microbe’s life cycle. This information is then employed 
                    to develop potential intervention strategies such as vaccines 
                    or therapeutics.

Our research goal is to conduct a proteomic analysis of the vaccinia virion. To advance our understanding of the infectious vaccinia virion we are identifying the proteins associated with the membrane as well as those associated with the core. We use several separation techniques coupled with mass spectrometry to identify the vaccinia proteins.

My 
                    research is focused on four Vaccinia virus (VV) acylproteins: 
                    L1R, A16L, E7R, and G9R. The entire life cycle of VV (DNA 
                    replication, transcription, translation, and virion assembly) 
                    occurs within the cytoplasm of the infected cell. This remarkable 
                    feature makes VV and other poxviruses an exception among all 
                    other DNA viruses. To orchestrate all these processes, VV 
                    exploits many of the mechanisms utilized by the host cell. 
                    One of the examples is protein myristoylation (attachment 
                    of a 14-carbon saturated fatty acid). In various studies, 
                    this type of protein modification has been demonstrated to 
                    regulate protein functions and targeting by promoting protein-protein 
                    and protein-membrane interactions. In my research, I use a 
                    broad spectrum of methods of molecular biology, genetics 
                    and various microscopy techniques. The goal of my study is to understand the role of these myristoylated 
                    VV proteins in virus replication as well as the significance 
                  of myristyc modification for protein functions.

I 
                        am using small molecule inhibitors to characterize 
                        unknown components of the vaccinia genome. I am in the 
                        process of generating several drug resistant mutants of 
                        which I intend to map the resistance via marker rescue 
                        analysis. My current system includes GFP as a reporter 
                        protein cloned into the vaccinia thymidine kinase ORF. 
                        Eventually, this research could reveal potential targets 
                        for the development of anti-viral drugs.

I study the product of the I7L ORF, a cysteine protease resposible for 
cleavage of core protein precursors.  It is essential for the formation of 
mature vaccinia virus particles and is a potential drug target. I am trying to 
further characterize its function, regulation, and interactions using 
temperature sensitive I7L mutants and molecular techniques.

My 
                            research interests involve development of a vaccine 
                            against Streptococcus pyogenes, the pathogenic gram-positive 
                            bacterium associated with a number of diseases including 
                            pharyngitis, impetigo, necrotizing fasciitis, pneumonia, 
                            scarlet fever, glomerulonephritis, acute rheumatic 
                            fever, and Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated 
                            with Streptococcus (PANDAS). Using a murine model 
                            of pharyngitis, my research focuses on establishing 
                            the importance of the humoral immune response to the 
                            M-protein C-repeat region in protecting against infection. 
                            In the course of this research, I have developed and 
                            continue to refine a novel expression system in which 
                            Streptococcus gordonii expresses and secretes into 
                            media exogenous antigens using genetics borne by a 
                            resident plasmid. This plasmid possesses the previously 
                            characterized positive regulator Rgg and secretion 
                            sequence from the glucosyltransferase GtfG.

My research goal is to conduct a proteomic analysis of the vaccinia virus virion. I use mass spectormetry in combination with various separation techniques to analyze complex mixtures of proteins. Post-translational modifications of these proteins, such as phosphorylation and acylation, are also identified. Three instuments are used to acquire information including: MALDI-ToF-ToF, LC-ESI-QIT, and LC-ESI-Q-ToF. Data is searched against an in-house database for vaccinia.

Vaccinia virus core proteins are cleaved at conserved AG*X sites, contributing to the formation of mature virions. A12L, a 25 kDa late core protein, is proteolytically processed at an N-terminal AGA site, yielding a 17 kDa product. Unlike other core proteins (such as 4a, 4b, and 25k), A12L has two more putative AG*K sites. The purpose of this study is to determine the cleavage process at the novel AG*K sites in order to understand of the maturation and regulation of the A12L protein. Also, I am studying the biological functions of A12L using a genetic approach of making a conditional-lethal mutant virus, as well as site-directed mutagenesis on the putative cleavage sites.

The viral RNA was found to contain polyadenylic acid [poly(A)] regions that were very heterogeneous in length. Chromatography of the EMC viral RNA on oligo(dT)-cellulose columns separated the RNA into three distinct fractions (peaks 1 to 3). Approximately 20% of the EMC viral RNA appeared as peak 1, 40% as peak 2, and 40% as peak 3. The RNA in each fraction appeared to be intact as...

Early studies noted this gene was transcribed early during infection (Morgan & Roberts, 1984) and that a mutation in its 5′ non-coding region affected the sensitivity of VACV to the inhibitor of RNA polymerase II, alpha-amanitin (Tamin et al., 1988, 1991) but this observation remains unexplained. The protein has 175 aa residues with a predicted mass of 20.8 kDa and an isoelectric point (pI) of 6.51 (www.poxvirus.org). Vaccinia virus protein N2 is a nuclear IRF3 inhibitor that promotes virulence[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Vaccinia virus (VACV) expresses many proteins that are non-essential for virus replication but promote virulence by inhibiting components of the host immune response to infection. These immunomodulators include a family of proteins that have, or are predicted to have, a structure related to the B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 protein. Five members of the VACV Bcl-2 family (N1, B14, A52, F1 and K7) have had their crystal structure solved, others have been characterised and a function assigned (C6, A46), and others are predicted to be Bcl-2 proteins but are uncharacterised hitherto (N2, B22, C1). Data presented here show that N2 is a nuclear protein that is expressed early during infection and inhibits the activation of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)3. Consistent with its nuclear localisation, N2 inhibits IRF3 downstream of the TANK-binding kinase (TBK)-1 and after IRF3 translocation into the nucleus. A mutant VACV strain Western Reserve lacking the N2L gene showed normal replication and spread in cultured cells compared to wild type parental (vN2) and revertant (vN2-rev) viruses, but was attenuated in two murine models of infection. After intranasal infection, the vdeltaN2 mutant induced lower weight loss and signs of illness, and virus was cleared more rapidly from the infected tissue. In the intradermal model of infection, vdeltaN2 induced smaller lesions that were resolved more rapidly. In summary, the N2 protein is an intracellular virulence factor that inhibits IRF3 activity in the nucleus. Full-text · Article · Jun 2013 Brian J.

However, this transcriptional termination mechanism does not appear to be operational during late transcription (Weinrich and Hruby, 1987; Weir and Moss, 1984). The viral late mRNAs present in virus-infected cells are often heterogeneous in length, with mRNAs of certain genes frequently exhibiting lengths ranging from just longer than the open reading frame to several kilobases longer than this (Mahr and Roberts, 1984; Weinrich et al., 1985; Weir and Moss, 1984). A 43-Nucleotide RNACis-Acting Element Governs the Site-Specific Formation of the 3′ End of a Poxvirus Late mRNA[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: The 3' ends of late mRNAs of the ati gene, encoding the major component of the A-type inclusions, are generated by endoribonucleolytic cleavage at a specific site in the primary transcript [Antczak et al., (1992), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89, 12033-12037]. In this study, sequence analysis of cDNAs of the 3' ends of ati mRNAs showed these mRNAs are 3' polyadenylated at the RNA cleavage site. This suggests that ati mRNA 3' end formation involves cleavage of a late transcript, with subsequent 3' polyadenylation of the 5' cleavage product. The RNA cis-acting element, the AX element, directing orientation-dependent formation of these mRNA 3' ends, was mapped to a 345-bp AluI-XbaI fragment. Deletion analyses of this fragment showed that the boundaries of the AX element are within -5 and +38 of the RNA cleavage site. Scanning mutagenesis showed that the AX element contains at least two subelements: subelement I, 5'-UUUAU downward arrowCCGAUAAUUC-3', containing the cleavage site ( downward arrow), separated from the downstream subelement II, 5'-AAUUUCGGAUUUGAAUGC-3', by a 10-nucleotide region, whose composition may be altered without effect on RNA 3' end formation. These features, which differ from those of other elements controlling RNA processing, suggest that the AX element is a component of a novel mechanism of RNA 3' end formation.

Vaccinia virus vectors: New strategies for producing recombinant vaccines[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: The development and continued refinement of techniques for the efficient insertion and expression of heterologous DNA sequences from within the genomic context of infectious vaccinia virus recombinants are among the most promising current approaches towards effective immunoprophylaxis against a variety of protozoan, viral, and bacterial human pathogens. Because of its medical relevance, this area is the subject of intense research interest and has evolved rapidly during the past several years. This review (i) provides an updated overview of the technology that exists for assembling recombinant vaccinia virus strains, (ii) discusses the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches, (iii) outlines the areas of outgoing research directed towards overcoming the limitations of current techniques, and (iv) provides some insight (i.e., speculation) about probable future refinements in the use of vaccinia virus as a vector.Article · May 1990 Dennis E HrubyReadThough immunization with vaccinia virus is no longer conducted, the potential threat of Smallpox being used for biological attack and the infrequent outbreaks from the closely related Monkey pox virus warrants the need for continued research for vaccine development, detection assays, and therapeutics against members of the poxviridae family. The L1 protein is a transmembrane, myristoylated protein that is located on the surface of the intact mature virion (IMV) [2,3]. The 250-residue protein is an essential component of the viral life cycle as deletion mutants have been shown incapable of maturation [4]. Development and Evaluation of Single Domain Antibodies for Vaccinia and the L1 Antigen[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: There is ongoing interest to develop high affinity, thermal stable recognition elements to replace conventional antibodies in biothreat detection assays. As part of this effort, single domain antibodies that target vaccinia virus were developed. Two llamas were immunized with killed viral particles followed by boosts with the recombinant membrane protein, L1, to stimulate the immune response for envelope and membrane proteins of the virus. The variable domains of the induced heavy chain antibodies were selected from M13 phage display libraries developed from isolated RNA. Selection via biopanning on the L1 antigen produced single domain antibodies that were specific and had affinities ranging from 4×10-9 M to 7.0×10-10 M, as determined by surface plasmon resonance. Several showed good ability to refold after heat denaturation. These L1-binding single domain antibodies, however, failed to recognize the killed vaccinia antigen. Useful vaccinia binding single domain antibodies were isolated by a second selection using the killed virus as the target. The virus binding single domain antibodies were incorporated in sandwich assays as both capture and tracer using the MAGPIX system yielding limits of detection down to 4×105 pfu/ml, a four-fold improvement over the limit obtained using conventional antibodies. This work demonstrates the development of anti-vaccinia single domain antibodies and their incorporation into sandwich assays for viral detection. It also highlights the properties of high affinity and thermal stability that are hallmarks of single domain antibodies.

Genomic Sequence and Virulence of Clonal Isolates of Vaccinia Virus Tiantan, the Chinese Smallpox Vaccine Strain[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Despite the worldwide eradication of smallpox in 1979, the potential bioterrorism threat from variola virus and the ongoing use of vaccinia virus (VACV) as a vector for vaccine development argue for continued research on VACV. In China, the VACV Tiantan strain (TT) was used in the smallpox eradication campaign. Its progeny strain is currently being used to develop a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine. Here we sequenced the full genomes of five TT clones isolated by plaque purification from the TT (752-1) viral stock. Phylogenetic analysis with other commonly used VACV strains showed that TT (752-1) and its clones clustered and exhibited higher sequence diversity than that found in Dryvax clones. The ∼190 kbp genomes of TT appeared to encode 273 open reading frames (ORFs). ORFs located in the middle of the genome were more conserved than those located at the two termini, where many virulence and immunomodulation associated genes reside. Several patterns of nucleotide changes including point mutations, insertions and deletions were identified. The polymorphisms in seven virulence-associated proteins and six immunomodulation-related proteins were analyzed. We also investigated the neuro- and skin- virulence of TT clones in mice and rabbits, respectively. The TT clones exhibited significantly less virulence than the New York City Board of Health (NYCBH) strain, as evidenced by less extensive weight loss and morbidity in mice as well as produced smaller skin lesions and lower incidence of putrescence in rabbits. The complete genome sequences, ORF annotations, and phenotypic diversity yielded from this study aid our understanding of the Chinese historic TT strain and are useful for HIV vaccine projects employing TT as a vector.

In infected cells, A17 is synthesized as a 23-kDa precursor of 203 amino acids and undergoes phosphorylation by viral F10 kinase (31–33) and subsequent cleavage at the " AGX " consensus motif present in both the N and C termini by viral protease I7 during maturation (Fig. 1B) (23,31,34). The processed A17 protein spans the membrane twice, and both ends of the protein are oriented toward the cytoplasm in the infected cells (35, 36). Vaccinia Viral Protein A27 Is Anchored to the Viral Membrane via a Cooperative Interaction with Viral Membrane Protein A17[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: The vaccinia viral protein A27 in mature viruses specifically interacts with heparan sulfate for cell surface attachment.
In addition, A27 associates with the viral membrane protein A17 to anchor to the viral membrane; however, the specific interaction
between A27 and A17 remains largely unclear. To uncover the active binding sites and the underlying binding mechanism, we
expressed and purified the N-terminal (18–50 residues) and C-terminal (162–203 residues) fragments of A17, which are denoted
A17-N and A17-C. Through surface plasmon resonance, the binding affinity of A27/A17-N (KA = 3.40 × 108 m−1) was determined to be approximately 3 orders of magnitude stronger than that of A27/A17-C (KA = 3.40 × 105 m−1), indicating that A27 prefers to interact with A17-N rather than A17-C. Despite the disordered nature of A17-N, the A27-A17
interaction is mediated by a specific and cooperative binding mechanism that includes two active binding sites, namely 32SFMPK36 (denoted as F1 binding) and 20LDKDLFTEEQ29 (F2). Further analysis showed that F1 has stronger binding affinity and is more resistant to acidic conditions than is F2.
Furthermore, A27 mutant proteins that retained partial activity to interact with the F1 and F2 sites of the A17 protein were
packaged into mature virus particles at a reduced level, demonstrating that the F1/F2 interaction plays a critical role in vivo. Using these results in combination with site-directed mutagenesis data, we established a computer model to explain the specific
A27-A17 binding mechanism.

The Fast CAT assay kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene , OR, USA) was used to detect acetylated Cm products [15,16]. 55 Wl of cell extract containing 1 Wg of protein were mixed with 15 Wl of £uorescent BODIPY FL chloramphenicol substrate and incubated at 37³C for 5 min. Characterisation of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase determinant found in the chromosome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: The open reading frame (ORF) in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa chromosome, whose product resembles the chloramphenicol acetyltransferases (CAT) belonging to the CATB family, was cloned and shown to confer resistance to chloramphenicol (Cm) in Escherichia coli. The determinant was therefore named catB7 and the corresponding protein CATB7. When the copy number and expression signals were identical, the catB7 gene conferred resistance to Cm at a level slightly lower than those of three other catB genes. CATB7 resembles other CATBs in that it acetylates Cm but not 1-acetoxy-Cm. For CATB7, the K(m) values for acetyl-CoA and Cm were 5.0-5.4-fold higher than the corresponding values for each of the three other CATB proteins (CATB1, CATB3 and CATB5) examined and the Vmax was 5-6 fold lower. Using PCR, the catB7 gene was found in all six P. aeruginosa strains examined but not in any other species of pseudomonad tested. Weak CAT activity was detected in crude cell extracts from five of the six P. aeruginosa strains. However, this activity did not correlate with the Cm susceptibility of the strains, indicating that catB7 is not likely to be the major determinant of intrinsic Cm resistance in P. aeruginosa.

These enzymes belong to the type II class of TKs and are closely related to the human cellular cytosolic TK (TK1) [36,37]. Like the host kinase, these homotetrameric enzymes phosphorylate a rather narrow range of substrates and are allosterically regulated by both thymidine diphosphate and thymidine triphosphate (dTTP) [38,39]. Antiviral Activity of 4′-thioIDU and Thymidine Analogs against Orthopoxviruses[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: The search for effective therapies for orthopoxvirus infections has identified diverse classes of molecules with antiviral activity. Pyrimidine analogs, such as 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (idoxuridine, IDU) were among the first compounds identified with antiviral activity against a number of orthopoxviruses and have been reported to be active both in vitro and in animal models of infection. More recently, additional analogs have been reported to have improved antiviral activity against orthopoxviruses including several derivatives of deoxyuridine with large substituents in the 5 position, as well as analogs with modifications in the deoxyribose moiety including (north)-methanocarbathymidine, and 5-iodo-4'-thio-2'-deoxyuridine (4'-thioIDU). The latter molecule has proven to have good antiviral activity against the orthopoxviruses both in vitro and in vivo and has the potential to be an effective therapy in humans.

The CAT reporter is widely used because transcription levels of CAT correspond well with enzymatic activity (Hruby et al., 1990).

Cyclic nucleotide kinases and tachyzoite–bradyzoite transition in Toxoplasma gondii[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: The ability of Toxoplasma gondii to cycle between the tachyzoite and bradyzoite life stages in intermediate hosts is key to parasite survival and the pathogenesis of toxoplasmosis. Studies from a number of laboratories indicate that differentiation in T. gondii is a stress-induced phenomenon. The signalling pathways or molecular mechanisms that control formation of the latent bradyzoite stage are unknown and specific effectors of differentiation have not been identified. We engineered a reporter parasite to facilitate simultaneous comparison of differentiation and replication after various treatments. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), expressed constitutively from the alpha-tubulin promoter (TUB1), was used to quantitate parasite number. beta-galactosidase (beta-GAL), expressed from a bradyzoite specific promoter (BAG1), was used as a measure of bradyzoite gene expression. Sodium nitroprusside, a well-known inducer of bradyzoite differentiation, reduced reporter parasite replication and caused bradyzoite differentiation. Stress-induced differentiation in many other pathogens is regulated by cyclic nucleotide kinases. Specific inhibitors of the cAMP dependent protein kinase and apicomplexan cGMP dependent protein kinase inhibited replication and induced differentiation. The beta-GAL/CAT reporter parasite provides a method to quantify and compare agents that cause differentiation in T. gondii. Full-text · Article · Feb 2006 Michael S. EatonLouis WeissKami KimRead full-textEarly attempts at identifying the cellular source of the double-membrane that envelopes MVs established that brefeldin A abrogates the production of EVs without impacting MV production. As brefeldin A inhibits the formation of COPI vesicles thereby resulting in the collapse of the Golgi into the endoplasmic reticulum, it was concluded that the Golgi or a post-Golgi compartment was involved in MV wrapping [98]. EM studies support the involvement of the trans-Golgi network (TGN), as WV membranes contain glycoprotein and glycolipid sugars which are only added in the late TGN [52]. Cloak and Dagger: Alternative Immune Evasion and Modulation Strategies of Poxviruses[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: As all viruses rely on cellular factors throughout their replication cycle, to be successful they must evolve strategies to evade and/or manipulate the defence mechanisms employed by the host cell. In addition to their expression of a wide array of host modulatory factors, several recent studies have suggested that poxviruses may have evolved unique mechanisms to shunt or evade host detection. These potential mechanisms include mimicry of apoptotic bodies by mature virions (MVs), the use of viral sub-structures termed lateral bodies for the packaging and delivery of host modulators, and the formation of a second, " cloaked " form of infectious extracellular virus (EVs). Here we discuss these various strategies and how they may facilitate poxvirus immune evasion. Finally we propose a model for the exploitation of the cellular exosome pathway for the formation of EVs. Full-text · Article · Aug 2015 Susanna BidgoodJason MercerRead full-textN-myristoylation is an irreversible protein modification that occurs co-translationally in eukaryotes and their viruses and promotes weak and reversible protein–membrane and protein–protein interactions (Farazi et al., 2001). Although myristoylation is required for the replication of retroviruses (Göttlinger et al., 1989), poxviruses (Ravanello et al., 1993; Hruby, 1994a, 1994b), herpesviruses (Harper et al., 1993), arenaviruses (Perez et al., 2004), geminiviruses (Fondong et al., 2007), picornaviruses (Goodwin et al., 2009), and reoviruses (Chandran et al., 2002), viruses, with the likely exception of entomopoxvirus, do not encode myristoyltransferases, but rely on cellular enzymes. Myristoylation occurs on the penultimate G residue of proteins bearing the consensus sequence (NH 2 -M-G-(X) 3 -[S/T/A]-COOH) and may play a role in either virion assembly, virion entry or both. Frog virus 3 ORF 53R, a putative myristoylated membrane protein, is essential for virus replication in vitro[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Although previous work identified 12 complementation groups with possible roles in virus assembly, currently only one frog virus 3 protein, the major capsid protein (MCP), has been linked with virion formation. To identify other proteins required for assembly, we used an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide to target 53R, a putative myristoylated membrane protein, and showed that treatment resulted in marked reductions in 53R levels and a 60% drop in virus titers. Immunofluorescence assays confirmed knock down and showed that 53R was found primarily within viral assembly sites, whereas transmission electron microscopy detected fewer mature virions and, in some cells, dense granular bodies that may represent unencapsidated DNA-protein complexes. Treatment with a myristoylation inhibitor (2-hydroxymyristic acid) resulted in an 80% reduction in viral titers. Collectively, these data indicate that 53R is an essential viral protein that is required for replication in vitro and suggest it plays a critical role in virion formation.

Interestingly, vaccinia virus encodes dNTP biosynthetic enzymatic activities such as thymidine kinase and ribonucleotide reductase to increase dNTP levels in infected cells[131,132]. Mutant vaccinia that did not contain thymidine kinase was more sensitive to SAMHD1-mediated restriction, and infected cells displayed lower dNTP levels than those infected with wild-type virus, indicating that SAMHD1 triphosphohydrolase activity mediated restriction[130]. Overall, these studies demonstrate that SAMHD1 host restriction extends beyond human retroviruses and includes the capacity to inhibit a broad range of viruses. SAMHD1 Host Restriction Factor: A Link with Innate Immune Sensing of Retrovirus Infection[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: SAMHD1 is the most recent addition to a unique group of host restriction factors that limit retroviral replication at distinct stages of the viral life cycle. SAMHD1 is a deoxynucleoside triphosphate triphosphohydrolase that degrades the intracellular pool of deoxynucleoside triphosphates available during early reverse transcription. SAMHD1 activity is blocked by the Vpx accessory function present in HIV-2 and SIVsm. Mutations in SAMHD1 are associated with the autoimmune disorder Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, thus emphasizing its role in regulation of the immune response. SAMHD1 anti-retroviral activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, cell-cycle dependent functions and cytokine-mediated changes. Innate receptors that sense retroviral DNA intermediates are the focus of intense study, and recent studies have established a link between SAMHD1 restriction, innate sensing of DNA and protective immune responses. Cell-cycle dependent regulation of SAMHD1 by phosphorylation and the increasingly broad range of viruses inhibited by SAMHD1 further emphasize the importance of these mechanisms of host restriction. This review highlights current knowledge regarding SAMHD1 regulation and its impact on innate immune signalling and retroviral restriction.

Vaccinia virus and its derivatives are the most frequently used virus vaccines (Moss, 1991; Ulaeto and Hruby, 1994); however in the last years, these vectors have been progressively replaced by other poxviruses, such as canary and fowl pox viruses, and by adenoviruses (Beukema et al., 2006; Karkhanis and Ross, 2007; Patterson and Robert-Guroff, 2008). The live bacterial vectors are either based on attenuated pathogens or on non-pathogenic bacteria (Daudel et al., 2007; Wells and Mercenier, 2008) ( > Table 29.1). Development of Mucosal Vaccines Based on Lactic Acid Bacteria[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Today, sufficient data are available to support the use of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), notably lactococci and lactobacilli, as delivery vehicles for the development of new mucosal vaccines. These non-pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria have been safely consumed by humans for centuries in fermented foods. They thus constitute an attractive alternative to the attenuated pathogens (most popular live vectors actually studied) which could recover their pathogenic potential and are thus not totally safe for use in humans. This chapter reviews the current research and advances in the use of LAB as live delivery vectors of proteins of interest for the development of new safe mucosal vaccines. The use of LAB as DNA vaccine vehicles to deliver DNA directly to antigen-presenting cells of the immune system is also discussed.

They are the gene products of A10L (p4a), A3L (p4b), L4R (p25K), A17L (p21K), G7L, and A12L (p17K)123456. Extensive studies of these proteins have provided more specific mechanisms of VV proteolysis in terms of the transformation of immature virions (IV) into intracellular mature virions (IMV). One of the VV major core proteins, A10L has been shown to be essential in virus replication and its absence in virus assembly resulted in defective virus morphology such as IV-like particles, which lacked granular viral materials and consequently produced the irregular-shaped virus parti- cles [7]. Vaccinia virus AI2L protein and its AG/A proteolysis play an important role in viral morphogenic transition[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Like the major vaccinia virus (VV) core protein precursors, p4b and p25K, the 25 kDa VV A12L late gene product (p17K) is proteolytically maturated at the conserved Ala-Gly-Ala motif. However, the association of the precursor and its cleavage product with the core of mature virion suggests that both of the A12L proteins may be required for virus assembly. Here, in order to test the requirement of the A12L protein and its proteolysis in viral replication, a conditional lethal mutant virus (vvtetOA12L) was constructed to regulate A12L expression by the presence or absence of an inducer, tetracycline. In the absence of tetracycline, replication of vvtetOA12L was inhibited by 80% and this inhibition could be overcome by transient expression of the wild-type copy of the A12L gene. In contrast, mutation of the AG/A site abrogated the ability of the transfected A12L gene to rescue, indicating that A12L proteolysis plays an important role in viral replication. Electron microscopy analysis of the A12L deficient virus demonstrated the aberrant virus particles, which were displayed by the AG/A site mutation. Thus, we concluded that the not only A12L protein but also its cleavage processing plays an essential role in virus morphogenic transition.

                           Smallpox virus is considered one of the most significant threats for use as a biowarfare agent. Due to complications from
                              vaccination, mass immunization of the populace is contra-indicated. Our current research seeks to develop effective anti-poxvirus
                              drug(s). Using vaccinia virus (VV) as a model system, the goal of our currently funded work is to determine whether the 17L
                              cysteine proteinase or the 17L metalloproteinase encoded by VV is the pox virus core protein proteinase (vCPP) that is essential
                              for viral maturation and production of infectious progeny. We have recently demonstrated that the 17L cysteine proteinase
                              is the vCPP (Byrd et al., 2002) and will continue to study the role of this enzyme during virus growth. Given this information
                              however, we are also positioned to launch a concerted effort to identify and develop 17L inhibitors as candidate antiviral
                              drugs. The specific goals of the experiments outlined in this report are to: 1) Over-express and purify enzymatically-active
                              17L proteins; 2) Develop both biochemical and tissue culture assays to measure 17L activity; 3) Utilize a combination of rational
                              drug design and high throughput screening procedures to identify potential 17L inhibitors; and 4) To test candidate inhibitors
                              for their ability to inhibit poxvirus replication in infected cells and appropriate animal models. Successful completion of
                              these experiments will identify 17L inhibitors that can be advanced into pre-clinical and clinical development as antiviral
                              drugs. Such drugs will be an essential addition to our pharmaceutical armamentarium against the deliberate or accidental introduction
                              of a pathogenic poxvirus into our environment in order to protect members of the armed forces or the general populace

Evaluation of Orally Delivered ST-246 as Postexposure Prophylactic and Antiviral Therapeutic in an Aerosolized Rabbitpox Rabbit

                           Orthopoxviruses, such as variola and monkeypox viruses, can cause severe disease in humans when delivered by the aerosol route,
                              and thus represent significant threats to both military and civilian populations. Currently, there are no antiviral therapies
                              approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat smallpox or monkeypox infection. In this study, we showed
                              that administration of the antiviral compound ST-246 to rabbits by oral gavage, once daily for 14 days beginning 1h postexposure
                              (p.e.), resulted in 100% survival in a lethal aerosolized rabbitpox model used as a surrogate for smallpox. Furthermore, efficacy
                              of delayed treatment with ST-246 was evaluated by beginning treatment on days 1, 2, 3, and 4 p.e. Although a limited number
                              of rabbits showed less severe signs of the rabbitpox disease from the day 1 and day 2 p.e. treatment groups, their illness
                              resolved very quickly, and the survival rates for these group of rabbits were 88% and 100%, respectively. But when the treatment
                              was started on days 3 or 4 p.e., survival was 67% and 33%, respectively. This work suggests that ST-246 is a very potent antiviral
                              compound against aerosolized rabbitpox in rabbits and should be investigated for further development for all orthopoxvirus
                              diseases

              Abstract




Smallpox virus and/or genetically-engineered orthopoxvimses are considered one of the most significant threats for malevolent use as potential agents of bioterrorism. Because smallpox was eliminated from the U.S. population in the 1960's, prophylactic immunization was discontinued. The subsequent 40 years have produced a population that is immunologically naive and highly susceptible to orthopoxvirus infection. Due to the small but significant risk of serious complications from vaccination, mass immunization of the populace is contra-indicated. 'Therefore, the focus of the experiments outlined in this proposal is to develop an effective anti-poxvirus drug for use in treating or preventing human disease caused by pathogenic poxviruses. The target of our antiviral drug development efforts will be the poxvirus proteinase responsible for core protein maturation, a step which is absolutely essential for the production and spread of infectious virions. This project will be carried out as a partnership between an academic group at Oregon State University with a long history of research in various aspects of poxvirus proteolysis, and a biopharmaceutical company, SIGA Research Laboratories, which is actively engaged in the development of proteinase inhibitors as anti- infectives. Together, these groups will identify' the viral gene product responsible for catalyzing core protein maturation and use genetic approaches to validate it as an antiviral target. Expression vector technology will be used to express and purify the large quantities of the core protein proteinase. The purified proteinase will serve as the starting material for a two-pronged approach to the identification of potential inhibitors: l) Structure-function analysis coupled with rational drug design; and 2) Development of an in vitro cleavage assay appropriate for use in high-throughput screening against limited libraries of potential proteinase inhibitors. Lead compounds identified by either approach will be tested for the ability to inhibit the replication of various orthopoxviruses in tissue culture cells. If necessary, lead compounds will be subjected to iterative chemistry to improve bioavailability, specificity and potency. The most promising optimized lead compound(s) will then be selected and advanced into preclinical and toxicology studies in preparation for in vivo testing in a murine and1or primate challenge in collaboration with NIAID and USAMRIID investigators. It is anticipated that the results of these experiments will identify one or more antiviral drugs as development candidates to provide a rapid-response defense against the deliberate introduction of a pathogenic poxvirus into the environment. An event which we all hope never transpires, but for which preparation is vital.

              Abstract




Viruses provide a novel and powerful paradigm for the experimental examination of eukaryotic posttranslational regulatory mechanisms. Unique amongst the DNA viruses, the poxviruses complete their replicative cycle entirely within the cytoplasmic compartment of infected cells. Virion assembly is complicated by the fact that poxviruses produce several different infectious forms (IMV, intracellular mature virus; IEV, intracellular enveloped virus; CEV, cell-associated enveloped virus; and EEV, extracellular enveloped virus) all of which may play distinct roles in vivo. The structure and protein composition of the poxvirus virion also appears to dictate whether it is able to productively interact with the cytoskeleton of the infected cell in order to effect it's propulsion by polymerizing actin rockets and subsequent egress from the infected cell. Thus, in order to productively replicate, poxviruses must be able to -express, activate, localize and concentrate their numerous (>250) encoded gene products at the correct intracellular sites to support viral transcription, replication of the viral genome and the assembly of infectious progeny virions. To help direct viral protein traffic, poxviruses such as vaccinia virus (VV) have adopted many of the same protein modification, activation and targeting pathways used by their cellular hosts including glycosylation, phosphorylation, proteolytic processing and, in particular, acylation. Remarkably, our laboratory has discovered that VV encodes at least a dozen acylproteins modified either by palmitylation or myristylation. The previous grant period was primarily spent completing an identification of the palmitylated VV gene products and demonstrating that these proteins require this posttranslational modification in order to functionally participate in acquisition of the IEV envelope. In the experiments detailed for the upcoming grant period, we propose to shift our focus to the VV myristylproteins. Myristylation is a particularly interesting modification as it can occur in two different forms (typical N-terminal myristylation and atypical internal myristylation) conferring a number of different phenotypic properties to the modified protein, including membrane affinity, protein multimerization, enzyme activity, and a reversible regulatory switch. A detailed structure-function analysis of the VV myristylproteins encoded by the L1R, Al 6L, G9R, E7R and A25L genes will be undertaken with the dual goals of (i) understanding the biochemistry and functional significance of the myristyl modification, and (ii) elucidation of the biological function of the encoded gene product and what role it plays in the viral replicative cycle. The results of these experiments should extend our knowledge of the VV replicative process and enhance our understanding of the biology of acylproteins in general.
