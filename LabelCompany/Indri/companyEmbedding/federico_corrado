CRITIC REVIEWS:�Anticipation is always great for new Opera Rara releases, because the mixture of excellent studio conditions and superb packaging always makes for a luxury product. On top of that, we get to know interesting works from a fascinating period of music history � ones which have fallen by the wayside, either because of poor librettos, difficult performance conditions at the premiere or a negative critical reception.This new CD, Federico Ricci's CORRADO D'ALTAMURA, is no exception:  it's beautifully produced and contains excellent playing and some high-quality singing. And for sure, the work deserves reconsideration � so much so that one wishes that Opera Rara could give the piece a complete recording rather than just highlights (though the whole libretto is included in the lavish booklet). We're told that this piece was a favourite of Patric Schmid, the late Artistic Director and former driving force of Opera Rara, and it's to him that the recording is dedicated.One can see why he liked the opera so much. Ricci had written six operas when he came to compose CORRADO, but he was still struggling to establish himself as a writer of opere serie. The failure of UN DUELLO SOTTO RICHELIEU in 1839 upset the composer so much that he fell silent for two years, returning to the fray only in 1841 with MICHELANGELO E ROLLA (notable for featuring Verdi's future wife, Giuseppina Streponi, in the lead female role). La Scala was then captivated later in the year with CORRADO, putting Ricci on the map with the critics.The work's serious tone is indeed striking, from the dark, grave prelude to the spellbinding final scene. Ricci is capable of great complexity, including the interweaving of the voices with different instrumental lines in the orchestra and sophisticated large-scale structures. Jeremy Commons notes in his liner essay that the choice of ostinato figures in Ricci's score is unusually nuanced, as well as a sense of the theatrical. Listen to the trumpet blares, trombone scales and cymbal crashes at the start of the first-act finale to witness a composer with a forward-thinking attitude to vivid opera orchestration. There is such promise in the work that it's a shame that Ricci did not take his career further; all but one of his remaining operas, it seems, was unsuccessful at his premiere, and as we know, his works have all but sunk into oblivion.Top marks here to Roland Bo�r and the Philharmonia Orchestra for providing a near-ideal accompaniment in this recording. There's such vitality about the playing that one would imagine the orchestra had the theatre in its blood, rather than spending most of its time in the concert hall. Boer's tempo choices tend to be sprightly but never rushed, and he breathes with his singers.�- Dominic McHugh�Frederico Ricci's CORRADO D'ALTAMURA is a dramma lirico that opened at La Scala in 1841. Set in 12th-century Sicily, the highly dramatic plot tells of betrayal and then revenge between Roggero, the Duke of Agrigento and his former friend and tutor, Corrado, to whose daughter, Delizia, Roggero has promised marriage - only to break his vows. The great expert in 19th-century Italian opera Julian Budden thought Ricci's serious works, �are worthy to stand beside Mercadante's�.  This is the sixth opera in the Essential Opera Rara series and, once again, a vivid impression of the work is captured on a single disc, accompanied by a complete libretto and article by the eminent 19th century musical scholar, Jeremy Commons.�- THE GUARDIAN�Ricci's orchestral writing is remarkably original, and he has a fine sense of theatre. The closing scene, in which Delizia, now a nun, denies Roggero sanctuary in her convent and hands him over to a bloodthirsty lynch mob, has considerable power.�- GRAMOPHONE�The tenor here is the young, clear-voiced and stylish Dmitry Korchak. Corrado is James Westman, a baritone well supplied with high A-flats for his cabaletta and with a well placed voice sometimes recalling Sherrill Milnes.... Dimitra Theodossiou...has a comparably strong dramatic instinct. ...the voice is well contrasted with the lighter soprano of Cora Burggraaf who plays Margarita, the �other woman�... Good work by orchestra and chorus under Roland B�er, who shows a sure feeling for the style.�- Zillah Dorset Akron

Apartment In The "eternal City" Designed By Federico Corrado | GoPillar















 





















Federico Corrado

Description
The project aims to realize two different cores within a single apartment: one is private and domestic and the other is to work and is more or less public.

To do this, the service areas  are placed in the centre of apartment and they are marked by dark shades and lowered ceilings. Sleeping and living area are located around this core and they have higher ceilings, lighter colors and dark oak parquet.

From the entrance, equipped with large wardrobe, you can access the living room or the study which is independent from the apartment thanks to his own bathroom, even if it were to become guests room. This room is characterized by a tailored and full-height library, which furnishes the space and distinguishes it from the hallway, where a chest is designed to contain everything you need to make guests bedroom, from airbed to blankets.

The living area is designed as an open space: the kitchen has a large island with integrated sink and snack corner, stove with design hood, fridge column and wine cooler, oven column and pantry forniture. Hidden among the forniture, there is also a column containing the sliding glass modules to divide, as required, the kitchen from the living room. 
Living room is equipped with dining table and TV area and overlooks the terraced roof that will be appropriately equipped. The balcony, which overlooks the kitchen, is really useful also to the utility room.

The master bedroom is equipped with every comfort and isolated from the rest of the apartment thanks to the services area, consisting of furnished tailored walk-in closet and bathroom. Conceived as a place to relax, the bedroom is made up of bright colors and mirrors that illuminate the room thanks to the wide windows that opens onto a second balcony. The master bathroom is instead made of darker tones and illuminated with LED lights embedded in the ceiling. Everything is thought to detail: the support surface extends and duplicates to be support for the washbasin, shelf, support for objects and seat for the shower.

Corporate Law Reforms in Europe: The Two-Tier Model and the One-Tier Model of Corporate Governance in the Italian Reform of Corporate Law

 Bocconi Legal Studies Research Paper No. 15

Date Written: January 19, 2007

Abstract
This paper explores the Italian reform of corporate governance of 2003, which, for the first time, allowed corporations to choose among three different models of governance in part inspired by foreign legal systems.   Italian corporations have three governance options. First, corporations may adopt the Italian traditional system of governance which has been modernized by the reform of corporate law. This model of governance is still the most influential and most commonly used in Italy. Besides the traditional model two other "alternative" systems of governance were created by the 2003 reform: the two-tier system and the one-tier system. The first model owes its basic structure to the German tradition, where the shareholders' meeting appoints a supervisory board, which then appoints a management board. In contrast, the one-tier model derives from the Anglo-American tradition. In this system the shareholders' meeting appoints the board of directors, which then appoints a number of directors to an audit committee entrusted with monitoring functions.   Taking into account the initial goals of the Italian legislator in designing the 2003 reform, we illustrate how the models have been implemented in Italian practice, and describe the initial predictions of their benefits and disadvantages. Then, we provide some empirical evidence of the practical consequences of the Italian reform of corporate governance three years after its enactment, and we investigate whether the predictions mentioned above were accurate.
