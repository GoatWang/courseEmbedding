The Importance of Working with a Trusted Financial Professional
A financial professional, also known as a broker, can help you achieve your goals by providing valuable insight and guidance on economic issues, the markets, specific investment and strategies. FINRA, The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, oversees the professionals and firms that sell stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other securities. We encourage you to seek out additional information on your current or prospective broker by going to BrokerCheck.

2017 Global Investment Survey | Legg Mason






























Decoding investor behavior:Bridging the disconnect between hope and reality
Perception vs Reality:Is fear driving investor behavior?
Humans vs Machines:Is technology really the silver bullet?
Youth vs Experience:Will millennials be better prepared for retirement?
U.S. Findings




























Decoding investor behavior: Bridging the disconnect between hope and reality


Scroll Down










From the Global Financial Crisis to changing technology, a diverse world of perspectives shapes the investor mindset. Their hopes and fears. Their financial dreams and realities. The trends and concerns that influence their behavior.
For the past five years, Legg Mason's groundbreaking survey has provided you with invaluable insight into investors' motivations, biases and the complex, ever-evolving landscape they must navigate.

Is the shadow of the global financial crisis still dimming investor optimism? What's missing for those turning to technology for investment decisions? Are retirement savings leaving investors short of "comfortable"?

Explore the outlook of 15,300 investors in 17 countries across Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America and the U.S. as we focus on three key themes:

Perceptions vs Reality
Humans vs Machines
Youth vs Experience












Perception vs Reality:Is fear driving investor behavior?






Nothing ventured. Nothing gained. But finding a healthy risk balance is tricky and personal for each investor. Our survey found that U.S. Investors are still substantially influenced by the shadow of the 2007-8 Financial Crisis and revealed concerning trends in how investors perceive and use risk. Even those who describe themselves as aggressive investors don’t have an asset allocation reflecting that. And their cautious investments may hinder their long-term potential for higher returns.
It is critical for investors to understand the risk profile of their investments. Here we examine the gap between perception and reality.




What is the extent of influence of the Global Financial Crisis and subsequent recession on your saving and investment decisions?

Humans vs Machines:Is technology really the silver bullet?






Technology is changing every aspect of our lives, including how we manage our finances and make investment decisions.  If human judgement takes a back seat to the increased use of online data resources, money-managing apps and products that invest our money on the basis of algorithms, the world of personal finance and investment may be fundamentally changed.
To what degree are investors ready to trust their finances to machines, and how important is the human factor in creating favorable user experiences and investment outcomes?

Youth vs Experience:Will millennials be better prepared for retirement?






Are retirement goals falling short across generations?  Baby Boomers seemed to have had it made enjoying equity and bond bull runs and benefitting from defined benefit pension schemes. For Gen Xers and Millennials who are seeking to pay off student loans and own a home, retirement saving may be even tougher.
We discovered that Boomers have many goals still unmet for comfortable retirement. Explore the reasons and remedies for this dilemma and how Gen Xers and Millennials can avoid falling into the same traps.

How Real Is The Global Retirement Crisis?
Experts worldwide are concerned that investors are under-saving for retirement, and may not be taking the risks necessary to close the gap. Are things really that dire? Our survey indicates that savings in DC plans are well behind what investors are likely to need later in life.

Boomers Not Rockin' Retirement Goals
Boomers may have reaped advantages in their youth, but a high percentage have yet to achieve basic retirement goals like being debt-free. Younger generations can learn from their experience; will have to invest differently; and act now, while time is on their side.

Retirement goal: Make sure that I am debt-free














U.S. findings







Young investors: haunted by the past
Nearly 2/3rds of U.S. investors say their decisions are still influenced by the Global Financial Crisis of 2007–8. But the impact is most severe among Millennials; almost 6 in 10 say it 'strongly' impacts their investment decisions.








Given the long shadow of the Global Financial Crisis, it is not surprising that Millennial investors are more conservative about risk than U.S. investors in general, with 85% describing themselves as either "somewhat or very conservative.”







Young, ambitious and scared: Can Millennials shed their crisis mentality?
Conventional wisdom holds that younger Americans should take advantage of the longer time horizon before retirement to increase their investments  in higher-risk asset classes like stocks.  However, U.S. Millennials don’t seem to have gotten the memo.  Our recent survey showed that on average they hold less in stocks than their elders – influenced heavily by the legacy of the Global Financial Crisis.

BACKGROUND & METHODOLOGY
The Legg Mason Global Investment Survey has been taking the pulse of investors worldwide for the past five years. Our goal is to better understand investors' hopes and fears, their financial dreams and realities, as well as what is influencing their behavior - from the Global Financial Crisis to changing technology.

Latin America (Brazil, Mexico)
Total: n=1,800High net worth: n=260


Australia
Total: n=900High net worth: n=306




This year we found investors who are:

more optimistic about investment opportunities but still impacted by the long shadow of the Global Financial Crisis;
increasingly turning to technology to help them organize their finances and make investment decisions, but who still want to know there is a human behind the machine; and
not entirely sure what they need to retire comfortably, but feel that they have not quite met their goals.

This year's survey reached 15,300 investors in 17 countries across Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and the U.S. - ensuring samples that are representative of the population of each country. Respondents are aged 18-74, have some income, are employed (unless retired) and are the sole or joint decision-maker for household investment decisions. Fieldwork was conducted through an online panel between January 12th and February 10th 2017. The high net worth criteria in the U.S. was set at $225,000+ in investable assets and individual country equivalents were set. Of the total sample, 3442 qualified as high net worth. There was also a fairly even split between the generations: 5,116 Millennials (18-35), 4,898 Gen X (36-52), 4,925 Baby Boomers (53-7).

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
