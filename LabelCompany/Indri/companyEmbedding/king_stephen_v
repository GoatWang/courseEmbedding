Stephen V (Hungarian: V. István, Croatian: Stjepan V., Slovak: Štefan V; before 18 October 1239 – 6 August 1272, Csepel Island) was King of Hungary and Croatia between 1270 and 1272, and Duke of Styria from 1258 to 1260. He was the oldest son of King Béla IV and Maria Laskarina. King Béla had his son crowned king at the age of six and appointed him Duke of Slavonia. Still a child, Stephen married Elizabeth, a daughter of a chieftain of the Cumans whom his father settled in the Great Hungarian Plain.
King Béla appointed Stephen Duke of Transylvania in 1257 and Duke of Styria in 1258. The local noblemen in Styria, which had been annexed four years before, opposed his rule. Assisted by King Ottokar II of Bohemia, they rebelled and expelled Stephen's troops from most parts of Styria. After Ottokar II routed the united army of Stephen and his father in the Battle of Kressenbrunn on 12 July 1260, Stephen left Styria and returned to Transylvania.
Stephen forced his father to cede all the lands of the Kingdom of Hungary to the east of the Danube to him and adopted the title of junior king in 1262. In two years, a civil war broke out between father and son, because Stephen accused Béla of planning to disinherit him. They concluded a peace treaty in 1266, but confidence was never restored between them. Stephen succeeded his father, who died on 3 May 1270, without difficulties, but his sister Anna and his father's closest advisors fled to the Kingdom of Bohemia. Ottokar II invaded Hungary in the spring of 1271, but Stephen routed him. In next summer, a rebellious lord captured and imprisoned Stephen's son, Ladislaus. Shortly thereafter, Stephen unexpectedly fell ill and died.

Childhood (1239–1245)[edit]




Stephen's father, King Béla IV of Hungary (from the Illuminated Chronicle)


Stephen was the eighth child and first son of King Béla IV of Hungary and his wife, Maria, a daughter of Theodore I Lascaris, Emperor of Nicaea.[1] He was born in 1239.[2] Archbishop Robert of Esztergom baptised him on 18 October.[3] The child, heir apparent from birth, was named after Saint Stephen, the first King of Hungary.[4]
Béla and his family, including Stephen, fled to Zagreb after the Mongols had annihilated the royal army in the Battle of Mohi on 11 April 1241.[5] The Mongols crossed the frozen Danube in February 1242 and the royal family ran off as far as the well-fortified Dalmatian town of Trogir.[4][6] The King and his family returned from Dalmatia after the Mongols unexpectedly withdrew from Hungary in March.[7]
Junior king[edit]
Duke of Slavonia (1245–1257)[edit]




Seal of Stephen's wife, Elizabeth the Cuman


A royal charter of 1246 mentions Stephen as "King, and Duke of Slavonia".[4] Apparently, in the previous year, Béla had his son crowned as junior king and endowed with the lands between the river Dráva and the Adriatic Sea, according to historians Gyula Kristó and Ferenc Makk.[4][8] The seven-year-old Stephen's provinces—Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia—were administered by royal governors, known as bans.[4][9]
In a letter addressed to Pope Innocent IV in the late 1240s, Béla IV wrote that "[o]n behalf of Christendom we had our son marry a Cuman girl".[10] The bride was Elizabeth, the daughter of a leader of the Cumans whom Béla had invited to settle in the plains along the river Tisza.[11][12] Elizabeth had been baptized, but ten Cuman chieftains present at the ceremony nevertheless took their customary oath upon a dog cut into two by a sword.[13]
Duke of Transylvania and Styria (1257–1260)[edit]
When Stephen attained the age of majority in 1257, his father appointed him Duke of Transylvania.[2][14] Stephen's rule in Transylvania was short-lived, because his father transferred him to Styria in 1258.[8][14] Styria had been annexed in 1254, but the local lords rose up in rebellion and expelled Béla IV's governor, Stephen Gutkeled, before Stephen's appointment.[15] Stephen and his father jointly invaded Styria and subdued the rebels.[16] In addition to Styria, Stephen also received two neighboring counties—Vas and Zala—in Hungary from his father.[16][17] He launched a plundering raid in Carinthia in the spring of 1259, in retaliation of Duke Ulrich III of Carinthia's support of the Styrian rebels.[16][18]
Stephen's rule remained unpopular in Styria. With support from King Ottokar II of Bohemia, the local lords again rebelled.[19] Stephen could preserve only Pettau (present-day Ptuj, Slovenia) and its region.[20] On 25 June 1260, Stephen crossed the river Morava to invade Ottokar's realm.[21] His military force, which consisted of Székely, Romanian and Cuman troops, routed an Austrian army.[21][22] However, in the decisive Battle of Kressenbrunn King Béla's and Stephen's united army was vanquished on 12 July, primarily because the main forces, which were under King Béla's command, arrived late.[23][22] Stephen, who commanded the advance guard, barely escaped from the battlefield.[24] The Peace of Vienna, which was signed on 31 March 1261, put an end to the conflict between Hungary and Bohemia, forcing Béla IV to renounce of Styria in favor of Ottokar II.[23]
Conflicts and civil war (1260–1270)[edit]




Baba Vida, the medieval fortress at Vidin in Bulgaria: Stephen captured it in 1261


Stephen returned to Transylvania and started to rule it for the second time after 20 August 1260.[14][23] He and his father jointly invaded Bulgaria and seized Vidin in 1261.[2] His father returned to Hungary, but Stephen continued the campaign alone.[25] He laid siege to Lom on the Danube and advanced as far as Tirnovo in pursuit of Tsar Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria.[25] However, the Tsar succeeded in avoiding any clashes with the invaders and Stephen withdrew his troops from Bulgaria by the end of the year.[25]
Stephen's relationship with Béla IV deteriorated in the early 1260s.[26] Stephen's charters reveal his fear of being disinherited and expelled by his father.[26] He also accused some unnamed barons of inciting the old monarch against him.[26] On the other hand, Stephen's charters prove that he made land grants in Bihar, Szatmár, Ugocsa, and other counties which were situated outside Transylvania.[27]




Stephen V is crowned by his father, Béla IV (from the Illuminated Chronicle)


Archbishops Philip of Esztergom and Smaragd of Kalocsa undertook to mediate after some clashes occurred between the two kings' partisans in the autumn.[28][29] According to the Peace of Pressburg, which was concluded around 25 November, Béla IV and his son divided the country and Stephen received the lands to the east of the Danube.[30] [31] When confirming the treaty on 5 December, Stephen also promised that he would not invade Slavonia which had been granted to his younger brother, Béla, by their father.[28] On this occasion, Stephen styled himself "Junior King, Duke of Transylvania and Lord of the Cumans".[30][28]
A Bulgarian nobleman, Despot Jacob Svetoslav sought assistance from Stephen after his domains, which were situated in the regions south of Vidin, were overrun by Byzantine troops in the second half of 1263.[32][33] Stephen sent reinforcements under the command of Ladislaus II Kán, Voivode of Transylvania to Bulgaria.[33] The Voivode routed the Byzantines and drove them out of Bulgaria.[34] Stephen granted Vidin to Jacob Svetoslav who accepted his suzerainty.[34]
The reconciliation of Stephen and his father was only temporary.[35] Stephen confiscated the domains of his mother and sister, Anna—including Beszterce (present-day Bistrița, Romania) and Füzér—which were located in the lands under his rule.[31] Béla IV's army crossed the Danube under Anna's command after 1 August 1264.[31][36] She besieged and took Sárospatak and seized Stephen's wife and children.[36] Voivode Ladislaus Kán turned against Stephen and led an army, which consisted of Cuman warriors, to Transylvania.[37] Stephen routed him at the fort of Déva (now Deva, Romania).[30][36] King Béla's Judge royal, Lawrence arrived at the head of a new army and forced Stephen to retreat to Feketehalom (now Codlea, Romania).[38][36] The Judge royal lay siege to the fortress, but Stephen's partisans relieved it.[38][36] Stephen launched a counter-offensive and forced his father's army to retreat.[35][39] He gained a decisive victory over his father's army in the Battle of Isaszeg in March 1265.[19][36] The two archbishops mediated a new consolidation between father and son, which confirmed the 1262 division of the country.[40] Béla and Stephen signed the peace treaty in the Convent of the Blessed Virgin on the Rabbits' Island (now Margaret Island in Budapest) on 23 March 1266.[41][35]
During the civil war in Hungary, Stephen's vassal, Despot Jacob Svetoslav submitted himself to Tsar Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria.[42] In the summer of 1266, Stephen invaded Bulgaria, seized Vidin, Pleven and other forts and routed the Bulgarians in five battles.[41][43] Jacob Svetoslav again accepted Stephen's suzerainty and was reinstalled in Vidin.[43] From then on, Stephen used the title "King of Bulgaria" in his charters.[19]
Béla and Stephen together confirmed the liberties of the "royal servants", from then on known as noblemen, in 1267.[44] A double marriage alliance between Stephen and King Charles I of Sicily—Stephen's son, Ladislaus married Charles's daughter, Elisabeth, and Charles's namesake son married Stephen's daughter, Mary—strengthened Stephen's international position in 1269.[44][45] Confidence was never restored between Béla and Stephen.[45] On his deathbed, the old King requested King Ottokar II of Bohemia to give shelter to his daughter Anna and his partisans after his death.[45][46]
Reign (1270–1272)[edit]




Kingdom of Hungary in the second half of the 13th century


The senior King died on 3 May 1270.[19] His daughter, Anna, seized the royal treasury and fled to Bohemia.[19][47] Henry Kőszegi, Nicholas Geregye, and Lawrence Aba—Béla's closest advisors—followed her and handed over Kőszeg, Borostyánkő (Bernstein, Austria) and their other castles along the western borders to Ottokar II.[19][48] Instead of leaving Hungary, Nicholas Hahót garrisoned Styrian soldiers in his fort at Pölöske, and made plundering raids against the nearby villages.[49] Stephen nominated his own partisans to the highest offices; for instance, Joachim Gutkeled became Ban of Slavonia, and Matthew Csák was appointed Voivode of Transylvania.[48] Stephen granted Esztergom County to Archbishop Philip who crowned him king in Esztergom on or after 17 May.[48][50]
The Polish chronicler Jan Długosz writes that Stephen made "a pilgrimage to the tomb of St. Stanisław"[51] in Cracow and visited his brother-in-law, Boleslaw the Chaste, Duke of Cracow at the end of August.[48] The two monarchs renewed "the old alliance between Hungary and Poland" and entered into an alliance "to have the same friends and the same enemies".[51][48] Stephen also met Ottokar II on an island of the Danube near Pressburg (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia), but they only concluded a truce.[48][47]
Stephen launched a plundering raid into Austria around 21 December.[52] King Ottokar invaded the lands north of the Danube in April 1271 and captured a number of fortresses, including Dévény (now Devín, Slovakia), Pressburg and Nagyszombat (present-day Trnava, Slovakia).[53][50] Ottokar routed Stephen at Pressburg on 9 May, and at Mosonmagyaróvár on 15 May, but Stephen won the decisive battle on the Rábca River on 21 May.[53] Ottokar withdrew from Hungary and Stephen chased his troops as far as Vienna.[53] The two kings' envoys reached an agreement in Pressburg on 2 July.[53][50] According to their treaty, Stephen promised that he would not assist Ottokar's opponents in Carinthia, and Ottokar renounced the castles he and his partisans held in Hungary.[19][53] The Hungarians soon recaptured Kőszeg, Borostyánkő and other fortresses along the western border of Hungary.[53]




Stephen's funeral crown


According to the Life of Stephen's saintly sister, Margaret, who had died on 18 May 1270,[46] Stephen was present when the first miracle attributed to her occurred on the first anniversary of her death.[54] Stephen, in fact, initiated Margaret's canonization at the Holy See in 1271.[54] In the same year, Stephen granted town privileges to the citizens of Győr.[53] He also confirmed the liberties of the Saxon "guests" in the Szepesség region (present-day Spiš, Slovakia), contributing to the development of their autonomous community.[55] On the other hand, Stephen protected the Archbishop of Esztergom's rights against the conditional nobles of the archbishopric who attempted to get rid of their obligations.[53]
Ban Joachim Gutkeled kidnapped Stephen's ten-year-old son and heir, Ladislaus and imprisoned him in the castle of Koprivnica in the summer of 1272.[19][56] Stephen besieged the fortress, but could not capture it.[56] Stephen fell ill and was taken to the Csepel Island. He died on 6 August 1272.[50] Stephen was buried near to the tomb of his sister, Margaret, in the Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits' Island.[57][58]
Family[edit]




Stephen's second daughter, Mary with her husband, Charles II of Naples and their children


Stephen's wife, Elizabeth was born around 1239, according to historian Gyula Kristó.[59] A charter of her father-in-law, Béla IV, refers to one Seyhan, a Cuman chieftain as his kinsman, implying that Seyhan was Elizabeth's father.[59][60] Stephen's first child by Elizabeth, Catherine was born around 1256.[61] She was given in marriage to Stephen Dragutin, the elder son and heir of King Stephen Uroš I of Serbia, in about 1268.[62] Her sister, Mary was born around 1257 and married the future Charles II of Naples in 1270.[63] Their grandson, Charles became King of Hungary in the first decade of the 14th century.[63]
According to historian Gyula Kristó, Stephen's third (unnamed) daughter was the wife of Despot Jacob Svetoslav.[64] Stephen's third (or fourth) daughter, Elizabeth, who was born in about 1260, became a Dominican nun in the Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits' Island.[63] She was appointed prioress in 1277, but her brother, Ladislaus, kidnapped and married her to a Czech baron, Zavis of Falkenstein, in 1288.[65][66] Stephen's youngest daughter, Anna, was born in about 1260.[64] She married Andronikos Palaiologos, son and heir of the Byzantine Emperor, Michael VIII.[64]
Stephen's first son Ladislaus was born in 1262.[67] He succeeded his father in 1272.[68] Stephen's youngest child, Andrew, was born in 1268 and died at the age of 10.[68][69]

Stephen V (Hungarian: V. István, Croatian: Stjepan V., Slovak: Štefan V; before 18 October 1239 – 6 August 1272, Csepel Island) was King of Hungary and Croatia between 1270 and 1272, and Duke of Styria from 1258 to 1260. He was the oldest son of King Béla IV and Maria Laskarina. King Béla had his son crowned king at the age of six and appointed him Duke of Slavonia. Still a child, Stephen married Elizabeth, a daughter of a chieftain of the Cumans whom his father settled in the Great Hungarian Plain.
King Béla appointed Stephen Duke of Transylvania in 1257 and Duke of Styria in 1258. The local noblemen in Styria, which had been annexed four years before, opposed his rule. Assisted by King Ottokar II of Bohemia, they rebelled and expelled Stephen's troops from most parts of Styria. After Ottokar II routed the united army of Stephen and his father in the Battle of Kressenbrunn on 12 July 1260, Stephen left Styria and returned to Transylvania.
Stephen forced his father to cede all the lands of the Kingdom of Hungary to the east of the Danube to him and adopted the title of junior king in 1262. In two years, a civil war broke out between father and son, because Stephen accused Béla of planning to disinherit him. They concluded a peace treaty in 1266, but confidence was never restored between them. Stephen succeeded his father, who died on 3 May 1270, without difficulties, but his sister Anna and his father's closest advisors fled to the Kingdom of Bohemia. Ottokar II invaded Hungary in the spring of 1271, but Stephen routed him. In next summer, a rebellious lord captured and imprisoned Stephen's son, Ladislaus. Shortly thereafter, Stephen unexpectedly fell ill and died.

Childhood (1239–1245)[edit]




Stephen's father, King Béla IV of Hungary (from the Illuminated Chronicle)


Stephen was the eighth child and first son of King Béla IV of Hungary and his wife, Maria, a daughter of Theodore I Lascaris, Emperor of Nicaea.[1] He was born in 1239.[2] Archbishop Robert of Esztergom baptised him on 18 October.[3] The child, heir apparent from birth, was named after Saint Stephen, the first King of Hungary.[4]
Béla and his family, including Stephen, fled to Zagreb after the Mongols had annihilated the royal army in the Battle of Mohi on 11 April 1241.[5] The Mongols crossed the frozen Danube in February 1242 and the royal family ran off as far as the well-fortified Dalmatian town of Trogir.[4][6] The King and his family returned from Dalmatia after the Mongols unexpectedly withdrew from Hungary in March.[7]
Junior king[edit]
Duke of Slavonia (1245–1257)[edit]




Seal of Stephen's wife, Elizabeth the Cuman


A royal charter of 1246 mentions Stephen as "King, and Duke of Slavonia".[4] Apparently, in the previous year, Béla had his son crowned as junior king and endowed with the lands between the river Dráva and the Adriatic Sea, according to historians Gyula Kristó and Ferenc Makk.[4][8] The seven-year-old Stephen's provinces—Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia—were administered by royal governors, known as bans.[4][9]
In a letter addressed to Pope Innocent IV in the late 1240s, Béla IV wrote that "[o]n behalf of Christendom we had our son marry a Cuman girl".[10] The bride was Elizabeth, the daughter of a leader of the Cumans whom Béla had invited to settle in the plains along the river Tisza.[11][12] Elizabeth had been baptized, but ten Cuman chieftains present at the ceremony nevertheless took their customary oath upon a dog cut into two by a sword.[13]
Duke of Transylvania and Styria (1257–1260)[edit]
When Stephen attained the age of majority in 1257, his father appointed him Duke of Transylvania.[2][14] Stephen's rule in Transylvania was short-lived, because his father transferred him to Styria in 1258.[8][14] Styria had been annexed in 1254, but the local lords rose up in rebellion and expelled Béla IV's governor, Stephen Gutkeled, before Stephen's appointment.[15] Stephen and his father jointly invaded Styria and subdued the rebels.[16] In addition to Styria, Stephen also received two neighboring counties—Vas and Zala—in Hungary from his father.[16][17] He launched a plundering raid in Carinthia in the spring of 1259, in retaliation of Duke Ulrich III of Carinthia's support of the Styrian rebels.[16][18]
Stephen's rule remained unpopular in Styria. With support from King Ottokar II of Bohemia, the local lords again rebelled.[19] Stephen could preserve only Pettau (present-day Ptuj, Slovenia) and its region.[20] On 25 June 1260, Stephen crossed the river Morava to invade Ottokar's realm.[21] His military force, which consisted of Székely, Romanian and Cuman troops, routed an Austrian army.[21][22] However, in the decisive Battle of Kressenbrunn King Béla's and Stephen's united army was vanquished on 12 July, primarily because the main forces, which were under King Béla's command, arrived late.[23][22] Stephen, who commanded the advance guard, barely escaped from the battlefield.[24] The Peace of Vienna, which was signed on 31 March 1261, put an end to the conflict between Hungary and Bohemia, forcing Béla IV to renounce of Styria in favor of Ottokar II.[23]
Conflicts and civil war (1260–1270)[edit]




Baba Vida, the medieval fortress at Vidin in Bulgaria: Stephen captured it in 1261


Stephen returned to Transylvania and started to rule it for the second time after 20 August 1260.[14][23] He and his father jointly invaded Bulgaria and seized Vidin in 1261.[2] His father returned to Hungary, but Stephen continued the campaign alone.[25] He laid siege to Lom on the Danube and advanced as far as Tirnovo in pursuit of Tsar Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria.[25] However, the Tsar succeeded in avoiding any clashes with the invaders and Stephen withdrew his troops from Bulgaria by the end of the year.[25]
Stephen's relationship with Béla IV deteriorated in the early 1260s.[26] Stephen's charters reveal his fear of being disinherited and expelled by his father.[26] He also accused some unnamed barons of inciting the old monarch against him.[26] On the other hand, Stephen's charters prove that he made land grants in Bihar, Szatmár, Ugocsa, and other counties which were situated outside Transylvania.[27]




Stephen V is crowned by his father, Béla IV (from the Illuminated Chronicle)


Archbishops Philip of Esztergom and Smaragd of Kalocsa undertook to mediate after some clashes occurred between the two kings' partisans in the autumn.[28][29] According to the Peace of Pressburg, which was concluded around 25 November, Béla IV and his son divided the country and Stephen received the lands to the east of the Danube.[30] [31] When confirming the treaty on 5 December, Stephen also promised that he would not invade Slavonia which had been granted to his younger brother, Béla, by their father.[28] On this occasion, Stephen styled himself "Junior King, Duke of Transylvania and Lord of the Cumans".[30][28]
A Bulgarian nobleman, Despot Jacob Svetoslav sought assistance from Stephen after his domains, which were situated in the regions south of Vidin, were overrun by Byzantine troops in the second half of 1263.[32][33] Stephen sent reinforcements under the command of Ladislaus II Kán, Voivode of Transylvania to Bulgaria.[33] The Voivode routed the Byzantines and drove them out of Bulgaria.[34] Stephen granted Vidin to Jacob Svetoslav who accepted his suzerainty.[34]
The reconciliation of Stephen and his father was only temporary.[35] Stephen confiscated the domains of his mother and sister, Anna—including Beszterce (present-day Bistrița, Romania) and Füzér—which were located in the lands under his rule.[31] Béla IV's army crossed the Danube under Anna's command after 1 August 1264.[31][36] She besieged and took Sárospatak and seized Stephen's wife and children.[36] Voivode Ladislaus Kán turned against Stephen and led an army, which consisted of Cuman warriors, to Transylvania.[37] Stephen routed him at the fort of Déva (now Deva, Romania).[30][36] King Béla's Judge royal, Lawrence arrived at the head of a new army and forced Stephen to retreat to Feketehalom (now Codlea, Romania).[38][36] The Judge royal lay siege to the fortress, but Stephen's partisans relieved it.[38][36] Stephen launched a counter-offensive and forced his father's army to retreat.[35][39] He gained a decisive victory over his father's army in the Battle of Isaszeg in March 1265.[19][36] The two archbishops mediated a new consolidation between father and son, which confirmed the 1262 division of the country.[40] Béla and Stephen signed the peace treaty in the Convent of the Blessed Virgin on the Rabbits' Island (now Margaret Island in Budapest) on 23 March 1266.[41][35]
During the civil war in Hungary, Stephen's vassal, Despot Jacob Svetoslav submitted himself to Tsar Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria.[42] In the summer of 1266, Stephen invaded Bulgaria, seized Vidin, Pleven and other forts and routed the Bulgarians in five battles.[41][43] Jacob Svetoslav again accepted Stephen's suzerainty and was reinstalled in Vidin.[43] From then on, Stephen used the title "King of Bulgaria" in his charters.[19]
Béla and Stephen together confirmed the liberties of the "royal servants", from then on known as noblemen, in 1267.[44] A double marriage alliance between Stephen and King Charles I of Sicily—Stephen's son, Ladislaus married Charles's daughter, Elisabeth, and Charles's namesake son married Stephen's daughter, Mary—strengthened Stephen's international position in 1269.[44][45] Confidence was never restored between Béla and Stephen.[45] On his deathbed, the old King requested King Ottokar II of Bohemia to give shelter to his daughter Anna and his partisans after his death.[45][46]
Reign (1270–1272)[edit]




Kingdom of Hungary in the second half of the 13th century


The senior King died on 3 May 1270.[19] His daughter, Anna, seized the royal treasury and fled to Bohemia.[19][47] Henry Kőszegi, Nicholas Geregye, and Lawrence Aba—Béla's closest advisors—followed her and handed over Kőszeg, Borostyánkő (Bernstein, Austria) and their other castles along the western borders to Ottokar II.[19][48] Instead of leaving Hungary, Nicholas Hahót garrisoned Styrian soldiers in his fort at Pölöske, and made plundering raids against the nearby villages.[49] Stephen nominated his own partisans to the highest offices; for instance, Joachim Gutkeled became Ban of Slavonia, and Matthew Csák was appointed Voivode of Transylvania.[48] Stephen granted Esztergom County to Archbishop Philip who crowned him king in Esztergom on or after 17 May.[48][50]
The Polish chronicler Jan Długosz writes that Stephen made "a pilgrimage to the tomb of St. Stanisław"[51] in Cracow and visited his brother-in-law, Boleslaw the Chaste, Duke of Cracow at the end of August.[48] The two monarchs renewed "the old alliance between Hungary and Poland" and entered into an alliance "to have the same friends and the same enemies".[51][48] Stephen also met Ottokar II on an island of the Danube near Pressburg (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia), but they only concluded a truce.[48][47]
Stephen launched a plundering raid into Austria around 21 December.[52] King Ottokar invaded the lands north of the Danube in April 1271 and captured a number of fortresses, including Dévény (now Devín, Slovakia), Pressburg and Nagyszombat (present-day Trnava, Slovakia).[53][50] Ottokar routed Stephen at Pressburg on 9 May, and at Mosonmagyaróvár on 15 May, but Stephen won the decisive battle on the Rábca River on 21 May.[53] Ottokar withdrew from Hungary and Stephen chased his troops as far as Vienna.[53] The two kings' envoys reached an agreement in Pressburg on 2 July.[53][50] According to their treaty, Stephen promised that he would not assist Ottokar's opponents in Carinthia, and Ottokar renounced the castles he and his partisans held in Hungary.[19][53] The Hungarians soon recaptured Kőszeg, Borostyánkő and other fortresses along the western border of Hungary.[53]




Stephen's funeral crown


According to the Life of Stephen's saintly sister, Margaret, who had died on 18 May 1270,[46] Stephen was present when the first miracle attributed to her occurred on the first anniversary of her death.[54] Stephen, in fact, initiated Margaret's canonization at the Holy See in 1271.[54] In the same year, Stephen granted town privileges to the citizens of Győr.[53] He also confirmed the liberties of the Saxon "guests" in the Szepesség region (present-day Spiš, Slovakia), contributing to the development of their autonomous community.[55] On the other hand, Stephen protected the Archbishop of Esztergom's rights against the conditional nobles of the archbishopric who attempted to get rid of their obligations.[53]
Ban Joachim Gutkeled kidnapped Stephen's ten-year-old son and heir, Ladislaus and imprisoned him in the castle of Koprivnica in the summer of 1272.[19][56] Stephen besieged the fortress, but could not capture it.[56] Stephen fell ill and was taken to the Csepel Island. He died on 6 August 1272.[50] Stephen was buried near to the tomb of his sister, Margaret, in the Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits' Island.[57][58]
Family[edit]




Stephen's second daughter, Mary with her husband, Charles II of Naples and their children


Stephen's wife, Elizabeth was born around 1239, according to historian Gyula Kristó.[59] A charter of her father-in-law, Béla IV, refers to one Seyhan, a Cuman chieftain as his kinsman, implying that Seyhan was Elizabeth's father.[59][60] Stephen's first child by Elizabeth, Catherine was born around 1256.[61] She was given in marriage to Stephen Dragutin, the elder son and heir of King Stephen Uroš I of Serbia, in about 1268.[62] Her sister, Mary was born around 1257 and married the future Charles II of Naples in 1270.[63] Their grandson, Charles became King of Hungary in the first decade of the 14th century.[63]
According to historian Gyula Kristó, Stephen's third (unnamed) daughter was the wife of Despot Jacob Svetoslav.[64] Stephen's third (or fourth) daughter, Elizabeth, who was born in about 1260, became a Dominican nun in the Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits' Island.[63] She was appointed prioress in 1277, but her brother, Ladislaus, kidnapped and married her to a Czech baron, Zavis of Falkenstein, in 1288.[65][66] Stephen's youngest daughter, Anna, was born in about 1260.[64] She married Andronikos Palaiologos, son and heir of the Byzantine Emperor, Michael VIII.[64]
Stephen's first son Ladislaus was born in 1262.[67] He succeeded his father in 1272.[68] Stephen's youngest child, Andrew, was born in 1268 and died at the age of 10.[68][69]

Stephen V (Hungarian: V. István, Croatian: Stjepan V., Slovak: Štefan V; before 18 October 1239 – 6 August 1272, Csepel Island) was King of Hungary and Croatia between 1270 and 1272, and Duke of Styria from 1258 to 1260. He was the oldest son of King Béla IV and Maria Laskarina. King Béla had his son crowned king at the age of six and appointed him Duke of Slavonia. Still a child, Stephen married Elizabeth, a daughter of a chieftain of the Cumans whom his father settled in the Great Hungarian Plain.
King Béla appointed Stephen Duke of Transylvania in 1257 and Duke of Styria in 1258. The local noblemen in Styria, which had been annexed four years before, opposed his rule. Assisted by King Ottokar II of Bohemia, they rebelled and expelled Stephen's troops from most parts of Styria. After Ottokar II routed the united army of Stephen and his father in the Battle of Kressenbrunn on 12 July 1260, Stephen left Styria and returned to Transylvania.
Stephen forced his father to cede all the lands of the Kingdom of Hungary to the east of the Danube to him and adopted the title of junior king in 1262. In two years, a civil war broke out between father and son, because Stephen accused Béla of planning to disinherit him. They concluded a peace treaty in 1266, but confidence was never restored between them. Stephen succeeded his father, who died on 3 May 1270, without difficulties, but his sister Anna and his father's closest advisors fled to the Kingdom of Bohemia. Ottokar II invaded Hungary in the spring of 1271, but Stephen routed him. In next summer, a rebellious lord captured and imprisoned Stephen's son, Ladislaus. Shortly thereafter, Stephen unexpectedly fell ill and died.

Childhood (1239–1245)[edit]




Stephen's father, King Béla IV of Hungary (from the Illuminated Chronicle)


Stephen was the eighth child and first son of King Béla IV of Hungary and his wife, Maria, a daughter of Theodore I Lascaris, Emperor of Nicaea.[1] He was born in 1239.[2] Archbishop Robert of Esztergom baptised him on 18 October.[3] The child, heir apparent from birth, was named after Saint Stephen, the first King of Hungary.[4]
Béla and his family, including Stephen, fled to Zagreb after the Mongols had annihilated the royal army in the Battle of Mohi on 11 April 1241.[5] The Mongols crossed the frozen Danube in February 1242 and the royal family ran off as far as the well-fortified Dalmatian town of Trogir.[4][6] The King and his family returned from Dalmatia after the Mongols unexpectedly withdrew from Hungary in March.[7]
Junior king[edit]
Duke of Slavonia (1245–1257)[edit]




Seal of Stephen's wife, Elizabeth the Cuman


A royal charter of 1246 mentions Stephen as "King, and Duke of Slavonia".[4] Apparently, in the previous year, Béla had his son crowned as junior king and endowed with the lands between the river Dráva and the Adriatic Sea, according to historians Gyula Kristó and Ferenc Makk.[4][8] The seven-year-old Stephen's provinces—Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia—were administered by royal governors, known as bans.[4][9]
In a letter addressed to Pope Innocent IV in the late 1240s, Béla IV wrote that "[o]n behalf of Christendom we had our son marry a Cuman girl".[10] The bride was Elizabeth, the daughter of a leader of the Cumans whom Béla had invited to settle in the plains along the river Tisza.[11][12] Elizabeth had been baptized, but ten Cuman chieftains present at the ceremony nevertheless took their customary oath upon a dog cut into two by a sword.[13]
Duke of Transylvania and Styria (1257–1260)[edit]
When Stephen attained the age of majority in 1257, his father appointed him Duke of Transylvania.[2][14] Stephen's rule in Transylvania was short-lived, because his father transferred him to Styria in 1258.[8][14] Styria had been annexed in 1254, but the local lords rose up in rebellion and expelled Béla IV's governor, Stephen Gutkeled, before Stephen's appointment.[15] Stephen and his father jointly invaded Styria and subdued the rebels.[16] In addition to Styria, Stephen also received two neighboring counties—Vas and Zala—in Hungary from his father.[16][17] He launched a plundering raid in Carinthia in the spring of 1259, in retaliation of Duke Ulrich III of Carinthia's support of the Styrian rebels.[16][18]
Stephen's rule remained unpopular in Styria. With support from King Ottokar II of Bohemia, the local lords again rebelled.[19] Stephen could preserve only Pettau (present-day Ptuj, Slovenia) and its region.[20] On 25 June 1260, Stephen crossed the river Morava to invade Ottokar's realm.[21] His military force, which consisted of Székely, Romanian and Cuman troops, routed an Austrian army.[21][22] However, in the decisive Battle of Kressenbrunn King Béla's and Stephen's united army was vanquished on 12 July, primarily because the main forces, which were under King Béla's command, arrived late.[23][22] Stephen, who commanded the advance guard, barely escaped from the battlefield.[24] The Peace of Vienna, which was signed on 31 March 1261, put an end to the conflict between Hungary and Bohemia, forcing Béla IV to renounce of Styria in favor of Ottokar II.[23]
Conflicts and civil war (1260–1270)[edit]




Baba Vida, the medieval fortress at Vidin in Bulgaria: Stephen captured it in 1261


Stephen returned to Transylvania and started to rule it for the second time after 20 August 1260.[14][23] He and his father jointly invaded Bulgaria and seized Vidin in 1261.[2] His father returned to Hungary, but Stephen continued the campaign alone.[25] He laid siege to Lom on the Danube and advanced as far as Tirnovo in pursuit of Tsar Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria.[25] However, the Tsar succeeded in avoiding any clashes with the invaders and Stephen withdrew his troops from Bulgaria by the end of the year.[25]
Stephen's relationship with Béla IV deteriorated in the early 1260s.[26] Stephen's charters reveal his fear of being disinherited and expelled by his father.[26] He also accused some unnamed barons of inciting the old monarch against him.[26] On the other hand, Stephen's charters prove that he made land grants in Bihar, Szatmár, Ugocsa, and other counties which were situated outside Transylvania.[27]




Stephen V is crowned by his father, Béla IV (from the Illuminated Chronicle)


Archbishops Philip of Esztergom and Smaragd of Kalocsa undertook to mediate after some clashes occurred between the two kings' partisans in the autumn.[28][29] According to the Peace of Pressburg, which was concluded around 25 November, Béla IV and his son divided the country and Stephen received the lands to the east of the Danube.[30] [31] When confirming the treaty on 5 December, Stephen also promised that he would not invade Slavonia which had been granted to his younger brother, Béla, by their father.[28] On this occasion, Stephen styled himself "Junior King, Duke of Transylvania and Lord of the Cumans".[30][28]
A Bulgarian nobleman, Despot Jacob Svetoslav sought assistance from Stephen after his domains, which were situated in the regions south of Vidin, were overrun by Byzantine troops in the second half of 1263.[32][33] Stephen sent reinforcements under the command of Ladislaus II Kán, Voivode of Transylvania to Bulgaria.[33] The Voivode routed the Byzantines and drove them out of Bulgaria.[34] Stephen granted Vidin to Jacob Svetoslav who accepted his suzerainty.[34]
The reconciliation of Stephen and his father was only temporary.[35] Stephen confiscated the domains of his mother and sister, Anna—including Beszterce (present-day Bistrița, Romania) and Füzér—which were located in the lands under his rule.[31] Béla IV's army crossed the Danube under Anna's command after 1 August 1264.[31][36] She besieged and took Sárospatak and seized Stephen's wife and children.[36] Voivode Ladislaus Kán turned against Stephen and led an army, which consisted of Cuman warriors, to Transylvania.[37] Stephen routed him at the fort of Déva (now Deva, Romania).[30][36] King Béla's Judge royal, Lawrence arrived at the head of a new army and forced Stephen to retreat to Feketehalom (now Codlea, Romania).[38][36] The Judge royal lay siege to the fortress, but Stephen's partisans relieved it.[38][36] Stephen launched a counter-offensive and forced his father's army to retreat.[35][39] He gained a decisive victory over his father's army in the Battle of Isaszeg in March 1265.[19][36] The two archbishops mediated a new consolidation between father and son, which confirmed the 1262 division of the country.[40] Béla and Stephen signed the peace treaty in the Convent of the Blessed Virgin on the Rabbits' Island (now Margaret Island in Budapest) on 23 March 1266.[41][35]
During the civil war in Hungary, Stephen's vassal, Despot Jacob Svetoslav submitted himself to Tsar Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria.[42] In the summer of 1266, Stephen invaded Bulgaria, seized Vidin, Pleven and other forts and routed the Bulgarians in five battles.[41][43] Jacob Svetoslav again accepted Stephen's suzerainty and was reinstalled in Vidin.[43] From then on, Stephen used the title "King of Bulgaria" in his charters.[19]
Béla and Stephen together confirmed the liberties of the "royal servants", from then on known as noblemen, in 1267.[44] A double marriage alliance between Stephen and King Charles I of Sicily—Stephen's son, Ladislaus married Charles's daughter, Elisabeth, and Charles's namesake son married Stephen's daughter, Mary—strengthened Stephen's international position in 1269.[44][45] Confidence was never restored between Béla and Stephen.[45] On his deathbed, the old King requested King Ottokar II of Bohemia to give shelter to his daughter Anna and his partisans after his death.[45][46]
Reign (1270–1272)[edit]




Kingdom of Hungary in the second half of the 13th century


The senior King died on 3 May 1270.[19] His daughter, Anna, seized the royal treasury and fled to Bohemia.[19][47] Henry Kőszegi, Nicholas Geregye, and Lawrence Aba—Béla's closest advisors—followed her and handed over Kőszeg, Borostyánkő (Bernstein, Austria) and their other castles along the western borders to Ottokar II.[19][48] Instead of leaving Hungary, Nicholas Hahót garrisoned Styrian soldiers in his fort at Pölöske, and made plundering raids against the nearby villages.[49] Stephen nominated his own partisans to the highest offices; for instance, Joachim Gutkeled became Ban of Slavonia, and Matthew Csák was appointed Voivode of Transylvania.[48] Stephen granted Esztergom County to Archbishop Philip who crowned him king in Esztergom on or after 17 May.[48][50]
The Polish chronicler Jan Długosz writes that Stephen made "a pilgrimage to the tomb of St. Stanisław"[51] in Cracow and visited his brother-in-law, Boleslaw the Chaste, Duke of Cracow at the end of August.[48] The two monarchs renewed "the old alliance between Hungary and Poland" and entered into an alliance "to have the same friends and the same enemies".[51][48] Stephen also met Ottokar II on an island of the Danube near Pressburg (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia), but they only concluded a truce.[48][47]
Stephen launched a plundering raid into Austria around 21 December.[52] King Ottokar invaded the lands north of the Danube in April 1271 and captured a number of fortresses, including Dévény (now Devín, Slovakia), Pressburg and Nagyszombat (present-day Trnava, Slovakia).[53][50] Ottokar routed Stephen at Pressburg on 9 May, and at Mosonmagyaróvár on 15 May, but Stephen won the decisive battle on the Rábca River on 21 May.[53] Ottokar withdrew from Hungary and Stephen chased his troops as far as Vienna.[53] The two kings' envoys reached an agreement in Pressburg on 2 July.[53][50] According to their treaty, Stephen promised that he would not assist Ottokar's opponents in Carinthia, and Ottokar renounced the castles he and his partisans held in Hungary.[19][53] The Hungarians soon recaptured Kőszeg, Borostyánkő and other fortresses along the western border of Hungary.[53]




Stephen's funeral crown


According to the Life of Stephen's saintly sister, Margaret, who had died on 18 May 1270,[46] Stephen was present when the first miracle attributed to her occurred on the first anniversary of her death.[54] Stephen, in fact, initiated Margaret's canonization at the Holy See in 1271.[54] In the same year, Stephen granted town privileges to the citizens of Győr.[53] He also confirmed the liberties of the Saxon "guests" in the Szepesség region (present-day Spiš, Slovakia), contributing to the development of their autonomous community.[55] On the other hand, Stephen protected the Archbishop of Esztergom's rights against the conditional nobles of the archbishopric who attempted to get rid of their obligations.[53]
Ban Joachim Gutkeled kidnapped Stephen's ten-year-old son and heir, Ladislaus and imprisoned him in the castle of Koprivnica in the summer of 1272.[19][56] Stephen besieged the fortress, but could not capture it.[56] Stephen fell ill and was taken to the Csepel Island. He died on 6 August 1272.[50] Stephen was buried near to the tomb of his sister, Margaret, in the Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits' Island.[57][58]
Family[edit]




Stephen's second daughter, Mary with her husband, Charles II of Naples and their children


Stephen's wife, Elizabeth was born around 1239, according to historian Gyula Kristó.[59] A charter of her father-in-law, Béla IV, refers to one Seyhan, a Cuman chieftain as his kinsman, implying that Seyhan was Elizabeth's father.[59][60] Stephen's first child by Elizabeth, Catherine was born around 1256.[61] She was given in marriage to Stephen Dragutin, the elder son and heir of King Stephen Uroš I of Serbia, in about 1268.[62] Her sister, Mary was born around 1257 and married the future Charles II of Naples in 1270.[63] Their grandson, Charles became King of Hungary in the first decade of the 14th century.[63]
According to historian Gyula Kristó, Stephen's third (unnamed) daughter was the wife of Despot Jacob Svetoslav.[64] Stephen's third (or fourth) daughter, Elizabeth, who was born in about 1260, became a Dominican nun in the Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits' Island.[63] She was appointed prioress in 1277, but her brother, Ladislaus, kidnapped and married her to a Czech baron, Zavis of Falkenstein, in 1288.[65][66] Stephen's youngest daughter, Anna, was born in about 1260.[64] She married Andronikos Palaiologos, son and heir of the Byzantine Emperor, Michael VIII.[64]
Stephen's first son Ladislaus was born in 1262.[67] He succeeded his father in 1272.[68] Stephen's youngest child, Andrew, was born in 1268 and died at the age of 10.[68][69]

Stephen V (Hungarian: V. István, Croatian: Stjepan V., Slovak: Štefan V; before 18 October 1239 – 6 August 1272, Csepel Island) was King of Hungary and Croatia between 1270 and 1272, and Duke of Styria from 1258 to 1260. He was the oldest son of King Béla IV and Maria Laskarina. King Béla had his son crowned king at the age of six and appointed him Duke of Slavonia. Still a child, Stephen married Elizabeth, a daughter of a chieftain of the Cumans whom his father settled in the Great Hungarian Plain.
King Béla appointed Stephen Duke of Transylvania in 1257 and Duke of Styria in 1258. The local noblemen in Styria, which had been annexed four years before, opposed his rule. Assisted by King Ottokar II of Bohemia, they rebelled and expelled Stephen's troops from most parts of Styria. After Ottokar II routed the united army of Stephen and his father in the Battle of Kressenbrunn on 12 July 1260, Stephen left Styria and returned to Transylvania.
Stephen forced his father to cede all the lands of the Kingdom of Hungary to the east of the Danube to him and adopted the title of junior king in 1262. In two years, a civil war broke out between father and son, because Stephen accused Béla of planning to disinherit him. They concluded a peace treaty in 1266, but confidence was never restored between them. Stephen succeeded his father, who died on 3 May 1270, without difficulties, but his sister Anna and his father's closest advisors fled to the Kingdom of Bohemia. Ottokar II invaded Hungary in the spring of 1271, but Stephen routed him. In next summer, a rebellious lord captured and imprisoned Stephen's son, Ladislaus. Shortly thereafter, Stephen unexpectedly fell ill and died.

Childhood (1239–1245)[edit]




Stephen's father, King Béla IV of Hungary (from the Illuminated Chronicle)


Stephen was the eighth child and first son of King Béla IV of Hungary and his wife, Maria, a daughter of Theodore I Lascaris, Emperor of Nicaea.[1] He was born in 1239.[2] Archbishop Robert of Esztergom baptised him on 18 October.[3] The child, heir apparent from birth, was named after Saint Stephen, the first King of Hungary.[4]
Béla and his family, including Stephen, fled to Zagreb after the Mongols had annihilated the royal army in the Battle of Mohi on 11 April 1241.[5] The Mongols crossed the frozen Danube in February 1242 and the royal family ran off as far as the well-fortified Dalmatian town of Trogir.[4][6] The King and his family returned from Dalmatia after the Mongols unexpectedly withdrew from Hungary in March.[7]
Junior king[edit]
Duke of Slavonia (1245–1257)[edit]




Seal of Stephen's wife, Elizabeth the Cuman


A royal charter of 1246 mentions Stephen as "King, and Duke of Slavonia".[4] Apparently, in the previous year, Béla had his son crowned as junior king and endowed with the lands between the river Dráva and the Adriatic Sea, according to historians Gyula Kristó and Ferenc Makk.[4][8] The seven-year-old Stephen's provinces—Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia—were administered by royal governors, known as bans.[4][9]
In a letter addressed to Pope Innocent IV in the late 1240s, Béla IV wrote that "[o]n behalf of Christendom we had our son marry a Cuman girl".[10] The bride was Elizabeth, the daughter of a leader of the Cumans whom Béla had invited to settle in the plains along the river Tisza.[11][12] Elizabeth had been baptized, but ten Cuman chieftains present at the ceremony nevertheless took their customary oath upon a dog cut into two by a sword.[13]
Duke of Transylvania and Styria (1257–1260)[edit]
When Stephen attained the age of majority in 1257, his father appointed him Duke of Transylvania.[2][14] Stephen's rule in Transylvania was short-lived, because his father transferred him to Styria in 1258.[8][14] Styria had been annexed in 1254, but the local lords rose up in rebellion and expelled Béla IV's governor, Stephen Gutkeled, before Stephen's appointment.[15] Stephen and his father jointly invaded Styria and subdued the rebels.[16] In addition to Styria, Stephen also received two neighboring counties—Vas and Zala—in Hungary from his father.[16][17] He launched a plundering raid in Carinthia in the spring of 1259, in retaliation of Duke Ulrich III of Carinthia's support of the Styrian rebels.[16][18]
Stephen's rule remained unpopular in Styria. With support from King Ottokar II of Bohemia, the local lords again rebelled.[19] Stephen could preserve only Pettau (present-day Ptuj, Slovenia) and its region.[20] On 25 June 1260, Stephen crossed the river Morava to invade Ottokar's realm.[21] His military force, which consisted of Székely, Romanian and Cuman troops, routed an Austrian army.[21][22] However, in the decisive Battle of Kressenbrunn King Béla's and Stephen's united army was vanquished on 12 July, primarily because the main forces, which were under King Béla's command, arrived late.[23][22] Stephen, who commanded the advance guard, barely escaped from the battlefield.[24] The Peace of Vienna, which was signed on 31 March 1261, put an end to the conflict between Hungary and Bohemia, forcing Béla IV to renounce of Styria in favor of Ottokar II.[23]
Conflicts and civil war (1260–1270)[edit]




Baba Vida, the medieval fortress at Vidin in Bulgaria: Stephen captured it in 1261


Stephen returned to Transylvania and started to rule it for the second time after 20 August 1260.[14][23] He and his father jointly invaded Bulgaria and seized Vidin in 1261.[2] His father returned to Hungary, but Stephen continued the campaign alone.[25] He laid siege to Lom on the Danube and advanced as far as Tirnovo in pursuit of Tsar Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria.[25] However, the Tsar succeeded in avoiding any clashes with the invaders and Stephen withdrew his troops from Bulgaria by the end of the year.[25]
Stephen's relationship with Béla IV deteriorated in the early 1260s.[26] Stephen's charters reveal his fear of being disinherited and expelled by his father.[26] He also accused some unnamed barons of inciting the old monarch against him.[26] On the other hand, Stephen's charters prove that he made land grants in Bihar, Szatmár, Ugocsa, and other counties which were situated outside Transylvania.[27]




Stephen V is crowned by his father, Béla IV (from the Illuminated Chronicle)


Archbishops Philip of Esztergom and Smaragd of Kalocsa undertook to mediate after some clashes occurred between the two kings' partisans in the autumn.[28][29] According to the Peace of Pressburg, which was concluded around 25 November, Béla IV and his son divided the country and Stephen received the lands to the east of the Danube.[30] [31] When confirming the treaty on 5 December, Stephen also promised that he would not invade Slavonia which had been granted to his younger brother, Béla, by their father.[28] On this occasion, Stephen styled himself "Junior King, Duke of Transylvania and Lord of the Cumans".[30][28]
A Bulgarian nobleman, Despot Jacob Svetoslav sought assistance from Stephen after his domains, which were situated in the regions south of Vidin, were overrun by Byzantine troops in the second half of 1263.[32][33] Stephen sent reinforcements under the command of Ladislaus II Kán, Voivode of Transylvania to Bulgaria.[33] The Voivode routed the Byzantines and drove them out of Bulgaria.[34] Stephen granted Vidin to Jacob Svetoslav who accepted his suzerainty.[34]
The reconciliation of Stephen and his father was only temporary.[35] Stephen confiscated the domains of his mother and sister, Anna—including Beszterce (present-day Bistrița, Romania) and Füzér—which were located in the lands under his rule.[31] Béla IV's army crossed the Danube under Anna's command after 1 August 1264.[31][36] She besieged and took Sárospatak and seized Stephen's wife and children.[36] Voivode Ladislaus Kán turned against Stephen and led an army, which consisted of Cuman warriors, to Transylvania.[37] Stephen routed him at the fort of Déva (now Deva, Romania).[30][36] King Béla's Judge royal, Lawrence arrived at the head of a new army and forced Stephen to retreat to Feketehalom (now Codlea, Romania).[38][36] The Judge royal lay siege to the fortress, but Stephen's partisans relieved it.[38][36] Stephen launched a counter-offensive and forced his father's army to retreat.[35][39] He gained a decisive victory over his father's army in the Battle of Isaszeg in March 1265.[19][36] The two archbishops mediated a new consolidation between father and son, which confirmed the 1262 division of the country.[40] Béla and Stephen signed the peace treaty in the Convent of the Blessed Virgin on the Rabbits' Island (now Margaret Island in Budapest) on 23 March 1266.[41][35]
During the civil war in Hungary, Stephen's vassal, Despot Jacob Svetoslav submitted himself to Tsar Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria.[42] In the summer of 1266, Stephen invaded Bulgaria, seized Vidin, Pleven and other forts and routed the Bulgarians in five battles.[41][43] Jacob Svetoslav again accepted Stephen's suzerainty and was reinstalled in Vidin.[43] From then on, Stephen used the title "King of Bulgaria" in his charters.[19]
Béla and Stephen together confirmed the liberties of the "royal servants", from then on known as noblemen, in 1267.[44] A double marriage alliance between Stephen and King Charles I of Sicily—Stephen's son, Ladislaus married Charles's daughter, Elisabeth, and Charles's namesake son married Stephen's daughter, Mary—strengthened Stephen's international position in 1269.[44][45] Confidence was never restored between Béla and Stephen.[45] On his deathbed, the old King requested King Ottokar II of Bohemia to give shelter to his daughter Anna and his partisans after his death.[45][46]
Reign (1270–1272)[edit]




Kingdom of Hungary in the second half of the 13th century


The senior King died on 3 May 1270.[19] His daughter, Anna, seized the royal treasury and fled to Bohemia.[19][47] Henry Kőszegi, Nicholas Geregye, and Lawrence Aba—Béla's closest advisors—followed her and handed over Kőszeg, Borostyánkő (Bernstein, Austria) and their other castles along the western borders to Ottokar II.[19][48] Instead of leaving Hungary, Nicholas Hahót garrisoned Styrian soldiers in his fort at Pölöske, and made plundering raids against the nearby villages.[49] Stephen nominated his own partisans to the highest offices; for instance, Joachim Gutkeled became Ban of Slavonia, and Matthew Csák was appointed Voivode of Transylvania.[48] Stephen granted Esztergom County to Archbishop Philip who crowned him king in Esztergom on or after 17 May.[48][50]
The Polish chronicler Jan Długosz writes that Stephen made "a pilgrimage to the tomb of St. Stanisław"[51] in Cracow and visited his brother-in-law, Boleslaw the Chaste, Duke of Cracow at the end of August.[48] The two monarchs renewed "the old alliance between Hungary and Poland" and entered into an alliance "to have the same friends and the same enemies".[51][48] Stephen also met Ottokar II on an island of the Danube near Pressburg (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia), but they only concluded a truce.[48][47]
Stephen launched a plundering raid into Austria around 21 December.[52] King Ottokar invaded the lands north of the Danube in April 1271 and captured a number of fortresses, including Dévény (now Devín, Slovakia), Pressburg and Nagyszombat (present-day Trnava, Slovakia).[53][50] Ottokar routed Stephen at Pressburg on 9 May, and at Mosonmagyaróvár on 15 May, but Stephen won the decisive battle on the Rábca River on 21 May.[53] Ottokar withdrew from Hungary and Stephen chased his troops as far as Vienna.[53] The two kings' envoys reached an agreement in Pressburg on 2 July.[53][50] According to their treaty, Stephen promised that he would not assist Ottokar's opponents in Carinthia, and Ottokar renounced the castles he and his partisans held in Hungary.[19][53] The Hungarians soon recaptured Kőszeg, Borostyánkő and other fortresses along the western border of Hungary.[53]




Stephen's funeral crown


According to the Life of Stephen's saintly sister, Margaret, who had died on 18 May 1270,[46] Stephen was present when the first miracle attributed to her occurred on the first anniversary of her death.[54] Stephen, in fact, initiated Margaret's canonization at the Holy See in 1271.[54] In the same year, Stephen granted town privileges to the citizens of Győr.[53] He also confirmed the liberties of the Saxon "guests" in the Szepesség region (present-day Spiš, Slovakia), contributing to the development of their autonomous community.[55] On the other hand, Stephen protected the Archbishop of Esztergom's rights against the conditional nobles of the archbishopric who attempted to get rid of their obligations.[53]
Ban Joachim Gutkeled kidnapped Stephen's ten-year-old son and heir, Ladislaus and imprisoned him in the castle of Koprivnica in the summer of 1272.[19][56] Stephen besieged the fortress, but could not capture it.[56] Stephen fell ill and was taken to the Csepel Island. He died on 6 August 1272.[50] Stephen was buried near to the tomb of his sister, Margaret, in the Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits' Island.[57][58]
Family[edit]




Stephen's second daughter, Mary with her husband, Charles II of Naples and their children


Stephen's wife, Elizabeth was born around 1239, according to historian Gyula Kristó.[59] A charter of her father-in-law, Béla IV, refers to one Seyhan, a Cuman chieftain as his kinsman, implying that Seyhan was Elizabeth's father.[59][60] Stephen's first child by Elizabeth, Catherine was born around 1256.[61] She was given in marriage to Stephen Dragutin, the elder son and heir of King Stephen Uroš I of Serbia, in about 1268.[62] Her sister, Mary was born around 1257 and married the future Charles II of Naples in 1270.[63] Their grandson, Charles became King of Hungary in the first decade of the 14th century.[63]
According to historian Gyula Kristó, Stephen's third (unnamed) daughter was the wife of Despot Jacob Svetoslav.[64] Stephen's third (or fourth) daughter, Elizabeth, who was born in about 1260, became a Dominican nun in the Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits' Island.[63] She was appointed prioress in 1277, but her brother, Ladislaus, kidnapped and married her to a Czech baron, Zavis of Falkenstein, in 1288.[65][66] Stephen's youngest daughter, Anna, was born in about 1260.[64] She married Andronikos Palaiologos, son and heir of the Byzantine Emperor, Michael VIII.[64]
Stephen's first son Ladislaus was born in 1262.[67] He succeeded his father in 1272.[68] Stephen's youngest child, Andrew, was born in 1268 and died at the age of 10.[68][69]

Stephen V (Hungarian: V. István, Croatian: Stjepan V., Slovak: Štefan V; before 18 October 1239 – 6 August 1272, Csepel Island) was King of Hungary and Croatia between 1270 and 1272, and Duke of Styria from 1258 to 1260. He was the oldest son of King Béla IV and Maria Laskarina. King Béla had his son crowned king at the age of six and appointed him Duke of Slavonia. Still a child, Stephen married Elizabeth, a daughter of a chieftain of the Cumans whom his father settled in the Great Hungarian Plain.
King Béla appointed Stephen Duke of Transylvania in 1257 and Duke of Styria in 1258. The local noblemen in Styria, which had been annexed four years before, opposed his rule. Assisted by King Ottokar II of Bohemia, they rebelled and expelled Stephen's troops from most parts of Styria. After Ottokar II routed the united army of Stephen and his father in the Battle of Kressenbrunn on 12 July 1260, Stephen left Styria and returned to Transylvania.
Stephen forced his father to cede all the lands of the Kingdom of Hungary to the east of the Danube to him and adopted the title of junior king in 1262. In two years, a civil war broke out between father and son, because Stephen accused Béla of planning to disinherit him. They concluded a peace treaty in 1266, but confidence was never restored between them. Stephen succeeded his father, who died on 3 May 1270, without difficulties, but his sister Anna and his father's closest advisors fled to the Kingdom of Bohemia. Ottokar II invaded Hungary in the spring of 1271, but Stephen routed him. In next summer, a rebellious lord captured and imprisoned Stephen's son, Ladislaus. Shortly thereafter, Stephen unexpectedly fell ill and died.

Childhood (1239–1245)[edit]




Stephen's father, King Béla IV of Hungary (from the Illuminated Chronicle)


Stephen was the eighth child and first son of King Béla IV of Hungary and his wife, Maria, a daughter of Theodore I Lascaris, Emperor of Nicaea.[1] He was born in 1239.[2] Archbishop Robert of Esztergom baptised him on 18 October.[3] The child, heir apparent from birth, was named after Saint Stephen, the first King of Hungary.[4]
Béla and his family, including Stephen, fled to Zagreb after the Mongols had annihilated the royal army in the Battle of Mohi on 11 April 1241.[5] The Mongols crossed the frozen Danube in February 1242 and the royal family ran off as far as the well-fortified Dalmatian town of Trogir.[4][6] The King and his family returned from Dalmatia after the Mongols unexpectedly withdrew from Hungary in March.[7]
Junior king[edit]
Duke of Slavonia (1245–1257)[edit]




Seal of Stephen's wife, Elizabeth the Cuman


A royal charter of 1246 mentions Stephen as "King, and Duke of Slavonia".[4] Apparently, in the previous year, Béla had his son crowned as junior king and endowed with the lands between the river Dráva and the Adriatic Sea, according to historians Gyula Kristó and Ferenc Makk.[4][8] The seven-year-old Stephen's provinces—Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia—were administered by royal governors, known as bans.[4][9]
In a letter addressed to Pope Innocent IV in the late 1240s, Béla IV wrote that "[o]n behalf of Christendom we had our son marry a Cuman girl".[10] The bride was Elizabeth, the daughter of a leader of the Cumans whom Béla had invited to settle in the plains along the river Tisza.[11][12] Elizabeth had been baptized, but ten Cuman chieftains present at the ceremony nevertheless took their customary oath upon a dog cut into two by a sword.[13]
Duke of Transylvania and Styria (1257–1260)[edit]
When Stephen attained the age of majority in 1257, his father appointed him Duke of Transylvania.[2][14] Stephen's rule in Transylvania was short-lived, because his father transferred him to Styria in 1258.[8][14] Styria had been annexed in 1254, but the local lords rose up in rebellion and expelled Béla IV's governor, Stephen Gutkeled, before Stephen's appointment.[15] Stephen and his father jointly invaded Styria and subdued the rebels.[16] In addition to Styria, Stephen also received two neighboring counties—Vas and Zala—in Hungary from his father.[16][17] He launched a plundering raid in Carinthia in the spring of 1259, in retaliation of Duke Ulrich III of Carinthia's support of the Styrian rebels.[16][18]
Stephen's rule remained unpopular in Styria. With support from King Ottokar II of Bohemia, the local lords again rebelled.[19] Stephen could preserve only Pettau (present-day Ptuj, Slovenia) and its region.[20] On 25 June 1260, Stephen crossed the river Morava to invade Ottokar's realm.[21] His military force, which consisted of Székely, Romanian and Cuman troops, routed an Austrian army.[21][22] However, in the decisive Battle of Kressenbrunn King Béla's and Stephen's united army was vanquished on 12 July, primarily because the main forces, which were under King Béla's command, arrived late.[23][22] Stephen, who commanded the advance guard, barely escaped from the battlefield.[24] The Peace of Vienna, which was signed on 31 March 1261, put an end to the conflict between Hungary and Bohemia, forcing Béla IV to renounce of Styria in favor of Ottokar II.[23]
Conflicts and civil war (1260–1270)[edit]




Baba Vida, the medieval fortress at Vidin in Bulgaria: Stephen captured it in 1261


Stephen returned to Transylvania and started to rule it for the second time after 20 August 1260.[14][23] He and his father jointly invaded Bulgaria and seized Vidin in 1261.[2] His father returned to Hungary, but Stephen continued the campaign alone.[25] He laid siege to Lom on the Danube and advanced as far as Tirnovo in pursuit of Tsar Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria.[25] However, the Tsar succeeded in avoiding any clashes with the invaders and Stephen withdrew his troops from Bulgaria by the end of the year.[25]
Stephen's relationship with Béla IV deteriorated in the early 1260s.[26] Stephen's charters reveal his fear of being disinherited and expelled by his father.[26] He also accused some unnamed barons of inciting the old monarch against him.[26] On the other hand, Stephen's charters prove that he made land grants in Bihar, Szatmár, Ugocsa, and other counties which were situated outside Transylvania.[27]




Stephen V is crowned by his father, Béla IV (from the Illuminated Chronicle)


Archbishops Philip of Esztergom and Smaragd of Kalocsa undertook to mediate after some clashes occurred between the two kings' partisans in the autumn.[28][29] According to the Peace of Pressburg, which was concluded around 25 November, Béla IV and his son divided the country and Stephen received the lands to the east of the Danube.[30] [31] When confirming the treaty on 5 December, Stephen also promised that he would not invade Slavonia which had been granted to his younger brother, Béla, by their father.[28] On this occasion, Stephen styled himself "Junior King, Duke of Transylvania and Lord of the Cumans".[30][28]
A Bulgarian nobleman, Despot Jacob Svetoslav sought assistance from Stephen after his domains, which were situated in the regions south of Vidin, were overrun by Byzantine troops in the second half of 1263.[32][33] Stephen sent reinforcements under the command of Ladislaus II Kán, Voivode of Transylvania to Bulgaria.[33] The Voivode routed the Byzantines and drove them out of Bulgaria.[34] Stephen granted Vidin to Jacob Svetoslav who accepted his suzerainty.[34]
The reconciliation of Stephen and his father was only temporary.[35] Stephen confiscated the domains of his mother and sister, Anna—including Beszterce (present-day Bistrița, Romania) and Füzér—which were located in the lands under his rule.[31] Béla IV's army crossed the Danube under Anna's command after 1 August 1264.[31][36] She besieged and took Sárospatak and seized Stephen's wife and children.[36] Voivode Ladislaus Kán turned against Stephen and led an army, which consisted of Cuman warriors, to Transylvania.[37] Stephen routed him at the fort of Déva (now Deva, Romania).[30][36] King Béla's Judge royal, Lawrence arrived at the head of a new army and forced Stephen to retreat to Feketehalom (now Codlea, Romania).[38][36] The Judge royal lay siege to the fortress, but Stephen's partisans relieved it.[38][36] Stephen launched a counter-offensive and forced his father's army to retreat.[35][39] He gained a decisive victory over his father's army in the Battle of Isaszeg in March 1265.[19][36] The two archbishops mediated a new consolidation between father and son, which confirmed the 1262 division of the country.[40] Béla and Stephen signed the peace treaty in the Convent of the Blessed Virgin on the Rabbits' Island (now Margaret Island in Budapest) on 23 March 1266.[41][35]
During the civil war in Hungary, Stephen's vassal, Despot Jacob Svetoslav submitted himself to Tsar Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria.[42] In the summer of 1266, Stephen invaded Bulgaria, seized Vidin, Pleven and other forts and routed the Bulgarians in five battles.[41][43] Jacob Svetoslav again accepted Stephen's suzerainty and was reinstalled in Vidin.[43] From then on, Stephen used the title "King of Bulgaria" in his charters.[19]
Béla and Stephen together confirmed the liberties of the "royal servants", from then on known as noblemen, in 1267.[44] A double marriage alliance between Stephen and King Charles I of Sicily—Stephen's son, Ladislaus married Charles's daughter, Elisabeth, and Charles's namesake son married Stephen's daughter, Mary—strengthened Stephen's international position in 1269.[44][45] Confidence was never restored between Béla and Stephen.[45] On his deathbed, the old King requested King Ottokar II of Bohemia to give shelter to his daughter Anna and his partisans after his death.[45][46]
Reign (1270–1272)[edit]




Kingdom of Hungary in the second half of the 13th century


The senior King died on 3 May 1270.[19] His daughter, Anna, seized the royal treasury and fled to Bohemia.[19][47] Henry Kőszegi, Nicholas Geregye, and Lawrence Aba—Béla's closest advisors—followed her and handed over Kőszeg, Borostyánkő (Bernstein, Austria) and their other castles along the western borders to Ottokar II.[19][48] Instead of leaving Hungary, Nicholas Hahót garrisoned Styrian soldiers in his fort at Pölöske, and made plundering raids against the nearby villages.[49] Stephen nominated his own partisans to the highest offices; for instance, Joachim Gutkeled became Ban of Slavonia, and Matthew Csák was appointed Voivode of Transylvania.[48] Stephen granted Esztergom County to Archbishop Philip who crowned him king in Esztergom on or after 17 May.[48][50]
The Polish chronicler Jan Długosz writes that Stephen made "a pilgrimage to the tomb of St. Stanisław"[51] in Cracow and visited his brother-in-law, Boleslaw the Chaste, Duke of Cracow at the end of August.[48] The two monarchs renewed "the old alliance between Hungary and Poland" and entered into an alliance "to have the same friends and the same enemies".[51][48] Stephen also met Ottokar II on an island of the Danube near Pressburg (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia), but they only concluded a truce.[48][47]
Stephen launched a plundering raid into Austria around 21 December.[52] King Ottokar invaded the lands north of the Danube in April 1271 and captured a number of fortresses, including Dévény (now Devín, Slovakia), Pressburg and Nagyszombat (present-day Trnava, Slovakia).[53][50] Ottokar routed Stephen at Pressburg on 9 May, and at Mosonmagyaróvár on 15 May, but Stephen won the decisive battle on the Rábca River on 21 May.[53] Ottokar withdrew from Hungary and Stephen chased his troops as far as Vienna.[53] The two kings' envoys reached an agreement in Pressburg on 2 July.[53][50] According to their treaty, Stephen promised that he would not assist Ottokar's opponents in Carinthia, and Ottokar renounced the castles he and his partisans held in Hungary.[19][53] The Hungarians soon recaptured Kőszeg, Borostyánkő and other fortresses along the western border of Hungary.[53]




Stephen's funeral crown


According to the Life of Stephen's saintly sister, Margaret, who had died on 18 May 1270,[46] Stephen was present when the first miracle attributed to her occurred on the first anniversary of her death.[54] Stephen, in fact, initiated Margaret's canonization at the Holy See in 1271.[54] In the same year, Stephen granted town privileges to the citizens of Győr.[53] He also confirmed the liberties of the Saxon "guests" in the Szepesség region (present-day Spiš, Slovakia), contributing to the development of their autonomous community.[55] On the other hand, Stephen protected the Archbishop of Esztergom's rights against the conditional nobles of the archbishopric who attempted to get rid of their obligations.[53]
Ban Joachim Gutkeled kidnapped Stephen's ten-year-old son and heir, Ladislaus and imprisoned him in the castle of Koprivnica in the summer of 1272.[19][56] Stephen besieged the fortress, but could not capture it.[56] Stephen fell ill and was taken to the Csepel Island. He died on 6 August 1272.[50] Stephen was buried near to the tomb of his sister, Margaret, in the Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits' Island.[57][58]
Family[edit]




Stephen's second daughter, Mary with her husband, Charles II of Naples and their children


Stephen's wife, Elizabeth was born around 1239, according to historian Gyula Kristó.[59] A charter of her father-in-law, Béla IV, refers to one Seyhan, a Cuman chieftain as his kinsman, implying that Seyhan was Elizabeth's father.[59][60] Stephen's first child by Elizabeth, Catherine was born around 1256.[61] She was given in marriage to Stephen Dragutin, the elder son and heir of King Stephen Uroš I of Serbia, in about 1268.[62] Her sister, Mary was born around 1257 and married the future Charles II of Naples in 1270.[63] Their grandson, Charles became King of Hungary in the first decade of the 14th century.[63]
According to historian Gyula Kristó, Stephen's third (unnamed) daughter was the wife of Despot Jacob Svetoslav.[64] Stephen's third (or fourth) daughter, Elizabeth, who was born in about 1260, became a Dominican nun in the Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits' Island.[63] She was appointed prioress in 1277, but her brother, Ladislaus, kidnapped and married her to a Czech baron, Zavis of Falkenstein, in 1288.[65][66] Stephen's youngest daughter, Anna, was born in about 1260.[64] She married Andronikos Palaiologos, son and heir of the Byzantine Emperor, Michael VIII.[64]
Stephen's first son Ladislaus was born in 1262.[67] He succeeded his father in 1272.[68] Stephen's youngest child, Andrew, was born in 1268 and died at the age of 10.[68][69]

Stephen V (Hungarian: V. István, Croatian: Stjepan V., Slovak: Štefan V; before 18 October 1239 – 6 August 1272, Csepel Island) was King of Hungary and Croatia between 1270 and 1272, and Duke of Styria from 1258 to 1260. He was the oldest son of King Béla IV and Maria Laskarina. King Béla had his son crowned king at the age of six and appointed him Duke of Slavonia. Still a child, Stephen married Elizabeth, a daughter of a chieftain of the Cumans whom his father settled in the Great Hungarian Plain.
King Béla appointed Stephen Duke of Transylvania in 1257 and Duke of Styria in 1258. The local noblemen in Styria, which had been annexed four years before, opposed his rule. Assisted by King Ottokar II of Bohemia, they rebelled and expelled Stephen's troops from most parts of Styria. After Ottokar II routed the united army of Stephen and his father in the Battle of Kressenbrunn on 12 July 1260, Stephen left Styria and returned to Transylvania.
Stephen forced his father to cede all the lands of the Kingdom of Hungary to the east of the Danube to him and adopted the title of junior king in 1262. In two years, a civil war broke out between father and son, because Stephen accused Béla of planning to disinherit him. They concluded a peace treaty in 1266, but confidence was never restored between them. Stephen succeeded his father, who died on 3 May 1270, without difficulties, but his sister Anna and his father's closest advisors fled to the Kingdom of Bohemia. Ottokar II invaded Hungary in the spring of 1271, but Stephen routed him. In next summer, a rebellious lord captured and imprisoned Stephen's son, Ladislaus. Shortly thereafter, Stephen unexpectedly fell ill and died.

Childhood (1239–1245)[edit]




Stephen's father, King Béla IV of Hungary (from the Illuminated Chronicle)


Stephen was the eighth child and first son of King Béla IV of Hungary and his wife, Maria, a daughter of Theodore I Lascaris, Emperor of Nicaea.[1] He was born in 1239.[2] Archbishop Robert of Esztergom baptised him on 18 October.[3] The child, heir apparent from birth, was named after Saint Stephen, the first King of Hungary.[4]
Béla and his family, including Stephen, fled to Zagreb after the Mongols had annihilated the royal army in the Battle of Mohi on 11 April 1241.[5] The Mongols crossed the frozen Danube in February 1242 and the royal family ran off as far as the well-fortified Dalmatian town of Trogir.[4][6] The King and his family returned from Dalmatia after the Mongols unexpectedly withdrew from Hungary in March.[7]
Junior king[edit]
Duke of Slavonia (1245–1257)[edit]




Seal of Stephen's wife, Elizabeth the Cuman


A royal charter of 1246 mentions Stephen as "King, and Duke of Slavonia".[4] Apparently, in the previous year, Béla had his son crowned as junior king and endowed with the lands between the river Dráva and the Adriatic Sea, according to historians Gyula Kristó and Ferenc Makk.[4][8] The seven-year-old Stephen's provinces—Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia—were administered by royal governors, known as bans.[4][9]
In a letter addressed to Pope Innocent IV in the late 1240s, Béla IV wrote that "[o]n behalf of Christendom we had our son marry a Cuman girl".[10] The bride was Elizabeth, the daughter of a leader of the Cumans whom Béla had invited to settle in the plains along the river Tisza.[11][12] Elizabeth had been baptized, but ten Cuman chieftains present at the ceremony nevertheless took their customary oath upon a dog cut into two by a sword.[13]
Duke of Transylvania and Styria (1257–1260)[edit]
When Stephen attained the age of majority in 1257, his father appointed him Duke of Transylvania.[2][14] Stephen's rule in Transylvania was short-lived, because his father transferred him to Styria in 1258.[8][14] Styria had been annexed in 1254, but the local lords rose up in rebellion and expelled Béla IV's governor, Stephen Gutkeled, before Stephen's appointment.[15] Stephen and his father jointly invaded Styria and subdued the rebels.[16] In addition to Styria, Stephen also received two neighboring counties—Vas and Zala—in Hungary from his father.[16][17] He launched a plundering raid in Carinthia in the spring of 1259, in retaliation of Duke Ulrich III of Carinthia's support of the Styrian rebels.[16][18]
Stephen's rule remained unpopular in Styria. With support from King Ottokar II of Bohemia, the local lords again rebelled.[19] Stephen could preserve only Pettau (present-day Ptuj, Slovenia) and its region.[20] On 25 June 1260, Stephen crossed the river Morava to invade Ottokar's realm.[21] His military force, which consisted of Székely, Romanian and Cuman troops, routed an Austrian army.[21][22] However, in the decisive Battle of Kressenbrunn King Béla's and Stephen's united army was vanquished on 12 July, primarily because the main forces, which were under King Béla's command, arrived late.[23][22] Stephen, who commanded the advance guard, barely escaped from the battlefield.[24] The Peace of Vienna, which was signed on 31 March 1261, put an end to the conflict between Hungary and Bohemia, forcing Béla IV to renounce of Styria in favor of Ottokar II.[23]
Conflicts and civil war (1260–1270)[edit]




Baba Vida, the medieval fortress at Vidin in Bulgaria: Stephen captured it in 1261


Stephen returned to Transylvania and started to rule it for the second time after 20 August 1260.[14][23] He and his father jointly invaded Bulgaria and seized Vidin in 1261.[2] His father returned to Hungary, but Stephen continued the campaign alone.[25] He laid siege to Lom on the Danube and advanced as far as Tirnovo in pursuit of Tsar Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria.[25] However, the Tsar succeeded in avoiding any clashes with the invaders and Stephen withdrew his troops from Bulgaria by the end of the year.[25]
Stephen's relationship with Béla IV deteriorated in the early 1260s.[26] Stephen's charters reveal his fear of being disinherited and expelled by his father.[26] He also accused some unnamed barons of inciting the old monarch against him.[26] On the other hand, Stephen's charters prove that he made land grants in Bihar, Szatmár, Ugocsa, and other counties which were situated outside Transylvania.[27]




Stephen V is crowned by his father, Béla IV (from the Illuminated Chronicle)


Archbishops Philip of Esztergom and Smaragd of Kalocsa undertook to mediate after some clashes occurred between the two kings' partisans in the autumn.[28][29] According to the Peace of Pressburg, which was concluded around 25 November, Béla IV and his son divided the country and Stephen received the lands to the east of the Danube.[30] [31] When confirming the treaty on 5 December, Stephen also promised that he would not invade Slavonia which had been granted to his younger brother, Béla, by their father.[28] On this occasion, Stephen styled himself "Junior King, Duke of Transylvania and Lord of the Cumans".[30][28]
A Bulgarian nobleman, Despot Jacob Svetoslav sought assistance from Stephen after his domains, which were situated in the regions south of Vidin, were overrun by Byzantine troops in the second half of 1263.[32][33] Stephen sent reinforcements under the command of Ladislaus II Kán, Voivode of Transylvania to Bulgaria.[33] The Voivode routed the Byzantines and drove them out of Bulgaria.[34] Stephen granted Vidin to Jacob Svetoslav who accepted his suzerainty.[34]
The reconciliation of Stephen and his father was only temporary.[35] Stephen confiscated the domains of his mother and sister, Anna—including Beszterce (present-day Bistrița, Romania) and Füzér—which were located in the lands under his rule.[31] Béla IV's army crossed the Danube under Anna's command after 1 August 1264.[31][36] She besieged and took Sárospatak and seized Stephen's wife and children.[36] Voivode Ladislaus Kán turned against Stephen and led an army, which consisted of Cuman warriors, to Transylvania.[37] Stephen routed him at the fort of Déva (now Deva, Romania).[30][36] King Béla's Judge royal, Lawrence arrived at the head of a new army and forced Stephen to retreat to Feketehalom (now Codlea, Romania).[38][36] The Judge royal lay siege to the fortress, but Stephen's partisans relieved it.[38][36] Stephen launched a counter-offensive and forced his father's army to retreat.[35][39] He gained a decisive victory over his father's army in the Battle of Isaszeg in March 1265.[19][36] The two archbishops mediated a new consolidation between father and son, which confirmed the 1262 division of the country.[40] Béla and Stephen signed the peace treaty in the Convent of the Blessed Virgin on the Rabbits' Island (now Margaret Island in Budapest) on 23 March 1266.[41][35]
During the civil war in Hungary, Stephen's vassal, Despot Jacob Svetoslav submitted himself to Tsar Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria.[42] In the summer of 1266, Stephen invaded Bulgaria, seized Vidin, Pleven and other forts and routed the Bulgarians in five battles.[41][43] Jacob Svetoslav again accepted Stephen's suzerainty and was reinstalled in Vidin.[43] From then on, Stephen used the title "King of Bulgaria" in his charters.[19]
Béla and Stephen together confirmed the liberties of the "royal servants", from then on known as noblemen, in 1267.[44] A double marriage alliance between Stephen and King Charles I of Sicily—Stephen's son, Ladislaus married Charles's daughter, Elisabeth, and Charles's namesake son married Stephen's daughter, Mary—strengthened Stephen's international position in 1269.[44][45] Confidence was never restored between Béla and Stephen.[45] On his deathbed, the old King requested King Ottokar II of Bohemia to give shelter to his daughter Anna and his partisans after his death.[45][46]
Reign (1270–1272)[edit]




Kingdom of Hungary in the second half of the 13th century


The senior King died on 3 May 1270.[19] His daughter, Anna, seized the royal treasury and fled to Bohemia.[19][47] Henry Kőszegi, Nicholas Geregye, and Lawrence Aba—Béla's closest advisors—followed her and handed over Kőszeg, Borostyánkő (Bernstein, Austria) and their other castles along the western borders to Ottokar II.[19][48] Instead of leaving Hungary, Nicholas Hahót garrisoned Styrian soldiers in his fort at Pölöske, and made plundering raids against the nearby villages.[49] Stephen nominated his own partisans to the highest offices; for instance, Joachim Gutkeled became Ban of Slavonia, and Matthew Csák was appointed Voivode of Transylvania.[48] Stephen granted Esztergom County to Archbishop Philip who crowned him king in Esztergom on or after 17 May.[48][50]
The Polish chronicler Jan Długosz writes that Stephen made "a pilgrimage to the tomb of St. Stanisław"[51] in Cracow and visited his brother-in-law, Boleslaw the Chaste, Duke of Cracow at the end of August.[48] The two monarchs renewed "the old alliance between Hungary and Poland" and entered into an alliance "to have the same friends and the same enemies".[51][48] Stephen also met Ottokar II on an island of the Danube near Pressburg (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia), but they only concluded a truce.[48][47]
Stephen launched a plundering raid into Austria around 21 December.[52] King Ottokar invaded the lands north of the Danube in April 1271 and captured a number of fortresses, including Dévény (now Devín, Slovakia), Pressburg and Nagyszombat (present-day Trnava, Slovakia).[53][50] Ottokar routed Stephen at Pressburg on 9 May, and at Mosonmagyaróvár on 15 May, but Stephen won the decisive battle on the Rábca River on 21 May.[53] Ottokar withdrew from Hungary and Stephen chased his troops as far as Vienna.[53] The two kings' envoys reached an agreement in Pressburg on 2 July.[53][50] According to their treaty, Stephen promised that he would not assist Ottokar's opponents in Carinthia, and Ottokar renounced the castles he and his partisans held in Hungary.[19][53] The Hungarians soon recaptured Kőszeg, Borostyánkő and other fortresses along the western border of Hungary.[53]




Stephen's funeral crown


According to the Life of Stephen's saintly sister, Margaret, who had died on 18 May 1270,[46] Stephen was present when the first miracle attributed to her occurred on the first anniversary of her death.[54] Stephen, in fact, initiated Margaret's canonization at the Holy See in 1271.[54] In the same year, Stephen granted town privileges to the citizens of Győr.[53] He also confirmed the liberties of the Saxon "guests" in the Szepesség region (present-day Spiš, Slovakia), contributing to the development of their autonomous community.[55] On the other hand, Stephen protected the Archbishop of Esztergom's rights against the conditional nobles of the archbishopric who attempted to get rid of their obligations.[53]
Ban Joachim Gutkeled kidnapped Stephen's ten-year-old son and heir, Ladislaus and imprisoned him in the castle of Koprivnica in the summer of 1272.[19][56] Stephen besieged the fortress, but could not capture it.[56] Stephen fell ill and was taken to the Csepel Island. He died on 6 August 1272.[50] Stephen was buried near to the tomb of his sister, Margaret, in the Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits' Island.[57][58]
Family[edit]




Stephen's second daughter, Mary with her husband, Charles II of Naples and their children


Stephen's wife, Elizabeth was born around 1239, according to historian Gyula Kristó.[59] A charter of her father-in-law, Béla IV, refers to one Seyhan, a Cuman chieftain as his kinsman, implying that Seyhan was Elizabeth's father.[59][60] Stephen's first child by Elizabeth, Catherine was born around 1256.[61] She was given in marriage to Stephen Dragutin, the elder son and heir of King Stephen Uroš I of Serbia, in about 1268.[62] Her sister, Mary was born around 1257 and married the future Charles II of Naples in 1270.[63] Their grandson, Charles became King of Hungary in the first decade of the 14th century.[63]
According to historian Gyula Kristó, Stephen's third (unnamed) daughter was the wife of Despot Jacob Svetoslav.[64] Stephen's third (or fourth) daughter, Elizabeth, who was born in about 1260, became a Dominican nun in the Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits' Island.[63] She was appointed prioress in 1277, but her brother, Ladislaus, kidnapped and married her to a Czech baron, Zavis of Falkenstein, in 1288.[65][66] Stephen's youngest daughter, Anna, was born in about 1260.[64] She married Andronikos Palaiologos, son and heir of the Byzantine Emperor, Michael VIII.[64]
Stephen's first son Ladislaus was born in 1262.[67] He succeeded his father in 1272.[68] Stephen's youngest child, Andrew, was born in 1268 and died at the age of 10.[68][69]

In the front row, a young man in a wheelchair was, very slowly, signing his name in a book that bore on its earliest pages the signature of Isaac Newton… Stephen Hawking was a legend even then.” In his introduction, Sagan goes on to add that Hawking is the “worthy successor” to Newton and Paul Dirac, both former Lucasian Professors of Mathematics.

Book description 





Expert coverage and new assessments of the reign of King Stephen, set in social, political and European contexts. The turbulent reign of King Stephen is here subjected to a full assessment by leading scholars in the field. All of the most important aspects are fully covered: the impact of developments under Henry I on the origins of civil war; relations with the continent, as they affected Stephen's overall strategy and the foundation of religious houses; the opportunities which lured foreign mercenaries to England; mid-twelfth century legal developments and trends in revenue-raising; baronial and episcopal allegiances; violent disorder and civil unrest; and the sequence of events which unfolded during the political crisis of July 1141. Taken together, they provide the fruits of the most recent research into and the most up to date interpretations of the intense political and military activity of the reign. CONTRIBUTORS: MARJORIE CHIBNALL, JUDITH GREEN, DAVID CROUCH, JANET BURTON, THOMAS BISSON, BRUCE O'BRIEN, GRAEME WHITE, PAUL DALTON, STEPHEN MARRITT, HUGH THOMAS, EDMUND KING.

Description
No other contemporary writer has influenced popular culture as much as the ‘King of Horror’, Stephen King. With a staggering output of short stories, novellas and novels Hollywood has been eager to adapt many of his ideas and books.
The Dark Tower is meant to be Stephen King’s ‘Lord of the Rings’ style magnum opus. It was initially published in five instalments in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction between 1978 and 1981. This is the first trade hardback copy, and King and the publisher anticipated slow sales only due to the fantasy nature of the story rather than his usual horror appeal. That is why the print run was only 10,000 copies  of which about 1,500 copies were misbound. as a comparison ‘The Shining’, and his debut novel ‘Carrie’ had a prin run of 25,000 and 30,000 respectively.
For July 2017, a movie adaptation has been announced titled ‘The Dark Tower’ starring Idris Alba and Matthew David McConaughey. This will surely boost once more interest in the already popular Dark Tower series.
A highly collectible book especially in such great condition. Michael Whelan’s King’s signature is a bonus!

5.0 out of 5 starsOlder King's writing is inflated and undisciplined with frequent unnecessary author intrusionsByHill Young J. Lamon November 3, 2016EDIT: I forgive everything. The ending was so spectacular, so real, so poignant to me I am reeling from it. I forgive all the irritations I've mentioned - this series is the best reading experience I've ever undertaken in my life.I'm a die-hard Stephen King fan. I'm the Constant Reader, the kind that would read the King's laundry list. I read all of his books many times, usually within days of release, except the Dark Tower. I thought it would be a Western-gun-type story and wasn't interested, but I finally got into it a month ago and I marveled at how I could possibly miss it - it truly is his greatest work, with a kind on-the-edge thrilling pace and steaming plot you seldom see in his horror novels. I read all seven books continuously over the past few weeks, couldn't put it down, and getting more and more disappointed. You can see how young King and old King's writing differs so greatly in both plot and language. Young King is tightly disciplined, highly structured, no unnecessary and distracting insertions that's really about the writer's ego than of service to the story. By this final book, I caught myself rolling my eyes frequently at unnecessary author intrusions to the story and plot, which is getting weirder and weirder all the time, like a bad psychedelic trip. Even the way the characters speak to each other doesn't flow with the natural ease and seamless belief in his old books, with frequent author intrusions about what Eddie or Roland or whoever is like, e.g. "...we might as well look at him a bit more closely. We won't take long, for Pimli Prentiss isn't central to our tale of Roland..."  - IS THIS NECESSARY? My good man, just tell the tale and leave the narrator out of it. Let your characters speak for themselves. By the end of Song of Susannah I could barely follow the narrative with real immersion (I skipped the entire series of journal logs by King at the end of the last book. What was that about? Totally unnecessary)That said, it's still one awesome ride. I know how much work it is to write a good book. So despite all this, the merits outweighs the faults, and it's all worth it.

1.0 out of 5 starsPoor way to end a great series.ByDeweyon January 30, 2015Really disappointing. I expected the ending from pretty much the first book but the way he takes you there is sorely lacking in Kingishness. The book felt rushed - like he "had to" finish it. Book 6 was the same way. The first 5 books took years to write because he only wrote them when he was inspired. These last 2 he forced and you can tell.

I started Book 1 about 5 months ago and Roland's journey just ended for me (several minutes ago, in fact!). You're most likely going to read horrible reviews on here, how Stephen King dropped the ball and this book is a hopeless letdown. My personal opinion of the matter is this book is quite simply the best of the entire series. The pacing, revelations, surprises, and twists absolutely never let up. From traveling under Caste Discordia to having dinner with Dandelo, I was completely enthralled from beginning to end. The last 20 pages or so of the book are your call to make what you will of how everything wraps up. Personally, it isn't how I wanted the story to end, but that in no way devalues the absolutely brilliant 99.9% of it. This series is my adult "Harry Potter" series. I will cherish these stories and will be reading Roland's journey to the tower again for you ears to come.0Comment|

Elmoreon January 18, 2017Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseEvery great writter of the past and present has their greatest work.  This book and all the rest are my favorites of all time.  I've read the classics and I by far I can say without a doubt these are my all time favorite stories and characters.  My only regret is the curtains have closed and the show is over.  If there was a way that I could implore Mr. King to write another book other than Wind through the key hole I would do it.  Please Mr. King, please write another book in this series.  The song can't be over, the rose can't have stopped talking to you.  I implore you to listen hard for the song and add to this great work.  It can't be over!0Comment|

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsDark Tower Quest SeriesByKathryn Radtkey-gaitheron June 1, 2017Format: Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase"I’ve told my tale all the way to the end, and am satisfied. It was (I set my watch and warrant on it) the kind only a good God would save for last, full of monsters and marvels and voyaging here and there."I read the first book of this series 40+ years ago.  And then life happened, much as it did for Mr. King.  But he eventually finished the quest, and I eventually picked it up again and read it in its entirety.  It was so satisfying.  Just as the lines above show us, it was a journey and it was well begun. And it was well ended. Say thank ya.Full of honor, love, good, evil, light and dark, it is the story of us all. It is the reason we love Arthur, Harry, Frodo, Luke....you get the idea.  It is the eternal quest, the great wheel of life, the great wheel of ka.Stephen and I were well met. I can't wait to meet him again in the movie.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsThe ending legitimately made me angry.ByVéronique Bellamyon March 12, 2017Format: Mass Market Paperback|Verified PurchaseWarning: there are spoilers ahead. If you want to avoid them, read just my first paragraph and the title.I love the Dark Tower series. I read through all seven books and I'm rereading the series now (and doing it with Wind through the Keyhole in its proper place between books 4 & 5). It was a book and a series that kept me riveted.... Though the ending pissed me off. I understand that there probably was no way King could have ended the story. The Dark Tower was built up so much throughout the series that it would have taken something spectacular to live up to it... Really, anything would have been a letdown. The ending was cheap, but as far as letdowns go, this made me angry. Legitimately angry.But how else was it supposed to end? Life isn't always accompanied by a happy ending. Life isn't always a field of roses. I think, too often, we don't appreciate this and instead prefer to have sunshine blown up our butts 24/7. The ending is sad, it's gritty and while there is hope, one can't finish the book without saying, "WTF, King?"0Comment|

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsThe Beginning of the EndByAmazon Queenon March 4, 2014Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseWhen I first read this last installment of the Dark Tower series, I absolutely raged at the ending. I had a fit, complete with nasty words and a hurled book. I waited all these years for this?! But...This series has ever lured me in, starting 22 years ago or so, when I was 12 and first read the Gunslinger. I have read the series countless times, the connections between stories and characters that I have loved and this world are a source of endless fascination for me. I always seem to stumble upon someone or something that I had thought was lost from another story--or another world, if you like that better. This series makes you feel as though nothing really is ever finished or lost forever. There is always another door, or hope.Throughout the years, Stephen King has alluded to feeling driven by this story, compelled, that it won't be ignored. Afterwords and Introductions refer to this feeling over and over again. It makes you wonder really, how wonderful and terrible if that is the case. As a reader it's easy to say "yeah yeah, I'm sure it's a real burden, but what happens next? Because YOU are Gan so cough it up." Likely with an unfriendly poke. But really think about that for a minute, if a story could burn and demand and keep you awake in the Dark hours of the night.  I don't know about anyone else, but that might just drive me out of my ever-loving mind. And if ever there was a tale that would demand, it is this one.Spoiler alertIn regards to the deaths of the ka-tet, well, we all knew it was coming. Eddie's death was the first, but sent the flare that the tet was broken, the job they were drawn for done. When he died, we knew that they were all fair game. It seems unfair that he had suffered so much only to be the first to fall, and in such a crappy way. A moment of inattention, and then the end. To lose Jake again was hard, harder than I had imagined. When he was sacrificed under the Mountains, we had barely come to know him. So while it was a lousy way to go, it was easier to bear than his last death, after we had stood with him for so many miles.  And Oy? His death had been foreseen in the glass back in book 4, but still a hard blow. You were almost glad for him though, Oy was ready to move on, to find Jake.As to the end....well... Yes from a reader's point of view, that was a major bummer. We all want to see sacrifice rewarded, a happy ending, a circle closed. So I had my tantrum and stomped my feet. Then went back and read it again....and again. In the reading, I started to wonder. The quest for the Tower maybe wasn't about letting your friends fall, but about falling for them. In that respect, Roland failed miserably.  From Hax the cook all the way to Oy he allowed his friends to fall on his quest for the Tower. When he climbs the stairs he thinks that the Tower is a Tower of death. And the Tower replies that it is because Roland's life has made it so.We as readers are left with another door, though. The horn that hangs at Roland's belt tells us that maybe, just maybe, he'll get it right this time around.0Comment|

Marshallon April 22, 2014Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchasePart of The Dark Tower Series by Stephen King.Highly Recommended!!!!!!! Too bad I could not give 10 stars.#1 The Gunslinger - Introduction to the last Gunslinger, Roland. This book was wonderful. It introduces you to some of the characters of the series and gives you the Gunslinger's quest.#2 - The Drawing of the Three - Roland pulls future Gunslingers, Jake, Eddie, and Suzannah from our world over to his. I really enjoyed how this was done. The characters are very likeable (especially OY)#3 - The Wastelands - The Gunslingers make continue on their way. Blaine really is a pain.#4 - Wizard and Glass - Roland tells them the story of Susan, The girl at the window. A very sad thing that happened to him in childhood. A beautiful story.#5 - Wolves of the Calla - The gunslingers help a town that is about to have their children taken. Jake makes a friend his own age. A character from another King book is met. This book was well put together.#6 - Song of Suzannah - This one tells of something that Suzannah is going through.#7 - The Dark Tower - The quest is finally over. The tower is reached. But who will make it there? Believe it or not this book made me cry.#* - The Wind Through the Keyhole - This story takes place between some of the other books. It is Roland and his gang taking refuge from a storm and Roland telling stories to pass the time. The stories are beautifully written.All of the stories in this series are exceptional. I love how they flow together. It really does seem like one continuous book.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsOne of the best books I have ever read!!!ByChris Brunneron January 11, 2013Format: Mass Market Paperback|Verified PurchaseThere is so much to say and yet, I am at a loss for words. Finishing this book, this series was amazing and saddening at the same time. I would say that this epic was life changing, but that is to strong of a statement, however, any other statement would not do this series justice. I couldn't stop thinking about these books, every time I set it down in the back of my mind was the constant thought of the tower. Will Roland finally make it to his life's goal and journey to the top of the tower? Will his Ka-tet continue to support his journey or will madness over take them all? This series was by far the best epic story line I have ever read, and that is saying something. I have read epics like Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter, but this in my opinion is better on so many levels.This book is the final chapter in the Tower series and one of the best books I have ever read. It is a very close second to my all time favorite book but almost ties for the #1 spot. Now it could partially be the fact that I have read six other books just to get to this point and it is my favorite because it is the end. In truth it is due to the fact that it is the longest book I have ever read at 1050 pages, and I flew through this as if it was a short novel. When I would read I wouldn't be able to put it down unless I fell asleep from exhaustion or work required me to. It was amazingly well written and suspenseful and engaging from the very beginning. There were parts that I wished were a bit longer but when I went back and realized it took several long chapters and a large page count I realized I fell into the story and got lost in the action.There is so much I want to say about this but it will give away to much of what is in other books and I hate spoilers in reviews. All I can really do now is send out my heartfelt desire for everyone to read this whether they like it or not. It seems like it should be something everyone should read at some point in their lives much like most of the other epic stories out there. Love it or hate it, I loved it, and hope that if this review gets one more person to Journey with Roland and his Ka-tet to the Dark Tower I will have fulfilled a need to pass on the wonder of these books.0Comment|

I tried to read The Green Mile 10 years ago, but I just couldn't get into it so I put it down and thought maybe Stephen King just wasn't for me. I was very wrong.My brother is the only reason I picked these books up. He had read them (more than twice) and really loved them and he said he just wanted someone else to read them so he had someone to talk to about them. I only started 'The Gunslinger' because he sent it home with me one day. It didn't really grab me like other books I had read but he promised the next book was better. He was right. It was better but I was still not hooked like what I thought I would be.It took me a year to finish 'The Wastelands' and then I started 'Wizard and Glass'. Something in this book captivated me. I don't know if I had finally made a connection with the characters or if it opened my eyes to a better understanding of Roland but when I finished it, I couldn't wait to start the next book. I finished them all in about a month and then went back and read 'The Gunslinger' again!I have a new found respect for Stephen King and I think he might be one of the greatest literary minds of our time. Seriously. I am amazed at the worlds his imagination has created for others to get lost in.It took me a year to finish 'The Wastelands' and then I started 'Wizard and Glass'.

I expected the ending from pretty much the first book but the way he takes you there is sorely lacking in Kingishness. The book felt rushed - like he "had to" finish it. Book 6 was the same way. The first 5 books took years to write because he only wrote them when he was inspired. These last 2 he forced and you can tell.0Comment|

			First Edition of 11/22/63; Signed by Stephen King

King, Stephen.



Item Number: 4063

New York: Scribner, 2011.  First edition. Thick octavo. Signed by Stephen King on the title page. Fine in a fine dust jacket.

'Stephen King's novel, 11.22.63, combines a variety of genres, being a JFK assassination, a story of time travel, a variation on the grail quest, a novel of voyeurism, a love story, a historical novel, a counter-factual historical novel and the chilling tale of a sinister animate universe, a form which can be traced back to the ghost stories of MR James" (London Review of Books).

In the front row, a young man in a wheelchair was, very slowly, signing his name in a book that bore on its earliest pages the signature of Isaac Newton… Stephen Hawking was a legend even then.” In his introduction, Sagan goes on to add that Hawking is the “worthy successor” to Newton and Paul Dirac, both former Lucasian Professors of Mathematics. Near fine in a near fine dust jacket with light rubbing. Rare and desirable signed.
