What Makes Cloud Business Phone Systems Productive?


Your business has enough to worry about...
Productive phone systems are managed in the cloud and are run remotely by expert engineers. Installation, maintenance, and support are fully managed by Crexendo so that you won’t be bogged down with unnecessary phone system issues.



Your goal is to grow the bottom line...
A combination of no up-front capital expense and the savings derived from no maintenance fees, upgrade fees or capacity constraints, transforms your business phone system into a productive communication tool- Not just another monthly bill. 



You can’t be everywhere at once...
Productivity does not need to cease to exist the second you step out of the office. Whether on a business trip, at the mall, or a child’s sports game, take important calls, transfer to co-worker extensions or simply retrieve your office voicemails without ever missing a beat.



You can’t afford obsolescence...
You try your best to stay ahead of the curve. You spend big money on systems to better understand and anticipate your marketplace. Why not select a hosted phone solution that spends big money anticipating your business needs?

Crexendo Telecom Service Areas
BZZZZ. BZZZZ. BZZ- You finally wake up enough to stop the incessant trembling of your phone on your nightstand. It is three in the morning in Hong Kong, and the home office in Chicago is calling. "Hello," you stammer out. Your voice cracks, unsteady with the abrupt start of your day and you realize what time it is.
"The phones are down! We can't make any calls," the voice clamors through from the United States.
"Again? Alright, call our Telecom company's customer support, and remember to ask for Jim. He helped us out last time."
"Already did that. Jim said his hands were tied but they were working on it."
"How long?"
"Three hours," this proclamation sends a cold chill up your spine. Figures start turning in your head and those figures quickly become real dollars. This, and a plethora of other issues like this, have impeded sales, customer support, and inner departmental communication. You suppress the wall of anxiety building in your stomach and compose yourself.
"Dave I'll call them too. Stay on the line and keep me updated. It is going to be a long day today."
If this doesn't sound familiar, you are lucky. For many IT Directors, business owners, and CTO's nightmare situations like this are the reason people hesitate to move to cloud telecommunication services. The fear of losing your most valuable form of communication at crucial moments is a real fear, and a fear many people have come across. We at Crexendo recognize and understand these concerns. That is why we built the foundation of our cloud telecommunications on principles that are important to ourselves as customers first, and secondly for the rest of our clientele.

With cloud telecommunication offerings through out the United States of America and Canada, we can help you and your business avoid nightmare phone calls and get the telecommunication support you need. Furthermoe, with our mobile applications we can provide you with free calls and call forwarding internationally as well as locally through the power of the Cloud, and at a fraction of the price. Many of our customers save upwards of 50% on their monthly phone expenses by switching to Crexendo's hosted telcom solutions.

Don't hesitate, call Crexendo today for your free demo and consultation.

Arizona Business Phone Systems Expert: Crexendo
Arizona is a technology hub, hidden in the desert. For years tech companies have flocked to this state for its beautiful weather, amazing natural beauty, and cheap recourses. During that time major improvements in telecommunications have happened, and Crexendo has been at the forefront of that tech movement. With over fifteen years of experience in the world wide web and business connectivity, we have established ourselves as a top telecom company. That means your Arizona business is getting the very best service, support, and technology available on the market today. Getting a business phone system from Crexendo is not only cost-effective (saving most organizations over fifty percent per month) it an be eye opening too. What technologies are you missing out on because you have been using a standard business phone system for the last fifteen-to-twenty years? Or if you are just starting out, what features are available to you that your competitors do not know about? There are many answers to this question, and that is why Crexendo proudly offers no-cost consultations to discuss your business needs to ensure they are tackling your goals directly.
How Can My Arizona Business Benefit From Cloud Communications?
A lot has changed since 1994. For those of you familiar with the history of technology, you will recognize this as the year the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was introduced. That organization and that year was really the start of an international revolution that would bring about the Internet as we know it today. With the advent and establishment of an "internet" as we know it, local, national, and international communication began to grow by leaps and bounds. Computers became faster, and smarter. The world's population became more technologically savvy, and the entire way we communicate changed along with it. Enter the world of VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) phone systems. While traditionally slow performing due to bandwidth issues, VOIP phone systems have been adopted in residential settings for more than a decade. So what does all of that have to do with your business phone system needs? Enter Crexendo.
For the last fifteen years, Crexendo has been a key player in internet connectivity. From helping business grow in the online markets, to developing key infrastructures and firmware to operate on traditional VOIP business phone systems, Crexendo is primed to help your business grow cost-effectively and profoundly. Our state-of-the-art servers are double and triple redundant protecting your from data outages, internet down time, or natural disasters. That means we can keep your phone system up and running without ever having to worry about productivity issues no matter what is happening through out Arizona or the rest of the world.
Why Switch To Crexendo for Your Business Phone System?
While you may be perfectly content with your current phone system, every business owner should be concerned with two things: Outsmarting their competition, and earning more profit. What does Crexendo's telecom solutions have to do with those two things? Everything. Outsmarting your competition is key to success because having tools in your proverbial belt that they don't have provides you with an upper-hand in the battle to gain more business. Rich features like voicemail, call forwarding, caller id, hunt groups, mobile connectivity, and much more can help your business look blue chip in a small business world, and provide your clients and potential clients access to you in ways your competition can only dream of. But how does that improve profit?
Crexendo has already established the technology, firmware, and app development needed to support its ever-growing client base. That means you do not have to wait around for us to catch up with your business needs, and it also means we do not have to charge an arm and a leg in order to grow our technology. We typically save most businesses over fifty percent on their current phone expense, while still providing them our robust line of feature and benefits. All you need to do is schedule a free consultation with one of our engineers to determine your business needs. From there we can help you develop a game plan to migrate to our cloud based phone system, and help your business jump into the new age of business: The technology age. Call today, and find out how Crexendo can help your Arizona business grow.
