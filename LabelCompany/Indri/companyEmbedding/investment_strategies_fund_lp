The Fund’s allocations to specific sectors and markets are presented to illustrate examples of the diversity of strategies and sub-strategies accessed by the Fund.  Portfolio holdings are subject to change and should not be considered a recommendation or investment advice.

Fund Overview
The Grant Park Futures Fund has operated since 1989, a period that includes a wide variety of economic and market cycles. Our experience has taught us there are three concepts to appreciate when considering an investment in managed futures. Grant Park, LP is a multi-advisor commodity pool that invests across global financial and commodity markets.

Managed futures is a divergent asset class and does not operate in a manner that is similar to equity or fixed income funds.


The agnostic nature of price-driven investing allows programs to invest by going long (anticipating prices will rise) or short (anticipating prices will fall). This, in turn, allows for potentially profitable investing when markets are rising or falling.


Globally, managed futures markets are regulated, widely traded, and very liquid.

These factors provide the basis for the diversification and non-correlated performance profile that managed futures can contribute to an investor’s portfolio.
Diversification is the most frequent reason managed futures are added to a portfolio and this represents two different elements - the diversification of a portfolio’s overall returns and the diversification of a portfolio’s overall volatility.
The Grant Park Futures Fund track record since inception illustrates the periods during which managed futures have performed similar to or differently than equities.

​Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
 
The Fund has performed positively for the majority of the period since inception; an individual investor may experience different results depending on their investment holding period.
There have been three “crisis” periods during the Fund’s existence.
During the Tech Bubble (2002) and the Financial Crisis (2008), the Fund provided downside protection, positive returns and reduced overall portfolio volatility while equity markets violently corrected.
During the Liquidity Bubble (2010 - 2015), the implementation of quantitative easing fueled extraordinary growth in equities, created, in part, by the excessive liquidity central banks created with zero- and negative-interest rates. During this unprecedented period, managed futures have made limited positive contribution to a portfolio’s performance but did contribute to a reduction in overall portfolio volatility.

The normalization of market-driven interest rates began fitfully during 2015 and is likely to slowly continue for the immediate future. We believe this will enable managed futures performance to return to its historical performance profile.
The Grant Park Futures Fund invests on the same core beliefs the Fund has held since inception:
Markets move in cycles.
The preservation of investor capital through rigorous risk management is equally important as is the pursuit of potentially profitable trading opportunities.
Diversification of CTAs within the Fund provides the broadest manner to achieve performance results that are representative of the managed futures asset class.
Active risk management focused on monitoring all aspects of the Fund’s trading, execution, and financial reporting are essential to retaining the limited partners’ trust.

Commodity Trading Advisers
The CTAs who invest on the Fund’s behalf invest across the global managed futures markets and typically execute their investment strategies utilizing rigorous, systematic investment processes and disciplined or quantitative trading models.

Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc.

The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

 About risk
			 


Active Trading Risk. Active trading of portfolio securities may result in added expenses, a lower return and increased tax liability.
Debt Securities Risk. The prices of debt securities held by the Fund will be affected by changes in interest rates, the creditworthiness of the issuer and other factors. An increase in prevailing interest rates typically causes the value of existing debt securities to fall and often has a greater impact on longer-duration debt securities and higher quality debt securities. Falling interest rates will cause the Fund to reinvest the proceeds of debt securities that have been repaid by the issuer at lower interest rates. Falling interest rates may also reduce the Fund's distributable income because interest payments on floating rate debt instruments held by the Fund will decline. The Fund could lose money on investments in debt securities if the issuer or borrower fails to meet its obligations to make interest payments and/or to repay principal in a timely manner. Changes in an issuer's financial strength, the market's perception of such strength or in the credit rating of the issuer or the security may affect the value of debt securities. The Adviser's credit analysis may fail to anticipate such changes, which could result in buying a debt security at an inopportune time or failing to sell a debt security in advance of a price decline or other credit event.
Deferred Tax Risk. The Fund is classified for federal tax purposes as a taxable regular corporation or so-called Subchapter "C" corporation. As a "C" corporation, the Fund is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its taxable income at the graduated rates applicable to corporations (currently at a maximum rate of 35%) as well as state and local income taxes. The Fund will not benefit from the current favorable federal income tax rates on long-term capital gains and Fund income, losses and expenses will not be passed through to the Fund's shareholders. An investment strategy whereby a fund is taxed as a regular corporation, or "C" corporation, rather than as a regulated investment company for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is a relatively recent strategy for open-end registered investment companies such as the Fund. This strategy involves complicated accounting, tax, net asset value (NAV) and share valuation aspects that would cause the Fund to differ significantly from most other open-end registered investment companies.
Energy Infrastructure MLP Risk. The Fund will concentrate its investments in the energy sector. Energy infrastructure MLPs are subject to a variety of industry specific risk factors, including reduced volumes of energy commodities available for transporting, processing, storing or distributing; changes in energy commodity prices; a sustained reduced demand for crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products; depletion of the natural gas reserves or other commodities if not replaced; natural disasters, extreme weather and environmental hazards; rising interest rates which could drive investors into other investment opportunities; environmental damage claims; and threats of attack by terrorists on energy assets. In addition, taxes, government regulation, international politics, price and supply fluctuations, volatile interest rates and energy conservation may cause difficulties for energy infrastructure MLPs.
High Yield Debt Securities (Junk Bond) Risk. Investments in high yield debt securities ("junk bonds") and other lower-rated securities will subject the Fund to substantial risk of loss. These securities are considered to be speculative with respect to the issuer's ability to pay interest and principal when due, are more susceptible to default or decline in market value and are less liquid than investment grade debt securities. Prices of high yield debt securities tend to be very volatile.
Management Risk. The Fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the Adviser's judgment about markets, interest rates or the attractiveness, relative values, liquidity, or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the Fund's portfolio. The Fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect. Additionally, legislative, regulatory, or tax developments may adversely affect management of the Fund and, therefore, the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment objective.
Market Risk. The market values of the Fund's investments, and therefore the value of the Fund's shares, will go up and down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry or section of the economy, or it may affect the market as a whole. Individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments, such as bonds. During a general downturn in the financial markets, multiple asset classes may decline in value. When markets perform well, there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the Fund will rise in value.
MLP Risk. The Fund invests principally in securities of MLPs, which are subject to the following risks: 


Limited Partner Risk. An MLP is a public limited partnership or limited liability company taxed as a partnership under the Code. Although the characteristics of MLPs closely resemble a traditional limited partnership, a major difference is that MLPs may trade on a public exchange or in the over-the-counter market. The risks of investing in an MLP are similar to those of investing in a partnership, including more flexible governance structures, which could result in less protection for investors than investments in a corporation. Investors in an MLP normally would not be liable for the debts of the MLP beyond the amount that the investor has contributed but investors may not be shielded to the same extent that a shareholder of a corporation would be. In certain circumstances, creditors of an MLP would have the right to seek return of capital distributed to a limited partner, which right would continue after an investor sold its investment in the MLP.
Liquidity Risk. The ability to trade on a public exchange or in the over-the-counter market provides a certain amount of liquidity not found in many limited partnership investments. However, MLP interests may be less liquid than conventional publicly traded securities and, therefore, more difficult to trade at desirable times and/or prices.
Interest Rate Risk. In addition, MLP distributions may be reduced by fees and other expenses incurred by the MLP. MLPs generally are considered interest-rate sensitive investments. During periods of interest rate volatility, these investments may not provide attractive returns.
General Partner Risk. The holder of the general partner or managing member interest can be liable in certain circumstances for amounts greater than the amount of the holder's investment in the general partner or managing member.

MLP Tax Risk. MLPs taxed as partnerships do not pay U.S. federal income tax at the partnership level. A change in current tax law, or a change in the underlying business mix of a given MLP, however, could result in an MLP being classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which would have the effect of reducing the amount of cash available for distribution by the MLP and, as a result, could cause a reduction of the value of the Fund's investment, and consequently your investment in the Fund and lower income. Each year, the Fund will send you an annual tax statement (Form 1099) to assist you in completing your federal, state and local tax returns. If an MLP in which the Fund invests amends its partnership tax return, the Fund will, when necessary, send you a corrected Form 1099, which could, in turn, require you to amend your federal, state or local tax returns.
Non-Diversification Risk. The Fund is non-diversified and can invest a greater portion of its assets in the obligations or securities of a small number of issuers or any single issuer than a diversified fund can. A change in the value of one or a few issuers' securities will therefore affect the value of the Fund more than if it was a diversified fund.
Small- and Mid-Capitalization Companies Risks. Small- and mid-capitalization companies tend to be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, may have little or no operating history or track record of success, and may have more limited product lines and markets, less experienced management and fewer financial resources than larger companies. These companies' securities may be more volatile and less liquid than those of more established companies, and their returns may vary, sometimes significantly, from the overall securities market.
