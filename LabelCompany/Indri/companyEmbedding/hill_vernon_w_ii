He is also the founder, former chairman, president and CEO of Commerce Bancorp of Cherry Hill, New Jersey and chairman of Fetch Inc. (aka Pet Plan North America).

Early career[edit]
Although known for banking, Hill’s business outlook has been informed by early encounters with retailing. While taking morning classes at Wharton, Hill worked afternoons at a South Jersey bank owned by a local car retailer, where Hill observed the car dealer applying retail principles to banking operations, such as late opening hours. The job also brought Hill into contact with other local retailers, including McDonald's.[1] After graduation Hill founded a real estate firm to find and develop sites for McDonald's, a task which required Hill to drive McDonald's entrepreneur Ray Kroc on scouting trips. Hill claims his experience with McDonald’s taught him the importance of standardised presentation and scale economies in retailing.[2]
Philadelphia Magazine reports that Hill’s experience with McDonald’s led directly to the creation of Commerce Bank. Referring to the creation of Commerce, Morton Kerr, chairman of the board of Markeim-Chalmers, Inc., a South Jersey real estate firm, and one of the original Commerce board members, observed:

“A lot of us knew Vernon from being involved in real estate at that time…He was a 26-year-old kid who called about 15 of us to a meeting in his office. I'll never forget it. He said, 'We're going to start a bank.' And he said we'd each have to put up between $25,000 and $125,000. This was 1973-who had that kind of money? But he'd arranged for all of us to borrow it. If you could put up $100,000, he got us loans for $80,000. Only seven of us didn't get up and walk out, but we still thought he was crazy.”[1]

The deal resulted in Commerce opening its first branch in Marlton, New Jersey, in 1973.
Commerce Bancorp[edit]
Commerce Bank was notable for its rapid expansion, from one branch in 1973 to 470 branches in 2008, and a deposit base that grew by an average of 25% per year between 1996 and 2001 (against an industry average of 5% in 2001). According to Forbes Magazine, Commerce produced a 23% annual shareholder return compounded for 30 years.[3]
Commerce Bank’s economic model rested on the idea that the fixed costs of a bank branch are largely independent of volume, and so profitability lay in maximizing the number of deposits and accounts per branch. Additionally, Hill believed that the industry's reliance on internet banking had led to dis-investment in bank branches, to the detriment of consumers who prioritised in-person service.

“Other banks decided to push consumers out of the branch because it is the high-cost delivery channel. They wanted to push them online. We totally reject that. You can’t name me one retailer in this country that has pushed people where they don’t want to go and succeeded…We have some branches that get 100,000 customer visits a month; the average branch gets 40,000. An average McDonald’s gets 25,000 per month.”[4]

Hill’s motto for Commerce was “America’s most convenient bank”.[5]
Commerce tactics were oriented to drive volume, differentiation and customer advocacy, including:

Longer opening hours, including evenings and weekends; opening ten minutes earlier and later than advertised hours
Removing glass from teller booths for a more open customer experience
Pet-friendly policies
Giveaways such as lollipops and dog biscuits
Free use of coin-counting machines
Handing out pens in response to rival banks’ practice of chaining pens to desks
“Kill the stupid rule” program, whereby employees who suggested an alternative to a stupid rule were paid $50

Commerce Bank staff were awarded $5,000 if a nearby rival bank closed its branches; hundreds of mystery shoppers made tens of thousands of store visits annually, and salary increases were based on mystery shopping scores. Top-performing managers were given sports cars.[6]
On June 29, 2007, Hill resigned as chairman and CEO of Commerce Bancorp after the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the board of directors of Commerce Bancorp established governance to stop doing business with firms under the control of Hill’s family. Notable business dealings with insiders included property leases with entities in which Hill was a partner, and the purchase of services from an architectural design business run by his wife, Shirley.[7] No charges were brought.
On October 2, 2007, Commerce Bancorp announced that it would be merging with TD Bank Financial Group. The Canadian-based Toronto-Dominion Bank would acquire Commerce for $8.5 billion (U.S. dollars) in cash and stock, at $42 per share of CBH stock, a purchase multiple of x28. Some industry commentators held that Hill's departure and a strong Canadian dollar had made a takeover inevitable.[8]
Petplan[edit]
Hill is chairman of Fetch Inc. (aka Petplan North America), a pet health insurance company founded by Chris and Natasha Ashton. It holds the U.S. and Canadian franchise from Petplan of Britain, the world's biggest provider of policies for companion animals. Hill invested in the company in April 2008, believing pet health to be a growth market in the USA.[9]
Speaking to Fortune Magazine in 2010, Hill said: "People used to put down their pets when they got sick. Now they're members of the family. People will want to save them with kidney transplants and hip replacements. This business will be huge."[citation needed]
Metro Bank[edit]
Metro Bank UK was launched in London July 2010, with Hill as co-founder and vice-chairman.
Press commentary at the time centred on Metro being the first high-street bank to open in the United Kingdom for more than 100 years, and upon Hill's belief that the competitive landscape of British banking amounted to a commercial opportunity to lead on service rather than price. In 2010, 85% of the UK market for current accounts was held by the “big five” banking institutions (HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander and Lloyds).[10] In 2008 an official report from the Office of Fair Trading concluded that UK banking was subject to weak competitive pressures and profit-maximising strategies.[11] Forbes Magazine described Metro at launch as "...aiming to disrupt a storied industry dominated by a handful of established players".[12]
In a BBC News interview, Thomson commented that the cost–driven model of traditional British banks required them to discourage customers from visiting branches, whereas Metro Bank’s model actively sought to attract customers into branches, using tactics such as longer opening hours and pet-friendly policies.[13]
The pair spent a further two years securing a £75m launch investment, including funds from New York real estate developer Richard LeFrak, property investors the Reuben brothers and Fidelity, the fund management company.[14] Metro launched with plans to open 200 branches in London by 2020.[15] Twelve branches were opened by December 2010. In June 2012 the company announced the completion of a £126m round of capital-raising to open further branches in London, including funds from Moore Capital and billionaire investor Steve Cohen.[16][17]
Noted investor Wilbur Ross commented that "The question is whether [Hill’s] promotional flair and service concept will produce enough customers to offset the extra operational cost of providing the extra space".[18]
Hill, who previously served as Metro's vice chairman, replaced his co-founder Anthony Thomson as chairman in January 2013.[19]
As of September 2013 Metro had 225,000 accounts and was opening a new branch every month with a goal of opening 25 by the close of the year.[20] In May, Metro opened a drive-through bank in Slough. the second in the UK after Natwest in Toxteth, Liverpool which opened in 1959 but has since closed in 2013.[21]
In April 2013 Hill was also awarded the Institute of Economic Affairs' Free Enterprise Award whose previous winners include Margaret Thatcher and Sir Richard Branson for his work at Metro. The IEA noted Hill, "has identified a clear opportunity and entered the UK banking scene at a time when the sector has been under constant fire" and showed "incredible perseverance and imagination"[22] while IEA Director General Mark Littlewood praised Metro Bank as "a shining example of innovation improving people's live. It's refreshing to see more competition and choice in the banking sector on our high streets".[22]
In August 2013, Tom Brown of Bankstocks.com wrote: "So Vernon Hill has, not once, but twice, and in two different markets, built growth machines in the supposedly mature and sleepy banking business. That has to make him the world’s greatest growth-oriented banker, probably of all time."[23] In the same month, Hill received the 2013 Stevie Award for International Chairman of the Year.[24]
Book[edit]
Hill is the author of Fans Not Customers: How to Create Growth Companies in a No Growth World, which was released by Profile Books in October 2012.[25] It argues that it is better to have fans rather than customers and urges businesses to compete on service rather than price. The Financial Times reviewed Hill's writing style as "refreshingly to the point" and said that "for those looking for an alternate way of approaching service, the book will prove rich pickings".[26]
Other investments[edit]
Hill is a partner with Steve Lewis in US Restaurants Inc, which operates 40 Burger King restaurants in metropolitan Philadelphia.[27]
Hill's first business was Site Development Inc, a real estate development firm which has developed over 1000 shopping centres and retail developments in America.[28]
In 1994, Hill, along with partners John Silvestri and Steve Lewis, founded and developed Galloway National Golf Club near Atlantic City, New Jersey. The course was designed by Tom Fazio and is ranked by GolfDigest.com as being among the top 100 courses in America.[citation needed]
Business philosophy[edit]
Fortune Magazine describes Hill as a “...flamboyant, tradition-stomping American billionaire…the P.T. Barnum of banking”.[29]
Hill has often advocated a business development strategy based on organic growth rather than acquisition, and by generating customer loyalty through service rather than price. Speaking to a 2010 House of Commons Treasury Select Committee on competition and choice in the banking sector, Hill said:

“My opinion is that great retailers never grow by acquisition…If you see yourself as a retailer delivering an unusual service, acquisitions are the easiest way to kill your model…[Organic growth] is slower, but you get what you want at the end. You get a group of people running your model, not somebody else’s model….”[30]

Hill is a critic of the shadow banking system, believing it to largely responsible for the 2007-2012 global financial crisis.

“We have two American banking systems. We have the normal banking system, with 8,000 banks serving consumers and businesses throughout America. Then we developed a shadow banking system…the money market funds, the investment banks, the credit default swaps. The current crisis is really a crisis of this shadow banking system….I think when [banks] are making a loan to, say, a restaurant, the overwhelming majority of banks aren’t playing games. As long as the guy’s paying, it’s a loan that pays back over time. Then we moved into all this exotic stuff — credit default swaps, CDOs. Believe me, no one at Goldman Sachs understands what they have on their books, because these kids are sitting at their computers dreaming this stuff up….”[31]

Hill is often quoted as viewing his banks to be in the retail business rather than the banking business.

“You don't have to think about what time a Home Depot, a McDonald's or a Starbucks is open,” Hill says. “They're open. You just go. My theory was, if you advertise that [your bank is] open on Sunday, the consumer will automatically believe you're open all the time. That message is more important than the savings."

In its 2007 20-20-20 Club, Forbes Magazine lists Hill as one of seven CEOs (along with Warren Buffett and Larry Ellison) of publicly traded companies with tenures of over 20 years to deliver an annual shareholder return in excess of 20%. Commerce produced a 23% annual compounded shareholder return over that time.[3]
Personal life[edit]
Hill is the son of a Virginia real estate brokerage owner and the eldest of six children. He graduated from Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia in 1967, earning a BS in economics with a concentration in finance.
Hill's 46,000 ft² (4,270 m²) home, Villa Collina, is located in Moorestown Township, New Jersey.[32] The home features an orangery.[33] Hill has been married for 40 years to Shirley Hill, who is the founder of InterArch, the architectural and branding firm responsible for the branding for Commerce Bank and Metro Bank. The couple have four children and Sir Duffield, their yorkshire terrier.
The Hill Family Foundation supports various charitable organisations in both the US and Britain. It is one of the largest[citation needed] supporters of veterinary causes, including:

A $10 million gift for the Vernon and Shirley Hill Pavilion at the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Vernon's alma mater.[34]
The Penn World Veterinary Award[35]
The UK Kennel Club Achievement Award[36]

Early career[edit]
Although known for banking, Hill’s business outlook has been informed by early encounters with retailing. While taking morning classes at Wharton, Hill worked afternoons at a South Jersey bank owned by a local car retailer, where Hill observed the car dealer applying retail principles to banking operations, such as late opening hours. The job also brought Hill into contact with other local retailers, including McDonald's.[1] After graduation Hill founded a real estate firm to find and develop sites for McDonald's, a task which required Hill to drive McDonald's entrepreneur Ray Kroc on scouting trips. Hill claims his experience with McDonald’s taught him the importance of standardised presentation and scale economies in retailing.[2]
Philadelphia Magazine reports that Hill’s experience with McDonald’s led directly to the creation of Commerce Bank. Referring to the creation of Commerce, Morton Kerr, chairman of the board of Markeim-Chalmers, Inc., a South Jersey real estate firm, and one of the original Commerce board members, observed:

“A lot of us knew Vernon from being involved in real estate at that time…He was a 26-year-old kid who called about 15 of us to a meeting in his office. I'll never forget it. He said, 'We're going to start a bank.' And he said we'd each have to put up between $25,000 and $125,000. This was 1973-who had that kind of money? But he'd arranged for all of us to borrow it. If you could put up $100,000, he got us loans for $80,000. Only seven of us didn't get up and walk out, but we still thought he was crazy.”[1]

The deal resulted in Commerce opening its first branch in Marlton, New Jersey, in 1973.
Commerce Bancorp[edit]
Commerce Bank was notable for its rapid expansion, from one branch in 1973 to 470 branches in 2008, and a deposit base that grew by an average of 25% per year between 1996 and 2001 (against an industry average of 5% in 2001). According to Forbes Magazine, Commerce produced a 23% annual shareholder return compounded for 30 years.[3]
Commerce Bank’s economic model rested on the idea that the fixed costs of a bank branch are largely independent of volume, and so profitability lay in maximizing the number of deposits and accounts per branch. Additionally, Hill believed that the industry's reliance on internet banking had led to dis-investment in bank branches, to the detriment of consumers who prioritised in-person service.

“Other banks decided to push consumers out of the branch because it is the high-cost delivery channel. They wanted to push them online. We totally reject that. You can’t name me one retailer in this country that has pushed people where they don’t want to go and succeeded…We have some branches that get 100,000 customer visits a month; the average branch gets 40,000. An average McDonald’s gets 25,000 per month.”[4]

Hill’s motto for Commerce was “America’s most convenient bank”.[5]
Commerce tactics were oriented to drive volume, differentiation and customer advocacy, including:

Longer opening hours, including evenings and weekends; opening ten minutes earlier and later than advertised hours
Removing glass from teller booths for a more open customer experience
Pet-friendly policies
Giveaways such as lollipops and dog biscuits
Free use of coin-counting machines
Handing out pens in response to rival banks’ practice of chaining pens to desks
“Kill the stupid rule” program, whereby employees who suggested an alternative to a stupid rule were paid $50

Commerce Bank staff were awarded $5,000 if a nearby rival bank closed its branches; hundreds of mystery shoppers made tens of thousands of store visits annually, and salary increases were based on mystery shopping scores. Top-performing managers were given sports cars.[6]
On June 29, 2007, Hill resigned as chairman and CEO of Commerce Bancorp after the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the board of directors of Commerce Bancorp established governance to stop doing business with firms under the control of Hill’s family. Notable business dealings with insiders included property leases with entities in which Hill was a partner, and the purchase of services from an architectural design business run by his wife, Shirley.[7] No charges were brought.
On October 2, 2007, Commerce Bancorp announced that it would be merging with TD Bank Financial Group. The Canadian-based Toronto-Dominion Bank would acquire Commerce for $8.5 billion (U.S. dollars) in cash and stock, at $42 per share of CBH stock, a purchase multiple of x28. Some industry commentators held that Hill's departure and a strong Canadian dollar had made a takeover inevitable.[8]
Petplan[edit]
Hill is chairman of Fetch Inc. (aka Petplan North America), a pet health insurance company founded by Chris and Natasha Ashton. It holds the U.S. and Canadian franchise from Petplan of Britain, the world's biggest provider of policies for companion animals. Hill invested in the company in April 2008, believing pet health to be a growth market in the USA.[9]
Speaking to Fortune Magazine in 2010, Hill said: "People used to put down their pets when they got sick. Now they're members of the family. People will want to save them with kidney transplants and hip replacements. This business will be huge."[citation needed]
Metro Bank[edit]
Metro Bank UK was launched in London July 2010, with Hill as co-founder and vice-chairman.
Press commentary at the time centred on Metro being the first high-street bank to open in the United Kingdom for more than 100 years, and upon Hill's belief that the competitive landscape of British banking amounted to a commercial opportunity to lead on service rather than price. In 2010, 85% of the UK market for current accounts was held by the “big five” banking institutions (HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander and Lloyds).[10] In 2008 an official report from the Office of Fair Trading concluded that UK banking was subject to weak competitive pressures and profit-maximising strategies.[11] Forbes Magazine described Metro at launch as "...aiming to disrupt a storied industry dominated by a handful of established players".[12]
In a BBC News interview, Thomson commented that the cost–driven model of traditional British banks required them to discourage customers from visiting branches, whereas Metro Bank’s model actively sought to attract customers into branches, using tactics such as longer opening hours and pet-friendly policies.[13]
The pair spent a further two years securing a £75m launch investment, including funds from New York real estate developer Richard LeFrak, property investors the Reuben brothers and Fidelity, the fund management company.[14] Metro launched with plans to open 200 branches in London by 2020.[15] Twelve branches were opened by December 2010. In June 2012 the company announced the completion of a £126m round of capital-raising to open further branches in London, including funds from Moore Capital and billionaire investor Steve Cohen.[16][17]
Noted investor Wilbur Ross commented that "The question is whether [Hill’s] promotional flair and service concept will produce enough customers to offset the extra operational cost of providing the extra space".[18]
Hill, who previously served as Metro's vice chairman, replaced his co-founder Anthony Thomson as chairman in January 2013.[19]
As of September 2013 Metro had 225,000 accounts and was opening a new branch every month with a goal of opening 25 by the close of the year.[20] In May, Metro opened a drive-through bank in Slough. the second in the UK after Natwest in Toxteth, Liverpool which opened in 1959 but has since closed in 2013.[21]
In April 2013 Hill was also awarded the Institute of Economic Affairs' Free Enterprise Award whose previous winners include Margaret Thatcher and Sir Richard Branson for his work at Metro. The IEA noted Hill, "has identified a clear opportunity and entered the UK banking scene at a time when the sector has been under constant fire" and showed "incredible perseverance and imagination"[22] while IEA Director General Mark Littlewood praised Metro Bank as "a shining example of innovation improving people's live. It's refreshing to see more competition and choice in the banking sector on our high streets".[22]
In August 2013, Tom Brown of Bankstocks.com wrote: "So Vernon Hill has, not once, but twice, and in two different markets, built growth machines in the supposedly mature and sleepy banking business. That has to make him the world’s greatest growth-oriented banker, probably of all time."[23] In the same month, Hill received the 2013 Stevie Award for International Chairman of the Year.[24]
Book[edit]
Hill is the author of Fans Not Customers: How to Create Growth Companies in a No Growth World, which was released by Profile Books in October 2012.[25] It argues that it is better to have fans rather than customers and urges businesses to compete on service rather than price. The Financial Times reviewed Hill's writing style as "refreshingly to the point" and said that "for those looking for an alternate way of approaching service, the book will prove rich pickings".[26]
Other investments[edit]
Hill is a partner with Steve Lewis in US Restaurants Inc, which operates 40 Burger King restaurants in metropolitan Philadelphia.[27]
Hill's first business was Site Development Inc, a real estate development firm which has developed over 1000 shopping centres and retail developments in America.[28]
In 1994, Hill, along with partners John Silvestri and Steve Lewis, founded and developed Galloway National Golf Club near Atlantic City, New Jersey. The course was designed by Tom Fazio and is ranked by GolfDigest.com as being among the top 100 courses in America.[citation needed]
Business philosophy[edit]
Fortune Magazine describes Hill as a “...flamboyant, tradition-stomping American billionaire…the P.T. Barnum of banking”.[29]
Hill has often advocated a business development strategy based on organic growth rather than acquisition, and by generating customer loyalty through service rather than price. Speaking to a 2010 House of Commons Treasury Select Committee on competition and choice in the banking sector, Hill said:

“My opinion is that great retailers never grow by acquisition…If you see yourself as a retailer delivering an unusual service, acquisitions are the easiest way to kill your model…[Organic growth] is slower, but you get what you want at the end. You get a group of people running your model, not somebody else’s model….”[30]

Hill is a critic of the shadow banking system, believing it to largely responsible for the 2007-2012 global financial crisis.

“We have two American banking systems. We have the normal banking system, with 8,000 banks serving consumers and businesses throughout America. Then we developed a shadow banking system…the money market funds, the investment banks, the credit default swaps. The current crisis is really a crisis of this shadow banking system….I think when [banks] are making a loan to, say, a restaurant, the overwhelming majority of banks aren’t playing games. As long as the guy’s paying, it’s a loan that pays back over time. Then we moved into all this exotic stuff — credit default swaps, CDOs. Believe me, no one at Goldman Sachs understands what they have on their books, because these kids are sitting at their computers dreaming this stuff up….”[31]

Hill is often quoted as viewing his banks to be in the retail business rather than the banking business.

“You don't have to think about what time a Home Depot, a McDonald's or a Starbucks is open,” Hill says. “They're open. You just go. My theory was, if you advertise that [your bank is] open on Sunday, the consumer will automatically believe you're open all the time. That message is more important than the savings."

In its 2007 20-20-20 Club, Forbes Magazine lists Hill as one of seven CEOs (along with Warren Buffett and Larry Ellison) of publicly traded companies with tenures of over 20 years to deliver an annual shareholder return in excess of 20%. Commerce produced a 23% annual compounded shareholder return over that time.[3]
Personal life[edit]
Hill is the son of a Virginia real estate brokerage owner and the eldest of six children. He graduated from Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia in 1967, earning a BS in economics with a concentration in finance.
Hill's 46,000 ft² (4,270 m²) home, Villa Collina, is located in Moorestown Township, New Jersey.[32] The home features an orangery.[33] Hill has been married for 40 years to Shirley Hill, who is the founder of InterArch, the architectural and branding firm responsible for the branding for Commerce Bank and Metro Bank. The couple have four children and Sir Duffield, their yorkshire terrier.
The Hill Family Foundation supports various charitable organisations in both the US and Britain. It is one of the largest[citation needed] supporters of veterinary causes, including:

A $10 million gift for the Vernon and Shirley Hill Pavilion at the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Vernon's alma mater.[34]
The Penn World Veterinary Award[35]
The UK Kennel Club Achievement Award[36]

Fortune Magazine describes Hill as a “...flamboyant, tradition-stomping American billionaire…the P.T. Barnum of banking”.[29]
Hill has often advocated a business development strategy based on organic growth rather than acquisition, and by generating customer loyalty through service rather than price. Speaking to a 2010 House of Commons Treasury Select Committee on competition and choice in the banking sector, Hill said:

“My opinion is that great retailers never grow by acquisition…If you see yourself as a retailer delivering an unusual service, acquisitions are the easiest way to kill your model…[Organic growth] is slower, but you get what you want at the end. You get a group of people running your model, not somebody else’s model….”[30]

Hill is a critic of the shadow banking system, believing it to largely responsible for the 2007-2012 global financial crisis.

“We have two American banking systems. We have the normal banking system, with 8,000 banks serving consumers and businesses throughout America. Then we developed a shadow banking system…the money market funds, the investment banks, the credit default swaps. The current crisis is really a crisis of this shadow banking system….I think when [banks] are making a loan to, say, a restaurant, the overwhelming majority of banks aren’t playing games. As long as the guy’s paying, it’s a loan that pays back over time. Then we moved into all this exotic stuff — credit default swaps, CDOs. Believe me, no one at Goldman Sachs understands what they have on their books, because these kids are sitting at their computers dreaming this stuff up….”[31]

Hill is often quoted as viewing his banks to be in the retail business rather than the banking business.

“You don't have to think about what time a Home Depot, a McDonald's or a Starbucks is open,” Hill says. “They're open. You just go. My theory was, if you advertise that [your bank is] open on Sunday, the consumer will automatically believe you're open all the time. That message is more important than the savings."

In its 2007 20-20-20 Club, Forbes Magazine lists Hill as one of seven CEOs (along with Warren Buffett and Larry Ellison) of publicly traded companies with tenures of over 20 years to deliver an annual shareholder return in excess of 20%. Commerce produced a 23% annual compounded shareholder return over that time.[3]
Personal life[edit]
Hill is the son of a Virginia real estate brokerage owner and the eldest of six children. He graduated from Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia in 1967, earning a BS in economics with a concentration in finance.
Hill's 46,000 ft² (4,270 m²) home, Villa Collina, is located in Moorestown Township, New Jersey.[32] The home features an orangery.[33] Hill has been married for 40 years to Shirley Hill, who is the founder of InterArch, the architectural and branding firm responsible for the branding for Commerce Bank and Metro Bank. The couple have four children and Sir Duffield, their yorkshire terrier.
The Hill Family Foundation supports various charitable organisations in both the US and Britain. It is one of the largest[citation needed] supporters of veterinary causes, including:

A $10 million gift for the Vernon and Shirley Hill Pavilion at the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Vernon's alma mater.[34]
The Penn World Veterinary Award[35]
The UK Kennel Club Achievement Award[36]

Early career[edit]
Although known for banking, Hill’s business outlook has been informed by early encounters with retailing. While taking morning classes at Wharton, Hill worked afternoons at a South Jersey bank owned by a local car retailer, where Hill observed the car dealer applying retail principles to banking operations, such as late opening hours. The job also brought Hill into contact with other local retailers, including McDonald's.[1] After graduation Hill founded a real estate firm to find and develop sites for McDonald's, a task which required Hill to drive McDonald's entrepreneur Ray Kroc on scouting trips. Hill claims his experience with McDonald’s taught him the importance of standardised presentation and scale economies in retailing.[2]
Philadelphia Magazine reports that Hill’s experience with McDonald’s led directly to the creation of Commerce Bank. Referring to the creation of Commerce, Morton Kerr, chairman of the board of Markeim-Chalmers, Inc., a South Jersey real estate firm, and one of the original Commerce board members, observed:

“A lot of us knew Vernon from being involved in real estate at that time…He was a 26-year-old kid who called about 15 of us to a meeting in his office. I'll never forget it. He said, 'We're going to start a bank.' And he said we'd each have to put up between $25,000 and $125,000. This was 1973-who had that kind of money? But he'd arranged for all of us to borrow it. If you could put up $100,000, he got us loans for $80,000. Only seven of us didn't get up and walk out, but we still thought he was crazy.”[1]

The deal resulted in Commerce opening its first branch in Marlton, New Jersey, in 1973.
Commerce Bancorp[edit]
Commerce Bank was notable for its rapid expansion, from one branch in 1973 to 470 branches in 2008, and a deposit base that grew by an average of 25% per year between 1996 and 2001 (against an industry average of 5% in 2001). According to Forbes Magazine, Commerce produced a 23% annual shareholder return compounded for 30 years.[3]
Commerce Bank’s economic model rested on the idea that the fixed costs of a bank branch are largely independent of volume, and so profitability lay in maximizing the number of deposits and accounts per branch. Additionally, Hill believed that the industry's reliance on internet banking had led to dis-investment in bank branches, to the detriment of consumers who prioritised in-person service.

“Other banks decided to push consumers out of the branch because it is the high-cost delivery channel. They wanted to push them online. We totally reject that. You can’t name me one retailer in this country that has pushed people where they don’t want to go and succeeded…We have some branches that get 100,000 customer visits a month; the average branch gets 40,000. An average McDonald’s gets 25,000 per month.”[4]

Hill’s motto for Commerce was “America’s most convenient bank”.[5]
Commerce tactics were oriented to drive volume, differentiation and customer advocacy, including:

Longer opening hours, including evenings and weekends; opening ten minutes earlier and later than advertised hours
Removing glass from teller booths for a more open customer experience
Pet-friendly policies
Giveaways such as lollipops and dog biscuits
Free use of coin-counting machines
Handing out pens in response to rival banks’ practice of chaining pens to desks
“Kill the stupid rule” program, whereby employees who suggested an alternative to a stupid rule were paid $50

Commerce Bank staff were awarded $5,000 if a nearby rival bank closed its branches; hundreds of mystery shoppers made tens of thousands of store visits annually, and salary increases were based on mystery shopping scores. Top-performing managers were given sports cars.[6]
On June 29, 2007, Hill resigned as chairman and CEO of Commerce Bancorp after the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the board of directors of Commerce Bancorp established governance to stop doing business with firms under the control of Hill’s family. Notable business dealings with insiders included property leases with entities in which Hill was a partner, and the purchase of services from an architectural design business run by his wife, Shirley.[7] No charges were brought.
On October 2, 2007, Commerce Bancorp announced that it would be merging with TD Bank Financial Group. The Canadian-based Toronto-Dominion Bank would acquire Commerce for $8.5 billion (U.S. dollars) in cash and stock, at $42 per share of CBH stock, a purchase multiple of x28. Some industry commentators held that Hill's departure and a strong Canadian dollar had made a takeover inevitable.[8]
Petplan[edit]
Hill is chairman of Fetch Inc. (aka Petplan North America), a pet health insurance company founded by Chris and Natasha Ashton. It holds the U.S. and Canadian franchise from Petplan of Britain, the world's biggest provider of policies for companion animals. Hill invested in the company in April 2008, believing pet health to be a growth market in the USA.[9]
Speaking to Fortune Magazine in 2010, Hill said: "People used to put down their pets when they got sick. Now they're members of the family. People will want to save them with kidney transplants and hip replacements. This business will be huge."[citation needed]
Metro Bank[edit]
Metro Bank UK was launched in London July 2010, with Hill as co-founder and vice-chairman.
Press commentary at the time centred on Metro being the first high-street bank to open in the United Kingdom for more than 100 years, and upon Hill's belief that the competitive landscape of British banking amounted to a commercial opportunity to lead on service rather than price. In 2010, 85% of the UK market for current accounts was held by the “big five” banking institutions (HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander and Lloyds).[10] In 2008 an official report from the Office of Fair Trading concluded that UK banking was subject to weak competitive pressures and profit-maximising strategies.[11] Forbes Magazine described Metro at launch as "...aiming to disrupt a storied industry dominated by a handful of established players".[12]
In a BBC News interview, Thomson commented that the cost–driven model of traditional British banks required them to discourage customers from visiting branches, whereas Metro Bank’s model actively sought to attract customers into branches, using tactics such as longer opening hours and pet-friendly policies.[13]
The pair spent a further two years securing a £75m launch investment, including funds from New York real estate developer Richard LeFrak, property investors the Reuben brothers and Fidelity, the fund management company.[14] Metro launched with plans to open 200 branches in London by 2020.[15] Twelve branches were opened by December 2010. In June 2012 the company announced the completion of a £126m round of capital-raising to open further branches in London, including funds from Moore Capital and billionaire investor Steve Cohen.[16][17]
Noted investor Wilbur Ross commented that "The question is whether [Hill’s] promotional flair and service concept will produce enough customers to offset the extra operational cost of providing the extra space".[18]
Hill, who previously served as Metro's vice chairman, replaced his co-founder Anthony Thomson as chairman in January 2013.[19]
As of September 2013 Metro had 225,000 accounts and was opening a new branch every month with a goal of opening 25 by the close of the year.[20] In May, Metro opened a drive-through bank in Slough. the second in the UK after Natwest in Toxteth, Liverpool which opened in 1959 but has since closed in 2013.[21]
In April 2013 Hill was also awarded the Institute of Economic Affairs' Free Enterprise Award whose previous winners include Margaret Thatcher and Sir Richard Branson for his work at Metro. The IEA noted Hill, "has identified a clear opportunity and entered the UK banking scene at a time when the sector has been under constant fire" and showed "incredible perseverance and imagination"[22] while IEA Director General Mark Littlewood praised Metro Bank as "a shining example of innovation improving people's live. It's refreshing to see more competition and choice in the banking sector on our high streets".[22]
In August 2013, Tom Brown of Bankstocks.com wrote: "So Vernon Hill has, not once, but twice, and in two different markets, built growth machines in the supposedly mature and sleepy banking business. That has to make him the world’s greatest growth-oriented banker, probably of all time."[23] In the same month, Hill received the 2013 Stevie Award for International Chairman of the Year.[24]
Book[edit]
Hill is the author of Fans Not Customers: How to Create Growth Companies in a No Growth World, which was released by Profile Books in October 2012.[25] It argues that it is better to have fans rather than customers and urges businesses to compete on service rather than price. The Financial Times reviewed Hill's writing style as "refreshingly to the point" and said that "for those looking for an alternate way of approaching service, the book will prove rich pickings".[26]
Other investments[edit]
Hill is a partner with Steve Lewis in US Restaurants Inc, which operates 40 Burger King restaurants in metropolitan Philadelphia.[27]
Hill's first business was Site Development Inc, a real estate development firm which has developed over 1000 shopping centres and retail developments in America.[28]
In 1994, Hill, along with partners John Silvestri and Steve Lewis, founded and developed Galloway National Golf Club near Atlantic City, New Jersey. The course was designed by Tom Fazio and is ranked by GolfDigest.com as being among the top 100 courses in America.[citation needed]

Early career[edit]
Although known for banking, Hill’s business outlook has been informed by early encounters with retailing. While taking morning classes at Wharton, Hill worked afternoons at a South Jersey bank owned by a local car retailer, where Hill observed the car dealer applying retail principles to banking operations, such as late opening hours. The job also brought Hill into contact with other local retailers, including McDonald's.[1] After graduation Hill founded a real estate firm to find and develop sites for McDonald's, a task which required Hill to drive McDonald's entrepreneur Ray Kroc on scouting trips. Hill claims his experience with McDonald’s taught him the importance of standardised presentation and scale economies in retailing.[2]
Philadelphia Magazine reports that Hill’s experience with McDonald’s led directly to the creation of Commerce Bank. Referring to the creation of Commerce, Morton Kerr, chairman of the board of Markeim-Chalmers, Inc., a South Jersey real estate firm, and one of the original Commerce board members, observed:

“A lot of us knew Vernon from being involved in real estate at that time…He was a 26-year-old kid who called about 15 of us to a meeting in his office. I'll never forget it. He said, 'We're going to start a bank.' And he said we'd each have to put up between $25,000 and $125,000. This was 1973-who had that kind of money? But he'd arranged for all of us to borrow it. If you could put up $100,000, he got us loans for $80,000. Only seven of us didn't get up and walk out, but we still thought he was crazy.”[1]

The deal resulted in Commerce opening its first branch in Marlton, New Jersey, in 1973.
Commerce Bancorp[edit]
Commerce Bank was notable for its rapid expansion, from one branch in 1973 to 470 branches in 2008, and a deposit base that grew by an average of 25% per year between 1996 and 2001 (against an industry average of 5% in 2001). According to Forbes Magazine, Commerce produced a 23% annual shareholder return compounded for 30 years.[3]
Commerce Bank’s economic model rested on the idea that the fixed costs of a bank branch are largely independent of volume, and so profitability lay in maximizing the number of deposits and accounts per branch. Additionally, Hill believed that the industry's reliance on internet banking had led to dis-investment in bank branches, to the detriment of consumers who prioritised in-person service.

“Other banks decided to push consumers out of the branch because it is the high-cost delivery channel. They wanted to push them online. We totally reject that. You can’t name me one retailer in this country that has pushed people where they don’t want to go and succeeded…We have some branches that get 100,000 customer visits a month; the average branch gets 40,000. An average McDonald’s gets 25,000 per month.”[4]

Hill’s motto for Commerce was “America’s most convenient bank”.[5]
Commerce tactics were oriented to drive volume, differentiation and customer advocacy, including:

Longer opening hours, including evenings and weekends; opening ten minutes earlier and later than advertised hours
Removing glass from teller booths for a more open customer experience
Pet-friendly policies
Giveaways such as lollipops and dog biscuits
Free use of coin-counting machines
Handing out pens in response to rival banks’ practice of chaining pens to desks
“Kill the stupid rule” program, whereby employees who suggested an alternative to a stupid rule were paid $50

Commerce Bank staff were awarded $5,000 if a nearby rival bank closed its branches; hundreds of mystery shoppers made tens of thousands of store visits annually, and salary increases were based on mystery shopping scores. Top-performing managers were given sports cars.[6]
On June 29, 2007, Hill resigned as chairman and CEO of Commerce Bancorp after the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the board of directors of Commerce Bancorp established governance to stop doing business with firms under the control of Hill’s family. Notable business dealings with insiders included property leases with entities in which Hill was a partner, and the purchase of services from an architectural design business run by his wife, Shirley.[7] No charges were brought.
On October 2, 2007, Commerce Bancorp announced that it would be merging with TD Bank Financial Group. The Canadian-based Toronto-Dominion Bank would acquire Commerce for $8.5 billion (U.S. dollars) in cash and stock, at $42 per share of CBH stock, a purchase multiple of x28. Some industry commentators held that Hill's departure and a strong Canadian dollar had made a takeover inevitable.[8]
Petplan[edit]
Hill is chairman of Fetch Inc. (aka Petplan North America), a pet health insurance company founded by Chris and Natasha Ashton. It holds the U.S. and Canadian franchise from Petplan of Britain, the world's biggest provider of policies for companion animals. Hill invested in the company in April 2008, believing pet health to be a growth market in the USA.[9]
Speaking to Fortune Magazine in 2010, Hill said: "People used to put down their pets when they got sick. Now they're members of the family. People will want to save them with kidney transplants and hip replacements. This business will be huge."[citation needed]
Metro Bank[edit]
Metro Bank UK was launched in London July 2010, with Hill as co-founder and vice-chairman.
Press commentary at the time centred on Metro being the first high-street bank to open in the United Kingdom for more than 100 years, and upon Hill's belief that the competitive landscape of British banking amounted to a commercial opportunity to lead on service rather than price. In 2010, 85% of the UK market for current accounts was held by the “big five” banking institutions (HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander and Lloyds).[10] In 2008 an official report from the Office of Fair Trading concluded that UK banking was subject to weak competitive pressures and profit-maximising strategies.[11] Forbes Magazine described Metro at launch as "...aiming to disrupt a storied industry dominated by a handful of established players".[12]
In a BBC News interview, Thomson commented that the cost–driven model of traditional British banks required them to discourage customers from visiting branches, whereas Metro Bank’s model actively sought to attract customers into branches, using tactics such as longer opening hours and pet-friendly policies.[13]
The pair spent a further two years securing a £75m launch investment, including funds from New York real estate developer Richard LeFrak, property investors the Reuben brothers and Fidelity, the fund management company.[14] Metro launched with plans to open 200 branches in London by 2020.[15] Twelve branches were opened by December 2010. In June 2012 the company announced the completion of a £126m round of capital-raising to open further branches in London, including funds from Moore Capital and billionaire investor Steve Cohen.[16][17]
Noted investor Wilbur Ross commented that "The question is whether [Hill’s] promotional flair and service concept will produce enough customers to offset the extra operational cost of providing the extra space".[18]
Hill, who previously served as Metro's vice chairman, replaced his co-founder Anthony Thomson as chairman in January 2013.[19]
As of September 2013 Metro had 225,000 accounts and was opening a new branch every month with a goal of opening 25 by the close of the year.[20] In May, Metro opened a drive-through bank in Slough. the second in the UK after Natwest in Toxteth, Liverpool which opened in 1959 but has since closed in 2013.[21]
In April 2013 Hill was also awarded the Institute of Economic Affairs' Free Enterprise Award whose previous winners include Margaret Thatcher and Sir Richard Branson for his work at Metro. The IEA noted Hill, "has identified a clear opportunity and entered the UK banking scene at a time when the sector has been under constant fire" and showed "incredible perseverance and imagination"[22] while IEA Director General Mark Littlewood praised Metro Bank as "a shining example of innovation improving people's live. It's refreshing to see more competition and choice in the banking sector on our high streets".[22]
In August 2013, Tom Brown of Bankstocks.com wrote: "So Vernon Hill has, not once, but twice, and in two different markets, built growth machines in the supposedly mature and sleepy banking business. That has to make him the world’s greatest growth-oriented banker, probably of all time."[23] In the same month, Hill received the 2013 Stevie Award for International Chairman of the Year.[24]
Book[edit]
Hill is the author of Fans Not Customers: How to Create Growth Companies in a No Growth World, which was released by Profile Books in October 2012.[25] It argues that it is better to have fans rather than customers and urges businesses to compete on service rather than price. The Financial Times reviewed Hill's writing style as "refreshingly to the point" and said that "for those looking for an alternate way of approaching service, the book will prove rich pickings".[26]
Other investments[edit]
Hill is a partner with Steve Lewis in US Restaurants Inc, which operates 40 Burger King restaurants in metropolitan Philadelphia.[27]
Hill's first business was Site Development Inc, a real estate development firm which has developed over 1000 shopping centres and retail developments in America.[28]
In 1994, Hill, along with partners John Silvestri and Steve Lewis, founded and developed Galloway National Golf Club near Atlantic City, New Jersey. The course was designed by Tom Fazio and is ranked by GolfDigest.com as being among the top 100 courses in America.[citation needed]
Business philosophy[edit]
Fortune Magazine describes Hill as a “...flamboyant, tradition-stomping American billionaire…the P.T. Barnum of banking”.[29]
Hill has often advocated a business development strategy based on organic growth rather than acquisition, and by generating customer loyalty through service rather than price. Speaking to a 2010 House of Commons Treasury Select Committee on competition and choice in the banking sector, Hill said:

“My opinion is that great retailers never grow by acquisition…If you see yourself as a retailer delivering an unusual service, acquisitions are the easiest way to kill your model…[Organic growth] is slower, but you get what you want at the end. You get a group of people running your model, not somebody else’s model….”[30]

Hill is a critic of the shadow banking system, believing it to largely responsible for the 2007-2012 global financial crisis.

“We have two American banking systems. We have the normal banking system, with 8,000 banks serving consumers and businesses throughout America. Then we developed a shadow banking system…the money market funds, the investment banks, the credit default swaps. The current crisis is really a crisis of this shadow banking system….I think when [banks] are making a loan to, say, a restaurant, the overwhelming majority of banks aren’t playing games. As long as the guy’s paying, it’s a loan that pays back over time. Then we moved into all this exotic stuff — credit default swaps, CDOs. Believe me, no one at Goldman Sachs understands what they have on their books, because these kids are sitting at their computers dreaming this stuff up….”[31]

Hill is often quoted as viewing his banks to be in the retail business rather than the banking business.

“You don't have to think about what time a Home Depot, a McDonald's or a Starbucks is open,” Hill says. “They're open. You just go. My theory was, if you advertise that [your bank is] open on Sunday, the consumer will automatically believe you're open all the time. That message is more important than the savings."

In its 2007 20-20-20 Club, Forbes Magazine lists Hill as one of seven CEOs (along with Warren Buffett and Larry Ellison) of publicly traded companies with tenures of over 20 years to deliver an annual shareholder return in excess of 20%. Commerce produced a 23% annual compounded shareholder return over that time.[3]
Personal life[edit]
Hill is the son of a Virginia real estate brokerage owner and the eldest of six children. He graduated from Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia in 1967, earning a BS in economics with a concentration in finance.
Hill's 46,000 ft² (4,270 m²) home, Villa Collina, is located in Moorestown Township, New Jersey.[32] The home features an orangery.[33] Hill has been married for 40 years to Shirley Hill, who is the founder of InterArch, the architectural and branding firm responsible for the branding for Commerce Bank and Metro Bank. The couple have four children and Sir Duffield, their yorkshire terrier.
The Hill Family Foundation supports various charitable organisations in both the US and Britain. It is one of the largest[citation needed] supporters of veterinary causes, including:

A $10 million gift for the Vernon and Shirley Hill Pavilion at the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Vernon's alma mater.[34]
The Penn World Veterinary Award[35]
The UK Kennel Club Achievement Award[36]

That has to make him the world’s greatest growth-oriented banker, probably of all time."[23] In the same month, Hill received the 2013 Stevie Award for International Chairman of the Year.[24]
Book[edit]
Hill is the author of Fans Not Customers: How to Create Growth Companies in a No Growth World, which was released by Profile Books in October 2012.[25] It argues that it is better to have fans rather than customers and urges businesses to compete on service rather than price. The Financial Times reviewed Hill's writing style as "refreshingly to the point" and said that "for those looking for an alternate way of approaching service, the book will prove rich pickings".[26]
Other investments[edit]
Hill is a partner with Steve Lewis in US Restaurants Inc, which operates 40 Burger King restaurants in metropolitan Philadelphia.[27]
Hill's first business was Site Development Inc, a real estate development firm which has developed over 1000 shopping centres and retail developments in America.[28]
In 1994, Hill, along with partners John Silvestri and Steve Lewis, founded and developed Galloway National Golf Club near Atlantic City, New Jersey. The course was designed by Tom Fazio and is ranked by GolfDigest.com as being among the top 100 courses in America.[citation needed]
Business philosophy[edit]
Fortune Magazine describes Hill as a “...flamboyant, tradition-stomping American billionaire…the P.T. Barnum of banking”.[29]
Hill has often advocated a business development strategy based on organic growth rather than acquisition, and by generating customer loyalty through service rather than price. Speaking to a 2010 House of Commons Treasury Select Committee on competition and choice in the banking sector, Hill said:

“My opinion is that great retailers never grow by acquisition…If you see yourself as a retailer delivering an unusual service, acquisitions are the easiest way to kill your model…[Organic growth] is slower, but you get what you want at the end. You get a group of people running your model, not somebody else’s model….”[30]

Hill is a critic of the shadow banking system, believing it to largely responsible for the 2007-2012 global financial crisis.

“We have two American banking systems. We have the normal banking system, with 8,000 banks serving consumers and businesses throughout America. Then we developed a shadow banking system…the money market funds, the investment banks, the credit default swaps. The current crisis is really a crisis of this shadow banking system….I think when [banks] are making a loan to, say, a restaurant, the overwhelming majority of banks aren’t playing games. As long as the guy’s paying, it’s a loan that pays back over time. Then we moved into all this exotic stuff — credit default swaps, CDOs. Believe me, no one at Goldman Sachs understands what they have on their books, because these kids are sitting at their computers dreaming this stuff up….”[31]

Hill is often quoted as viewing his banks to be in the retail business rather than the banking business.

“You don't have to think about what time a Home Depot, a McDonald's or a Starbucks is open,” Hill says. “They're open. You just go. My theory was, if you advertise that [your bank is] open on Sunday, the consumer will automatically believe you're open all the time. That message is more important than the savings."

In its 2007 20-20-20 Club, Forbes Magazine lists Hill as one of seven CEOs (along with Warren Buffett and Larry Ellison) of publicly traded companies with tenures of over 20 years to deliver an annual shareholder return in excess of 20%. Commerce produced a 23% annual compounded shareholder return over that time.[3]
Personal life[edit]
Hill is the son of a Virginia real estate brokerage owner and the eldest of six children. He graduated from Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia in 1967, earning a BS in economics with a concentration in finance.
Hill's 46,000 ft² (4,270 m²) home, Villa Collina, is located in Moorestown Township, New Jersey.[32] The home features an orangery.[33] Hill has been married for 40 years to Shirley Hill, who is the founder of InterArch, the architectural and branding firm responsible for the branding for Commerce Bank and Metro Bank. The couple have four children and Sir Duffield, their yorkshire terrier.
The Hill Family Foundation supports various charitable organisations in both the US and Britain. It is one of the largest[citation needed] supporters of veterinary causes, including:

A $10 million gift for the Vernon and Shirley Hill Pavilion at the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Vernon's alma mater.[34]
The Penn World Veterinary Award[35]
The UK Kennel Club Achievement Award[36]

Early career[edit]
Although known for banking, Hill’s business outlook has been informed by early encounters with retailing. While taking morning classes at Wharton, Hill worked afternoons at a South Jersey bank owned by a local car retailer, where Hill observed the car dealer applying retail principles to banking operations, such as late opening hours. The job also brought Hill into contact with other local retailers, including McDonald's.[1] After graduation Hill founded a real estate firm to find and develop sites for McDonald's, a task which required Hill to drive McDonald's entrepreneur Ray Kroc on scouting trips. Hill claims his experience with McDonald’s taught him the importance of standardised presentation and scale economies in retailing.[2]
Philadelphia Magazine reports that Hill’s experience with McDonald’s led directly to the creation of Commerce Bank. Referring to the creation of Commerce, Morton Kerr, chairman of the board of Markeim-Chalmers, Inc., a South Jersey real estate firm, and one of the original Commerce board members, observed:

“A lot of us knew Vernon from being involved in real estate at that time…He was a 26-year-old kid who called about 15 of us to a meeting in his office. I'll never forget it. He said, 'We're going to start a bank.' And he said we'd each have to put up between $25,000 and $125,000. This was 1973-who had that kind of money? But he'd arranged for all of us to borrow it. If you could put up $100,000, he got us loans for $80,000. Only seven of us didn't get up and walk out, but we still thought he was crazy.”[1]

The deal resulted in Commerce opening its first branch in Marlton, New Jersey, in 1973.
Commerce Bancorp[edit]
Commerce Bank was notable for its rapid expansion, from one branch in 1973 to 470 branches in 2008, and a deposit base that grew by an average of 25% per year between 1996 and 2001 (against an industry average of 5% in 2001). According to Forbes Magazine, Commerce produced a 23% annual shareholder return compounded for 30 years.[3]
Commerce Bank’s economic model rested on the idea that the fixed costs of a bank branch are largely independent of volume, and so profitability lay in maximizing the number of deposits and accounts per branch. Additionally, Hill believed that the industry's reliance on internet banking had led to dis-investment in bank branches, to the detriment of consumers who prioritised in-person service.

“Other banks decided to push consumers out of the branch because it is the high-cost delivery channel. They wanted to push them online. We totally reject that. You can’t name me one retailer in this country that has pushed people where they don’t want to go and succeeded…We have some branches that get 100,000 customer visits a month; the average branch gets 40,000. An average McDonald’s gets 25,000 per month.”[4]

Hill’s motto for Commerce was “America’s most convenient bank”.[5]
Commerce tactics were oriented to drive volume, differentiation and customer advocacy, including:

Longer opening hours, including evenings and weekends; opening ten minutes earlier and later than advertised hours
Removing glass from teller booths for a more open customer experience
Pet-friendly policies
Giveaways such as lollipops and dog biscuits
Free use of coin-counting machines
Handing out pens in response to rival banks’ practice of chaining pens to desks
“Kill the stupid rule” program, whereby employees who suggested an alternative to a stupid rule were paid $50

Commerce Bank staff were awarded $5,000 if a nearby rival bank closed its branches; hundreds of mystery shoppers made tens of thousands of store visits annually, and salary increases were based on mystery shopping scores. Top-performing managers were given sports cars.[6]
On June 29, 2007, Hill resigned as chairman and CEO of Commerce Bancorp after the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the board of directors of Commerce Bancorp established governance to stop doing business with firms under the control of Hill’s family. Notable business dealings with insiders included property leases with entities in which Hill was a partner, and the purchase of services from an architectural design business run by his wife, Shirley.[7] No charges were brought.
On October 2, 2007, Commerce Bancorp announced that it would be merging with TD Bank Financial Group. The Canadian-based Toronto-Dominion Bank would acquire Commerce for $8.5 billion (U.S. dollars) in cash and stock, at $42 per share of CBH stock, a purchase multiple of x28. Some industry commentators held that Hill's departure and a strong Canadian dollar had made a takeover inevitable.[8]
Petplan[edit]
Hill is chairman of Fetch Inc. (aka Petplan North America), a pet health insurance company founded by Chris and Natasha Ashton. It holds the U.S. and Canadian franchise from Petplan of Britain, the world's biggest provider of policies for companion animals. Hill invested in the company in April 2008, believing pet health to be a growth market in the USA.[9]
Speaking to Fortune Magazine in 2010, Hill said: "People used to put down their pets when they got sick. Now they're members of the family. People will want to save them with kidney transplants and hip replacements. This business will be huge."[citation needed]
Metro Bank[edit]
Metro Bank UK was launched in London July 2010, with Hill as co-founder and vice-chairman.
Press commentary at the time centred on Metro being the first high-street bank to open in the United Kingdom for more than 100 years, and upon Hill's belief that the competitive landscape of British banking amounted to a commercial opportunity to lead on service rather than price. In 2010, 85% of the UK market for current accounts was held by the “big five” banking institutions (HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander and Lloyds).[10] In 2008 an official report from the Office of Fair Trading concluded that UK banking was subject to weak competitive pressures and profit-maximising strategies.[11] Forbes Magazine described Metro at launch as "...aiming to disrupt a storied industry dominated by a handful of established players".[12]
In a BBC News interview, Thomson commented that the cost–driven model of traditional British banks required them to discourage customers from visiting branches, whereas Metro Bank’s model actively sought to attract customers into branches, using tactics such as longer opening hours and pet-friendly policies.[13]
The pair spent a further two years securing a £75m launch investment, including funds from New York real estate developer Richard LeFrak, property investors the Reuben brothers and Fidelity, the fund management company.[14] Metro launched with plans to open 200 branches in London by 2020.[15] Twelve branches were opened by December 2010. In June 2012 the company announced the completion of a £126m round of capital-raising to open further branches in London, including funds from Moore Capital and billionaire investor Steve Cohen.[16][17]
Noted investor Wilbur Ross commented that "The question is whether [Hill’s] promotional flair and service concept will produce enough customers to offset the extra operational cost of providing the extra space".[18]
Hill, who previously served as Metro's vice chairman, replaced his co-founder Anthony Thomson as chairman in January 2013.[19]
As of September 2013 Metro had 225,000 accounts and was opening a new branch every month with a goal of opening 25 by the close of the year.[20] In May, Metro opened a drive-through bank in Slough. the second in the UK after Natwest in Toxteth, Liverpool which opened in 1959 but has since closed in 2013.[21]
In April 2013 Hill was also awarded the Institute of Economic Affairs' Free Enterprise Award whose previous winners include Margaret Thatcher and Sir Richard Branson for his work at Metro. The IEA noted Hill, "has identified a clear opportunity and entered the UK banking scene at a time when the sector has been under constant fire" and showed "incredible perseverance and imagination"[22] while IEA Director General Mark Littlewood praised Metro Bank as "a shining example of innovation improving people's live. It's refreshing to see more competition and choice in the banking sector on our high streets".[22]
In August 2013, Tom Brown of Bankstocks.com wrote: "So Vernon Hill has, not once, but twice, and in two different markets, built growth machines in the supposedly mature and sleepy banking business. That has to make him the world’s greatest growth-oriented banker, probably of all time."[23] In the same month, Hill received the 2013 Stevie Award for International Chairman of the Year.[24]

Hill is the author of Fans Not Customers: How to Create Growth Companies in a No Growth World, which was released by Profile Books in October 2012.[25] It argues that it is better to have fans rather than customers and urges businesses to compete on service rather than price. The Financial Times reviewed Hill's writing style as "refreshingly to the point" and said that "for those looking for an alternate way of approaching service, the book will prove rich pickings".[26]

A Banker’s Last Day at the Office, in a Bank He Built Aggressively

By JEREMY W. PETERS and ERIC DASHJULY 31, 2007

MOORESTOWN, N.J., July 24 — There are no grand sendoffs planned. No speeches, either. In fact, Vernon W. Hill II, who founded Commerce Bank 34 years ago, is not even planning to go to the office on Tuesday.Faced with a federal threat of not being allowed to open any more bank branches unless he stepped aside, the board members of Commerce Bancorp, which Mr. Hill hand-picked, voted last month to remove him as chairman and chief executive effective July 31.How Mr. Hill rose to become so influential a figure in New Jersey business and politics is the story of an ambitious real estate developer who cultivated powerful friends as he built a network of Burger Kings and then banks across the state. It is also a story of pride and excess.“It’s a Greek tragedy,” said Allen Starkie, an executive recruiter at Knightsbridge Advisers, who lured several senior managers to Commerce. “Vernon was an incredibly gifted protagonist who challenged the fates and won, but he developed such extreme hubris that in the end, it undermined his success.”

Mr. Hill’s career has been defined more than anything else by a willingness to defy the establishment. He founded Commerce with a plan to make retail banking more like retail shopping, opening spacious branches when the rest of the industry was scaling back. And in the highly regulated world of public corporations, he openly awarded tens of millions of dollars of contracts to friends and relatives, including about $50 million for his wife, who decorated and designed many of the nearly 450 branches.

In Moorestown, the well-heeled South Jersey town he calls home, he built a 46,000-square-foot Tuscan-style mansion where a farmhouse once stood. Construction of the home, complete with a 4,000-square-foot gym and fountains inside and out, so alienated his neighbors that Moorestown established a historic preservation commission.But last month the establishment pushed back.Under the terms of a cease-and-desist order with federal bank regulators, Commerce agreed to stop signing contracts that entangled the bank with businesses run by its board members, officers and members of their families.But his troubles have not ended there. The federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the bank’s primary regulator, says it is continuing to look into possible insider dealing at Commerce, and two people close to the investigation say the 61-year-old Mr. Hill is at the center of the examination.Mr. Hill’s lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, said in a telephone interview that his client did not believe he had done anything improper. “I can’t believe that he would ever put his interests above those of the bank,” Mr. Bennett said, noting that the business deals in question were all publicly disclosed. “These things were done in the sunshine.”Mr. Hill declined to be interviewed for this article.This was not Commerce Bank’s first brush with the law. In 2004, a federal grand jury indicted two Commerce executives, Glenn K. Holck and Stephen M. Umbrell, on charges of giving loans to the Philadelphia city treasurer in exchange for the city’s financial business. In 2005, the two executives were convicted of conspiracy and the treasurer was found guilty of fraud and conspiracy. Although investigators disclosed that they had taped Mr. Hill talking about business with the treasurer, Mr. Hill  was never charged.The son of a prosperous Virginia real estate developer, Mr. Hill ran the bank as if it were his own personal patronage system. He hired numerous people with deep connections to New Jersey municipal and state governments, and then he hired their relatives. He befriended George E. Norcross III, one of New Jersey’s most influential Democratic politicians, and appointed him chief executive of Commerce Bank’s insurance business. The bank has done business for more than 30 years with the law firm in which Mr. Norcross’s brother is a managing partner, and last year it paid the firm $1.4 million for legal services, a move the bank said in a regulatory filing was not approved by the board.Ever since he opened the first Commerce branch in Marlton, N.J., in 1973 at the age of 27, Mr. Hill was a self-styled maverick with little patience for tradition. Owner of more than 40 Burger Kings, he brought a retail mindset to the banking industry, which never operated that way.

When rivals were closing their branches, Commerce aggressively opened new “stores,” as Mr. Hill called them, and kept them open long past the closing times of other banks. Today it is New Jersey’s largest bank and has reached into New York City, Washington and Palm Beach, Fla. In light of its recent legal troubles, Commerce has scaled back plans to open new branches this year from 65 to about 50.

As its presence in the state grew, so did its political influence. Today the Commerce board includes not only Mr. Norcross, but also a former Senate president and acting governor, Donald T. DiFrancesco, who came on in 2002, and a former chairman of the Ocean County Republican Party, Joseph Buckelew. On the same day in 1996, Mr. Hill purchased the insurance businesses of both Mr. Norcross and Mr. Buckelew and folded them into Commerce.As much as Mr. Hill’s departure from Commerce raises questions about how the bank, based in Cherry Hill, N.J., will fare without its founder — analysts have already speculated that it will soon be sold — it also raises questions about the possible collateral damage to Mr. Norcross.

“The power in South Jersey has been George Norcross,” said Senator Raymond J. Lesniak, a Democratic senator from Union County and former chairman of the Budget and Appropriations Committee. “Vernon was just part of the political empire built by George Norcross.”As Alene Ammond, a former Democratic senator in New Jersey who has clashed publicly with Mr. Norcross, put it: “They formed a cartel. It was a very happy marriage. With George Norcross’s clout as a political boss, he then paved the way throughout the state for them to establish themselves with bonds, insurance — town by town, county by county.”In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Commerce Bank was the largest underwriter of municipal bonds in New Jersey. Indeed, by 2002 it was underwriting more than half of them.Even as its bond business grew, Commerce was making contributions to Democratic and Republican politicians alike through its political action committees. It stopped making the political donations in 2003, as Wall Street analysts and others questioned whether they created conflicts of interest.As far back as 1993 a state grand jury was investigating whether the design company operated by Mr. Hill’s wife, Shirley, was awarded business from Camden County, where Mr. Norcross was then the Democratic Party chairman. When the grand jury subpoenaed phone records, the county said they were inadvertently destroyed. Neither Mrs. Hill nor any county official was ever charged.The business arrangement at Commerce that has attracted the most scrutiny is its relationship with InterArch, the architectural and design company owned by Mrs. Hill. Over the past decade, the bank has paid the company about $50 million to design and furnish bank branches. Last year alone, it paid Mrs. Hill $9.2 million for her services.

In addition to her role as the bank’s chief interior designer, Mrs. Hill became the bank’s de facto protocol officer, making surprise inspections — sometimes with her Yorkie, Sir Duffield, in tow — to ensure that employees were complying with company standards.Mrs. Hill and her husband shared a flare for the flamboyant.At Christmas, he has held lavish parties at their home, Villa Collina, with a different theme, and food, in each room after being greeted by trumpeters and served canapés while Broadway entertainers performed.The bank held annual “Wow Awards” to honor its best employees, renting out Radio City Music Hall for a night of festivities for hundreds of workers, with Mr. Hill escorted to the stage arm-in-arm with two sequined Rockettes.Mr. Hill’s neighbors are familiar with his grand scale.  When the couple was building their mansion on a wooded 44 acres here, they complained of a parade of construction vehicles: earth movers, dump trucks, water tankers to fill the artificial ponds on the property. Then there were the helicopters overhead at all hours. One neighbor said she asked why the helicopters were necessary, and was told by a construction worker it was so Mrs. Hill could give orders to construction crews through a megaphone.“I work at home, and when I say there was one dump truck a minute going in and out, I’m not kidding,” said Jeannie Roulet, a quilt maker who lives on the street the Hills use to get to their service entrance. “I have the cracks in our plaster to prove it.”

A Banker’s Last Day at the Office, in a Bank He Built Aggressively

September 26, 2015 Lawrence Christopher Skufca, J.D. Leave a comment



 

Published: July 31, 2007

By JEREMY W. PETERS and ERIC DASH


MOORESTOWN, N.J., July 24 — There are no grand sendoffs planned. No speeches, either. In fact, Vernon W. Hill II, who founded Commerce Bank 34 years ago, is not even planning to go to the office on Tuesday.




Faced with a federal threat of not being allowed to open any more bank branches unless he stepped aside, the board members of Commerce Bancorp, which Mr. Hill hand-picked, voted last month to remove him as chairman and chief executive effective July 31.



How Mr. Hill rose to become so influential a figure in New Jersey business and politics is the story of an ambitious real estate developer who cultivated powerful friends as he built a network of Burger Kings and then banks across the state. It is also a story of pride and excess.
“It’s a Greek tragedy,” said Allen Starkie, an executive recruiter at Knightsbridge Advisers, who lured several senior managers to Commerce. “Vernon was an incredibly gifted protagonist who challenged the fates and won, but he developed such extreme hubris that in the end, it undermined his success.”
Mr. Hill’s career has been defined more than anything else by a willingness to defy the establishment. He founded Commerce with a plan to make retail banking more like retail shopping, opening spacious branches when the rest of the industry was scaling back. And in the highly regulated world of public corporations, he openly awarded tens of millions of dollars of contracts to friends and relatives, including about $50 million for his wife, who decorated and designed many of the nearly 450 branches.
In Moorestown, the well-heeled South Jersey town he calls home, he built a 46,000-square-foot Tuscan-style mansion where a farmhouse once stood. Construction of the home, complete with a 4,000-square-foot gym and fountains inside and out, so alienated his neighbors that Moorestown established a historic preservation commission.
But last month the establishment pushed back.
Under the terms of a cease-and-desist order with federal bank regulators, Commerce agreed to stop signing contracts that entangled the bank with businesses run by its board members, officers and members of their families.
But his troubles have not ended there. The federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the bank’s primary regulator, says it is continuing to look into possible insider dealing at Commerce, and two people close to the investigation say the 61-year-old Mr. Hill is at the center of the examination.
Mr. Hill’s lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, said in a telephone interview that his client did not believe he had done anything improper. “I can’t believe that he would ever put his interests above those of the bank,” Mr. Bennett said, noting that the business deals in question were all publicly disclosed. “These things were done in the sunshine.”
Mr. Hill declined to be interviewed for this article.
This was not Commerce Bank’s first brush with the law. In 2004, a federal grand jury indicted two Commerce executives, Glenn K. Holck and Stephen M. Umbrell, on charges of giving loans to the Philadelphia city treasurer in exchange for the city’s financial business. In 2005, the two executives were convicted of conspiracy and the treasurer was found guilty of fraud and conspiracy. Although investigators disclosed that they had taped Mr. Hill talking about business with the treasurer, Mr. Hill was never charged.
The son of a prosperous Virginia real estate developer, Mr. Hill ran the bank as if it were his own personal patronage system. He hired numerous people with deep connections to New Jersey municipal and state governments, and then he hired their relatives. He befriended George E. Norcross III, one of New Jersey’s most influential Democratic politicians, and appointed him chief executive of Commerce Bank’s insurance business. The bank has done business for more than 30 years with the law firm in which Mr. Norcross’s brother is a managing partner, and last year it paid the firm $1.4 million for legal services, a move the bank said in a regulatory filing was not approved by the board.
Ever since he opened the first Commerce branch in Marlton, N.J., in 1973 at the age of 27, Mr. Hill was a self-styled maverick with little patience for tradition. Owner of more than 40 Burger Kings, he brought a retail mindset to the banking industry, which never operated that way.
When rivals were closing their branches, Commerce aggressively opened new “stores,” as Mr. Hill called them, and kept them open long past the closing times of other banks. Today it is New Jersey’s largest bank and has reached into New York City, Washington and Palm Beach, Fla. In light of its recent legal troubles, Commerce has scaled back plans to open new branches this year from 65 to about 50.
As its presence in the state grew, so did its political influence. Today the Commerce board includes not only Mr. Norcross, but also a former Senate president and acting governor,Donald T. DiFrancesco, who came on in 2002, and a former chairman of the Ocean County Republican Party, Joseph Buckelew. On the same day in 1996, Mr. Hill purchased the insurance businesses of both Mr. Norcross and Mr. Buckelew and folded them into Commerce.
As much as Mr. Hill’s departure from Commerce raises questions about how the bank, based in Cherry Hill, N.J., will fare without its founder — analysts have already speculated that it will soon be sold — it also raises questions about the possible collateral damage to Mr. Norcross.

“The power in South Jersey has been George Norcross,” said Senator Raymond J. Lesniak, a Democratic senator from Union County and former chairman of the Budget and Appropriations Committee. “Vernon was just part of the political empire built by George Norcross.”
As Alene Ammond, a former Democratic senator in New Jersey who has clashed publicly with Mr. Norcross, put it: “They formed a cartel. It was a very happy marriage. With George Norcross’s clout as a political boss, he then paved the way throughout the state for them to establish themselves with bonds, insurance — town by town, county by county.”
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Commerce Bank was the largest underwriter of municipal bonds in New Jersey. Indeed, by 2002 it was underwriting more than half of them.
Even as its bond business grew, Commerce was making contributions to Democratic and Republican politicians alike through its political action committees. It stopped making the political donations in 2003, as Wall Street analysts and others questioned whether they created conflicts of interest.
As far back as 1993 a state grand jury was investigating whether the design company operated by Mr. Hill’s wife, Shirley, was awarded business from Camden County, where Mr. Norcross was then the Democratic Party chairman. When the grand jury subpoenaed phone records, the county said they were inadvertently destroyed. Neither Mrs. Hill nor any county official was ever charged.
The business arrangement at Commerce that has attracted the most scrutiny is its relationship with InterArch, the architectural and design company owned by Mrs. Hill. Over the past decade, the bank has paid the company about $50 million to design and furnish bank branches. Last year alone, it paid Mrs. Hill $9.2 million for her services.
In addition to her role as the bank’s chief interior designer, Mrs. Hill became the bank’s de facto protocol officer, making surprise inspections — sometimes with her Yorkie, Sir Duffield, in tow — to ensure that employees were complying with company standards.

Mrs. Hill and her husband shared a flare for the flamboyant.
At Christmas, he has held lavish parties at their home, Villa Collina, with a different theme, and food, in each room after being greeted by trumpeters and served canapés while Broadway entertainers performed.
The bank held annual “Wow Awards” to honor its best employees, renting out Radio City Music Hall for a night of festivities for hundreds of workers, with Mr. Hill escorted to the stage arm-in-arm with two sequined Rockettes.
Mr. Hill’s neighbors are familiar with his grand scale. When the couple was building their mansion on a wooded 44 acres here, they complained of a parade of construction vehicles: earth movers, dump trucks, water tankers to fill the artificial ponds on the property. Then there were the helicopters overhead at all hours. One neighbor said she asked why the helicopters were necessary, and was told by a construction worker it was so Mrs. Hill could give orders to construction crews through a megaphone.
“I work at home, and when I say there was one dump truck a minute going in and out, I’m not kidding,” said Jeannie Roulet, a quilt maker who lives on the street the Hills use to get to their service entrance. “I have the cracks in our plaster to prove it.”

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
