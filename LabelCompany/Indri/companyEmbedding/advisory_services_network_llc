Tom C. Prescott 

Tom C . Prescott is a founder and Managing Member of Advisory Services Network, LLC. Mr. Prescott brings 34 years of Financial Services Industry and consulting experience to the firm.
Mr. Prescott began his career in the Financial Services Industry in 1980 with Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb, Inc. Mr. Prescott underwent extensive training in various areas within the firm including operations, compliance, trading desk, as well as institutional and high net worth sales.
Mr. Prescott became a registered representative with Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb, Inc. in 1982. He successfully built and managed both retail and institutional client relationships, providing investment advice in the areas of portfolio management, asset allocation, stocks, bonds, options, limited partnerships, and other investment related services. Following the merger of Shearson American Express and Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb, Mr. Prescott and several other professionals left the firm to create an Atlanta branch office for a New York based firm specializing in taking small to medium sized companies public. In his capacity with the firm, Mr. Prescott called on both retail and institutional clientele and assisted in the recruitment and training of both professional and staff positions. In addition, he was instrumental in setting up the operations and compliance functions of the office. In 1986, Mr. Prescott returned to the institutional side of the business, working for Interstate Securities on the institutional fixed income desk. While at Interstate, Mr. Prescott’s customer base included banks (both portfolio and trust departments), money managers, hedge funds, pension funds, mutual funds, and broker/dealers.
As a result of Mr. Prescott’s experience within the industry, he recognized a need for a consulting firm to assist financial institutions with sales and internal growth, operational problems, clearance issues, compliance, and regulatory concerns. In 1987, Mr. Prescott formed Prescott & Associates to provide comprehensive consulting services to broker/dealers, investment advisers, banks, money managers, pension plans, corporations, and securities attorneys. Subsequently, Prescott & Associates merged with another consulting firm to create Mainstay Capital Markets Consultants, Inc.(“Mainstay”).
Mr. Prescott continues his consulting practice with Mainstay and provides services to both domestic and foreign clients including: retail and institutional broker/dealers, investment advisors, investment companies, mutual fund complexes, insurance companies, banks, thrifts, and hedge funds. Additionally, he has participated in overseas capital markets projects sponsored by USAID.
While operating Mainstay, Mr. Prescott founded Advisory Services Network, LLC (“ASN”). ASN is an Atlanta-based Registered Investment Adviser that registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2010. ASN was created to serve as a true strategic partner and is a new option for those Investment Advisor Representatives and Register Representatives who seek independence without creating or operating their own investment advisory firm. ASN provides services and support as part of a larger corporate entity and frame work.

Business Continuity Plan Summary 

In recognition of the potential for significant business disruptions that may result from large-scale disasters, Advisory Services Network, LLC (“ASN”) has created a Business Continuity Plan (the “Plan”) to help minimize the impact that such disruptions might have to its business operations. The Plan is designed primarily to address those functions ASN deems to be “mission critical” and includes:

Ensuring the physical safety of ASN employees and investment advisory representatives (“IARs”);
Data back-up and recovery (both hard copy and electronic);
Communications between ASN, its IARs, and clients;
Communications between ASN and the custodians that hold the investment assets of its clients;
Ensuring that clients have access to their investment assets;
Communications between ASN and its critical business constituents (i.e., banks, service providers, vendors, etc.); and
Communications between ASN and federal and state regulatory organizations.

Should ASN be affected by a significant business disruption, ASN will take steps to promptly notify clients of the nature of the disruption and its affect on ASN operations, the steps being taken by ASN to address the disruption, and an estimate of the amount of time it will take for ASN to resume operations. The manner in which this communication will occur will depend on the specific disruption experienced and its impact on the communication options available.
As ASN’s IARs are geographically dispersed, significant business disruptions may affect individual IARs. ASN has established mechanisms to ensure that both it and its IARs have access to sufficient information about each client to provide continuing service should one or the other be affected by a disruption.
ASN utilizes the custodial services of Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, Pershing and Charles Schwab for the accounts of our clients. Clients may communicte directly with these custodians at the following phone numbers or via their websites for access to your account, including the acceptance of buy and sell orders and issuance of funds:
Fidelity
(800) 544-6666
www.fidelity.com
Charles Schwab
(800) 435-4000
www.schwab.com

TD Ameritrade
(800) 431-3500
www.tdainstitutional.com
Pershing
(201) 413-3635
www.pershing.com


Because of its reliance on its custodians and service providers, ASN has taken steps to ensure that they have established their own Business Continuity Plans. ASN will communicate to clients any disruptions to the business activities of these entities that could affect the service ASN provides.

CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) was downgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “buy” rating to a “hold” rating in a report released on Monday. 
According to Zacks, “CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period.”
Several other equities analysts have also recently weighed in on CA. Citigroup Inc.  reissued a “neutral” rating and set a $34.00 price objective (up previously from $33.00) on shares of CA in a research report on Sunday, May 14th. DA Davidson  reissued a “neutral” rating and set a $12.00 price objective on shares of CA in a research report on Friday, May 19th. BidaskClub cut CA from a “hold” rating to a “sell” rating in a research report on Saturday, July 1st. Raymond James Financial, Inc.  reissued a “market perform” rating on shares of CA in a research report on Thursday, June 22nd. Finally, Sanford C. Bernstein  reissued an “underperform” rating and set a $28.00 price objective on shares of CA in a research report on Wednesday, June 28th. Four equities research analysts have rated the stock with a sell rating, eight have assigned  a hold rating and five have given a buy rating to the stock. CA currently has an average rating of “Hold” and an average price target of $35.10.




Shares of CA (NASDAQ CA) opened at 34.06 on Monday. The company’s 50 day moving average price is $33.34 and its 200 day moving average price is $32.43. The stock has a market capitalization of $14.23 billion, a P/E ratio of 18.41 and a beta of 0.87. CA has a one year low of $30.01 and a one year high of $36.54. 
CA (NASDAQ:CA) last released its quarterly earnings results on Thursday, May 11th. The technology company reported $0.54 earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter, topping the consensus estimate of $0.49 by $0.05.
