      Economic cost    

Diabetes imposes a large economic burden on national healthcare systems:

Healthcare expenditures on diabetes will account for 11.6% of the total healthcare expenditure in the world in 2010.
About 95% of the countries will spend 5% or more, and about 80% of the countries will spend between 5% and 13% of their total healthcare dollars on diabetes.
Global health expenditures to prevent and treat diabetes and its complications will total at least $376 billion in 2010.
By 2030, this number will exceed $490 billion.
Expressed in International Dollars (ID), which correct for differences in purchasing power, the global expenditures on diabetes will be at least ID 418 billion in 2010, and at least ID 561 billion in 2030.
An average of $703 (ID 878) per person will be spent on diabetes in 2010 globally.

Expenditures spent on diabetes care are not evenly distributed across age and gender groups. More than three-quarters of the global expenditure in 2010 will be used for persons who are between 50 and 80 years of age. Also, more money is expected to be spent on diabetes care for women than for men.
There is a large disparity in healthcare spending on diabetes between regions and countries:

More than 80% of the global expenditures on diabetes are made in the world’s economically richest countries, not in the low- and middle-income countries where 80% of people with diabetes will soon live.
The North American and Caribbean Region will spend $214 billion, or 57% of the global total on diabetes in 2010.
In contrast, the African Region will spend, in total, $1.4 billion for diabetes, or 0.4% of the global total.
The United States of America (USA), will alone spend $198 billion, or 52.7% of global expenditures.
India, the country with the largest population of people living with diabetes, will spend an estimated $2.8 billion, or less than 1% of the global total.

The largest economic burden caused by diabetes is the monetary value associated with disability and loss of life as a result of the disease itself and its related complications, including heart, kidney, eye and foot disease. Economists have used different methods to value disability and loss of life associated with diseases and the most appropriate method is still under debate. No matter what method is used, it is very likely the economic burden that is measured by the monetary value associated with this disability and loss of life would be far larger than the estimated economic burden using measures described above.
Fortunately, the economic burden of diabetes can be reduced by implementing many inexpensive, easy-to-use interventions, and most of the interventions are cost-effective or cost-saving, even in the poorest countries. Tragically, these interventions are not widely used in poor and middle income countries. More resources should be invested to deliver these cost effective interventions, in particular to those in the developing countries where the great majority of persons with diabetes live.

      About Us    

Cell MedX Corp. is an early development stage company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapeutic products for patients with diseases such as diabetes by developing technologies to help manage the illness and related complications.
The future of healthcare is a renewed priority and is dedicated to helping people stay healthy. Emerging practices and technologies are being used to detect and treat medical problems sooner and all with the ultimate goal of achieving better health outcomes. Traditionally, healthcare has evolved around treating illness with chemical (pharmaceuticals). However at Cell MedX, we have expanded the management of difficult chronic illnesses like diabetes to encompass electro-chemical methods of treatment and are achieving exceptional results.
Many universities are still teaching that life is based on a chemical model. Given the explosive growth in electrical technologies and our ever increasing understanding of physics, it is more realistic in the 21st century to view biological processes on an electrochemical basis rather than on a chemical basis alone. What may seem like a subtle shift could have major implications for the healthcare industry. The growing aging population worldwide, the increasing number of people with chronic conditions, expanded regulatory requirements, insufficient healthcare resources, and rising costs are all burdening today’s health system, and creating the impetus for major changes.
Everyone knows they should have a healthy lifestyle, but knowing what to do and which tools to use can be overwhelming.

Patients can now manage diets, medications and health goals much easier.
In addition, social networking sites enable people to connect with others with the same medical issues to discuss options and available resources.
Combining this knowledge with the creation of effective medical devices now puts healthcare in a new medical context that is direct-to-consumer wellness.

At Cell MedX we are at the leading edge in the development of devices that treat chronic and acute conditions for both clinical and self-management care. We are pioneering safe, results oriented technologies combining electro-chemical applications and establishing new levels of treatment, known as cellular medicine.

Simultaneously with the progress of the Trial, the Company continues to work on the development and further improvements of its eBalance Technology in Canada and expects to have its first order of Canadian-built eBalance Pro devices completed by late July, in time for the conclusion of the Trial.
As part of its distribution model, the Company has entered into negotiations with Cascadia Health 2020 Corporation, to act as its representative and distributor in all of Canada (the “Distributor”). In order to secure the right for exclusive distributorship, the Distributor must place an order for a minimum of 50 devices by end of July 2017; in addition, the Distributor paid the Company a Cdn$7,500 deposit for the right to finalize the letter of intent, which is expected to be signed by mid July 2017.  
Mr. McEnulty, the Company’s President and CEO, stated, “We are very excited to see our Trial progressing as fast as it has been! The fact that Dr. Tytus was able to recruit all 30 subjects within such a short time and with a minimal drop-out rate gives us confidence that our eBalance Pro is very well positioned in the current market. We are convinced that our new distribution partnership and forthcoming completion of the first Canadian-built order will ensure that the eBalance Therapy will become available for general public in a very near future and will provide long awaited relief to the individuals suffering with complications of diabetes and those who simply want to improve their overall wellness.”

Forward Looking Statements
The information included in this press release has not been reviewed by the FDA, nor has it been peer reviewed. This press release contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are identified by words such as “expects”, “intends”, “estimates”, “projects”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “could”, and other similar words. All statements addressing product performance, events, or developments that the Company expects or anticipates will occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Because the statements are forward-looking, they should be evaluated in light of important risk factors and uncertainties, some of which are described in the Company’s Quarterly, Annual and Current Reports filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of the Company’s underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those currently anticipated. In addition, undue reliance should not be placed on Company’s forward-looking statements. In particular, the Company’s eBalance technology is still in development.  Except as required by law, Cell MedX Corp. disclaims any obligation to update or publicly announce any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained in this press release. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate and actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. No stock exchange, securities commission or other regulatory body has reviewed nor accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release. Investors are advised to carefully review the reports and documents that Cell MedX Corp. files from time to time with the SEC, including its Annual, Quarterly and Current Reports.
