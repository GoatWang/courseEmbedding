Joseph Edelman | about.meJoseph EdelmanJoseph Edelman serves as Chief Executive Officer and founder of Perceptive Advisors LLC, a New York City-based hedge fund that specializes in biotechnology stocks. Debuting in 1999, Perceptive Advisors proved to be a multimillion-dollar success within its first year of operation. Joseph Edelman produced net earnings of 128.57 percent at the close of 1999, which was followed by his pinnacle returns of 154.89 percent in 2000. At the conclusion of 2010, the firm oversaw funds of $380 million and, as of May 2011, Perceptive Advisors maintains assets of more than $400 million. In 1980, Joseph Edelman earned a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology, graduating magna cum laude from the University of California, San Diego. He contemplated a graduate-level degree in Psychopharmacology, which would establish a foundation for a career in psychology and neuroscience like his father, Isidore Edelman, but he concluded that he wanted to embark on his own professional path. Several years later, after exploring the world of finance and investment, Joseph Edelman studied at the Leonard N. Stern School of Business at New York University, graduating in 1988 with a Master of Business Administration. Although their educational backgrounds differed, Mr. Edelman believes that much of his scientific critical analysis was inherited from his father. On a personal note, Joseph Edelman likes to sing and play rhythm guitar in a rock ’n’ roll cover band. A community philanthropist, he has supported the Centurion Foundation as well as the Whitney Museum of American Art.#josephedelman

About       Julian Edelman Autographed Memorabilia & Collectibles
Historical Julian Edelman Milestones
Julian Edelman is one of the best wide receivers in the NFL right now. This New England Patriots superstar has become one of the most effective offensive weapons in the league since his 2009 NFL Draft by the Patriots. Edelman played college football for the Kent State Golden Flashes where he started at quarterback. While playing for the Golden Flashes Edelman was one of the top players in the Mid-American Conference and was a dual threat quarterback who had 2,483 career rushing yards.
Over the course of Edelman’s ongoing NFL career he has been a nightmare for defenses across the league. Edelman has continually finished among the top reception and total yardage leaders in the NFL. In addition to playing wide receiver for the Patriots Edelman also returns kicks and punts and has been named the AFC Special Teams Player of the Week multiple times. Edelman has played a key role in leading the Patriots to Super Bowl victories at Super Bowls XLIX and LI over the Seattle Seahawks and Atlanta Falcons respectively.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Zappos.com has received 4.67 out of 5 stars based on 8 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
