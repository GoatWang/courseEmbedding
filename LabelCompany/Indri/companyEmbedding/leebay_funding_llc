Products and Services | YORK FUNDING LLC | YORK FUNDING LLC Products and ServicesOur approach and discretionary funds enable us to provide fast and flexible capital.York Funding will review your deal in 48 hoursFrom review to closing in less than 2 weeksYork Funding has full discretion over its investment capitalLong-term investments – up to 3 yearsNo pre-payment penalties on fixed interest loansHard Money LendingWe have over 40 years of combined experience in investment real estate financingYork Funding is a ‘bridge’ lender to real estate professionals in the acquisition and renovation of one-to-four family houses, multi-family apartment buildings, mixed-use properties, commercial properties, and new construction nationwide. Hard money loans, sometimes referred to as bridge loans, are short-term mortgages that seasoned real estate investors use to finance an investment project. This type of loan is often used for house flippers (fix and flip), developers, renovators, and speculators whose goal is to renovate or develop a property to sell or refinance. Unlike traditional banks and inexperienced lenders, we have the ability to underwrite, evaluate, and fund loans faster and more efficiently with our common sense approach.Learn MoreUltra Short Transactional FundingSame day and up to 90 day fundsTransactional Funding is a two step process for deals that require an intermediary between an original buyer and end buyer, a situation that may occur with many lenders. Typically, most lenders will not allow contract assignments and instead require the original buyer to provide funds immediately upon purchase, regardless of when they anticipate transferring it to the end buyer in a secondary sale. These initial funds can be borrowed for anywhere between 0 and 90 days in order to satisfy the requirements of the bank for the initial purchase before the funds from the end buyer are attained. All standard underwriting procedures are still followed.Learn MoreJoint VenturesCall us to discuss your next dealYork Funding gets creative with joint venture real estate projects with select borrowers.

RD Legal Funding, LLC's Fees Acceleration Product Helps Plaintiffs And Plaintiffs’ Attorneys Cash In Now
date: 03/23/2016

Cresskill, NJ: For 19 years, RD Legal Funding, LLC (“RD Legal”) has been helping plaintiffs and their attorneys access capital through their Fee Acceleration product and they are reaffirming their commitment to both communities. RD Legal has provided and will continue to provide assistance to plaintiffs and plaintiff attorneys experiencing payment delays on their settled cases. For plaintiffs’ attorneys that funding can be used for a variety of reasons, including reinvesting in their practice, advertising for new cases, continued financing on existing cases, or expanding their office. For plaintiffs, our funding can be used for a variety of reasons including personal and medical expenses. RD Legal’s Fee Acceleration product was designed by the founder of RD Legal Funding, Roni Dersovitz. As a former litigator, Dersovitz intimately understood the problems plaintiffs’ attorneys and their clients have or can deal with while practicing and intuitively designed the product to their advantage. 

“Plaintiffs’ attorneys only survive by a steady cash flow, so when their fees are delayed it can become detrimental to them. I want to see the attorney cash in,” says Dersovitz. “After a settlement is reached plaintiffs may have to wait an extended period of time before they receive compensation, we are able to help them as well.” 

A majority of companies in the lawsuit funding space are focused on commercial litigation or pre-settlement funding. RD Legal is an originator of post-settlement funding and remains solely dedicated to it today. With decades of experience working with a variety of cases, they can operate without the restrictions that newer and less experienced companies can sometimes have. 
“Many of the companies in the legal funding space can only provide small dollars to a plaintiff or plaintiffs’ attorney who typically needs more than what they can offer. That isn’t a problem at RD Legal, our starting point is $20,000 and it can go over $20 million,” says Dersovitz. 

For any plaintiffs or plaintiffs’ attorneys looking for funding on their settled case, RD Legal is ready to provide it through their Fee Acceleration product. To find out more information, please contact RD Legal at 800-565-5177 and speak to one of their legal funding representatives. Plaintiffs’ attorneys and their clients interested in settled case funding can also fill out the application on RD Legal’s website, www.legalfunding.com

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
