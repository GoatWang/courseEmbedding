Aloha,
Welcome to Kaanapali Land Management Corp.’s official website. We are pleased to share 
	 with you information about our company, our current projects, and updates on our 
	 community-based planning efforts.
Our company's vision of “Honoring our roots. Preserving our spirit.”  best exemplifies in our mission statement:
“As responsible land managers for the community, we will strive to protect the land by 
	nurturing Maui’s water and open space resources, encouraging productivity of agricultural 
	and environmental sustainability, promoting cultural preservation, and enhancing our island’s 
	way of life. Through these efforts we are committed to honoring our roots and preserving our 
	spirit.”

Over the years, our company has made a true commitment to preserving agriculture in West Maui 
	through our subsidiary Kaanapali Farm Services and our joint venture with 
	MauiGrown Coffee, Inc. 
	We value our working relationships with such worthy organizations as Maui Cultural Lands in preserving 
	the cultural treasures of Honokowai Valley; and we also actively encourage sound stewardship practices 
	in the planning process for our development projects - Ka‘anapali 2020, 
	Pu‘ukoli‘i Village Mauka, Waine‘e and 
	Ka‘anapali Coffee Farms.
As a long-time kama‘aina (local), land-holding company, we have seen Maui grow. We have 
	witnessed and understand the opportunities and challenges to preserve our island’s quality 
	of life, and we have learned many lessons through the years. 
	The most important of which is involving the community and working together to bring about a brighter future for Maui. 
	We encourage you to learn more about our projects, and to get involved in our community-based 
	planning efforts. A big mahalo to the many residents who have contributed to the vision of 
	West Maui.
Malama ka`aina (care for the land).
