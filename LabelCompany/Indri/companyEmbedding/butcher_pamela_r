SUGAR LAND, Texas, Nov. 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Trecora Resources (NYSE:   TREC), a leading provider of high purity specialty hydrocarbons and waxes, today announced that Pamela R. Butcher has been appointed as an independent director to the Board of Directors of the Company, effective November 17, 2016.  Ms. Butcher will serve on the Nominations and Governance and the Compensation Committees of the Board.  This brings the total number of Board members for the Company to eight, six of whom are considered independent.


Ms. Butcher has over 35 years of industry experience primarily in specialty chemicals.  Over the past six years she was the CEO, President and Chief Operating Officer of Pilot Chemical Corp., a global specialty chemical company.  She joined Pilot after a successful 29-year career with The Dow Chemical Company where she held a variety of executive leadership positions including Business Vice President of Specialty Chemicals, Vice President of Corporate Marketing & Sales and Vice President and General Manager of Adhesives and Sealants.  She was a distinguished recipient of Dow's Genesis Award for people excellence, which is Dow's highest recognition for people leadership.

Ms. Butcher holds a Bachelor's Degree in Agronomy and a Master's of Science Degree from Purdue University.  Ms. Butcher has served on the board of trustees for the Chemical Educational Foundation and on the Board of the American Cleaning Institute, the Ohio Manufacturing Association, and the Regional Advisory Board of US Bank.  She is currently also on the Board of Directors of the Pilot Chemical Corp. and Quality Distribution, Inc.

Produce
Our produce is a sight to behold. It's like we got it from Central Casting: a visual feast of color, variety and sparkling freshness piled high for your pleasure and convenience. Cue the credits.



Meat & Poultry
If you’re looking for “natural meat,” we’re looking out for you, because that term only means no additives in the finished product. We go further with great-tasting meat from animals raised with no antibiotics, ever, and no added hormones*. Plus, our farmer and rancher partners follow strict standards for farm-animal welfare. And we’ve got you covered when it comes to local, grass-fed and organic, too.



Seafood
Our Seafood Department is the top reason many shoppers give for coming to our stores. Not only will you find a wide selection of fresh and frozen, high-quality seafood, we source only from sustainable fisheries and responsible farms. You can shop with confidence, and our fishmongers are ready with a smile.

Meat Standards that Exceed the Standard
Shopping for meat and meat products shouldn’t be a guessing game. In our meat department, you can count on high standards for the quality and sourcing of everything from fresh ground beef to frozen gluten-free chicken nuggets. In addition to everyday basics, you might find goose, duck, pheasant, Cornish hens, quail or goat in our stores. No matter what you choose, we’ve got standards like nowhere else.

Leading the Herd with Farm Animal Welfare 
Long before you pick up a steak or chicken breasts at our meat counter, our farmer and rancher partners were caring for the animals. Those farms and ranches are audited regularly to ensure our standards for how the animals were raised. Beyond labels such as free range, pasture raised, local or heritage, our animal-welfare standards apply to everything in our meat department, so you can shop with confidence.

A Step Above: 5-Step® Animal Welfare**
For fresh chicken, beef, pork and turkey at our meat counter, we require additional animal-welfare standards, adhering to the Global Animal Partnership 5-Step® Animal Welfare Rating**. Third-party certified, and traceable back to the source, each item displays its rating right on the sign in the meat case.

At Your Service with Butchers, Selection and Cooking Ideas
Cooking at home is easier than ever. Our butchers are here to help you choose the best cut for your needs and give you cooking tips. Plus, our cases are loaded with dinner shortcuts such as marinated or seasoned kabobs, chicken breasts, meatloaf and more. If you don’t see what you want, they’ll cut or season for you. And, when you’re short on inspiration, check out our kitchen-tested recipes with nutrition facts. 


Meet the Ranchers: Panorama Meats
Panorama Organic Grass-Fed Beef cattle are raised by family ranchers in Northern California, Southern Oregon, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado on USDA Certified Organic pastures of natural grasses, legumes and range forage. Their cattle are 100 percent grass-fed and grass-finished.




*Federal regulations prohibit the use of hormones in raising pork, poultry, goat, veal and bison.
**Pork sold in our Northern California and Rocky Mountain regions may not currently meet the 5-Step® Animal Welfare rating requirement. Pork products continue to meet all other quality standards.
