  Each of the variable annuity products listed above offers one or more of the
following funds of the RS Variable Products Trust as an underlying investment option: RS Large Cap Alpha VIP Series; RS Small Cap Growth Equity VIP Series; RS International VIP Series; RS Emerging Markets VIP Series; RS Investment Quality Bond VIP
Series; 
 









 

 
 



RS Low Duration Bond VIP Series; RS High Yield VIP Series; and RS S&P 500 Index VIP Series (collectively, the RS Funds). Subject to regulatory, boards of trustees and shareholders
approvals, the following changes will take place regarding the investment management of the RS Funds.    Victory Capital Management Inc. (Victory Capital), a multi-boutique asset management firm, has agreed to acquire RS Investment Management Co. LLC (RS Investments), the investment
adviser to the RS Funds. The transaction, which is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2016, is subject to regulatory approvals in addition to customary closing conditions and consents, including approvals related to the RS Funds,
described below.    RS Investments anticipates recommending to the
Board of Trustees of RS Variable Products Trust that each of the RS Funds reorganize into a corresponding, newly-formed fund within the Victory family of funds with similar investment objectives, strategies, and risks (each, an Acquiring
Fund). Victory Capital will serve as the investment adviser to each Acquiring Fund. RS Investments anticipates that each Acquiring Fund will be managed by the same investment management team as currently manages the corresponding RS Fund
(whether at RS Investments or, as applicable, the relevant sub-adviser) except that RS Investments anticipates that it will recommend that RS Investment Quality Bond VIP Series and RS Low Duration Bond VIP Series reorganize into corresponding
Acquiring Funds managed by INCORE Capital Management, an existing Victory Capital investment franchise, and RS S&P 500 Index VIP Series reorganize into an Acquiring Fund managed by Compass EMP, an existing Victory Capital investment franchise.
The reorganizations are subject to approval by shareholders of the RS Funds and the boards of trustees of RS Variable Products Trust and Victory Variable Insurance Funds. 
  As always, the availability of any investment option is subject to change.
See your prospectus for more information concerning the addition, deletion or substitution of investments.    Except as set forth herein, all other provisions of the prospectuses noted above, as heretofore supplemented, shall remain unchanged. 
  THIS PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT MUST BE PRECEDED OR ACCOMPANIED
BY THE MOST RECENT PROSPECTUS FOR THE APPLICABLE PRODUCT AND SHOULD BE RETAINED WITH THE PROSPECTUS FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.

PROSPECTUS FOR PARK AVENUE VUL -- MILLENNIUM SERIES(R)                          

 Issued by The Guardian Separate Account N

This prospectus describes Park Avenue VUL -- Millennium Series(R) (Park Avenue  
VUL), a variable universal life insurance policy providing lifetime insurance   
protection. It also offers flexibility in the timing and amount of the premiums 
you pay, how your premiums are invested, and the amount of coverage you have;   
but you bear the risk of investment losses for any premiums or cash values      
allocated to the variable investment options.                                   

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A prospective purchaser should evaluate the need for life insurance and the     
policy's long term investment potential before buying a policy. In addition, it 
may not be advantageous to terminate existing life insurance coverage and       
replace it with a Park Avenue VUL policy. Variable life insurance is not a      
short-term investment. The policy is issued by The Guardian Insurance & Annuity 
Company, Inc. (GIAC), a wholly owned subsidiary of The Guardian Life Insurance  
Company of America (Guardian Life) through its Separate Account N (Separate     
Account). Our offices are located at 7 Hanover Square, New York, New York 10004.
GIAC is obligated to pay all benefits under the policy.                         

This prospectus sets forth information that you should know about the policy    
before investing, and you should retain it for future reference. It must be     
accompanied by the current prospectuses for the variable investment options to  
which you may allocate all or part of your net premiums and policy account      
value. You can also allocate premiums and policy account value to a fixed-rate  
option. Special limits apply to transfers out of the fixed-rate option. Please  
read these prospectuses carefully before investing.                             

Guardian Investor Services LLC (GIS) serves as principal underwriter and        
distributor of the policies and offers the policies through its sales           
representatives or through sales representatives of broker-dealer firms that    
have entered into agreements with GIAC and GIS to sell the policies and who are 
registered with the NASD and with the states in which they do business. More    
information about GIS and its registered persons is available at

POLICY SUMMARY

THIS SUMMARY outlines the principal features of your Park Avenue VUL variable   
universal life insurance policy; including policy benefits, policy risks and the
risks associated with each variable investment option available under the       
policy. It is qualified by the detailed explanation which follows and the terms 
of your VUL policy.                                                             

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Terms we've used                                                                
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this document, we, us, and our refer to The Guardian Insurance & Annuity     
Company, Inc., and you and your refer to the policyowner. You can find          
definitions of special terms used in this prospectus at the end of this         
document. We've used italic script to highlight these terms the first time they 
appear in the text.                                                             

WHAT IS VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE AND HOW DOES IT WORK?                           

Variable life insurance is intended to provide two important benefits:          

o     a death benefit that is not taxable to your beneficiary                   

o     a cash value that can grow, with taxes on the growth being deferred.      

You allocate your net premium payments and cash value among the variable        
investment options and the fixed-rate option. Most of these options provide     
variable returns. That's why it's called variable life insurance.               

If the investment options that you choose perform well, the cash value of your  
policy will increase, and the death benefit may also increase. As a variable    
life insurance policyowner, however, you bear the risk of investment losses to  
the extent that your cash values are invested in the variable options. Your     
policy has no guaranteed cash value. The policy is not generally suitable for   
short-term investment purposes.                                                 

Benefits

There are two types of insurance benefits available through this policy: death  
benefits and rider benefits. We pay death benefits to the beneficiary named in  
the policy when we receive proof that the insured has died while the policy was 
in force. Rider benefits offer special optional coverage in addition to the     
death benefit.                                                                  

WHAT ARE THE INSURANCE BENEFITS UNDER YOUR POLICY?                              

There are two types of insurance benefits available through this policy: death  
benefits and rider benefits. We pay death benefits to the beneficiary named in  
the policy when we receive proof that the insured has died while the policy was 
in force. Rider benefits offer special optional coverage in addition to the     
death benefit. The rider benefits you choose will determine the additional      
amount, if any, that's paid to the beneficiary.                                 

Death benefits                                                                  

You have a choice of three death benefit options with this policy:              

o     under Option 1, the death benefit is a fixed amount, your policy's face   
amount.                                                             

o     under Option 2, the death benefit is a variable amount, based on your     
      policy's face amount and the value of the investments held in your policy,
your policy account value. These values can change depending on the 
performance of the investments held in your policy.                 

o     under Option 3, the death benefit is an amount based on your policy's face
  amount and the sum of your net accumulated premiums. The death benefit
  amount will increase when you make premium payments, but will decrease
when you make partial withdrawals.

You may choose among these options, with some restrictions, until the policy    
anniversary (the anniversary each year of the date your policy was issued)      
closest to the insured's 100th birthday. On or after this date, the death       
benefit will be the policy account value.                                       

Within certain limits, you can change your policy's death benefit option on any 
policy anniversary after your policy has been in force for one year, and as long
as the insured is still living. For more information see Death benefit options. 

Additional sum insured                                                          

You may purchase an additional sum insured when this policy is issued. The      
additional sum insured will be part of your policy's face amount. This option   
may not be available in all jurisdictions. See Benefits and policy values.      

Rider benefits                                                                  

Riders are a way to add to the coverage offered by your policy. The riders      
offered under this policy are set forth in Appendix B. They are subject to      
GIAC's insurance and policy issuing requirements, and all may not be available  
in all states.                                                                  

The cost of any rider benefits you have added to your policy will be included in
your monthly deduction, which is withdrawn from your policy account value each  
month.                                                                          

Paying                                                                          
premiums                                                                        
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After you have paid the initial premium, you may pay premiums on your policy at 
any time and in any amount during the lifetime of the insured.                  

WHAT ARE PREMIUMS?                                                              

Premiums are the payments you make to buy and keep your insurance in force.     
There are several types of premiums associated with your Park Avenue VUL, which 
together form your policy premium. See Premiums.                                

After you have paid the initial premium, you may pay premiums on your policy at 
any time and in any amount during the lifetime of the insured subject to certain
limits. However, if the net cash surrender value of your policy is not          
sufficient to cover the monthly deduction from your policy, your policy may     
lapse, unless the No Lapse Guarantee is in effect and you have satisfied its    
requirements. We will warn you if your policy is in danger of lapsing.          

Allocation options                                                              
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You choose where your net premiums and policy account value are invested. There 
are a number of variable investment options and a fixed-rate option. Your       
premiums and policy account value may be allocated to a maximum of twenty       
allocation options at any one time.                                             

WHAT ARE YOUR ALLOCATION OPTIONS?                                               

You choose where your net premiums and policy account value are invested. There 
are a number of variable investment options and a fixed-rate option. These      
options are discussed under Your Allocation Options. Your premiums and policy   
account value may be allocated to a maximum of twenty allocation options at any 
one time.                                                                       

Each variable investment option invests in a series of mutual funds. The value  
of these options, and your policy account value in them, will vary depending on 
the performance of the mutual funds. There is no minimum guaranteed policy      
account value for amounts allocated to the variable investment options and, if  
you invest in variable investment options, you will be subject to the risk that 
investment performance will be poor and that your policy account value will     
decrease. You could lose everything you invest and your policy could lapse      
without value unless you pay additional premium.                                

You will find the investment objectives, policies, fees and expenses, and a     
comprehensive discussion of the risks of each of these funds listed in the      
accompanying prospectus for that fund. You should read the fund prospectuses

carefully before investing in any variable investment option. For a summary of  
this information see The variable investment options.                           

Investment Risks                                                                
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Investment performance in the variable investment options may be unfavorable.   
You could lose everything you invest and your policy could lapse without value  
if you do not pay additional premium. The rate of interest we declare for the   
fixed-rate option may decrease to the minimum guaranteed rate.                  

Amounts allocated to the fixed-rate option earn a set rate of interest. You earn
interest on the total that you have invested in the fixed-rate option, including
interest you have earned in previous years. Interest accrues daily at a minimum 
annual interest rate of 4%. GIAC sets the rate of interest for the fixed-rate   
option in its sole discretion, and you assume the risk that the rates we set    
might not exceed the minimum guaranteed rate. GIAC guarantees your principal and
interest under this option.                                                     

CAN YOU TRANSFER THE MONEY IN YOUR POLICY AMONG DIFFERENT ALLOCATION OPTIONS?   

To the extent that the money in your policy is not being held as collateral     
against a loan, you can transfer it among the variable investment options, and  
into the fixed-rate option, at any time. You may choose up to twenty allocation 
options at any time. We limit transfers out of the fixed-rate option. See The   
fixed-rate option.                                                              

Loan Risks                                                                      
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Loans reduce the amount of policy account value available for withdrawal or     
surrender, or the amount we pay on the insured's death, by the amount of the    
indebtedness. Your policy may lapse if your indebtedness reduces the cash       
surrender value to zero. A loan also may have tax consequences.                 

DO YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE MONEY YOU'VE INVESTED IN YOUR POLICY?                 

After your policy has been in force for one year, you may, within limits, make  
partial withdrawals of your policy's net cash surrender value. The net cash     
surrender value is your policy account value minus any surrender charges and    
policy debt.                                                                    

You may also, within limits, borrow all or a portion of the loan value of your  
policy. There are risks associated with policy loans. When you take a policy    
loan, we transfer the amount of the loan out of the variable investment options 
and the fixed-rate option, and hold that amount in the Loan Account to serve as 
collateral. This loan collateral does not participate in the investment         
experience of those allocation options and the loan, therefore, can affect the  
policy value and death benefit over time whether or not the loan is repaid.     
Loans reduce the amount of your policy account value available for withdrawal or
surrender, or the amount we pay on the insured's death, by the amount of any    
indebtedness. Your policy may lapse (terminate without value) if your           
indebtedness reduces the cash surrender value to zero. If you surrender the     
policy or allow it to lapse while a policy loan is outstanding, the amount of   
the loan, to the extent it has not previously been taxed, will be added to any  
amount you receive and taxed accordingly. See Policy loans and tax              
considerations for details.                                                     

Surrender and Withdrawal Risks                                                  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The policy is designed to meet long-term financial goals. Surrenders and partial
withdrawals may have tax consequences, and the charges associated with          
surrenders may play a role in determining whether your policy will lapse.       

Finally, you may at any time surrender your policy for the net cash surrender   
value. After you surrender your policy, you no longer have insurance coverage. A
surrender charge applies for 9 policy years after the issue date. An additional 
surrender charge will be applicable for 9 years from the date of any increase in
the face amount of the policy. It is possible that you will receive no net cash 
surrender value if you surrender your policy in the first few policy years. You 
should purchase the policy only if you have the financial ability to keep it in 
force for a substantial period of time. You should not purchase the policy if   
you intend to surrender it or make partial withdrawals in the near future. We   
designed the policy to meet long-term financial goals. The policy is not        
suitable as a short term investment.

Even if you do not ask to surrender your policy, surrender charges and          
additional surrender charges may play a role in determining whether your policy 
will lapse (terminate without value), because surrender charges and additional  
surrender charges decrease the cash surrender value which is a measure we use to
determine whether your policy will enter a grace period (and possibly lapse).   

Surrenders and partial withdrawals may have tax consequences. See Surrendering  
your policy for details.                                                        

Tax Risks                                                                       
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While there is some uncertainty about the application of federal tax law to the 
policy, we believe it is reasonable to conclude that increases in the value of  
your policy should not be taxed unless you make a withdrawal (or, in some cases,
take a loan) or surrender your policy before the insured dies.                  

HOW IS YOUR POLICY AFFECTED BY TAXES?                                           

We believe it is reasonable to conclude that your Park Avenue VUL policy will be
treated as a life insurance contract under federal tax law. However, due to     
limited guidance, there is some uncertainty about the application of the federal
tax law to the policy, particularly with respect to policies issued on an       
insured who does not meet our insurance requirements for standard coverage.     
Assuming that your policy qualifies as a life insurance contract for federal    
income tax purposes, you should not be deemed to be in constructive receipt of  
the policy account value until there is a distribution from the policy.         
Moreover, death benefits payable under a policy should be excludible from the   
gross income of the beneficiary. As a result, the beneficiary generally should  
not have to pay U.S. federal income tax on the death benefit, although some     
other taxes, such as estate taxes, may apply.                                   

Depending on the total amount of premiums you pay, the policy may be treated as 
a modified endowment contract ("MEC") under federal tax laws. If a policy is    
treated as a MEC, then surrenders, partial withdrawals, and loans under the     
policy will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent there are earnings in   
the policy. In addition, an additional 10% tax may be imposed on surrenders,    
partial withdrawals, and loans taken before you attain age 591/2. If the policy 
is not a MEC, distributions generally will be treated first as a return of basis
or investment in the contract and then as taxable income. Moreover, loans will  
generally not be treated as distributions. Finally, neither distributions nor   
loans from a policy that is not a MEC are subject to the 10% additional tax. See
Tax Considerations.                                                             

WHAT DEDUCTIONS AND CHARGES DO YOU HAVE TO PAY?                                 

There are various deductions and charges associated with maintaining your Park  
Avenue VUL policy. These charges are set forth in the Charges and Deductions    
Tables and in the section titled Deductions and charges.                        

Policy changes                                                                  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With certain restrictions, you may:                                             

o     request an increase or decrease in the face amount of your policy         

o     exchange your Park Avenue VUL Policy for a level premium fixed-benefit    
life insurance policy                                               

o     cancel your policy after it has been issued                               

See accompanying text for details.                                              

WHAT CHANGES CAN YOU MAKE TO YOUR POLICY?                                       

Decreasing the face amount of the policy                                        

On or after your first policy anniversary you may request a decrease in the face
amount. The decrease must be at least $5,000, and the insured must be alive when
we receive your request. The new face amount cannot be lower than GIAC's current
minimum face amount. See Decreasing the face amount.                            

Increasing the face amount of the policy                                        

On your first policy anniversary, and on each anniversary up to and including   
the anniversary nearest the insured's 70th birthday, you may request an increase
in your policy's face amount. The increase is subject to evidence of            
insurability, and must be for at least $10,000. The amount of each increase will
be treated as a separate policy segment, with its own

annual premium.                                                                 

Exchanging your Park Avenue VUL policy for a fixed-benefit life insurance policy

You may exchange all or a portion of your Park Avenue VUL policy for a level    
premium fixed-benefit whole life insurance policy issued by GIAC or one of our  
affiliates by the later of two years after the issue date of your policy or the 
insured's attained age 70. There may be a credit or a cost to be paid. See      
Special Features of your policy.                                                

Canceling your policy after it has been issued                                  

You may cancel your policy by returning it with a written cancellation notice to
either our customer service office or the agent from whom you bought the policy.
You must do this within:                                                        

o     10 days after you receive your policy, or                                 

o     45 days after you sign the completed application for your policy.         

Longer periods may apply in some states. Once we receive your notice, we will   
refund all of the premiums you paid, and your policy will be considered void    
from the beginning. See Your right to cancel your policy.                       

Could your policy lapse?                                                        
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your policy may lapse if you don't pay enough policy premium or if you have     
excess policy debt.                                                             

COULD YOUR POLICY LAPSE?                                                        

Your policy may lapse if its net cash surrender value is less than zero after   
deducting the monthly deduction in a given month, and you do not make the       
required premium payment within 61 days of the time the monthly deduction is    
due.                                                                            

For the first three years of your policy the No Lapse Guarantee ensures that    
your policy will not lapse, even if the net cash surrender value of your policy 
is insufficient to pay the policy's monthly deduction in a given month, so long 
as the No Lapse Guarantee Premium Test is met. See Premiums and No Lapse        
Guarantee.                                                                      

Your policy may also lapse if you have not made a loan repayment 61 days after  
the monthly date on which the amount of any unpaid loans or interest exceeds

We will warn you at least 30 days in advance if we see that your policy is in   
danger of lapsing. We will tell you the premium or the portion of your loan that
you must pay in order to keep your policy in force, and will keep your policy in
force if we receive the required payment when requested. See Grace Period.

CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS TABLES                                                   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following tables describe the fees and expenses that you will pay when      
buying, owning, and surrendering the policy. Certain of those fees and charges  
are payable only if you choose an optional policy feature. If the amount of the 
charge varies depending on the individual characteristics of the policyowner or 
insured -- such as age, sex, duration, face amount and underwriting class -- the
tables below show the maximum and minimum charges we assess under the policy and
the charges for a typical insured. The charges may not be typical of the charges
you will pay. The first table describes the fees and expenses that you will pay 
at the time that you buy the policy, surrender the policy, or transfer policy   
account value among the variable investment options and the fixed options.

(1)   The amount of the target premium for a policy depends on the insured's    
     age, underwriting class and sex (unless gender-neutral rates are required
     by law). The minimum amount of target premium for a non-substandard rated
  policy is $3.00 per $1,000 of face amount and the maximum amount for a
non-substandard rated is $126.01 per $1,000 of face amount.         
(2)   The surrender charge decreases every year until it reaches 0% by the      
   beginning of the 10th policy year following the initial face amount and
each increase in face amount. Surrender charges vary based on the   
  insured's age, sex, underwriting class and face amount for the initial
    face amount and each increase in face amount. The surrender charge shown
   in the table may not be representative of the charges you will pay. You

ABOUT THE PARK AVENUE VUL POLICY                                                
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THIS SECTION provides detailed information about your policy. It explains your  
rights and responsibilities under the policy, and those of GIAC. Because the    
laws and regulations that govern the policy vary among the jurisdictions where  
the policy is sold, some of the policy's terms will vary depending on where you 
live. These terms of your policy will be outlined in the policy we send you.    

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Issuing the policy                                                              
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Park Avenue VUL insurance policy must have basic sum insured coverage of at   
least $100,000.                                                                 

ISSUING THE POLICY 

A Park Avenue VUL insurance policy must have basic sum insured coverage of at   
least $100,000 ($125,000 for the pension trust version of the policy). To issue 
a policy:                                                                       

o     the insured must be age 80 or under and meet our insurance requirements,  
and                                                                 

o     you must live in a state or jurisdiction in which we offer the policy.    

If you are interested in exchanging an existing policy for a Park Avenue VUL    
policy, we recommend that you speak with your lawyer or tax adviser first.      
Replacing your existing policy may not be advantageous.                         

Some jurisdictions do not allow insurance companies to provide different        
benefits based on the sex of the insured. For these jurisdictions we offer a    
version of the Park Avenue VUL policy with the same benefits for men and women. 

Backdating your policy                                                          

Under certain circumstances we will backdate your policy if you ask us to,      
giving you a policy date up to six months before the application was actually   
signed. Backdating your policy will be allowed only if it would allow you to    
qualify for a lower premium because the insured was younger on an earlier policy
date. On the date the policy is actually issued, we deduct the monthly          
deductions due from the backdated policy date to the issue date. We will not    
backdate a policy to a date before which the policy was available in the state  
of issue.

The Policyowner                                                                 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The policyowner is the person named on the application as the owner of the      
policy. You may own a policy jointly with more than one person. A policyowner   
does not have to be the insured.                                                

THE POLICYOWNER 

The policyowner is the person named on the application as the owner of the      
policy. You may own a policy jointly with more than one person. A policyowner   
does not have to be the insured. While the insured is living, only the          
policyowner named in our records has the right to exercise rights granted by the
policy unless ownership of the policy has been assigned to someone else. Except 
for transfers, all of the policy's joint owners must approve policy transactions
or changes in writing, including assigning ownership of the policy to someone   
else. When a joint policyowner dies, we will divide his or her share of the     
policy equally among the other policyowners, unless the deceased policyowner has
indicated otherwise.                                                            

If you want to change the policyowner, you must request it in writing in a form 
acceptable to us. Your request must be signed and dated by all of the           
policyowners. The change will be made effective on the date your request was    
signed, but will not apply to any payments or actions taken before we receive   
your request. If you are not the insured and die before the insured, your estate
(or if there had been joint owners, the estate of the last surviving joint      
owner) becomes the policyowner, unless you have named someone to take over      
ownership of the policy (a successor owner). If you are both the policyowner and
the insured, a successor owner may not be named, because the policy ends when   
you die.                                                                        

The Beneficiary                                                                 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The beneficiary is the person you name to receive the proceeds when the insured 
dies.                                                                           

THE BENEFICIARY 

The beneficiary is the person you name to receive the proceeds when the insured 
dies. You can change the beneficiary until the insured dies. Also, you may name 
a `contingent' beneficiary, who will receive the proceeds if the first          
beneficiary dies before the insured, or a second or `concurrent' beneficiary,   
who will receive a portion of the proceeds when the insured dies. The           
beneficiary must live longer than the insured to qualify as a beneficiary, and  
has no rights under the policy until the insured dies. If the insured outlives  
all of the beneficiaries named in the policy, then the policyowner or the       
policyowner's estate becomes the beneficiary. If you want to change the         
beneficiary, you must give us your instructions in writing in a form acceptable 
to us. Your request must be signed and dated by all of the policyowners listed  
in our records. The change is made effective on the date your request was       
signed, but will not apply to any payments or actions taken before we receive   
your request.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADDITIONAL SUM INSURED 

If you choose death benefit Option 1 at issue, you may purchase an additional   
sum insured under the policy. The additional sum insured provides a level death 
benefit to age 100. The amount of this coverage, if any, plus the basic sum     
insured are the two components of your policy's initial face amount. The minimum
additional sum insured amount you can purchase is $25,000; the maximum amount   
cannot exceed 400% of the basic sum insured.                                    

Coverage provided by the additional sum insured will be treated like coverage   
provided by the basic sum insured. In particular:                               

o     it will be included in calculating whether the policy qualifies for lower 
cost of insurance rates;                                            

o     it will affect the minimum death benefit under Section 7702 of the        
Internal Revenue Code; and                                          

o     it will affect the calculation of premiums for determining whether the    
policy is a modified endowment contract.                            

See Deductions and charges; Death benefit options; and Tax considerations.      

You should consider several factors in deciding whether to purchase coverage as 
basic sum insured or additional sum insured, including:                         

o     The additional sum insured has no additional administrative charges or    
surrender charges.                                                  

o     Cost of insurance rates for the additional sum insured are the same as for
the basic sum insured.                                              

o     The target premium for the additional sum insured is less than the target 
premium for the same amount of basic sum insured.                   

o     The amount of premium charges you will pay may be less if you purchase    
coverage as additional sum insured, rather than basic sum insured.  

o     If the coverage provided by the additional sum insured is greater than the
  coverage under the basic sum insured at issue, you cannot purchase the
Guaranteed Coverage rider.                                          

o     If you purchase an additional sum insured, you may not purchase coverage  
under the adjustable annual renewable term insurance rider.         

You may purchase additional sum insured coverage only at issue and only if you  
select Option 1. If you change your death benefit option at any time, we will   
terminate the additional sum insured. Once terminated, the additional sum       
insured cannot be reinstated.                                                   

The additional sum insured may not be available in all jurisdictions. Please    
check with your registered representative.

NO LAPSE GUARANTEE 

The No Lapse Guarantee ensures that your policy will not lapse, even if high    
surrender charges, poor investment performance, or excess policy debt mean that 
the net cash surrender value of your policy is not enough to pay the policy's   
monthly deductions on a monthly processing date. This guarantee is in effect for
the first three years of your policy so long as the No Lapse Guarantee Premium  
Test is met.                                                                    

To meet this test, as of the most recent monthly processing date, you must have 
paid at least as much into your policy (minus any withdrawals or policy debt) as
the sum of minimum annual premiums up to this date, as stated on page 3 of your 
policy. To calculate your minimum annual premium for the current policy year, we
multiply your minimum annual premium by a ratio equal to the number of completed
policy months since the last policy anniversary plus 1, divided by 12.          

If you increase the face amount of your policy after the first policy year, your
minimum annual premium will change, which in turn changes the amount that you   
must contribute in order to meet the No Lapse Guarantee Premium Test. As of the 
most recent monthly processing date, you must have paid at least as much into   
your policy (minus any withdrawals or policy debt) as the original minimum      
annual premium for the period up to the increase, plus the new minimum annual   
premium for the period after the increase in your policy's face amount,         
multiplied by the ratio of the number of completed policy months since the      
increase plus 1 divided by 12.                                                  

If your policy does not meet the No Lapse Guarantee Premium Test, and the cash  
value is insufficient to cover the monthly deduction, you will have a 61-day    
grace period from that date to make a required premium payment or loan repayment
if there is outstanding policy debt. If you do not make the required payment,   
the policy will lapse.

Minimum death benefit                                                           

The minimum death benefit required under Section 7702 of the Internal Revenue   
Code on any monthly processing date is the policy account value multiplied by   
the death benefit factor shown in your policy on page 4.                        
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DEATH BENEFIT OPTIONS 

You have a choice of three death benefit options with this policy. You should   
choose the death benefit option that best meets your insurance needs and        
investment objectives. If a fixed amount of insurance coverage and potentially  
lower monthly deductions best fit your needs you should choose Option 1. If you 
want the potential to increase the amount of your insurance coverage beyond your
policy's face amount you should choose Option 2. If you want to recapture the   
premiums you have paid into the policy, you should choose Option 3.*            

Option 1                                                                        

Under Option 1, your death benefit on any monthly processing date prior to the  
policy anniversary nearest the insured's 100th birthday is the greater of:      

o     the face amount; or                                                       

o     the minimum death benefit required under Section 7702 of the Internal     
Revenue Code.

Death benefit options                                                           
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You have a choice of three death benefit options with this policy. If a fixed   
amount of insurance coverage and potentially lower monthly deductions best fits 
your needs, you should choose Option 1. If you want the potential to increase   
the amount of your insurance coverage beyond your policy's face amount you      
should choose Option 2. If you want to recapture the premiums you have paid into
the policy, you should choose Option 3. See accompanying text for details.      

Under this option, if your investments perform well or you contribute more than 
the minimum annual premium and the policy account value increases by a          
sufficient amount, then the net amount at risk will be lower. When this happens,
the amount that we deduct for the cost of insurance charges each month may also 
go down.                                                                        

Option 2                                                                        

Under Option 2, your death benefit on any monthly processing date prior to the  
policy anniversary nearest the insured's 100th birthday is the greater of:      

o     the face amount plus the policy account value, if positive, or            

o     the minimum death benefit required under Section 7702 of the Internal     
Revenue Code.                                                       

Under this option, your death benefit will vary based on your investment        
performance and the premiums you pay. Even if your investments perform poorly,  
your death benefit will never be lower than the face amount. The net amount at  
risk will not change unless we have to increase the death benefit to comply with
Section 7702 of the Internal Revenue Code.                                      

Option 3                                                                        

Under Option 3, your death benefit on any monthly processing date prior to the  
policy anniversary nearest the insured's 100th birthday is the greater of:      

o     the face amount plus net accumulated premiums, or                         

o     the minimum death benefit required under Section 7702 of the Internal     
Revenue Code.                                                       

Under this option, as under Option 1, if your investments perform well, or you  
contribute more than the minimum annual premium, then the net amount at risk    
will generally be lower. When this happens, the amount that we deduct for the   
cost of insurance charges each month may also go down.                          

Regardless of which option you choose, after the policy anniversary closest to  
the insured's 100th birthday the death benefit is the policy account value. The 
tax consequences of continuing the policy beyond the insured's 100th birthday   
are unclear. You should consult a tax adviser for more information.             

If you make a partial withdrawal from your policy between the most recent       
monthly processing date and the death of the insured, the death benefit under   
all options will be reduced by the amount of your withdrawal. Under Option 3,   
the death benefit will be increased by the amount of any premium paid between   
the most recent monthly processing date and the date of death of the insured.   

                                                         -----------------------

To qualify as insurance under the Internal Revenue Code, all three options must 
pay at least the minimum death benefit required under Section 7702. We calculate
this minimum using one of two methods: the Cash Value Accumulation Test (Cash   
Value Test) or the Guideline Premium and Cash Value Corridor Test (Guideline    
Premium Test). You decide which method you want used when you complete your     
application. Once you've made your choice, you cannot change it.                

Here are some general guidelines for choosing between the Cash Value Test and   
the Guideline Premium Test:                                                     

Test Advantages                                                                 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cash Value Test                        Guideline Premium Test                   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o allows you to make larger            o allows greater proportion of policy    
  premium payments than the              account value relative to death benefit
Guideline Premium Test                 than under the Cash Value Test       
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o increases the death benefit          o develops larger policy account values  
earlier than the Guideline             due to lower death benefits          
Premium Test                                                                
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The minimum death benefit required on any monthly processing date is equal to   
the policy account value on that date multiplied by the death benefit factor    
shown in your policy. These death benefit factors vary depending on whether you 
have selected the Cash Value Test or the Guideline Premium Test.                

CHANGING YOUR DEATH BENEFIT OPTION 

On any policy anniversary you may change your death benefit option, as long as  
the insured is alive when we make the change. You must send us your instructions
in writing at our customer service office. Such changes take effect on the      
policy anniversary following or coinciding with our receipt of the request.     
Changing the death benefit option may have adverse tax consequences. You should 
consult a tax adviser before doing so.                                          

If you change the death benefit option, we will change the policy's face amount 
to keep the death benefit the same immediately before and after the change.     

We will not permit any change if it results in a reduction of the face amount   
below our minimum face amount, currently $100,000. We will not approve any      
request to change the option if monthly deductions are being waived under the   
waiver of monthly deductions rider and we will not approve any request to change
from Option 1 or Option 2 to Option 3.                                          

Any increase is applied directly to the initial face amount. A decrease reduces 
coverage in the same manner as a requested face amount decrease. See Decreasing 
the face amount.                                                                

We won't deduct a surrender charge or impose new surrender charges in connection
with changes in the death benefit option.

PAYING THE DEATH BENEFIT 

We will pay a death benefit to the beneficiaries named in your policy when we   
receive proof that the insured has died while the policy was in effect. If there
is reason to dispute the policy, then we may delay the payment of death         
benefits. See Limits to GIAC's right to challenge a policy.                     

POLICY VALUES 

The following is a detailed breakdown of how we calculate the different values  
associated with your policy.                                                    

Amounts in the Separate Account                                                 

Any net premiums that you allocate or transfer to a variable investment option  
are used to buy shares in the mutual fund corresponding to the variable         
investment option, according to your instructions. We will sell these shares    
when you make a withdrawal, transfer or take a policy loan, or when we withdraw 
your monthly deduction, or make dollar cost averaging transfers. Based on the   
value of each share on the transaction date, we will sell the number of shares  
needed to cover the cost of that transaction. To reflect how investment         
performance affects policy account value, we determine a unit value for each    
variable investment option. Unit values will vary among variable investment     
options. To calculate the value of your investment in a particular variable     
investment option, multiply the unit value of the option by the number of units 
you own. Unit values change based on the investment performance of mutual fund  
shares. We calculate the unit value for each variable investment option at the  
end of each business day. Note that you bear all risks associated with the      
investments in the Separate Account.                                            

Policy account value                                                            

Your policy account value is the total value of the investments held in your    
policy. This includes the value of your allocations to the fixed-rate and       
variable investment options, and any policy values that may be in the Loan      
Account or the Loan Interest Account as collateral for a policy loan. It is     
calculated as:                                                                  

o     net premiums that you contribute to your policy; plus or minus            

o     any profit or loss generated by your policy account value in the variable 
investment options; plus                                            

o     any interest you earn on allocations to the fixed-rate option or interest 
we credit on the Loan Account and the Loan Interest Account; minus  

o     your total monthly deductions; minus                                      

o     any partial withdrawals you've made, minus                                

o     any transfer charges.                                                     

Policy account value varies from day to day. We do not guarantee a minimum      
policy account value.

Cash surrender value and net cash surrender value                               
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cash surrender value is the policy account value minus any surrender charges.   
There are no surrender charges after your policy or any face amount increase has
been in effect for 9 years. Net cash surrender value is the amount you would    
actually receive if you surrendered your life insurance policy.

Cash surrender value is the policy account value minus any surrender charges.   
There are no surrender charges after your policy or any face amount increase has
been in effect for 9 years. Net cash surrender value is the amount you would    
actually receive if you surrendered your life insurance policy. It is your      
policy account value minus any surrender charges and policy debt.               

The value of any investments in the variable investment options may increase or 
decrease daily depending on how well the investments perform. A combination of  
partial withdrawals, policy loans, unfavorable investment performance, surrender
charges and the ongoing monthly deduction can cause a policy's net cash         
surrender value to drop below zero. Even if this happens, the policy will not   
lapse during the first three policy years if the No Lapse Guarantee is in effect
and the No Lapse Guarantee Premium Test is satisfied. See No Lapse Guarantee.   
Certain rider benefits available under the policy may also prevent your policy  
from lapsing. See Appendix B.

PREMIUMS, DEDUCTIONS AND CHARGES                                                
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PREMIUMS 

Your policy will take effect once you have paid your initial premium, but not   
before your policy's issue date. Once it has taken effect you decide the amount 
of your premium payments and when you want to make them. However, your premiums 
must meet certain requirements for your policy to remain in force.              

Your initial premium must equal at least one sixth of your minimum annual       
premium. The minimum annual premium is outlined in your policy, and is used to  
calculate your initial premium and compliance with the No Lapse Guarantee       
Premium Test. If the policy is to be issued based on premium payments made      
through a pre-authorized checking plan (i.e., Guard-o-matic), the initial       
premium must equal two pre-authorized payments.                                 

When you set up your policy, you must choose a planned premium. This is the     
premium that you intend to pay periodically. We will send you a reminder when   
your planned premium is due, annually, semi-annually or quarterly, as requested 
unless you are paying your premiums through a pre-authorized checking plan. You 
are under no obligation to pay this premium as long as the net cash surrender   
value is sufficient to pay the monthly deduction when due.                      

All premiums must be paid to GIAC's customer service office. Each premium you   
pay must be at least $100, unless you are paying through a pre-authorized       
checking plan, in which case each premium must be at least $25. GIAC reserves   
the right, from time to time, to establish administrative rules that set forth  
acceptable forms of premium payments. Premium payments that are not deemed      
acceptable under these rules will be returned to the policyowner and not        
credited to the policy. No premiums may be paid after the policy anniversary    
closest to the insured's 100th birthday.                                        

We may limit the amount that you can pay into your policy, including refusing or
refunding premiums you pay, to attempt to preserve your policy's treatment as   
life insurance under federal tax laws.                                          

Under the guideline premium test, the maximum premium we will accept in any     
policy year is the greatest amount that will not violate Section 7702. We will  
refund to you any portion of a premium payment that violates these section 7702 
limits with interest at an annual rate of 6% within 60 days of receipt of such  
premium.                                                                        

Under the cash value accumulation test, we will accept any premium that does not
result in an increase in the death benefit as a result of Section 7702. If a    
premium would cause an increase in the death benefit under Section 7702, we will
accept the payment provided the total of premium payments in a policy year does 
not exceed the greater of:                                                      

o     150% of your policy's target premium, or                                  

o     the lesser of 400% of the target premium and 125% of your largest premium 
amount paid in the past three policy years.

If you do not meet these tests, we may still accept your premium payment if you 
prove that the insured meets our insurance requirements.                        

We will refund any portion of a premium payment that exceeds these limits.      

Crediting payments                                                              

When you make a payment towards your policy, we will credit it according to your
instructions. If you do not provide specific instructions, we will use the      
payment:                                                                        

o     first to repay any policy debt                                            

o     then, as a premium payment.                                               

We normally credit your payment and allocate the net premium as of the business 
day we receive it, as long as we receive it at our customer service office by   
the close of the business day, which is 4:00 p.m. New York time. However, any   
payments that we receive before your policy has been issued will be held and    
credited on the policy issue date, and any payments that we receive after your  
policy has been issued that require additional underwriting will be held and    
credited as of the date the underwriting process is complete.                   

See How your premiums are allocated and Policy loans for specific information on
how your payments are distributed among the fixed-rate and variable investment  
options.

When you make a payment towards your policy, the amount that remains after we   
deduct the premium charge is the net premium. We invest your net premiums       
according to your instructions. When net premiums have been invested, they      
become part of your policy account value.                                       

How your premiums are allocated                                                 

When you make a payment towards your policy, the amount that remains after we   
deduct the premium charge (see Deductions and charges) is the net premium. We   
invest your net premiums in the fixed-rate and/or variable investment options   
according to your instructions. When net premiums have been invested they become
part of your policy account value.                                              

As part of your initial application, you tell us how you would like your net    
premiums distributed among the various allocation options. The percentage you   
choose for each allocation option must be in whole numbers, and the total must  
equal 100%. You may change how your net premiums are invested at any time by    
telling us in writing at our customer service office or by calling              
1-800-441-6455. Before you can request a future allocation change by telephone, 
you must first establish a Personal Identification Number (PIN). You can        
establish a PIN by sending us an executed Telephone Fund Transfer/Premium       
Allocation Change Form. Contact your Registered Representative or call          
1-800-441-6455 to obtain a copy of this form. The change will be effective on   
and after the date we receive your instructions at our customer service office, 
but will not affect any existing policy values. To change the allocation of     
these amounts, you must effect a transfer. See Transfers between the investment 
options.

Currently you may invest your net premiums and policy account value in up to 20 
different allocation options, although we reserve the right to change this      
number from time to time.                                                       

Default                                                                         

During the first three years of your policy, it is protected from lapsing by the
No Lapse Guarantee as long as the No Lapse Guarantee Premium Test is met. This  
feature guarantees that your policy will not lapse, even if its net cash        
surrender value is not enough to pay your policy's monthly deduction on a       
monthly processing date. See No Lapse Guarantee.                                

If your policy does not meet this test, and your net cash surrender value isn't 
enough to cover your monthly deduction (or you have borrowed too much--see      
below), you will have a 61-day grace period to make a required payment. We will 
tell you that your policy is in danger of lapsing, and the premium payment or   
loan repayment you must pay to keep it from lapsing, at least 30 days before the
end of this grace period. If you must make a premium payment, the premium       
required will be the lesser of (i) the amount of the deficiency in the net cash 
surrender value, plus three times your policy's current monthly deduction or    
(ii) the amount necessary for your policy to meet the no lapse Guarantee Premium
Test, plus one quarter of the minimum annual premium. If we do not receive the  
requested payment by the end of the 61-day grace period, the policy will lapse. 

After the No Lapse Guarantee has ended, your policy will go into default if its 
net cash surrender value is less than the monthly deduction due at each monthly 
processing date. We will give you a 61-day grace period from the date of default
to make a required payment. We will tell you that your policy is in danger of   
lapsing, and the premium or loan repayment you must pay to keep it from lapsing,
at least 30 days before the end of this grace period. The required premium will 
be an amount equal to the difference between the monthly deduction due and the  
net cash surrender value, plus three times your policy's current monthly        
deduction.                                                                      

If we do not receive the required payment by the end of the 61-day grace period,
your policy will lapse without value.                                           

Your policy will also go into default if the amount of any unpaid policy loans  
and interest, which is your policy debt, exceeds the value of the investments in
your policy, minus any surrender charges. We will then tell you that a loan     
repayment is required. Your policy will lapse 61 days from the default date if  
you do not make the required loan repayment. The required repayment will be the 
amount by which policy debt exceeds cash surrender value. If the insured person 
dies after we have mailed our notice that a loan repayment is due, but before   
the 61-day grace period is up, we will pay the beneficiary the policy's death   
proceeds minus the unpaid policy debt.                                          

Once your policy has lapsed, it cannot be reinstated.

DEDUCTIONS AND CHARGES 

GIAC makes various deductions and charges that are required to maintain your    
Park Avenue VUL policy. These charges cover certain costs we incur with respect 
to the policies, including:                                                     

o     the cost of underwriting, issuing and maintaining the policies, including 
preparing and sending billing notices, reports and policy owner     
      statements, communications with insurance agents and other overhead costs.

o     the risk that those insured under the policies may not live as long as we 
    estimated when we issued the policy, and our administrative expenses may
also be higher than expected.                                       

o     the cost of paying death benefits, especially in the early policy years   
      when the policy account value may be far below the death benefit we pay if
the insured dies.                                                   

o     our sales and promotional expenses, commissions, and local, state and     
     federal taxes. You may not claim the portion of these charges used to pay
taxes as a federal income tax deduction.                            

The amount of a charge does not necessarily correspond to our costs in providing
the service or benefits associated with a particular policy. For example, the   
premium charge and the surrender charge may not cover all of our actual sales   
expenses for the policies, and proceeds from other charges, including the       
mortality and expense risk charge and cost of insurance charges, may be used in 
part to cover sales expenses. There may be a guaranteed, or maximum, charge and 
a current charge. The guaranteed or maximum charge is the most that we can      
charge you for a particular item. The current charge is what we are now charging
for that item. We have the right to increase the current charge up to the       
maximum charge. We will tell you if we increase these charges. Once deductions  
and charges are taken from your policy they do not contribute to the value of   
your policy.                                                                    

All of the deductions and charges are summarized and explained below. Contact   
our customer service office for more information about the deductions and       
charges. For information regarding compensation paid for the sale of the        
policies, see Distribution of the policy.                                       

TRANSACTION FEES                                                                

Premium charge                                                                  

During each of the first 12 policy years after issue or after an increase in    
coverage, a charge of 8% is deducted from each premium you pay until you have   
paid one target premium in a policy year and 4% is deducted from premiums paid  
in excess of the target premium. After the 12th year, this charge drops to 4%   
for premiums paid in a policy year until you have paid one target premium in a  
policy year and no charge for premiums paid in excess of one target.

P-->485APOS29th�Page�of�101TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�29th
Your policy has a separate target premium for the initial face amount and for   
any additional coverage you have added through any increase in face amount (each
separate face amount increase is referred to as a policy segment). The target   
premium amount depends upon the insured's age, underwriting class and sex       
(unless gender-neutral rates are required by law. The premium charge will be    
applied in the order that these policy segments were issued. In order to        
calculate your premium charge, we will allocate each premium you pay as follows:

o     first to your policy's initial face amount, up to the target premium for  
that amount                                                         

o     then to any policy segments that are in force, in the order that they were
purchased, up to the target premium for each segment                

o     then proportionately, based on the target premium, among the initial face 
amount and any policy segments that are in force.                   

Surrender charge                                                                

During the first 9 policy years of the initial face amount and each policy      
segment, we impose a surrender charge if you:                                   

o     surrender your policy, or                                                 

o     let your policy lapse.                                                    

We do not reduce or deduct the surrender charge upon a change in death benefit  
option or upon a partial withdrawal. In addition, we do not reduce or deduct the
surrender charge if you reduce or eliminate your coverage under a term rider, or
reduce your face amount. The surrender charge shown on page 3 of your policy    
remains in effect until you either surrender your policy for its net cash       
surrender value or the policy lapses, at which time the surrender charge will be
deducted, or until the expiration of the applicable surrender charge period.    

This charge is a flat rate for every $1,000 of your policy's basic sum insured. 
The rate declines proportionally each year until it is zero after nine years. We
will make this deduction from your policy account value invested in the variable
investment options, until these are exhausted, and then from your fixed-rate    
option.                                                                         

The first year surrender charge varies from $2.700 to $53.973 per $1,000 of the 
basic sum insured, depending on the insured's age when the policy started, sex  
and underwriting class.                                                         

A separate surrender charge is also calculated for each new policy segment,     
based on the coverage it provides and the insured's age, sex, underwriting class
and face amount when it was added to your policy. This means that the total     
surrender charges under your policy will be the sum of the different surrender  
charges for your initial face amount and each policy segment. The surrender     
charge compensates us for administrative and sales-related expenses.

After we deduct any applicable surrender charge, a policy's net cash surrender  
value may be zero, particularly in the early policy years.                      

Transfer charge                                                                 

You may transfer your policy account value among the allocation options. If you 
make more than 12 transfers within a policy year, we reserve the right to charge
you $25 for each additional transfer. We will deduct the transfer charge from   
the allocation options from which you are making the transfer, and will use this
amount for our processing costs.                                                

We will not deduct a transfer charge when:                                      

o     you make multiple transfers under your policy's dollar cost averaging     
feature                                                             

o     you transfer amounts as part of taking or repaying a policy loan, or      

o     you transfer amounts out of a variable investment option because the      
investment policies of the corresponding mutual fund have materially
changed.                                                            

We do not currently deduct transfer charges.                                    

Monthly deductions                                                              
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We deduct from the policy account value, on the same date each month, amounts   
for administrative costs, the cost of insuring the insured, the mortality and   
expense risk charge and any riders. These deductions are made proportionately   
from your investments in the fixed-rate and variable investment options.        

PERIODIC FEES                                                                   

Monthly deductions from the policy account value                                

We deduct from the policy account value, on the same date each month, amounts to
cover administrative costs, the cost of insuring the insured, the mortality and 
expense risk charge and the cost of any riders. These deductions are made       
proportionately from your policy account value in the fixed-rate and variable   
investment options. We do not make these monthly deductions after the policy    
anniversary closest to the insured's 100th birthday.                            

Administrative charges                                                          

We deduct a monthly charge of $7.50.                                            

We also deduct a monthly charge based on the basic sum insured portion of the   
face amount on each monthly processing date for the first 12 policy years after 
issue or after any increase in face amount. The amount of this charge depends on
the insured's age, sex and underwriting class when the policy is issued or the  
face amount is increased. This charge is not reduced if you decrease your face  
amount.                                                                         

The charge will range from $0.03 to $0.75 per $1,000 of the basic sum insured.  
Your policy's charge is set forth in your policy.

Mortality and expense risk charge                                               

We deduct this charge based on the policy account value in the variable         
investment options. Through the twelfth policy anniversary, we deduct a monthly 
charge at a current annual rate of 0.60% of the policy account value in the     
variable investment options. Starting in the thirteenth policy year, we deduct a
monthly charge at a current annual rate of 0.40% of the policy account value in 
the variable investment options, up to the account value breakpoint, and 0.20%  
on the amount in excess of the account value breakpoint. The account value      
breakpoint is equal to $100,000 less any policy account value allocated to the  
fixed-rate option, but not less than zero. This charge is guaranteed never to   
exceed the current charge stated above plus 0.25% of the policy account value.

This charge allows us to pay death benefits, especially in the early policy     
years when the policy account value is far below the death benefit we pay if the
insured dies.                                                                   

Cost of insurance charge                                                        

This charge is based on our cost of insurance rates for insured people of the   
same age, sex, duration, face amount, including coverage under the adjustable   
annual renewable term rider, and underwriting class. Any additional rating      
charges which are applied to the insured because he or she does not satisfy our 
insurance requirements for standard insurance are added to the cost of insurance
charge. The maximum that we can charge for each $1,000 of net amount at risk is 
set out in your policy and is based on the 1980 Commissioners' Standard Ordinary
Mortality Tables published by the National Association of Insurance             
Commissioners. The cost of insurance rate generally increases as the insured    
gets older. Rates are currently lower for policies with a face amount including 
any adjustable annual renewable term coverage at least equal to $500,000. If the
policy is eligible for the lower rates, they will apply to the initial face     
amount and all policy segments. Our current cost of insurance rates are lower   
than the guaranteed maximum.                                                    

We calculate the cost of insurance charge by multiplying your policy's          
net amount at risk each month by the current cost of insurance rate that applies
to the insured, and dividing the result by $1,000. The net amount at risk       
reflects the difference between the death benefit and the policy account value. 
The net amount at risk is affected by investment performance, loans, payments of
premiums, fees and charges under the policy, death benefit option chosen,       
partial withdrawals, and decreases in face amount. Your policy's cost of        
insurance charge is calculated before the calculation of the administrative     
charges, the mortality and expense risk charge and the cost of any additional   
benefit riders. A cost of insurance charge is determined separately for the     
basic sum insured, additional sum insured and each policy segment, and any      
adjustable annual renewable term coverage.                                      

After the first policy year, we may change the cost of insurance rates          
prospectively, at our discretion, up to the guaranteed maximum rate listed in   
your policy.

Charges for additional insurance benefits                                       

If you acquire additional insurance benefits by buying one or more riders to the
policy, we will deduct rider costs. We deduct these from the policy account     
value monthly. Any charges applicable to your policy will be indicated in the   
"Policy Data" section of your policy.                                           

OTHER DEDUCTIONS FROM POLICY ACCOUNT VALUE                                      

Interest on policy loans                                                        

If you have outstanding policy debt, we charge simple interest that accrues     
daily at an annual rate of 5%, payable in arrears until the 20th policy         
anniversary. After this the annual rate falls to 4.5% for all existing and new  
policy loans. Interest accrues daily and is due on each policy anniversary. If  
you do not pay the interest on your loan when it is due, the amount will be     
capitalized and added to the Loan Account. We transfer the required amount from 
the Loan Interest Account to the Loan Account. If the amount in the Loan        
Interest Account is not sufficient to cover the loan interest due, any          
deficiency will be transferred proportionately from the amounts in the variable 
investment options and the fixed-rate option.                                   

Deductions from the Separate Account                                            

We have the right to charge the Separate Account, the account through which we  
invest your premiums in the variable investment option, for any federal, state  
or local income taxes relating to the Separate Account. We also have the right  
to impose additional charges if there is a change in our tax status, if the     
income tax treatment of variable life insurance changes for insurance companies,
or for any other tax-related charges associated with the Separate Account or the
policies. We don't currently charge for taxes attributable to the Separate      
Account.                                                                        

Deductions from mutual funds                                                    

Daily deductions are made from the assets of the mutual funds to cover advisory 
fees and other expenses. As a result, you pay these fees and expenses           
indirectly. These expenses, which vary from year to year, are summarized in the 
Charges and deductions tables of this prospectus and described in more detail in
each fund's prospectus.

YOUR ALLOCATION OPTIONS                                                         
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AS PART OF YOUR POLICY you are able to direct where a portion of your premiums  
are allocated. There are several variable investment options and a fixed-rate   
option. You may choose up to 20 allocation options at any time.                 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE VARIABLE INVESTMENT OPTIONS 

The variable investment options give you the opportunity to invest a portion of 
your net premiums, indirectly, in a series of mutual funds offering variable    
rates of return. The value of your investments will vary depending on the       
performance of the mutual funds. There is no minimum guaranteed policy account  
value for the portion of your policy that is held in the variable investment    
options.                                                                        

The Separate Account                                                            

The Separate Account is the account through which we invest your net premiums in
the variable investment options. We are the record owner of the assets in the   
Separate Account, and use them exclusively to support the variable life         
insurance policies issued through the Separate Account. The Separate Account    
consists of 31 investment divisions, each corresponding to a mutual fund in     
which the Separate Account invests. The Separate Account was established by     
GIAC's Board of Directors on September 23, 1999 under the insurance law of the  
state of Delaware, and meets the definition of a separate account under the     
federal securities laws. Our Separate Account is registered with the SEC as a   
unit investment trust - a type of investment company under the Investment       
Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act). Registration under the 1940 Act does not    
involve any supervision by the SEC of the investment management or programs of  
the Separate Account or GIAC. However, both GIAC and the Separate Account are   
subject to regulation under Delaware law. GIAC is also subject to the insurance 
laws and regulations of all states and jurisdictions where the company is       
authorized to do business.                                                      

Income, gains and losses, whether or not realized, from assets allocated to the 
Separate Account will be credited to or charged against the Separate Account    
without regard to our other income, gains or losses. Income, gains or losses    
credited to, or charged against, a variable investment option reflect that      
variable investment option's investment performance and not the investment      
performance of our other assets. GIAC owns the assets held in the Separate      
Account. The assets equal to the reserves and other liabilities of the Separate 
Account are used only to support the variable life insurance policies issued    
through the Separate Account. Delaware insurance law provides that these assets 
may not be used to satisfy liabilities arising from any other business that GIAC
may conduct. This means that the assets supporting policy account values        
maintained in the variable investment options are not available to meet the     
claims of GIAC's general creditors. GIAC may also retain in the Separate Account
assets that exceed the reserves and other liabilities of the Separate Account.  
Such assets can include GIAC's direct contributions to the Account, accumulated 
charges for mortality and expense risks or the investment results attributable  
to GIAC's retained assets. Because such

retained assets do not support policy account values, GIAC may transfer them    
from the Separate Account to its general account.                               

Each mutual fund is described briefly below. Complete information can be found  
in the accompanying fund prospectuses.                                          

The Funds                                                                       

Each of the funds corresponding to a variable investment option is either an    
open-end management company or a series of an open-end management company       
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We buy and sell shares  
of the funds at their net asset value in response to your instructions and other
policy-related transactions.                                                    

GIAC may receive compensation from the investment adviser of a fund (or         
affiliates thereof) in connection with administration, distribution, or other   
services provided with respect to the funds and their availability through the  
policy. The amount of this compensation is based upon a percentage of the assets
of the fund attributable to the policy and other policies issued by GIAC. These 
percentages differ, and some advisers (or affiliates) may pay us more than      
others.                                                                         

Currently, other investment products that we and other insurers offer are also  
able to invest in certain of the mutual funds through the Separate Account.     
While the Board of Directors of each fund monitors activities in an effort to   
avoid or correct any material irreconcilable conflicts arising out of this      
arrangement, we may also take actions to protect the interests of our           
policyowners. For more information see Rights reserved by GIAC, and the         
prospectuses for the individual mutual funds.                                   

Investment objectives and policies of the funds                                 

Each fund has a different investment objective that it tries to achieve by      
following certain investment policies. These objectives affect the potential    
risks and returns for each fund, and there is no guarantee that a fund will be  
able to meet its investment objectives fully. Some funds have similar investment
objectives and policies to other funds managed by the same adviser. The         
investment results of the funds, however, may be higher or lower than the       
adviser's other funds. There is no assurance, and we make no representation,    
that the performance of any fund will be comparable to the performance results  
of any other fund.                                                              

The table below summarizes each fund's investment objective, along with the     
typical investments that make up that fund. There is no assurance that any of   
the funds will achieve its stated objective(s). For example, during extended    
peirods of low interest rates, the yields of money market variable investment   
options may become extremely low and possibly negative. You can find more       
detailed information about the portfolios, including a description of risks and 
expenses, in the prospectuses for the funds that accompany this prospectus. You 
should read these prospectuses carefully and keep them for future reference. The
AIM, Alliance, Davis, Fidelity, Gabelli, Janus, MFS, and Value Line funds are   
not affiliated with GIAC.

Fixed-rate option

The net premiums or policy account value you allocate to the fixed-rate option  
earn a set rate of interest. Your policy account value in the fixed-rate option 
is backed by GIAC's general account.                                            

THE FIXED-RATE OPTION 

The net premiums you allocate to the fixed-rate option earn a set rate of       
interest. You may allocate some or all of your net premiums to the fixed-rate   
option, and may transfer some or all of your investments in the variable        
investment options into the fixed-rate option. There are restrictions on making 
transfers out of the fixed-rate option. See Transfers between the investment    
options. Your policy account value in the fixed-rate option is backed by GIAC's 
general account.                                                                

We have not registered the fixed-rate option or our general account as          
investment companies, and interests in the fixed-rate option are not registered 
under the Securities Act of 1933. The SEC staff does not review the prospectus  
disclosure about the fixed-rate option or the general account, but the          
information we present may be subject to certain generally applicable provisions
of the federal securities laws regarding the accuracy and completeness of       
information appearing in a prospectus.                                          

Amounts in the fixed-rate option                                                

The total amount that you have invested in the fixed-rate option consists of:   

o     the portion of your net premiums and any loan repayments that you have    
allocated to this option, plus                                      

o     any amounts that you have transferred to this option from the variable    
investment options, plus                                            

o     the interest paid on your policy account value in this option, minus      

o     any deductions, withdrawals, or transfers from the fixed-rate option,     
including applicable charges.                                       

Because different interest rates may be in effect as you make transfers and     
contributions, your effective interest rate at any time may be a weighted       
average of the different rates which apply to the portions of your policy       
account value in the fixed-rate option. Interest accrues daily on the total that
you have invested in the fixed-rate option, including interest you have earned  
in previous years. The minimum annual interest rate for the fixed-rate option is
4%. Interest rates may be changed at any time in our discretion. We are not     
obliged to pay more than 4% in interest, although we may choose to do so.       
Deductions from the fixed-rate option are made from amounts in the fixed-rate   
option in the order in which they were added, beginning with amounts held there 
the longest.

While the insured is alive, you may borrow all or a portion of the loan value of
your policy, by assigning your policy to us as collateral for your loan.        

POLICY LOANS 

While the insured is alive, you may borrow all or a portion of the loan value of
your policy, by assigning your policy to us as collateral for your loan. Your   
policy's loan value is:                                                         

o     the net cash surrender value of your policy on the date we receive your   
written request,                                                    

o     minus 2% of                                                               

- cash surrender value minus                                          

- any outstanding policy debt as of the prior policy anniversary      

o     minus any interest due at the next policy anniversary on any existing     
policy debt                                                         

o     minus any interest that will be due at the next policy anniversary on the 
amount being borrowed.                                              

The minimum loan amount is $500, or your policy's loan value, whichever is less.
We will normally pay loan proceeds to you within seven days of receiving your   
request (see Policy proceeds for exceptions to this general rule).              

We will not process any loan request that does not specify the variable         
investment options from which the loan should be taken, or that exceeds the     
amount available.                                                               

When taking out a policy loan, you should consider:                             

o     amounts transferred out of the variable and fixed-rate options and into   
 our Loan Account are no longer affected by the investment experience,
    positive or negative, or interest crediting, of those allocation options

o     as a result, taking a policy loan will have a permanent effect on your    
policy account value, even after the loan is repaid in full         

o     the amount of your policy that is available for withdrawal or surrender,  
and your policy's death benefit proceeds, will also be reduced      
dollar-for-dollar by the amount of any policy debt                  

o     There may be tax consequences associated with taking a policy loan. See   
   Tax considerations for a discussion of modified endowment contracts and
the effects on policy loans.                                        

When you request a loan, we will first transfer that amount from the policy     
account value in the variable investment options that you specify in your       
request. If the amount of the loan requested exceeds the policy account value in
all variable investment options, we will transfer the excess from your policy   
account value in the fixed-rate option into our Loan Account.

The investments in the Loan Account will earn interest at a minimum annual rate 
of 4%. Starting at the later of the 21st year or attained age 61, this rate will
increase on a current basis to 4.4%. We may change this rate at any time, but it
is guaranteed not to be less than 4%. We credit this interest monthly to the    
Loan Interest Account. The tax consequences of a policy loan are uncertain if   
the difference between the interest rate we charge on the loan and the interest 
rate earned on the loan is very small, for example, after the 20th anniversary. 
See Treatment of Policy Proceeds."                                              

Interest on                                                                     
policy loans                                                                    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We charge interest at an annual rate of 5% on all outstanding policy debt,      
payable in arrears, until the 20th anniversary of your policy. After this point 
the annual rate falls to 4.5% for all existing and new policy loans.            

Interest on your policy loan                                                    

We charge simple interest that accrues daily at an annual rate of 5% on all     
outstanding policy debt, payable in arrears, until the 20th anniversary of your 
policy. After this, the annual rate falls to 4.5% for all existing and new      
policy loans. Interest accrues daily and is due on each policy anniversary. If  
you do not pay the interest on your loan when it is due, the amount will be     
capitalized and added to the Loan Account.                                      

We transfer the required amount from the Loan Interest Account to the Loan      
Account. After the transfer, any amount remaining in the Loan Interest Account  
is transferred to the variable investment options and the fixed-rate option in  
accordance with the current premium allocation instructions. If the amount in   
the Loan Interest Account is not sufficient to cover the loan interest due, any 
deficiency will be transferred proportionately from the amounts in the variable 
investment options and the fixed-rate option.                                   

Repaying your policy loan                                                       

Except for required loan repayments, you may repay all or part of any           
outstanding policy debt at any time while the insured is alive and the policy is
in force. The minimum loan repayment amount is $100 or the outstanding balance  
of your policy debt, whichever is lower.                                        

If the insured has died and the death benefit proceeds have not been paid,      
either in cash or under a payment option, you have 60 days after his or her     
death to repay any policy debt. If you do, we will then increase the amount     
payable to the beneficiary by the amount of your repayment.                     

Except for required loan repayments (see below), we will apply a loan repayment 
first to the payment of loan interest due but not yet capitalized, then to      
reduce amounts in the Loan Account and then to policy interest accrued since the
last policy anniversary but not yet due. We credit any repayment applied to     
reduce amounts in the Loan Account to the variable investment options and the   
fixed-rate option according to your current allocation instructions. The amount 
credited to the fixed-rate option will earn the interest rate in effect at that 
time until the next policy anniversary.                                         

Transfers under your policy that are made in connection with policy loans are   
not subject to transfer charges. Also, loan repayments are not subject to       
premium charges, so it may be to your advantage, if you have outstanding loans  
or interest, to make loan repayments rather than premium payments.

If, on any monthly processing date, you owe more in loans and interest than your
cash surrender value, we will notify you that a loan repayment is required for  
your policy to remain in force. Your policy will lapse without value 61 days    
after the default date set out in our notice if we do not receive a payment     
equal to the amount by which your policy debt exceeds the cash surrender value  
on the monthly processing date in question.                                     

If the insured dies after we have sent this notice, but before the 61 days are  
up, we will pay the beneficiary the death benefit proceeds, minus any policy    
debt and unpaid interest.                                                       

There may be adverse tax consequences if your policy lapses and you have        
outstanding policy debt.                                                        

Decreasing the face amount                                                      
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On and after the first policy anniversary, you may request a reduction in its   
face amount, which is the guaranteed minimum amount your policy will pay at     
death or maturity.                                                              

DECREASING THE FACE AMOUNT 

On and after the first policy anniversary, you may request a reduction in face  
amount, which is the guaranteed minimum amount your policy will pay at death. To
do this we require that:                                                        

o     you make your request in writing and we receive it at our customer service
office                                                              

o     the insured is alive when we receive your request                         

o     the reduction is at least $5,000 unless it is caused by a partial         
withdrawal, in which case the partial withdrawal rules apply        

o     the new face amount is not lower than our minimum face amount, currently  
$100,000, and                                                       

o     the monthly deductions are not currently being waived under a waiver of   
monthly deductions rider.                                           

We reduce your face amount on the monthly processing date coinciding with or    
next following the date we approve your request.                                

Reducing the face amount of your policy may have tax consequences, including    
possibly causing it to be considered a modified endowment contract under the    
Internal Revenue Code. A decrease in face amount also may reduce the federal tax
law limits on what you can put into the policy. In these cases, you may need to 
have a portion of the policy's cash value paid to you to comply with federal tax
law.

INCREASING THE FACE AMOUNT 

On any policy anniversary up to and including the anniversary closest to the    
insured's 70th birthday, you may ask us to increase your policy's face amount.  
To do this we require that:                                                     

o     you make your request in writing and we receive it at our customer service
office at least 30 days before your policy anniversary              

o     you prove that the insured meets our insurance requirements               

o     the increase be for at least $10,000, and                                 

o     the monthly deductions are not currently being waived under a waiver of   
monthly deductions rider.                                           

If we approve the increase, it will take effect on the policy anniversary on or 
after we receive the request, provided the insured is alive on that date. We'll 
send you revised policy pages reflecting the changes to your policy.            

An increase in face amount will be accompanied by a cost of insurance charge for
the increase, and new surrender charges. Increasing the face amount also may    
have tax consequences, including possibly causing your policy to be considered a
modified endowment contract under the Internal Revenue Code.                    

Partial withdrawals                                                             
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After the first policy year, you may withdraw part of your policy's net cash    
surrender value. The minimum partial withdrawal is $500.                        

PARTIAL WITHDRAWALS 

After the first policy year, you may withdraw part of your policy's net cash    
surrender value. You must make your request for withdrawal in writing, and the  
insured must be alive when you make the withdrawal. The minimum partial         
withdrawal is $500. We have the right to limit the number of partial withdrawals
you make in a policy year to 12.                                                

If we approve your request, it will be effective as of the business day we      
receive it at our customer service office. The proceeds will normally be paid   
within seven days of the time we receive your request. For exceptions to this   
general rule see Policy proceeds. We will not approve or process a partial      
withdrawal if:                                                                  

o     your remaining net cash surrender value would be insufficient to cover    
three times the most recent monthly deduction, or                   

o     you have chosen death benefit Option 1 or Option 3 and the partial        
      withdrawal would cause your policy's face amount to fall below our minimum
face amount, or                                                     

o     you do not specify the variable investment options from which the         
withdrawal is to be deducted.                                       

We will tell you if these conditions apply.                                     

A partial withdrawal will reduce your policy account value by the amount of the 
partial withdrawal. In addition the face amount will be reduced by the amount of
any partial withdrawal that exceeds the reduction-free partial withdrawal       
amount. The reduction-free partial withdrawal

amount is the maximum withdrawal that you can take, without triggering a        
reduction in your face amount. So if you wish to make a partial withdrawal that 
does not reduce your face amount, you should make a reduction-free partial      
withdrawal. The amount of your reduction-free partial withdrawal depends on the 
death benefit option in effect. If you have increased your policy's face amount 
by adding policy segments, we will reduce the face amount starting with the most
recent policy segment, and ending with the additional sum insured and the basic 
sum insured, in that order. See Decreasing the face amount.                     

We deduct the amount of your withdrawal from the policy account value           
attributable to the variable investment options that you specified in your      
request. If the partial withdrawal exceeds the policy account value attributable
to all variable investment options, we will deduct the excess amount from the   
policy account value attributable to the fixed-rate option.                     

The tax consequences of making partial withdrawals are discussed under Tax      
considerations.

You may surrender your policy for its net cash surrender value while the insured
is alive. Your policy's net cash surrender value will normally be paid within   
seven days of the time we receive your request.                                 

SURRENDERING YOUR POLICY 

You may surrender your policy for its net cash surrender value while the insured
is alive. We will calculate your policy's net cash surrender value as of the    
close of the business day we receive your written request, which must include   
your policy, or an acceptable affidavit confirming that you've lost your policy,
at our customer service office. Your policy's net cash surrender value will     
normally be paid within seven days of the time we receive your request. Your    
policy's net cash surrender value will be calculated as follows:                

o     your policy account value, including any amount held in the Loan Account  
and Loan Interest Account, minus                                    

o     any surrender charges, minus                                              

o     any outstanding policy debt.                                              

Your total surrender charges will be the total of the surrender charges for the 
initial face amount, and for any policy segments. See Deductions and charges.

You may ask us to transfer your policy account value in and out of the variable 
investment options, or into the fixed-rate option, at any time. Each transfer   
must be for a minimum of $500, or the total amount you have invested in the     
option you are transferring funds out of, whichever is lower.                   

TRANSFERS BETWEEN THE INVESTMENT OPTIONS 

You may ask us to transfer your policy account value in and out of the variable 
investment options, or into the fixed-rate option, at any time. We will make    
transfers based on the unit values at the end of the business day on which we   
receive your instructions, either in writing or by telephone. You can request a 
transfer by writing to our customer service office or by calling 1-800-441-6455.
Before you can request transfers over the telephone, you must first establish a 
Personal Identification Number (PIN). You can establish a PIN by sending us an  
executed Telephone Fund Transfer/Premium Allocation Change Form. Contact your   
Registered Representative or call 1-800-441-6455 to obtain a copy of this form. 

Written requests that are received after 4:00 p.m. New York time will be        
effective on the next business day. We will accept transfer instructions by     
telephone between 9:00 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. New York time on each business day. We
will ask callers to provide identification and a personal security code for the 
policy, and will accept the instructions of anyone who can provide this         
information. We may also record telephone transfer requests without notifying   
the caller. If we reasonably believe that telephone instructions are genuine, we
are not liable for any losses, damages or costs resulting from a transaction. As
a result, you bear the risk of any losses caused by unauthorized or fraudulent  
telephone transactions.                                                         

The rules for telephone transfers are subject to change, and we reserve the     
right to suspend or withdraw this service without notice. During periods of     
financial market or economic volatility, it may be difficult to

contact us in order to make a transfer by telephone. If this happens, you should
send your request to us in writing.                                             

Your net premium and policy account value may not be invested in or allocated to
more than twenty of our allocation options at any one time. Each transfer must  
be for a minimum of $500, or the total amount you have invested in the option   
you are transferring funds out of, whichever is lower. If you make more than    
twelve transfers within a policy year, we reserve the right to charge you $25   
for each additional transfer. We do not currently charge for additional         
transfers. We also reserve the right to limit you to one transfer every 30 days.
There are also restrictions on making transfers out of the fixed-rate option,   
which are outlined below. The policy is not designed for market timing activity 
and frequent transfers. A Fund may restrict or refuse purchases or redemptions  
of shares in its portfolio if the Fund determines that the activity is          
disruptive to the management of the portfolio's investments. If a Fund exercises
its right to restrict or refuse transactions by the Separate Account as a result
of your activity we will not process your transfer request.                     

The policy is not designed for market timing activity such as frequent transfers
or account rebalancing activity. We may limit your right to make transfers or   
allocation changes if we determine that your transfers would have an adverse    
effect on other policyowners. We will apply restrictions that we reasonably     
believe will prevent any disadvantage to other policyowners. Restrictions may be
imposed without prior notice and may include, without limitation:               

o     limiting the frequency of transfers to not more than once every 30 days;  

o     imposing a fee of $25 per transfer, if you make more than twelve transfers
within a policy year;                                               

o     requiring you to make your transfer requests through the U.S. Postal      
Service or otherwise restricting electronic or telephone transaction
priviliges;                                                         

o     refusing to act on instructions of an agent acting under a power of       
attorney on your behalf;                                            

o     refusing or otherwise restricting any transaction request that we believe 
  alone, or with a group of transaction requests, may have a detrimental
effect on the Separate Account or the underlying Funds, or          

o     we are informed by any of the Funds that the purchase or redemption of    
shares would have a detrimental effect on the applicable Funds.

TRANSFERS FROM THE FIXED-RATE OPTION 

You may only transfer your policy account value out of the fixed-rate option    
once each policy year. We must receive your request within 30 days of your      
policy anniversary. If we receive your request in the 30 days before your policy
anniversary, we will make the transfer on your policy anniversary. If we receive
your request in the 30 day period after your policy anniversary, we will make   
the transfer on the business day we receive your request. We will not honor     
requests to transfer investments out of the fixed-rate option that we receive at
any other time of the year.                                                     

When you request a transfer from the fixed-rate option, the amounts that you    
have held in the fixed-rate option longest will be withdrawn first.             

The maximum that you may transfer out of the fixed-rate option each policy year 
is either 33 1/3% of your allocation in the fixed-rate option on the policy     
anniversary on or immediately preceding the date of transfer, or $2,500,        
whichever is higher. If you have less than $2,500 in the fixed-rate option, you 
may transfer the entire amount.                                                 

Dollar cost averaging                                                           
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Under this option, you transfer the same dollar amount from The Guardian Cash   
Fund to a particular variable investment option or options each month, over a   
period of time. Dollar cost averaging may reduce the impact of price            
fluctuations on unit values of the variable investment options over the period  
that automatic transfers are made, but cannot guarantee an increase in the      
overall value of your investments or offer protection against losses in a       
declining market.                                                               

DOLLAR COST AVERAGING TRANSFER OPTION 

Under this option, you transfer the same dollar amount from The Guardian Cash   
Fund to a particular variable investment option or options each month, over a   
period of time. Using dollar cost averaging, you purchase more units in the     
variable investment options when their share prices are lower, and fewer units  
when prices are higher. In this way, dollar cost averaging may reduce the impact
of price fluctuations on unit values of the variable investment options over the
period that automatic transfers are made. However, this strategy cannot         
guarantee an increase in the overall value of your investments or offer         
protection against losses in a declining market.                                

More detailed information concerning our dollar-cost averaging program is       
available upon request from our customer service office.                        

POLICY PROCEEDS 

The amount that your beneficiaries will receive upon the death of the insured is
determined as explained under Death benefit options, and is payable when we     
receive proof that the insured has died while the policy was in effect. It is   
calculated as follows:                                                          

o     the death proceeds based on the death benefit option in effect as of the  
   monthly processing date immediately preceding the insured's death, plus

o     the proceeds of any coverage you have added to your policy through riders,
plus                                                                

o     if you have chosen death benefit Option 3, any premiums paid between the  
     monthly processing date and the insured's date of death, minus, as of the
date of the insured's death,                                        

                                                         -----------------------

o     any outstanding policy debt, minus                                        

o     as of the date of the insured's death, the lesser of:                     

o     any premium required under the No Lapse Guarantee; or         

   o     the amount required to bring the cash surrender value up to zero,

and minus                                                           

o     any partial withdrawals between the monthly processing date and the       
insured's date of death.                                            

We may adjust the death proceeds paid to the beneficiaries if:                  

o     the age or sex listed on the policy application is incorrect              

o     the insured commits suicide within two years of the policy issue date, a  
     change in the face amount, or the date a change in the death benefit from
    Option 1 or Option 3 to Option 2 takes effect (but only for any increase
    in the death benefit over your policy's face amount that was a result of
the change)                                                         

o     there are limits imposed by riders to the policy.                         

If the insured has reached the attained age of 100 or older, the death proceeds 
will be the policy account value minus any policy debt as of the date of death. 

The amount of all other transactions will be calculated at the end of the       
business day on which we receive the necessary instructions, information or     
documentation at our customer service office.                                   

If the proceeds are being taken from your policy account value in the variable  
investment options, we will normally pay proceeds within seven days of receiving
the necessary information. However, we may delay any transfers, loans or other  
payments made from the variable investment options when:                        

o     the New York Stock Exchange is closed, except for weekends or holidays, or
when trading has been restricted                                    

o     the Securities and Exchange Commission determines that a state of         
emergency exists, making policy transactions impracticable, or      

o     when one or more of the mutual funds corresponding to the variable        
      investment options legally suspends payment or redemption of their shares.

We will pay interest on the death proceeds from the date of the insured's death 
until the proceeds are paid, either in a lump sum or through a payment option.  

If the proceeds are from your policy account value in the fixed-rate option,    
they will normally be paid promptly once we have received the necessary         
information. However, we may delay any transfers, loans or other payments made  
from the fixed-rate option for up to six months

from the date of your request. If we do this, we will pay interest of at least  
3% per year on payments that we delay for 30 days or more. Please note that     
requests for transfers from the fixed-rate option may only be made during       
certain periods. See Transfers from the fixed-rate option.                      

Exchanging a policy

You may exchange all or a portion of your Park Avenue VUL policy for a level    
premium fixed-benefit whole life policy issued by us or one of our affiliates,  
without having to prove that the insured meets our insurance requirements.      

EXCHANGING A POLICY 

Exchange for Fixed-Benefit Whole Life Insurance Option                          

At any time prior to the later of the insured's attained age 70 or the second   
policy anniversary, you have the right to exchange all or a portion of your Park
Avenue VUL policy for a level premium fixed-benefit whole life policy issued by 
us or our affiliate, Guardian Life, without having to prove that the insured    
meets our insurance requirements. Once exercised, this right terminates. Under  
the new policy, your policy value will be held in the issuer's general account. 
Your face amount cannot exceed the face amount of this policy on the date you   
make the exchange nor be less than the minimum face amount under GIAC's or its  
affiliate's rules. If you exchange a portion of the face amount, the face amount
remaining must meet GIAC's minimum face amount requirements. The insured's age  
when the Park Avenue VUL policy took effect will also be carried over. Before   
you can make any exchange, however, you must repay any outstanding policy debt  
on your Park Avenue VUL policy, and all due monthly deductions must be paid. See
your policy for details.                                                        

The exchange may result in a cost or credit to you. On or before the fifth      
policy anniversary, the exchange cost or credit is the greater of (a) or (b)    
where:                                                                          

o     (a) is the cumulative premiums for the new policy (i.e., the premiums that
      would have been paid to the date of exchange if the new policy had been in
    force from the policy date) with an annual interest rate of 6%, less the
  pro-rata portion of the cumulative premiums for this policy (i.e., the
actual premiums paid for this policy to the date of the exchange)   
     applicable to the face amount exchanged accumulated at an annual interest
rate of 6%; and                                                     

o     (b) is the cash value of the new policy, less the pro-rata portion of this
    policy's net cash surrender value on the exchange date applicable to the
face amount exchanged.                                              

After the fifth policy anniversary, the exchange cost is equal to the cash value
of the new policy less the pro-rata portion of this policy's net cash surrender

If this amount is greater than zero, you must pay the exchange cost to the      
issuing company. If this amount is less than zero, the issuing company will pay 
an exchange credit to you.

by the issuer of your new policy, whichever is later.                           

Additional rider benefits are available only if you provide the issuer of your

Exchange for Fixed Benefit Paid-Up Insurance Option                             
(Available in New York Only)                                                    

On any policy anniversary, you may elect the Fixed Benefit Paid-Up Insurance    
Option. To be eligible for this option, we must receive your written request to 
elect this option at our customer service office on or within 30 days prior to a
policy anniversary, the insured must be living, and the policy must have a cash 
surrender value.                                                                

If you elect this option, we will transfer your policy account value to the     
general account. If any policy debt is outstanding, you may apply a portion of  
the policy account value to repay the policy debt. Any policy debt still        
outstanding on the date this option takes effect will continue as policy debt   
under this option with the same rate of interest. You may not make further      
premium payments under this option and any riders attached to the policy will be
cancelled.                                                                      

This option provides a level death benefit. The death benefit will be the amount
the net cash surrender value, if policy debt is being repaid, otherwise the cash
surrender value, will purchase as a net single premium at the insured's attained
age, sex and underwriting class.                                                

The Fixed Benefit Paid-Up Insurance Option will have a cash value and a policy  
loan value. We will send you policy pages reflecting the table of guaranteed    
values. The death benefit under this option will be reduced by the amount of any
outstanding policy debt. The cash value and the death benefit will be reduced   
after a partial withdrawal. The new death benefit will be the current death     
benefit multiplied by the ratio of the cash value after the partial withdrawal  
to the cash value before the partial withdrawal. No monthly administration      
charges will be deducted when this option is in effect. We will send you policy 
pages reflecting the new values.                                                

You should consult with legal and tax advisers before exchanging your policy    
under either of the above options.

You have several payment options for the death or surrender proceeds from your  
policy. These proceeds can either be paid in a single lump sum, or under one or 
more of the payment options specified in the accompanying text.                 

PAYMENT OPTIONS 

You have several payment options for the death or surrender proceeds from your  
policy. These proceeds can either be paid in a single lump sum, or under one or 
more of the payment options available under the policy, including payments of a 
fixed amount, or for a fixed period, or payments guaranteed for life. You may   
select a payment option while the insured is living. If the insured has died and
you have not chosen a payment option, the beneficiaries will be asked to choose 
the payment options, up to one year after the insured's death. If you are       
surrendering your policy, you have 60 days after the proceeds of your policy    
become payable within which to choose a payment option. You, or the             
beneficiaries, may choose to distribute the proceeds under more than one payment
option at a time, but you must distribute at least $5,000 through each option   
selected. Monthly payments under each option must be at least $50.              

The proceeds of your policy must be paid to a `natural person'. Payments will   
not be made to his or her estate if he or she dies before the proceeds have been
fully paid. You may name a second person to receive any remaining payments if   
this happens.                                                                   

The proceeds that we hold in order to make payments under the payment options do
not share in the income, gains or losses of the variable investment options, nor
do they earn interest in the same way or amount as funds in the fixed-rate      
option.                                                                         

For more information about the payment options available under the policy,      
contact our customer service office.

TAX CONSIDERATIONS                                                              
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tax status                                                                      
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To qualify as a life insurance contract and to receive the tax treatment        
normally accorded life insurance contracts under Federal tax law, a life        
insurance policy must satisfy certain requirements which are set forth in the   
Internal Revenue Code. For example, the underlying investments must be          
"adequately diversified" in order for the policy to be treated as a life        
insurance contract for Federal income tax purposes. It is intended that the     
investment divisions of the Separate Account, through the mutual funds, will    
satisfy these diversification requirements.                                     

THIS DISCUSSION of tax considerations for your Park Avenue VUL policy is general
in nature, does not purport to be complete or to cover all tax situations, and  
should not be considered as tax advice. It is based on our understanding of     
federal income tax laws as they are currently being interpreted. We cannot      
guarantee that these laws will not change while this prospectus is in use, or   
while your policy is in force. If you are interested in purchasing a policy,    
taking a policy loan or effecting policy transactions, you should consult a     
legal or tax adviser regarding your particular circumstances.                   

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TAX STATUS OF THE POLICY 

In order to qualify as a life insurance contract for federal income tax purposes
and to receive the tax treatment normally accorded life insurance contracts     
under federal tax law, a life insurance policy must satisfy certain requirements
which are set forth in Section 7702 of the Internal Revenue Code. Guidance as to
how these requirements are to be applied is limited. Accordingly, there is some 
uncertainty about the application of Section 7702 to a policy, particularly so  
with respect to policies issued on an insured who does not meet our insurance   
requirements for standard coverage. Nevertheless, we believe there is a         
reasonable basis for concluding that your policy should satisfy the applicable  
requirements. If it is subsequently determined that a policy does not satisfy   
the applicable requirements, we may take appropriate steps to bring the policy  
into compliance with such requirements and we reserve the right to modify the   
policy as necessary in order to do so.                                          

In certain circumstances, owners of variable life insurance policies have been  
considered for federal income tax purposes to be the owners of the assets of the
separate account supporting their contracts due to their ability to exercise    
investment control over those assets. Where this is the case, the policyowners  
have been currently taxed on income and gains attributable to separate account  
assets. There is little guidance in this area, and some features of the Park    
Avenue VUL policy, such as your flexibility to allocate premiums and the policy 
account value, have not been explicitly addressed in published rulings. While we
believe that the policy does not give policyowners investment control over the  
Separate Account's assets, we reserve the right to modify the policy as         
necessary to prevent the policyowner from being treated as the owner of the     
Separate Account assets supporting the policy.                                  

In addition, the Code requires that the investments of the investment divisions 
of our Separate Account be "adequately diversified" in order for the policy to  
be treated as a life insurance contract for federal income tax purposes. It is  
intended that the investment divisions of the Separate Account, through the     
mutual funds, will satisfy these diversification requirements.                  

The following discussion assumes that the policy will qualify as a life         
insurance contract for federal income tax purposes.

We believe that the death benefits under your policy should be excludable from  
the gross income of the beneficiary. Generally, under the existing federal tax  
laws, increases in the value of your policy will not be taxed federally unless  
you make a withdrawal before the insured dies.                                  

TREATMENT OF POLICY PROCEEDS 

We believe that the death benefits under your policy generally should be        
excludable from the gross income of the beneficiary. Generally, under the       
existing federal tax laws, increases in the value of your policy will not be    
taxed federally unless you make a withdrawal before the insured dies. The money 
that you receive when the insured dies is not subject to federal income tax, but
may be subject to federal estate taxes or generation skipping taxes. The tax    
consequences of continuing a policy beyond the insured's 100th year are unclear.
You should consult a tax advisor if you intend to keep the policy in force      
beyond the insured's 100th year.                                                

Partial withdrawals, surrenders and policy loans all result in money being taken
out of your policy before the insured dies. How this money is taxed depends on  
whether your policy is classified as a modified endowment contract.             

Under the Internal Revenue Code, certain life insurance contracts are classified
as "modified endowment contracts," with less favorable tax treatment than other 
life insurance contracts. Due to the flexibility of the policy as to premiums   
and benefits, the individual circumstances of each policy will determine whether
it is classified as a modified endowment contract. The rules are too complex to 
be summarized here, but generally depend on the amount of premium payments made 
during the first seven policy years. Certain changes in a policy after it is    
issued could also cause it to be classified as a modified endowment contract.   
You should consult with a competent tax adviser to determine whether a policy   
transaction will cause your policy to be classified as a modified endowment     
contract.                                                                       

If your policy is not considered a modified endowment contract:                 

o     money that you withdraw from your policy will generally be taxed only if  
     the total that you withdraw exceeds your "basis" in the policy - which is
generally equal to the total amount that you have paid in premiums. 
    However, certain distributions that must be made to enable the policy to
   continue to qualify as a life insurance contract for federal income tax
    purposes if policy benefits are reduced during the first 15 policy years
     may be treated in whole or in part as ordinary income subject to tax. The
 difference between what you have put in and what you take out will be
    taxed as ordinary income. When you withdraw money from your policy, your
basis is reduced by any amount withdrawn that is not taxed          

o     if you surrender your policy, you will generally be taxed only on the     
   amount by which the value of your policy, including any policy debt, is
greater than your basis in the policy. The tax consequences of      
      surrendering your policy may vary if you receive the proceeds under one of
the payment plans. Losses are generally not tax deductible          

o     policy loans are generally not taxable because they must be paid back. The
     interest you pay on these loans is generally not tax deductible. However,
    if your policy lapses while you have an outstanding policy loan, you may
    have to pay tax on the amount that you still owe to your policy. The tax
consequences of a policy loan are unclear if the

P-->485APOS52nd�Page�of�101TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�52nd
difference between the rate we charge on the loan and the interest rate earned  
on the loan is very small (e.g., after the 20th policy anniversary). You should 
consult a tax adviser regarding these consequences.                             

If your policy is considered a modified endowment contract:                     

o     all distributions other than death benefits, including partial            
  withdrawals, surrenders, assignments and policy loans, will be treated
    first as distributions of gain, taxable as ordinary income to the extent
    of any gain; and as a tax free recovery of basis only after all the gain
in the contract has been distributed.                               

o     all modified endowment contracts issued to you by GIAC or its affiliates  
during any calendar year will be treated as one modified endowment  
contract to determine the taxable portion of any distribution       

o     a 10% penalty tax will also apply to any taxable distribution unless it is
     made to a taxpayer who is 591/2 years of age or older; is attributable to
      a disability; or is received as substantially equal periodic payments made
    over the life (or life expectancy) of the taxpayer, or the life (or life
expectancies) of the taxpayer and a designated beneficiary.         

If a Policy becomes a modified endowment contract, distributions that occur     
during the contract year will be taxed as distributions from a modified         
endowment contract. In addition, distributions from a Policy within two years   
before it becomes a modified endowment contract will be taxed in this manner.   
This means that a distribution made from a Policy that is not a modified        
endowment contract could later become taxable as a distribution from a modified 
endowment contract.                                                             

EXCHANGES 

Generally, there are no tax consequences when you exchange one life insurance   
policy for another, as long as the same person is being insured (a change of the
insured under a policy is a taxable event). Paying additional premiums under the
new policy may cause it to be treated as a modified endowment contract. Your    
policy may also lose any "grandfathering" privilege, where you would be exempt  
from certain legislative or regulatory changes made after your original policy  
was issued, if you exchange your policy. You should consult with a tax adviser  
if you are considering exchanging any life insurance policy.                    

POLICY CHANGES 

We will make changes to policies and their riders where necessary to attempt to 
ensure that they continue to qualify as life insurance under the Internal       
Revenue Code, and policyowners are not considered the direct owners of the      
mutual funds held in the Separate Account. Any changes will be made uniformly to
all policies affected. We will provide advance notice in writing of these       
changes when required by state insurance regulators.                            

Federal, state and local governments may, from time to time, introduce new      
legislation concerning the taxation of life insurance policies. They can also   
change or adopt new interpretations of existing laws and

regulations without notice. If you have questions about the tax consequences of 
your Park Avenue VUL policy, please consult a legal or tax adviser.             

Transfer taxes

If you are both the policyowner and the insured, the death benefit under your   
Park Avenue VUL policy will generally be included in the value of your gross    
estate for federal estate tax purposes. If the beneficiary of the policy is     
someone who is two or more generations younger than the policyowner, the        
generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax may be imposed.                          

ESTATE AND GENERATION SKIPPING TRANSFER TAXES 

If you are both the policyowner and the insured, the death benefit under your   
Park Avenue VUL policy will generally be included in the value of your gross    
estate for federal estate tax purposes. If you are not the insured, the value of
the policy will be included in your gross estate.                               

Also, if the beneficiary of the policy is someone who is two or more generations
younger than the policyowner, the generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax may be 
imposed on the death benefit.                                                   

The individual situation of a policyowner or beneficiary will determine how the 
ownership of a policy or the receipt of policy proceeds will affect their tax   
situation. Because the rules are complex, a legal or tax adviser should be      
consulted for specific information.                                             

OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES                                                          

Park Avenue VUL policies can be used in various ways, including:                

o     as non-qualified deferred compensation or salary continuance plans        

o     in split-dollar insurance plans, and                                      

o     as part of executive bonus plans, retiree medical benefits plans, or other
similar plans.                                                      

The tax consequences of these plans will vary depending on individual           
arrangements and circumstances. We recommend that anyone considering buying a   
Park Avenue VUL policy with the expectation of favorable tax consequences should
consult with a qualified tax adviser before investing.                          

In addition, new rules have recently been passed by Congress relating to life   
insurance owned by businesses and the IRS has recently issued guidance relating 
to split-dollar arrangements. Any business should consult with a qualified tax  
adviser before buying a policy, and before making any changes or transactions   
under the policy.                                                               

Tax Shelter Regulations. Prospective policyowners that are corporations should  
consult a tax advisor about the treatment of the Policy under the regulations   
applicable to corporate tax shelters.                                           

Alternative Minimum Tax. There may also be an indirect tax upon                 
the income in the policy or the proceeds of a policy under the Federal corporate
alternative minimum tax, if the policyowner is subject to that tax.

Although the likelihood of legislative change is uncertain, there is always the 
possibility that the tax treatment of the policy could change by legislation or 
otherwise. You should consult a tax adviser with respect to legislative         
developments and their effect on the policy.

otherwise. You should consult a tax adviser with respect to legislative         
developments and their effect on the policy.                                    

GIAC'S TAXES 

Based on current life insurance tax regulations, GIAC does not pay tax on       
investment income or capital gains from the assets held in the Separate Account.
The operations of the Separate Account are reported on our federal income tax   
return, which is then consolidated with that of our parent company, Guardian    
Life.                                                                           

We may pay taxes at the state and local level, as well as premium taxes, but at 
present these are not substantial. If they increase, we reserve the right to    
recover these costs by charging the Separate Account or the policy.             

INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING 

We are generally required to withhold money for income taxes when you make a    
transaction on which you will have to pay tax. You can request in writing that  
we not withhold any amount for income tax purposes. If we do not, or if we fail 
to withhold enough to cover the taxes that are due, you could be penalized. You 
would also be responsible for any unpaid taxes when you file your regular income
tax return. We may similarly withhold generation skipping transfer taxes unless 
you tell us in writing that these taxes are not required.

RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES                                                     
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VOTING RIGHTS 

As explained in The variable investment options, we are the owner of the fund   
shares held in the Separate Account. As a result, we have the right to vote at  
any meeting of the funds' shareholders.                                         

Where we are required to by law, we will vote fund shares based on the          
instructions we receive from Park Avenue VUL policyowners. If we do not receive 
instructions from some policyowners, we will vote fund shares attributable to   
their policies, and any shares we own in our own right, in the same proportion  
as the shares attributable to the policyowners from whom we do receive          
instructions. This proportion could include policyowners and contract owners    
from other separate accounts.                                                   

If changes in the law or its interpretation allow us to make voting decisions in
our own right, or to restrict the voting of policyowners, we reserve the right  
to do so. We will ask you for your voting instructions if, on the record date   
set by the fund's directors, part of your policy account value is invested in   
the variable investment option of the Separate Account that corresponds to the  
mutual fund holding a shareholders' meeting.                                    

The number of votes that you have will be based on the number of shares that you
hold. We will calculate the number of shares, or fraction of a share, that you  
hold on the record date by dividing the dollar value of your investment in the  
division of the Separate Account corresponding to the mutual fund, by the net   
asset value of the variable investment option's shares on that date.            

If, after careful examination, we reasonably disapprove of a proposed change to 
a mutual fund's investment adviser, its advisory contract, or its investment    
objectives or policies, we may disregard policyowners' voting instructions, if  
the law allows us to do so. If the change affects the investment adviser or     
investment policy, we will only exercise this right if we determine in good     
faith that the proposed change is contrary to state law or is inappropriate in  
view of the fund's investment objective and purpose. If we exercise this right, 
we will provide a detailed explanation of our actions in the next semi-annual   
report to policyowners.                                                         

Certain activities related to the operation of the Separate Account may require 
the approval of policyowners. See Rights reserved by GIAC. If a vote is         
required, you will be given one vote for every $100 of your policy that is held 
in the variable investment options. For any investments that we hold on our own 
behalf, we will vote in the same proportion as our policyowners.                

You do not have the right to vote on the operations of the fixed-rate option.

LIMITS TO GIAC'S RIGHT TO CHALLENGE A POLICY 

Incontestability                                                                
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Generally, we cannot challenge your policy once it is in force for two years.   

Incontestability                                                                

Generally, we cannot challenge your policy or any face amount increase once it  
is in force for two years. If you change your policy's death benefit from Option
1 or Option 3 to Option 2, we have two years to challenge any increase in the   
death benefit that results from this change. If we are successful in our        
challenge, your death benefit will revert to what it would have been under      
Option 1 or Option 3, whichever is applicable.                                  

Misstatement of age or sex                                                      

If we find that the information in the application regarding the age or         
sex of the insured is wrong, we will adjust the death benefit to that which     
would have been purchased by the most recent deduction for cost of insurance    
under the policy and any rider costs using the correct age or sex.              

Suicide exclusion                                                               

If the insured commits suicide within two years of the policy's issue date,     
regardless of whether he or she is considered sane at the time, the amount that 
we must pay in death benefits will be limited to the greater of                 

o     the net cash surrender value as of the date of death, or                  

o     the policy premiums paid, minus                                           

o     any policy debt, minus                                                    

o     any partial withdrawals.                                                  

If the insured commits suicide, while sane or insane within two years from the  
effective date of any increase in the face amount, our liability will be limited
to the cost of insurance for such increase.                                     

If the insured commits suicide within two years of an increase in your policy's 
death benefit due to a change from Option 1 or Option 3 to Option 2, the death  
benefit will be limited to the original death benefit under Option 1 or Option  
3, whichever is applicable, plus the additional cost of insurance charges paid  
for the increased death benefit.                                                

RIGHTS RESERVED BY GIAC 

We reserve the right to make changes or take actions that we feel are           
in the best interests of the policyowners and their beneficiaries, or are       
appropriate for the policy. We will follow applicable laws and regulations in   
exercising our rights, and will seek the approval of policyowners or regulators 
when necessary. Some of the changes or actions we may take include:             

o     operating the Separate Account in any form permitted by law               

o     taking any action that will allow the Separate Account either to comply   
with or be exempt from sections of the 1940 Act                     

o     de-registering the Separate Account under the 1940 Act

o     transferring the assets from one division of the Separate Account into    
   other divisions, or to one or more separate accounts, or to our general
   account, and adding, combining, or removing investment divisions in the
Separate Account                                                    

o     substituting the shares of one mutual fund held through the Separate      
      Account for shares of a different class in the same mutual fund, shares of
a different mutual fund, or any other investment allowed by law     

o     adding to, suspending or eliminating your ability to direct how your net  
     premiums are invested, or to transfer your investments among the variable
investment options or the fixed-rate option                         

o     changing the way we make deductions or collect charges, consistent with   
the limits outlined in the policy                                   

o     changing the policy as required to ensure that it continues to qualify as 
    life insurance under the Internal Revenue Code, or to preserve favorable
tax treatment for your benefits under the policy, or                

o     making any changes necessary to the policy so that it conforms with any   
action we are permitted to take.                                    

Substitutions may be made with respect to existing policy value or the          
investment of future premium payments, or both. We may close subaccounts to     
allocations of premium payments or policy value, or both, at any time in our    
sole discretion. The funds, which sell their shares to the subaccounts pursuant 
to participation agreements, also may terminate these agreements and discontinue
offering their shares to the subaccounts.                                       

We will inform you if we make a change that affects the basic nature of the     
investments in any of the variable investment options. If this occurs, you will 
have 60 days from the postmark on our notice to transfer your investments out of
this option and into one of the other investment options, without charge. See   
Transfers between the investment options.                                       

YOUR RIGHT TO CANCEL YOUR POLICY 

You may cancel your policy by returning it with a written cancellation notice to
either our customer service office or the agent from whom you bought the policy.
You must do this within the later of:                                           

o     10 days of receiving your policy, or                                      

o     45 days of signing your completed policy application.                     

Longer periods may apply in some states.                                        

If a cancellation notice is sent by mail, it will be effective on the date of   
the postmark. Once we receive your notice, we will refund all of the premiums   
you have made towards your policy, and it will be considered void from the      
beginning. We may delay refunding any payments you made by check until your     
check has cleared.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DISTRIBUTION OF THE POLICIES 

We have entered into a distribution agreement with Guardian Investor Services   
LLC (GIS) for the distribution and sale of the policies. GIS is affiliated with 
us. GIS acts as principal underwriter of the Park Avenue VUL policies as well as
other variable life insurance policies and variable annuities that we offer. The
Park Avenue VUL policies are distributed by GIAC agents who are licensed by     
state insurance authorities to sell variable life insurance and are registered  
representatives of GIS or other broker-dealer firms with which GIAC has entered 
into agreements to sell the policies.                                           

We pay commissions for the sale of the policies. GIAC agents will receive a     
maximum sales commission of:                                                    

o     50% of the policy premium paid for the first policy year or the first year
 of a policy segment up to one target premium, and 2.85% of any policy
premiums in excess of one target premium, then                      

o     4% of the policy premiums paid for policy years two through ten or years  
     two through ten of any policy segment up to one target premium, and 3% of
any policy premiums in excess of one target premium, then           

o     0.15% per annum of the policy account value (excluding loans) paid monthly
after policy year 10.                                               

In certain group and sponsored arrangements, maximum commissions are 15% of     
premiums paid up to one target premium in the first policy year, 20% in policy  
years two through four, 7% in policy years five through ten. Premiums in excess 
of one target are compensated at the maximum rate of 2.85% in the first policy  
year, and 3% in policy years two through ten. In policy years after year ten, a 
maximum of 0.15% of policy account value (excluding loans) is paid.             

We also may compensate our agents through compensation overrides, expense       
allowances, bonuses, wholesaler fees and training allowances. GIAC agents also  
may qualify for non-cash compensation.                                          

If you return your policy under the right to cancel provisions, the GIAC agent  
may have to return some or all of any commission we have paid.                  

SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFITS AND RIDERS 

We offer several riders or additional benefits that you can add to your policy. 
Certain of these riders are subject to age and underwriting requirements. We    
generally deduct monthly charges for these riders from your policy account      
value.

this prospectus. These riders may not be available in all states.               

TELEPHONE AND ELECTRONIC SERVICES 

We will process certain transactions by telephone if you have authorized us to  
do so. We currently take requests for fund transfers and changes in allocation  
of future premiums over the phone. See How your premiums are allocated and      
Transfers Between the Investment Options for more details on requesting these   
transactions telephonically.                                                    

In addition to these telephone services, in the future we anticipate offering   
you the ability to use your personal computer to receive documents              
electronically, review your policy information and to perform other specified   
transactions. We will notify you as these electronic services become available. 
At that time, if you want to participate in any or all of our electronic        
programs, we will ask that you visit our website for information and            
registration. You may also be able to register by other forms of communication. 
If you choose to participate in the electronic document delivery program, you   
will receive financial reports, prospectuses, confirmations and other           
information via the Internet. You will not receive paper copies.                

Generally, you are automatically eligible to use these services when they are   
available. You must notify us if you do not want to participate in any or all of
these programs. Should you decline to participate, you will be able to reinstate
these services at any time. You bear the risk of possible loss if someone gives 
us unauthorized or fraudulent registration or instructions for your account so  
long as we believe that the registration or instructions are genuine and we have
followed reasonable procedures to confirm that the registration or instructions 
communicated by telephone or electronically are genuine. If we do not follow    
reasonable procedures to confirm that the registration or instructions are      
genuine, we may be liable for any losses. Please take precautions to protect    
yourself from fraud. Keep your policy information and PIN number private and    
immediately review your statements and confirmations. Contact us immediately    
about any transactions you believe to be unauthorized.                          

We may change, suspend or eliminate telephone or Internet privileges at any     
time, without prior notice. We reserve the right to refuse any transaction      
request that we believe would be disruptive to policy administration or not in  
the best interests of the policyowners or the

Separate Account. Telephone and Internet services may be interrupted or response
times slow if we are experiencing physical or technical difficulties, or        
economic or market emergency conditions. While we are experiencing such         
difficulties, we ask you to send your request by regular or express mail and we 
will process it using the net asset value first calculated after we receive the 
request. We will not be responsible or liable for: any inaccuracy, error or     
delay in or omission of any information you transmit or deliver to us; any loss 
or damage you may incur because of such inaccuracy, error, delay, omission or   
non-performance; or any interruption resulting from emergency circumstances.    

LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR EMPLOYERS 

The Park Avenue VUL policy estimates different risks for men and women in       
establishing a policy's premiums, benefits and deductions, except in states     
where gender-neutral standards must be used. In 1983, the United States Supreme 
Court held that optional annuity benefits offered under an employer's deferred  
compensation plan could not, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,   
vary between men and women on the basis of sex. Anyone interested in buying Park
Avenue VUL policies in connection with insurance or benefits programs should    
consult with their legal advisers to determine if the policy is appropriate for 
this purpose.                                                                   

ILLUSTRATIONS 

Illustrations can help demonstrate how the policy operates, given the policy's  
charges, investment options and any optional features selected, how you plan to 
accumulate or access policy value over time, and assumed rates of return.       
Illustrations may also be able to assist you in comparing the policy's death    
benefits, cash surrender values and policy values with those of other variable  
life insurance policies based upon the same or similar assumptions. You may ask 
your registered representative or us (at our toll-free telephone number) to     
provide an illustration, without charge, based upon your specific situation.    

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

We are not currently involved in any legal proceedings that would threaten our  
financial position or that of the Separate Account.

Loan account                                                                    

An account to which values from the variable investment options and the         
fixed-rate option are transferred when a policy loan is taken. The Loan Account 
is equal to the loan.                                                           

Loan amount                                                                     

The sum of any amounts borrowed plus any capitalized loan interest less any loan
repayment.

An account that represents the interest earnings credited by GIAC on the Loan   
Account.                                                                        

Minimum annual premium                                                          

An amount used to determine whether your policy meets the No Lapse Guarantee    
Premium Test, and in setting your policy's initial premium. It is shown in your 
policy.                                                                         

Monthly processing date                                                         

The day of each policy month on which the monthly deduction is deducted from the
policy account value and certain policy benefits and values are calculated. The 
monthly processing date is the same date of each calender month as the policy   
date, or the last day of a calender month if that is earlier. If such calendar  
day is not a business day, the monthly processing date will be the next         
following business day.                                                         

Net accumulated premiums                                                        

At issue, net accumulated premiums equals the value of the initial premium      
payment. Thereafter, net accumulated premiums will increase, as a result of     
premium payments made, and decrease, as a result of partial withdrawals. After a
premium payment, net accumulated premiums will be equal to the value of net     
accumulated premiums before the premium payment plus the amount of the premium  
paid. After a partial withdrawal, net accumulated premiums is equal to the      
greater of (i) the value of net accumulated premiums before the withdrawal,     
decreased by the amount of the partial withdrawal, or (ii) zero.                

Net amount at risk                                                              

The difference between the amount that you would be paid under a policy segment 
under the policy's death benefit and the policy account value allocated to that 
segment.                                                                        

Net Premium                                                                     

The amount of premium that remains after we deduct premium charges from the     
premiums you pay.

No Lapse Guarantee                                                              

For the first three years of your policy the No Lapse Guarantee ensures that it 
will not lapse, even if the net cash surrender value of your policy is not      
enough to pay the policy's monthly deduction in a given month, so long as the No
Lapse Guarantee Premium Test is met. For policies issued in the State of        
Illinois, the No Lapse Guarantee and the No Lapse Guarantee Premium Test are    
known as the Minimum Premium Period and Minimum Premium Period Test,            
respectively.                                                                   

No Lapse Guarantee Premium Test                                                 

This test is used to determine whether your policy qualifies for the No Lapse   
Guarantee. It states that, as of the most recent monthly processing date, you   
must have paid at least as much into your policy (minus any withdrawals or      
policy debt) as the minimum annual premiums up to this date, as outlined in your
policy. To calculate your minimum annual premium for the current policy year,   
multiply your minimum annual premium by a ratio equal to the number of completed
policy months since the last policy anniversary plus 1 over 12. For policies    
issued in the State of Illinois, the No Lapse Guarantee and the No Lapse        
Guarantee Premium Test are known as the Minimum Premium Period and Minimum      
Premium Period Test, respectively.                                              

Policy anniversary                                                              

The same date each year as the policy date.                                     

Policy date                                                                     

The date your policy comes into effect. This date is used to measure policy     
months, policy years, policy anniversaries, and monthly processing dates.       

Policy debt                                                                     

The unpaid policy loan amount plus the accumulated and unpaid interest on those 
loans.                                                                          

Policy Segment                                                                  

The additional coverage provided by an increase in face amount.                 

Target premium                                                                  

A measure of premium used to determine your policy's premium charges and agent  
commissions. Your policy's basic sum insured, additional sum insured and any    
policy segments you buy each have their own target premium. The target premium  
associated with the basic sum insured and additional sum insured is based on the
insured's age, underwriting class and sex (unless gender-neutral rates are      
required by law). The target premium associated with any policy segment is based
on the insured's attained age and the underwriting class for each policy        
segment.                                                                        

The target premium for any rider, except the guaranteed coverage rider, is based
on the monthly deduction for that rider during the first policy year.

APPENDIX B                                                                      
ADDITIONAL BENEFITS BY RIDER                                                    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional benefits are available by riders to the policy. Riders are issued    
subject to GIAC's standards for classifying risks. GIAC charges premiums for    
additional benefit riders. These premium amounts are deducted monthly from      
policy account value. The benefits provided by the riders are fully described in
the riders and summarized here. These riders may not be available in all states.

Adjustable Annual Renewable Term (AART) rider -- this rider, available only at  
issue, provides term insurance coverage to the insured's age 100. Coverage under
this rider has no cash value associated with it. If you have purchased an       
additional sum insured you cannot have an AART rider. If AART overage is greater
than basic sum insured coverage, you cannot purchase a guaranteed coverage      
rider.                                                                          

Waiver of Monthly Deductions rider -- this rider provides for the waiver of the 
monthly deductions while the insured is totally disabled as defined in the      
rider. Age limits apply. It is only available on policies with a Face Amount of 
$3,000,000 or less.                                                             

Guaranteed Coverage rider ("GCR") -- this rider, available with death benefit   
option 1 and at issue only, guarantees that the policy will remain in force even
if the net cash surrender value is less than the current monthly deduction,     
provided the GCR requirement, as described in the rider, is met. It is not      
available if coverage under the additional sum insured or AART rider is greater 
than the basic sum insured at issue.                                            

Disability Benefit rider -- this rider provides for crediting as a benefit an   
amount equal to the specified amount, as defined in the rider, while the insured
is totally disabled, as defined in the rider. It is only available on policies  
with a Face Amount less than $3,000,000.                                        

Accidental Death Benefit rider -- this rider, available only at issue, provides 
additional insurance coverage if the insured's death results from accidental    
bodily injury on or before the policy anniversary nearest the insured's 75th    
birthday. The maximum coverage under this rider is the lesser of (i) $500,000 or
(ii) the basic sum insured plus coverage provided by the additional sum insured 
or AART rider.                                                                  

Guaranteed Insurability Option rider -- this rider, available only at issue,    
provides the policyowner the right to increase the face amount of insurance     
coverage without evidence of insurability on the policy anniversaries nearest   
certain birthdays of the insured, or within specified time periods of qualifying
life events subject to the conditions in the rider.                             

Select Security rider -- this rider, used in split dollar cases, is an          
endorsement that prevents the policy owner from making certain policy changes   
without the consent of the policy owner's employer. There is no charge for this 
rider.                                                                          

Exchange of Insureds rider -- this rider gives the policy owner the right to    
exchange the policy for a new one on the life of a substitute insured. The      
exercise of this rider will be treated as a taxable exchange for federal income 
tax purposes.                                                                   

Depending on your individual circumstances, it may or may not be to your        
advantage to add coverage to your policy through a rider. Some of the           
circumstances to consider include the premium you want to pay, the amount of    
coverage and how long you want this additional coverage for, and the age, sex   
and underwriting classification of the insured. Your GIAC representative can    
help you decide whether adding rider benefits to your policy would be in your   
best interest.                                                                  

GIAC may from time to time discontinue the availability of one or more of these 
riders, or make other riders available. GIAC agents can provide information     
about the current availability of particular riders.

APPENDIX C

ILLUSTRATIONS OF DEATH BENEFITS, POLICY ACCOUNT VALUES,                         
NET CASH SURRENDER VALUES AND ACCUMULATED POLICY PREMIUMS                       

   The following tables illustrate how the policies operate. Specifically,
they show how the death benefit, net cash surrender value and policy account    
value can vary over an extended period of time assuming hypothetical gross rates
of return (i.e., investment income and capital gains and losses, realized or    
unrealized) for the Separate Account that are equal to constant after tax annual
rates of 0%, 6% and 10%. The tables are based on policies issued prior to May 1,
2002 with face amounts of $250,000 for a male insured Age 40, preferred plus    
underwriting class, utilizing the guideline premium test. Values are first given
based on current charges and then based on the policy's higher guaranteed       
charges. Each illustration is given first for a policy with an Option 1 death   
benefit, then for a policy with an Option 2 death benefit, and, finally, for a  
policy with an Option 3 death benefit. These illustrations may assist in the    
comparison of death benefits, net cash surrender values and policy account      
values for Park Avenue VUL policies with those under other variable life        
insurance policies that may be issued by GIAC or other companies. Prospective   
policyowners are advised, however, that it may not be advantageous to replace   
existing life insurance coverage by purchasing a Park Avenue VUL policy,        
particularly if the decision to replace existing coverage is based primarily on 
a comparison of policy illustrations.                                           

    Actual returns will fluctuate over time and likely will be both positive
and negative. The actual death benefits, net cash surrender values and policy   
account values under the policy could be significantly different from those     
shown even if actual returns averaged 0%, 6% and 10%, but fluctuated over and   
under those averages throughout the years shown. Depending on the timing and    
degree of fluctuation, the actual values could be substantially less than those 
shown, and may, under certain circumstances, result in the lapse of the policy  
unless the policyowner pays more than the stated premium.                       

    Death benefits, net cash surrender values and policy account values will
also be different from the amounts shown if: (1) the actual gross rates of      
return average 0%, 6%, or 10%, but vary above and below the average over the    
period; and (2) premiums are paid at other than annual intervals. Benefits and  
values will also be affected by the policyowner's allocation of the unloaned    
policy account value among the variable investment options and the fixed-rate   
option. If the actual gross rate of return for all options averages 0%, 6%, or  
10%, but varies above or below that average for individual options, allocation  
and transfer decisions can have a significant impact on a policy's performance. 
Policy loans and other policy transactions, such as partial withdrawals, will   
also affect results, as will the insured's sex, smoker status and underwriting  
class.                                                                          

     Death benefits, net cash surrender values and policy account values shown
in the tables reflect the fact that: (1) deductions have been made from premiums
for premium charges; and (2) the monthly deduction is deducted from the policy  
account value on each monthly processing date. The net cash surrender values    
shown in the tables reflect the fact that a surrender charge is deducted upon   
surrender or lapse during the first 9 policy years. See Deductions and charges. 
The amounts shown in the illustrations also reflect an arithmetic average of the
investment advisory fees and operating expenses incurred by the mutual funds, at
an annual rate of 0.87% of the average daily net assets of such funds. The      
average is based upon actual expenses, before applicable expense reimbursements 
and fee waivers, incurred during 2002. For an explanation of the expenses see   
the accompanying fund prospectuses.                                             

      Taking account of the charges, the average investment advisory fee and the
operating expenses of the mutual funds, the gross annual rates of return of 0%, 
6% and 10% correspond to net investment experience at ____%, ____%, and ____%,  
respectively. See Net investment factor.                                        

     The hypothetical rates of return shown in the tables do not reflect any tax
charges attributable to the Separate Account since no charges are currently     
made. If any such charges are imposed in the future, the gross annual rate of   
return would have to exceed the rates shown by an amount sufficient to cover the
tax charges, in order to produce the death benefits, net cash surrender values  
and policy account values illustrated. See GIAC's taxes.

APPENDIX C                                                                      

      The fourth column of each table shows the amount which would accumulate if
an amount equal to the target premium was invested to earn interest, after      
taxes, of 5% per year, compounded annually. There can be no assurance that a    
prospective policyowner would be able to earn this return.                      

  GIAC will furnish upon request an illustration reflecting the proposed
insured's Age, sex, underwriting class, face amount requested, and life         
insurance test selected, but a premium-based illustration must reflect GIAC's   
current minimum face amount requirement for Park Avenue VUL -- which is         
$100,000. If you are already a Park Avenue VUL policyowner, please contact your 
registered representative for a current illustration.                           

   These illustrations will refer to "net outlay" as the cash flow into or
out of the policy. It is equal to the sum of all premiums and accrued loan      
interest paid in cash and reduced by the proceeds of any policy loan or partial 
withdrawal received in cash. For purposes of these illustrations "net outlay"   
will be equal to target premium.                                                

     From time to time, advertisements or sales literature for Park Avenue VUL
may quote historical performance data of one or more of the underlying funds,   
and may include cash surrender values and death benefit figures computed using  
the same methodology as that used in the following illustrations, but with      
historical average annual total returns of the underlying funds for which       
performance data is shown in the advertisement or sales literature replacing the
hypothetical rates of return shown in the following tables. This information may
be shown in the form of graphs, charts, tables, and examples. Any such          
information is intended to show the policy's investment experience based on the 
historical experience of the underlying funds and is not intended to represent  
what may happen in the future.                                                  

      GIAC began to offer Park Avenue VUL on June 15, 2000. As such the policies
may not have been available when the funds commenced their operations. However, 
illustrations may be based on the actual investment experience of the funds     
since their respective inception dates (See Investment performance of the       
Funds). The results for any period prior to the policies' being offered would be
calculated as if the policies had been offered during that period of time, with 
all charges assumed to be those applicable to the policies. Thus the            
illustrations will reflect deductions for each fund's expenses, and the charges 
deducted from premiums, monthly deductions and any transaction deductions       
associated with the policy in question.

ABOUT GIAC                                                                      

Your Park Avenue VUL policy is issued, through its Separate Account N, by The   
Guardian Insurance & Annuity Company, Inc. (GIAC), a Delaware stock insurance   
company formed in 1970. GIAC is licensed to sell life insurance and annuities in
all 50 states of the United States of America and the District of Columbia. As  
of December 31, 2002, our total assets (gaap basis) exceeded $__ billion.       

We are wholly owned by The Guardian Life Insurance Company of America (Guardian 
Life), a mutual life insurance company organized in the State of New York in    
1860. As of December 31, 2002, Guardian Life had total assets (GAAP basis) in   
excess of $________ billion. The offices of both Guardian Life and GIAC are     
located at 7 Hanover Square, New York, New York 10004.                          

Both Guardian Life and GIAC have consistently received exemplary ratings from   
Moody's Investors Service, Inc., Standard & Poor's Corporation, Duff & Phelps   
and A.M. Best. These ratings may change at any time, and only reflect GIAC's    
ability to meet its insurance-related obligations and the guaranteed return on  
the fixed-rate option. These ratings do not apply to the variable investment    
options, which are subject to the risks of investing in any securities. Guardian
Life does not issue the Park Avenue VUL policies, and does not guarantee the    
benefits provided by the policy.                                                

The Guardian Separate Account N was established by GIAC's Board of Directors on 
September 23, 1999 under the insurance laws of the State of Delaware. It is     
registered with the SEC as a unit investment trust.                             

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE POLICY                                         

Issuing the Policy                                                              

If you already own certain fixed-benefit life insurance policies issued by us or
by Guardian Life, you may be able to buy a Park Avenue VUL policy without having
to meet our insurance requirements again. You can do this by exchanging your    
current policy for a Park Avenue VUL policy or if your fixed-benefit policy     
contains a rider to permit you to purchase a Park Avenue VUL policy. You may    
also be able to convert to a Park Avenue VUL policy if your existing policy     
contains appropriate riders. In this case you may have to meet minimal insurance
requirements.                                                                   

If you have a convertible term policy, or a whole life policy with a convertible
term rider, you may receive a credit of up to one minimum annual premium if you 
convert it to a Park Avenue VUL policy.                                         

Death Benefit Options                                                           
Cash Value Test                                                                 

To satisfy this test, the death benefit must be at least equal to the policy    
account value multiplied by a death benefit factor. A table of death benefit    
factors appears in your policy. These factors are equal to one divided by the   
net single premium (the single premium that would be needed to pay for the death
benefit under the policy, including any additional sum insured).                

Guideline Premium Test                                                          

The Guideline Premium Test consists of two parts: the Guideline Premium Test and
the Cash Value Corridor Test.                                                   

To satisfy the Guideline Premium Test the total of all premiums you pay must not
exceed certain maximums. The total of premiums paid, minus the nontaxable       
portion of partial withdrawals, must not be greater than the larger of the      
following:                                                                      

o     the guideline single premium on the date the calculation is done, or      

o     the sum of the guideline level premiums to the date the calculation is    
done.                                                               

For the purposes of this test, the guideline single premium is the premium that 
would be necessary to pay for future benefits under the policy as calculated at 
the time the policy is issued. It's based on "reasonable" mortality and expense 
charges (as defined in Section 7702 of the Internal Revenue Code) and an        
effective annual interest rate of 6%.                                           

-----

The guideline level premium is the level annual premium payable to age 100 that 
would be necessary to pay for all future benefits under the policy as calculated
at the time the policy is issued. It's based on "reasonable" mortality and      
expense charges (as defined in Section 7702 of the Internal Revenue Code) and an
effective annual interest rate of 4%.                                           

Payment of premiums in excess of the guideline premium limit is permitted if    
those premiums are necessary to keep the policy in force.                       

To satisfy the Cash Value Corridor Test, the death benefit must at least equal  
the percentage of the policy account value shown in the following table:

Changing Your Death Benefit Option                                              

If you're changing from Option 1 to Option 2, we will decrease the face amount  
by the lesser of (i) the policy account value on the date the change takes      
effect or (ii) the face amount divided by the applicable death benefit factor   
shown in your policy. You must also prove that the insured meets our insurance  
requirements and we will terminate any additional sum insured.                  

If you're changing from Option 2 to Option 1, we will increase the face amount  
by the lesser of (i) the policy account value on the date the change takes      
effect, or (ii) the face amount divided by [the applicable death benefit factor 
minus 1]. The applicable death benefit factor is shown on page 4 of your policy.

If you're changing from Option 3 to Option 1, we will increase the face amount  
by the amount of net accumulated premiums on the date the change takes effect.  

If you're changing from Option 3 to Option 2, we will adjust the face amount by 
an amount equal to net accumulated premiums on the effective date of the change 
minus the lesser of: (i) policy account value on the effective date of the      
change or (ii) the face amount divided by the applicable death benefit factor   
shown on page 4 of your policy.

Net investment factor                                                           

We calculate the unit value of each variable investment option on each business 
day by multiplying the option's immediately preceding unit value by the net     
investment factor for that day. We calculate the net investment factor as       
follows on each business day:                                                   

o     the net asset value of one share of the mutual fund corresponding to the  
     variable investment option at the close of the current business day, plus

o     the amount per share of any dividends or capital gains distributed by the 
     fund on the current business day, minus any federal, state or local taxes
    payable by GIAC and allocated by GIAC to the variable investment option;
divided by                                                          

o     the net asset value of one share of the same mutual fund at the close of  
the previous business day.                                          

The prospectuses for each fund describe how they calculate the net asset values 
of their mutual fund shares.                                                    

Decreasing the face amount                                                      

Your death benefit option will determine how your policy is affected by a       
reduction in the face amount due to a partial withdrawal:                       

o     under Option 1, a partial withdrawal will typically cause an immediate    
reduction in your policy's face amount.                             

o     under Option 2, a partial withdrawal will not reduce your policy's face   
    amount. However, the amount of your death benefit will decline with each
partial withdrawal.                                                 

o     under Option 3, a partial withdrawal will typically not cause an immediate
     reduction in your policy's face amount. However, the amount of your death
benefit will decline with each partial withdrawal.                  

If you have made one or more increases to the initial face amount by adding     
policy segments and then request a face amount decrease, we will apply the      
decrease to your policy segments as follows. We start with the most recent      
policy segment, followed by the next most recent, and so on, and then reduce the
additional sum insured portion of the initial face amount and, finally, reduce  
the basic sum insured portion of the initial face amount.                       

Since we do not deduct a surrender charge when you decrease the face amount, the
surrender charge does not change. Your policy account value must always be      
greater than the surrender charge. Further, the administrative charge per $1,000
of coverage is not reduced by a decrease in face amount.                        

We will send you policy pages that reflect the changes resulting from your      
reduction in the face amount.                                                   

Reducing the face amount of your policy may have tax consequences, including    
possibly causing it to be considered a modified endowment contract under the    
Internal Revenue Code. A decrease in face amount may also reduce the federal tax
law limits on what you can put into the policy. In these cases you may need to  
have a portion of the policy's cash value paid to you to comply with federal tax
law. See Tax considerations.                                                    

You can also reduce or cancel coverage provided by the Adjustable Annual        
Renewable Term rider. Areduction in the face amount of the Adjustable Annual    
Renewable Term rider will not affect the face amount of your policy. Likewise,  
you can decrease the face amount of your policy without reducing the coverage of
your term rider.                                                                

Consult your sales representative for advice.                                   

Increasing the Face Amount                                                      

We'll issue the increase in the form of a separate policy segment. Each policy  
segment has its own underwriting class, rate for cost of insurance, surrender   
charges, administrative charges, premium charge, target premium, and, during the
first three policy years, minimum annual premium.                               

After an increase in the face amount takes effect, to calculate premium charges 
we will allocate premium payments first to the initial face amount and then to  
each policy segment, starting with the oldest policy segment and ending with the
most recent one. We'll allocate premiums in such a way that they won't exceed   
the annual target premium                                                       

-----                                                                           
B-4                                                                           
-----                                                                           

P-->485APOS80th�Page�of�101TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�80th
for the initial face amount or for each policy segment. When the sum of the     
premiums paid during a policy year exceeds the target premium for the initial   
face amount, we will allocate the excess to the first policy segment. If the    
premiums you pay during a policy year exceed the target premiums for all the    
policy segments and the initial face amount, we'll allocate the excess          
proportionately according to the target premiums for the initial face amount and
each policy segment.                                                            

If you increase the face amount of your policy, it will be subject to new       
surrender charges. We'll calculate the surrender charges as if you had bought a 
new policy for the increase in the face amount. A new 9-year surrender charge   
will apply to the policy segment that increased the face amount. We'll notify   
you about the new surrender charge after any increase in the face amount.       

You don't have to pay an additional premium to increase the face amount.        
However, you may have to make a premium payment to prevent the policy from going
into default. That's because the new surrender charges triggered by an increase 
in the face amount would automatically reduce the net cash surrender value of   
the policy. Depending on your circumstances, a premium payment may be necessary 
to keep the net cash surrender value above zero.                                

Increasing the face amount of your policy may have tax consequences, including  
possibly causing your policy to be considered a modified endowment contract. The
tax consequences associated with your policy being classified as a modified     
endowment contract are discussed in the prospectus at Tax considerations.       

Reduction-free partial withdrawals                                              

We will calculate the reduction-free partial withdrawal amount as of the close  
of business on the date we receive your request. This amount will be affected by
which death benefit option you have chosen.                                     

If you have chosen death benefit Option 1, your reduction-free partial          
withdrawal amount is any positive amount resulting from:                        

o     your policy account value, minus                                          

o     your policy's face amount divided by the death benefit factor outlined in 
your policy.                                                        

If you have chosen death benefit Option 2, all partial withdrawals are          
reduction-free.                                                                 

If you have chosen death benefit Option 3, your reduction-free partial          
withdrawal amount is the greater of:                                            

o     your net accumulated premiums immediately prior to the partial withdrawal,
or                                                                  

o     any positive amount resulting from:                                       

o     your policy account value, minus                              

o     your policy's face amount divided by the death benefit factor 
outlined in your policy.                                

Dollar cost averaging                                                           

The amount of your monthly transfer under this option must be at least $100 for 
each variable investment option you wish to invest in. Amounts will be          
transferred automatically on each monthly processing date from The Guardian Cash
Fund into the variable investment options you have chosen.                      

Before the program can begin, you must submit an authorization form.            

We will stop your dollar cost averaging program when:                           

o     the period of time listed on your dollar cost averaging authorization form
ends                                                                

o     your policy account value in The Guardian Cash Fund is insufficient to    
     cover your monthly investment in the variable investment options you have
   chosen. If this happens we will divide what you do have in The Guardian
   Cash Fund proportionally among the variable investment options you have
chosen, leaving a balance of zero in The Guardian Cash Fund

Payment options                                                                 

Under Payment Option 1, we will hold the proceeds and make monthly interest     
payments at a guaranteed annual rate of 3%.                                     

Under Payment Option 2, we will make monthly payments of a specified amount     
until the proceeds and interest are fully paid. At least 10% of the original    
proceeds must be paid each year. Guaranteed interest of 3% will be added to the 
proceeds each year.                                                             

Under Payment Option 3, we will make monthly payments for a specified number of 
years. The amount of the payments will include interest at 3% per year.         

Under Payment Option 4, we will make monthly payments for the longer of the life
of the payee or 10 years. The minimum amount of each payment will include       
interest at 3% per year.                                                        

Under Payment Option 5, we will make monthly payments until the amount paid     
equals the proceeds settled, and for the remaining life of the payee. The       
minimum amount of each payment will include interest at 3% per year.            

Under Payment Option 6, we will make monthly payments for 10 years and for the  
remaining life of the last surviving of two payees. The minimum amount of each  
payment will include interest at 3% per year.                                   

Payment option tables for Options 4, 5 and 6 are based on the Annuity 2000      
Mortality Tables (male and female) projected 20 years to the year 2020 by 100%  
of the male scale G Factors (for males) and 50% of the female scale G Factors   
(for females).                                                                  

Your policy lists the monthly payment for every $1,000 of proceeds that the     
payee applies under Options 3 to 6.                                             

Assigning the rights to your policy                                             

You may assign the rights under your Park Avenue VUL policy to another person or
business. This is often done, for example, to secure a loan. We will only be    
bound by such an agreement when we have received a copy of the assignment       
papers, signed by you, as well as the business or person to whom you are        
assigning your rights, and your policy's beneficiaries, if applicable.          
Assignments are subject to all payments made or actions we have taken on or     
before the date we receive the assignment papers. We are not responsible for    
determining whether the transfer of your policy's rights is legally valid.      

The entity or person to whom you assign your rights may exercise all rights     
granted under the policy except the right to:                                   

o     change the policyowner or beneficiary                                     

o     change a payment option, and                                              

o     direct where your net premiums will be invested or make transfers among   
the fixed-rate and variable investment options.                     

Modifying the policy                                                            

Only the President, a Vice President, or the Secretary of GIAC may make or      
modify this policy. No agent has the authority to:                              

o     change this policy

o     waive any provision of this policy or any of GIAC's requirements; or      

o     waive an answer to any question in the application(s).                    

GIAC will not be bound by any promise or statement made by any agent or other   
person except as stated above.                                                  

Other policies                                                                  

We offer other variable life insurance policies that have different death       
benefits, policy features, and optional programs. However, these other policies 
also have different charges that would affect the performance of the investment 
divisions of the Separate Account in which you invest, as well as your policy   
account value. To obtain more information about these other policies, contact   
our customer service office or your registered representative.                  

Distribution of the policy and other contractual arrangements                   

We have an agreement with Guardian Investor Services LLC (GIS) for GIS to act as
the principal underwriter of the VUL policies, as well as the other variable    
life insurance policies and variable annuity contracts that we offer. GIS is a  
broker-dealer registered under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and a   
member of the NASD. Under this agreement we paid through GIS for the sale of    
products issued by the Separate Account a total of $333,726 in 2000, $987,408 in
2001, and $________ in 2002. GIS did not retain any of such commissions. GIS is 
a Delaware corporation organized on December 19, 2001; it is a wholly-owned     
subsidiary of GIAC and is located at 7 Hanover Square, New York, New York 10004.

The offering of the policies is continuous, and we do not anticipate            
discontinuing offering the policies. However, we reserve the right to           
discontinue the offering at any time. We intend to recoup commissions and other 
sales expenses through fees and charges imposed under the policy. Commissions   
paid on the policy, including other incentives or payments, are not charged     
directly to the policyowners or the Separate Account.                           

Agents and commissions                                                          

GIAC agents who are licensed by state insurance authorities to sell variable    
life insurance policies must also be registered representatives of GIS, or of   
broker-dealer firms which have entered into agreements with GIAC and GIS to sell
Park Avenue VUL policies, which may include our affiliate Park Avenue Securities
LLC.                                                                            

The Prospectus contains information regarding the aggregate dollar amounts of   
commissions paid to GIAC agents. Information on how to obtain a Prospectus is   
available on the cover page of this SAI.                                        

Because registered representatives also are GIAC agents, they are eligible for  
additional compensation in the form of commission overrides, expense allowances,
bonuses, wholesaler fees and training allowances. In addition, agents may       
qualify for non-cash compensation such as expense-paid trips or educational     
seminars.                                                                       

If you return your policy under the right to cancel provisions, the agent may   
have to return some or all of any commissions we have paid.                     

Administrative services                                                         

Through an agreement with our parent company, Guardian Life, to carry out the   
administration of Park Avenue VUL policies, we are billed quarterly for the time
that their staff spends on GIAC business, and for the use of their centralized  
services and sales force.                                                       

Other agreements                                                                

We have entered into several other agreements, including:                       

o     an agreement with Value Line, Inc. under which we are compensated for     
      marketing the Value Line Centurion Fund and the Value Line Strategic Asset
Management Trust to our policyowners, and

o     agreements with MFS, AIM, Davis, Fidelity, Janus and Alliance under which 
   we are compensated for certain distribution and/or administrative costs
 and expenses connected to the offering and sale of their funds to our
   policyholders. The amount we receive is based on a percentage of assets
under management. We may receive 12 b-1 fees from the funds.        

Special provisions for group or sponsored arrangements                          

Where state insurance laws allow us to, we may sell Park Avenue VUL policies    
under a group or sponsored arrangement.                                         

A group arrangement is one in which a group of individuals is covered under a   
single policy. This might be arranged, for example, by an employer, a trade     
union, or a professional association.                                           

A sponsored arrangement is one in which we are allowed to offer members of a    
group, such as employees of a company or members of an association, insurance   
policies on an individual basis.                                                

We may reduce or eliminate certain deductions and charges outlined in this      
prospectus for policies bought under group or sponsored arrangements including  
policies issued in connection with certain business insurance arrangements. We  
may, for instance, sell policies without surrender charges and/or with reduced  
or eliminated fees and charges to employees, officers, directors and agents of  
Guardian Life and its subsidiaries and their immediate family members. We may   
reduce or waive policy charges and deductions in accordance with the rules in   
effect as of the date an application for a policy is approved. In addition, GIAC
may permit groups and persons purchasing under a sponsored arrangement to apply 
for simplified issue and multi-life underwriting. To qualify for a reduction in 
the policy's charges or deductions certain criteria must be met. These may      
include:                                                                        

o     the size of the group                                                     

o     the expected number of participants                                       

o     the expected amount of premium payments                                   

o     the expected number of policies to be issued                              

o     the amount of coverage                                                    

The amount of any reduction in charges or deductions and the criteria to qualify
for a reduction will reflect our reduced cost of selling and/or maintaining the 
policies in group or sponsored arrangements.                                    

From time to time we may change the amount of any reduction in charges or       
deductions, or the criteria that a group must meet to qualify for these         
reductions. Any change will be made on a non-discriminatory basis.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT CHARGES                                            

Premium Charge

EXAMPLE                                                                         

A 45 year-old male (Preferred Plus underwriting class) buys a policy with a face
amount of $250,000 on January 1, 2000. Five years later, on January 1, 2005, the
same male, now age 50 (Preferred Plus underwriting class), requests an increase 
in the face amount of $100,000. The initial target premium is $3,502.50, and the
target premium for the increase is $1,781, bringing the total target premium to 
$5,283.50. Assume he pays $4,000 per year for 10 years and $6,000 per year for  
the next 10 years. The premiums and premium charges are allocated as follows:   

Years 1-5:   All premiums are allocated to the initial face amount because that 
is the only coverage.                                 

Years 6-10:  Premiums up to the target for the initial face amount ($3,502.50)  
             are allocated to the initial face amount, and the excess ($4,000.00
           - $3,502.50 = ($497.50) is allocated to the face amount increase.

Years 11-20: Again, premiums up to the target for the initial face amount       
          ($3,502.50) are allocated to the initial face amount. The excess
      amount up to the target premium for the face amount increase
             ($1,781.00) is allocated to the face amount increase. The remaining
          premium ($6,000.00 - 3,502.50 - 1,781.00 = $716.50) is allocated
      proportionally based on the target premium for each segment:

        Initial face amount: $716.50 x (3,502.50 / 5,283.50) = $474.98

Face amount increase segment:                         
                                       $716.50 x (1,781.00 / 5,283.50) = $241.52

           Therefore, the total premium allocated to the initial face amount
           is $3,502.50 + 474.98 = $3,977.48, and the total allocated to the
         face amount increase segment is $1,781.00 + 241.52 = $2,022.52.

Surrender charges                                                               

EXAMPLE (Policy with initial face amount only)                            

  The example on the right shows how the surrender charge declines over a nine
year period so that in year 10 it equals $0.

Surrender Charge per $1000 of basic sum insured in policy year one (from  
Appendix E): $12.609                                                      

Surrender charge in policy year one is:                                   
The surrender charge per $1000 multiplied by $250,000 or                  
($12.609 x $250,000 divided by 1000) = $3125.25                           

Proportional reduction in surrender charge over 9 year period:            
$3152.25 divided by 9 or $350.25 per year.

Assume in the above example you effect a face amount increase of $200,000 at the
beginning of policy year 6 (attained age 55) and another face amount increase of
$100,000 at the beginning of policy year 11 (attained age 55). At the time of   
the first increase, the insured is again classified in the Preferred Plus       
underwriting class, but at the time of the second increase he is classified in  
the Standard underwriting class.                                                

For the purposes of calculating the applicable surrender charges, each face     
amount increase is treated separately based on the insured's attained age and   
underwriting class at the time of the increase. Therefore, for each increase the
policy will incur a new set of surrender charges. Surrender charges are         
calculated as if the policyowner has purchased a policy with the amount of the  
increase being the face amount; in other words, they are calculated just as in  
the first example. The total surrender charge for a particular policy year      
equals the sum of the surrender charge for the initial face amount and the      
applicable surrender charge for each policy segment.

The following is a calculation of the surrender charge for this example. Note   
that the surrender charges are shown for policy years 1 through 20 only as,     
after the 20th policy year, surrender charges equal zero for the initial face   
amount as well as for the two face amount increases.

Cost of insurance charge                                                        

Changes in the health of the insured will not cause your cost of insurance      
charge to increase. Increases in the cost of insurance rates are not made to an 
individual policy, but are made equally to all policies where the insured people
are of the same attained age, sex, policy or segment duration, and underwriting 
class. We may increase this charge when we expect:                              

o     a higher number of deaths among people in a certain group                 

o     higher expenses or federal income taxes                                   

o     a higher number of policies that are allowed to lapse by their            
policyowners                                                        

o     an increase in state or local premium taxes                               

o     lower earnings

Generally, reducing the net amount at risk results in lower charges for cost of 
insurance. Decreasing the net amount at risk partly depends on the death benefit
option you choose. If you choose Option 1, in which the death benefit is the    
face amount of your policy, you reduce the net amount at risk when you pay      
premiums. That's because premiums increase the policy account value. If you     
choose Option 2, in which the death benefit can increase to more than the face  
amount, paying premiums will not affect the net amount at risk.                 

If you choose Option 3, in which the death benefit is the face amount of your   
policy plus your net accumulated premiums, your net amount at risk could be     
lower if your investments perform well.                                         

The net amount at risk can increase, for example, when we increase a policy's   
death benefit to meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. See Death  
benefit options. Having a higher net amount at risk results in higher deductions
for cost of insurance.                                                          

There may be different cost of insurance rates for the initial face amount of   
your policy and for each subsequent increase in the face amount. As a result, we
calculate the net amount at risk separately for each segment of coverage.       

Your policy account value is allocated first to your policy's basic sum insured,
then to the additional sum insured, and finally to each of the policy segments  
in the order that they were added to the policy. The maximum amount of your     
policy account value that will be allocated to any one policy segment or to the 
initial face amount is the amount that the policy segment or initial face amount
provides as a death benefit, divided by 1.0032737. For the purposes of          
determining the net amount at risk, if the death benefit is increased due to the
operation of death benefit Option 2 or 3, the increase will be allocated to the 
basic sum insured. If the death benefit is further increased due to Section 7702
of the Internal Revenue Code the increase will be allocated to the most recent  
policy segment.

APPENDIX A

Investment performance of the Funds                                             

The table below shows the average annual total returns for the mutual funds for 
years ended December 31, 2002. The average annual total returns were provided by
the respective funds. We have not independently verified such performance data. 
The performance figures reflect the deduction of fund investment advisory fees  
and operating expenses, and assume that any dividends and capital gains are     
reinvested in the fund. These figures do not reflect how the funds' investment  
performance will affect the value of your policy, because they do not take into 
account the insurance and other charges we deduct from your policy. If these    
charges were taken into account, total returns for each fund would be lower.    
These charges are discussed in the Prospectus for the policy. For information   
about how to obtain a Prospectus, read the front cover page of this Statement of
Additional Information. Also, past returns should not be used to predict future 
performance. Total returns for The Guardian Cash Fund are not presented here.   

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total returns do not reflect deductions                                         

These total returns are for the funds only and do not reflect the effects of    
deductions from policy premiums, monthly deductions, transaction deductions or  
deductions from the Separate Account. Including the effects of these deductions 
reduces returns. See Special terms used in this prospectus and Deductions and   
charges for additional information.

USES OF LIFE INSURANCE

Because the policy provides a death benefit and cash surrender value, the policy
can be used for various individual and business planning purposes. Purchasing   
the policy in part for such purposes entails certain risks, particularly if the 
policy's cash surrender value, as opposed to its death benefit, will be the     
principal policy feature used for such planning purposes. If Policy Premiums are
not paid, the investment performance of the Variable Investment Options to which
Policy Account Value is allocated is poorer than anticipated, or insufficient   
cash surrender value is maintained, then the policy may lapse or may not        
accumulate sufficient values to fund the purpose for which the policy was       
purchased. Because the policy is designed to provide benefits on a long-term    
basis, before purchasing a policy for a specialized purpose, a purchaser should 
consider whether the long-term nature of the policy is consistent with the      
purpose for which it is being considered.                                       

Policyowners are urged to consult competent tax advisors about the possible tax 
consequences of pre-death distributions from any life insurance policy,         
including Park Avenue Life.                                                     

The following are examples of ways in which the policy can be used to address   
certain financial objectives, bearing in mind that variable life insurance is   
not a short-term investment and that its primary purpose is to provide benefits 
upon the death of the insured.                                                  

Family Income Protection                                                        

Life insurance may be purchased on the lives of a family's income earners to    
provide a death benefit to cover final expenses, and continue the current income
to the family. The amount of insurance purchase should be an amount which will  
provide a death benefit that when invested outside the policy at a reasonable   
interest rate, will generate enough money to replace the insured's income.      

Estate Protection                                                               

Life insurance may be purchased by a trust on the life of a person whose estate 
will incur federal estate taxes upon his or her death. The amount of insurance  
purchased should equal the amount of the estimated estate tax liability. Upon   
the insured's death, the trustee could make the death proceeds available to the 
estate for the payment of estate taxes.                                         

Education Funding                                                               

Life insurance may be purchased on the life of the parent(s) or primary person  
funding an education. The amount of insurance purchased should equal the total  
education cost projected at a reasonable inflation rate.                        

In the event of the insured's death, the guaranteed death benefit is available  
to help pay the education costs. If the insured lives through the education     
years, the cash value accumulations may be accessed to help offset the remaining
education costs. Any policy loans or partial withdrawals will reduce the        
policy's death benefit and may have tax consequences.                           

Mortgage Protection                                                             

Life insurance may be purchased on the life of the person(s) responsible for    
making mortgage payments. The amount of insurance purchased should equal the    
mortgage amount. In the event of the insured's death, the guaranteed death      
benefit can be used to offset the remaining mortgage balance.                   

During the insured's lifetime, the cash value accumulations may be accessed late
in the mortgage term to help make the remaining mortgage payments. Any policy   
loans or partial withdrawals will reduce the policy's death benefit and may have
tax consequences.                                                               

Key Person Protection                                                           

Life insurance may be purchased by a business on the life of a key person in an 
amount equal to a key person's value, considering salary, benefits, and         
contribution to business profits. Upon the key person's death, the business can 
use the death benefit to ease the interruption of business operations and/or to 
provide a replacement fund for hiring a new executive.                          

                                                                          ------

The Guardian Insurance & Annuity Company, Inc.                                  

APPENDIX B                                                                      
USES OF LIFE INSURANCE                                                          

Business Continuation Protection                                                

Life insurance may be purchased on the life of each business owner in an amount 
equal to the value of each owner's business interest. In the event of death, the
guaranteed death benefit may provide the funds needed to carry out the purchase 
of the deceased's business interest by the business, or surviving owners, from  
the deceased owner's heirs.                                                     

Retirement Income                                                               

Life insurance may be purchased on the life of a family income earner during his
or her working life. If the insured lives to retirement, the cash value         
accumulations may be accessed to provide retirement payments. In the event of   
the insured's death, the proceeds may be used to provide retirement income to   
his or her spouse. Any policy loans or partial withdrawals will reduce the      
policy's death benefit and may have tax consequences.                           

Deferred Compensation Plans                                                     

Life insurance may be purchased to fund a Deferred Compensation Plan, or        
Selective Incentive Plan, for key employees. A Deferred Compensation Plan, or   
Selective Incentive Plan, is a written agreement between an employer and an     
executive. The employer makes an unsecured promise to make future benefit       
payments to a key executive if the executive meets certain stated requirements. 

Under this type of plan, a company purchases a cash value life insurance policy 
insuring an executive's life to (1) informally fund the promised benefits and   
(2) recover its plan costs at the death of the executive. The policy cash values
may be used to help pay the promised benefits to the executive. In the event    
that the executive dies prior to retirement, the policy death benefits can be   
used to fund survivor benefits.                                                 

Split Dollar Plans                                                              

Life insurance may be purchased by an employer on the life of an employee under 
a Split Dollar Plan. In a Split Dollar Plan, the employer advances the executive
the premium on a life insurance policy. Both the employer and the executive     
share the cash value and death benefit under the policy. Generally, the employer
has rights to the cash value and death benefit equal to its advances. The       
balance of the cash value and death benefit belong to the executive.            

The executive receives an economic benefit for which he or she must contribute  
into the plan or pay income tax. The economic benefit is equal to the term value
of the death benefit assuming taxation under IRS Revenue Rulings and IRC Section
72. Different results are possible if these or other code sections are applied  
or amended.                                                                     

Executive Bonus Plans                                                           

Life Insurance may be purchased by an employee with funds provided by his or her
employer for that purpose. An Executive Bonus plan involves an employer         
providing an executive with additional compensation to enable the executive to  
pay premiums on a life insurance policy. The bonus is tax deductible by the     
employer and received as taxable income by the executive.

Item 30.          Indemnification                                               

      The By-Laws of The Guardian Insurance & Annuity Company, Inc. provide that
the Company shall, to the fullest extent legally permissible under the General  
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, indemnify and hold harmless officers  
and directors of the Corporation for certain liabilities reasonably incurred in 
connection with such person's capacity as an officer or director.               

The Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation includes the following      
provision:                                                                      

No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the    
Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary    
duty as a director except for liability (i) for any breach of the director's    
duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders; (ii) for acts or        
omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing
violation of the law; (iii) under Section 164 of the Delaware General           
Corporation Law, or (iv) for any transaction for which the director derived an  
improper personal benefit.                                                      

     Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities Act
of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the  
registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant   
has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission  
such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is,   
therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against 
such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred 
or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the   
successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such       
director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being 
registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel, the      
matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of          
appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is     
against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final 
adjudication of such issue.                                                     

Item 31.          Principal Underwriters                                        

               (a) Guardian Investor Services LLC ("GIS") is the principal

                    These returns also reflect deductions for the following charges, which have been calculated using SEC mandated computation methods:

                    a) the investment division charges consist of fund-level expenses, which are similar to the charges on traditional mutual funds.

                    b) the separate account level charges are the annual mortality and expense risk charge (M&E charge) of 1.45% and administrative expenses of .20%.

                    c) a $35.00 contract administrative fee based on an average contract size (which is waived for contracts with an accumulation value over $100,000).

                    d) any contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) that would apply upon the surrender of a contract at the end of the stated period. CDSCs may apply to premium payments deposited into the contract within seven years of the withdrawal, according to the following schedule: 8%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4% and 3% from the date of the premium payment, respectively.
                

                    † The performance information for some funds in this section may reflect a very short period of time and should not be the sole indicator to determine investment option selection. In order to assist you in determining which investment options may be suitable for your individual investment objectives and risk tolerance, we have included the average annual returns for the life of each investment option in the non-standardized section.
                

                    Please note that performance figures for contract owners who elect an enhanced death benefit or other optional rider would be lower to reflect each rider’s applicable annual charges (for the Highest Anniversary Value Death Benefit Rider, 0.25% of variable investment option assets; for the Earnings Benefit Rider, 0.25% of variable investment option assets; for the Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit Rider (GLWB) single life options a current charge of 0.65% to 1.20% (1.00% to 2.50% maximum) of the adjusted guaranteed withdrawal balance at the time the change is deducted and, for the GLWB Rider with spousal options, a current charge of 0.85% to 1.60% (2.00% - 3.50% maximum) of the adjusted guaranteed withdrawal balance at the time the charge is deducted. The optional death benefit feature
					of the GLWB Rider will increase the rider percentage fee by 0.50% annually.
                


                        The following funds have asset-based distribution fees (12b-1 fees) that were imposed on the dates noted. Returns for these funds prior to the dates on which these fees were imposed do not include the effects of the 12b-1 fees and returns listed would have been lower for these funds if these fees had been in place and reflected in the performance.

                    Certain portfolios may have similar investment objectives and policies and, in some cases, similar names to retail mutual funds managed by the same manager. The portfolios named are not the same funds as the retail funds. As a result, specific investments may be different and investment results may be higher or lower. While all funds involve some risk, including possible loss of principal amount invested, there are some additional risks to consider when investing in certain types of funds or certain types of asset classes that comprise a fund’s portfolio. For further information on risks associated with the various funds see the fund prospectuses.
                

[A] Foreign Securities and Emerging Markets Risk. Investing in International funds or funds that invest any of their assets in foreign securities has special risks relating to changes in currency rates, foreign taxation, differences in auditing and other financial standards, political uncertainty and greater volatility. These risks are even greater when investing in emerging markets.
                

[B] Small Cap and Mid Cap Companies Risk. Risks associated with investments in small and mid cap companies include less publicly available information, higher volatility, and less liquidity than investments in larger companies.
                

[C] Concentration Risk Investments concentrated in specific industries, market segments, regions or securities may be subject to increased share price volatility.
                

[D] Debt Securities Risk. Investing in Bond funds or funds that invest any of their assets in debt securities exposes the contractowner to the general risks of investing in debt markets, such as interest rate, credit, and prepayment risk. Generally, when interest rates rise, bond prices fall, and when interest rates fall, bond prices rise. Therefore, an increase in interest rates would decrease the value of a bond fund’s holdings. The ability of an issuer of a debt security to repay principal prior to a security’s maturity can cause greater price volatility if interest rates change. Duration is a measure of bond price sensitivity to a given change in interest rates. Generally, the longer a bond’s duration, the greater is its price sensitivity to a change in interest rates.
					However, low duration bond funds are not an alternative to money market funds. Low duration bond funds, unlike money market funds, do not seek to maintain a stable net asset value and as a result are a riskier asset class.
                

[E] High Yield Debt Securities Risk. Investments in high yield bonds or lower rated and unrated debt securities are subject to greater credit risk and price fluctuation than investments in higher-rated securities.
                

[F] Derivatives Risk. Since the value of a derivative instrument derives from an underlying asset, the use of derivatives involves risks different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in the underlying assets. Derivatives can be highly volatile, illiquid, and difficult to value.
