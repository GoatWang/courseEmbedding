CART has announced that James Grosfeld has been named to its board of directors.The announcement was made by CART chairman and CEO Joe Heitzler. Grosfeld becomes the 12th member of the CART board and his appointment is effective immediately.Grosfeld has spent the majority of his time in recent years on personal investing activities. He served in various capacities with Pulte Homes Inc. for more than 18 years, including chief executive officer from 1974 to 1990. He remained active with the company as a member of its board until 1997, when he retired. Grosfeld graduated from Amherst College in 1959 and Columbia Law School in 1962.  After working in the New York City law firm of Kelly, Drye, Newhall, Maginnes & Warren, from 1962-65, Grosfeld became House Counsel at Goodbody & Company, a national investment banking and brokerage firm."I believe CART and its racing are terrific products," said Grosfeld.  "The challenge for us is to realize the full potential of CART and open-wheel racing.  I believe my background and experience can help move the company in a direction that will be advantageous to all the entities involved with CART."Grosfeld has served on a variety of corporate boards and is currently a member of the board of directors for publicly owned Copart Inc., which provides vehicle suppliers, primarily insurance companies, with a full range of services to process and sell salvage vehicles through auctions.  He also serves on the board of Blackrock Inc., a financial services firm managing more than $200 billion on behalf of institutional clients and retail investors, whose controlling shareholder is PNC Financial Services Group.According to a Sept. 28, 2001 Securities and Exchange Commission 13G filing, Grosfeld is one of CART's largest shareholders, holding approximately 9.99 percent of the company's outstanding shares.  Grosfeld joins Eugene Atkinson, Gerald Forsythe, Chip Ganassi, Barry Green, Carl Haas, James Hardymon, Joseph Heitzler, James Henderson, Pat Patrick, Fred Tucker and Derrick Walker on CART's board of directors.
