Atlas Travel® Insurance 
Get Quote Apply Online








For international travel, Atlas Travel® Insurance provides customizable coverage for travelers looking to cover specific needs while abroad.
International travel can represent financial risk. The benefits of many standard medical insurance policies do not apply beyond the borders of your home country. An Atlas Travel® Insurance
                                        plan can be the difference between a trip ruined by unexpected illness or injury, versus a trip with access to quality care and financial help if the unexpected strikes.
HCC has developed two Atlas Travel® plans that offer a complete package of international benefits available 24 hours a day. Atlas America® provides coverage for non-U.S. citizens traveling outside their home country while Atlas International provides coverage for US citizens traveling outside their home country.
Important things you should know about Atlas Visitors Insurance
There are many different types of insurance policies that are around today, but one of the best ones you can try out is the Atlas America Visitor Insurance policy. The medical insurance policy is available to visitors in the United States, as well as all foreign tourists who are traveling to the United States for business or for leisure. There is massive demand for this travel insurance package, because it is available for new immigrants in the United States, as well as international students, and overseas travelers as well.

Pre-existing conditions — charges resulting directly or indirectly from any pre-existing condition, as herein defined, are excluded from this insurance unless it is a sudden and unexpected outbreak or recurrence that is of short duration and requires urgent care. Under Atlas Travel®, no coverage is available for known, scheduled, required, or expected medical care, drugs, or treatments existent or necessary prior to the effective date of coverage.
Routine medical examinations
Routine pre-natal care, pregnancy, child birth, and post-natal care

Does Atlas Travel® provide any coverage while I am in my home country?
Atlas Travel® does offer medical expense coverage in your home country in the following situations:

                                                Benefit Period –Atlas Travel® will cover eligible medical expenses in the member’s home country for 90 days after the beginning of treatment so long as the related illness or injury began while the certificate was still in effect and treatment began while the member was outside their home country.

                                                Incidental Home Country Coverage – For U.S. citizens, medical expenses are only covered during incidental trips home totaling no more than 15 days per three-month period of coverage. Incidental visit time must be used within the three-month period earned, and the member must continue his or her international trip in order to be eligible for this benefit. Medical expenses for non-U.S. citizens will be covered up to a maximum of 30 days for any three-month period. Medical expenses incurred in your home country will not be covered if your purpose for returning to your home country is to obtain treatment of an illness or injury that began while traveling. 
Will Atlas Travel® cover me on trips of a year or longer?

For international travel, Atlas Travel® Insurance provides customizable coverage for travelers looking to cover specific needs while abroad.
International travel can represent financial risk. The benefits of many standard medical insurance policies do not apply beyond the borders of your home country. An Atlas Travel® Insurance
                                        plan can be the difference between a trip ruined by unexpected illness or injury, versus a trip with access to quality care and financial help if the unexpected strikes.
HCC has developed two Atlas Travel® plans that offer a complete package of international benefits available 24 hours a day. Atlas America® provides coverage for non-U.S. citizens traveling outside their home country while Atlas International provides coverage for US citizens traveling outside their home country.
Important things you should know about Atlas Visitors Insurance

Pre-existing conditions — charges resulting directly or indirectly from any pre-existing condition, as herein defined, are excluded from this insurance unless it is a sudden and unexpected outbreak or recurrence that is of short duration and requires urgent care. Under Atlas Travel®, no coverage is available for known, scheduled, required, or expected medical care, drugs, or treatments existent or necessary prior to the effective date of coverage.
Routine medical examinations
Routine pre-natal care, pregnancy, child birth, and post-natal care

Does Atlas Travel® provide any coverage while I am in my home country?
Atlas Travel® does offer medical expense coverage in your home country in the following situations:

                                                Benefit Period –Atlas Travel® will cover eligible medical expenses in the member’s home country for 90 days after the beginning of treatment so long as the related illness or injury began while the certificate was still in effect and treatment began while the member was outside their home country.

                                                Incidental Home Country Coverage – For U.S. citizens, medical expenses are only covered during incidental trips home totaling no more than 15 days per three-month period of coverage. Incidental visit time must be used within the three-month period earned, and the member must continue his or her international trip in order to be eligible for this benefit. Medical expenses for non-U.S. citizens will be covered up to a maximum of 30 days for any three-month period. Medical expenses incurred in your home country will not be covered if your purpose for returning to your home country is to obtain treatment of an illness or injury that began while traveling. 
Will Atlas Travel® cover me on trips of a year or longer?
For non-U.S. citizens or residents whose travel does not include the U.S. or U.S. territories, the maximum coverage duration is 365 days. Additionally, coverage may be renewed up to 2 additional coverage periods. Coverage renewal requires satisfaction of a new deductible and coinsurance. Renewals may be filed through the Client Zone.
                                                For all other travelers, the maximum duration is 364 days, and coverage is not renewable. 
How do I cancel my Atlas Travel® coverage?
You may submit a written cancellation request to HCCMIS prior to the effective date of coverage for a full refund. If HCCMIS receives the cancellation request following the effective date of coverage, only the unused portion of premium will be refunded. A $25 cancellation fee will apply.
Will Atlas Travel® cover multiple trips?

Finally taking that trip you’ve always dreamed of to the United States? Whether you’re planning to travel solo or with your family for work, school, or pleasure, you’re probably equal parts excited and stressed.
For international visitors unfamiliar with the U.S. healthcare system, questions of health and safety can be a major source of travel anxiety. Would you be able to seek treatment if you suffered an injury or unexpected illness while exploring the country? Would your medical expenses be covered by your home country health insurance policy?
If the answer to either of these questions is no, then it’s time to explore your travel medical insurance options.
What is Atlas America insurance?
Atlas America is a travel medical insurance policy for non-U.S. citizens and residents visiting the United States. Available to individuals, families, and groups, Atlas America insurance can cover individuals from most countries who are at least 14 days old and traveling to the U.S. from abroad.
Policies must cover a minimum of 5 days, though you do not have to travel all 5 days to be eligible for coverage. Coverage is available up to 364 days.

Why do I need insurance for my trip to the U.S.?
Your home country health insurance policy may not cover you across international lines – or it may provide very limited international coverage. And in the United States, people are responsible for their own healthcare costs, meaning you’ll be financially responsible for any medical expenses stemming from an unexpected illness or injury.
According to healthcare.gov, a broken leg can cost up to $7,500 to fix in the United States, and the average cost of a 3-day hospital stay is around $30,000.
Travel medical insurance, as noted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), can reduce “the cost of a medical emergency" and the resulting “financial burden on travelers" by providing access to quality care and financial help if the unexpected occurs as you travel throughout the United States.
It can also serve as evidence that you’ll be able to pay for medical expenses incurred during your time in the U.S., which may be required if you need a visa to enter the country.


What benefits does Atlas America provide?
Atlas America insurance provides benefits for eligible medical expenses incurred in the U.S., including Hospital Room and Board, Local Ambulance, Emergency Medical Evacuation, Intensive Care Unit, and all other eligible costs.
It also provides supplemental travel benefits like Trip Interruption, Travel Delay, and Lost Checked Luggage.
Key features of Atlas America insurance include:

Up to $2,000,000 in maximum coverage per covered injury or illness and per certificate period
Your choice of deductible ranging from $0 to $2,500 per certificate period
Coinsurance at 80% of the next $5,000 of eligible expenses after the deductible, then 100% to the maximum coverage limit. Within the Preferred Provider Network (PPO), coinsurance is waived and eligible expenses are paid at 100% after the deductible, up to the overall maximum.
Provider network with over 5,000 hospitals and more than 90,000 healthcare facilities throughout the U.S.
Free travel assistance services available in multiple languages 365 days a year

Other Atlas America highlights:

Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D)
Repatriation of Remains
Political Evacuation
Terrorism
Natural Disaster
Personal Liability

To see the full list of Atlas America insurance benefits and exclusions, see the Description of Coverage. 

Why choose Atlas America insurance?

Plus, if you need to extend your coverage after you purchase your policy, you can extend (5-day minimum) up to a maximum of 364 days from your initial coverage start date. Provided there is no break in coverage, you will not be required to re-satisfy your deductible or coinsurance and your benefit limits will not reset.

Does Atlas America meet visa requirements?
As a USA visitor, you may need a visa in order to gain entry to the United States. Whether or not you’ll need a visa is determined by your country of citizenship. The type of visa you'll need is dependent on the purpose of your travel.
Here are just a few common USA visitor visa types:

Visitor Visa: For people coming to the U.S. for a short period of time – typically 6 months or less – to visit children or relatives, tour, or vacation
Temporary Worker Visa: For individuals coming to the U.S. for a fixed period of time to receive job training or perform short-term or seasonal work
J-1 Visa: For USA visitors enrolling in work-and-study-based exchange programs in order to teach, study, conduct research, or receive on-site job training in the U.S.

In order to be approved for your visa, you’ll need to fulfill visa requirements. While your visa may not require you to have travel medical insurance, it may require you to show proof of funds to cover expenses incurred in the United States.
One way to evidence these funds is to purchase a travel medical policy like Atlas America, which provides policyholders with a visa letter to serve as proof of medical coverage.
Atlas America also meets the minimum insurance requirements of a J-1 visa as established by the U.S. Department of State.

Why do I need travel medical insurance?

Atlas Travel does offer medical expense coverage in your home country in the following situations:
Benefit Period
Atlas Travel will cover eligible medical expenses in the member’s home country for 90 days after the beginning of treatment so long as the related illness or injury began while the certificate was still in effect and treatment began while the member was outside their home country.
Incidental Home Country Coverage
For individuals with the U.S. as home country, for every three month period during which the Member is covered hereunder, medical expenses incurred in the U.S. are covered up to a maximum of 15 days.
For individuals with a home country other than the U.S., for every three month period during which the Member is covered hereunder, medical expenses incurred in the member’s home country are covered up to a maximum of 30 days. Any benefit accrued under a sin­gle 3 month period does not accumulate to another period. Failure of the member to continue his or her international trip or the members return to their home country for the sole purpose of obtaining treatment for an illness or injury that began while traveling shall void any home country coverage provided under the terms of this agreement.

Why do I need travel medical insurance?
International travel can represent financial risk. The benefits of many standard medical insurance policies do not apply beyond the borders of your home country. An Atlas Travel medical insurance plan can be the difference between a trip ruined by unexpected illness or injury, versus a trip with access to quality care and financial help if the unexpected strikes.

Atlas Travel does offer medical expense coverage in your home country in the following situations:
Benefit Period
Atlas Travel will cover eligible medical expenses in the member’s home country for 90 days after the beginning of treatment so long as the related illness or injury began while the certificate was still in effect and treatment began while the member was outside their home country.
Incidental Home Country Coverage
For individuals with the U.S. as home country, for every three month period during which the Member is covered hereunder, medical expenses incurred in the U.S. are covered up to a maximum of 15 days.
For individuals with a home country other than the U.S., for every three month period during which the Member is covered hereunder, medical expenses incurred in the member’s home country are covered up to a maximum of 30 days. Any benefit accrued under a sin­gle 3 month period does not accumulate to another period. Failure of the member to continue his or her international trip or the members return to their home country for the sole purpose of obtaining treatment for an illness or injury that began while traveling shall void any home country coverage provided under the terms of this agreement.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED)  Forward-Looking Statements  When used in this Form 10-Q, the words "believes", "anticipates," "expects" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from the results stated or implied in this document. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to forward-looking statements which we may make to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-Q or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.  General  Atlas America Series 27-2006 L.P. ("we", "us" or the "Partnership") is a Delaware limited partnership, formed on July 21, 2006 with Atlas Resources, LLC serving as its Managing General Partner and Operator ("Atlas Resources" or "MGP"). Atlas Resources is an indirect subsidiary of Atlas Resource Partners, L.P. ("ARP") 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    ARP, -1.08%
 We have drilled and currently operate wells located in New York, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. We have no employees and rely on our MGP for management, which in turn, relies on its parent company, Atlas Energy L.P. ("Atlas Energy"), for administrative services.  We do not plan to sell any of our wells and intend to produce them until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce, at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold. We expect that no other wells will be drilled and no additional funds will be required for drilling.  Overview  The following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Our operating cash flows are generated from our wells, which produce primarily natural gas, but also some oil. Our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated and or third-party gas gathering systems. Our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production. We pay our MGP, as operator, a monthly well supervision fee, which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as:  · well tending, routine maintenance and adjustment;  · reading meters, recording production, pumping, maintaining appropriate books and records; and  · preparation of reports for us and government agencies.  The well supervision fees, however, do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment, materials, and brine disposal. If these expenses are incurred, we pay cost for third-party services, materials, and a competitive charge for services performed directly by our MGP or its affiliates. Also, beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production, our MGP, as operator, may retain $200 per month, per well to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well. As of September 30, 2013, our MGP had not withheld any funds for this purpose.  Markets and Competition  The availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us, and the price obtained, depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production, imports of foreign natural gas and oil, political instability or terrorist acts in oil and gas producing countries and regions, market demand, competition from other energy sources, the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce, other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity, availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities. Our MGP is responsible for selling our production. During 2013 and 2012, we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil. Product availability and price are the principal means of competition in selling natural gas and oil production. While it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry, we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry.  Results of Operations The following table sets forth information relating to our production revenues, volumes, sales prices, production costs and depletion during the periods indicated: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2013 2012 2013 2012 Production revenues (in thousands): Gas $ 529 $ 460 $ 1,639 $ 1,273 Oil 20 23 55 82 Total $ 549 $ 483 $ 1,694 $ 1,355 Production volumes: Gas (mcf/day) (1) 1,493 1,657 1,504 1,610 Oil (bbls/day) (1) 2 3 2 4 Total (mcfe/day) (1) 1,505 1,675 1,516 1,634 Average sales prices (2) Gas (per mcf) (1) (2) $ 4.04 $ 3.38 $ 4.21 $ 3.28 Oil (per bbl) (1) (4) $ 91.66 $ 91.67 $ 89.63 $ 83.64 Production costs: As a percent of revenues 61 % 69 % 58 % 74 % Per mcfe (1) $ 2.42 $ 2.17 $ 2.39 $ 2.25 Depletion per mcfe $ 2.28 $ 1.31 $ 2.28 $ 1.31  (1) "Mcf" represents thousand cubic feet, "mcfe" represents thousand cubic feet equivalent, and "bbl" represents barrels. Bbl is converted to mcfe using the ratio of six mcf to one bbl.  Natural Gas Revenues. Our natural gas revenues were $528,400 and $460,100 for the three months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, an increase of $68,300 (15%). The $68,300 increase in natural gas revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $113,800 increase in our natural gas sales prices after the effect of financial hedges, which was driven by market conditions, partially offset by a $45,500 decrease in production volumes. Our production volumes decreased to 1,493 mcf per day for the three months ended September 30, 2013 from 1,657 mcf per day for the three months ended September 30, 2012, a decrease of 164 mcf per day (10%). The overall decrease in natural gas production volumes for the three months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to the prior year similar period resulted primarily from the normal decline inherent in the life of a well, and a decrease in the number of producing wells.  Our natural gas revenues were $1,638,600 and $1,273,100 for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, an increase of $365,500 (29%). The $365,500 increase in natural gas revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $453,800 increase in our natural gas sales prices after the effect of financial hedges, partially offset by a $88,300 decrease in production volumes. Our production volumes decreased to 1,504 mcf per day for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 from 1,610 mcf per day for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, a decrease of 106 mcf per day (7%). The overall decrease in natural gas production volumes for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to the prior year similar period resulted primarily from the normal decline inherent in the life of a well, and a decrease in the number of producing wells.  Oil Revenues. We drill wells primarily to produce natural gas, rather than oil, but some wells have limited oil production. Our oil revenues were $20,200 and $23,100 for the three months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, a decrease of $2,900 (13%). The $2,900 decrease in oil revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $3,000 decrease in production volumes, partially offset by a $100 increase in our natural gas sales prices after the effect of financial hedges. Our production volumes decreased to 2.39 bbls per day for the three months ended September 30, 2013 from 2.75 bbls per day for the three months ended September 30, 2012, a decrease of .36 bbl per day (13%).  Our oil revenues were $55,200 and $82,100 for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, a decrease of $26,900 (33%). The $26,900 decrease in oil revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $30,600 decrease in production volumes, partially offset by a $3,700 increase in oil prices after the effect of financial hedges. Our production volumes decreased to 2.26 bbls per day for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 from 3.59 bbls per day for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, a decrease of 1.33 bbl per day (37%).  Costs and Expenses. Production expenses were $335,300 and $333,400 for the three months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, an increase of $1,900 (1%). Production expenses were $990,400 and $1,005,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, a decrease of $14,600 (1%). The increases for the three months ended September 30, 2013 was mostly due to an increase in repairs and maintenance. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 was mostly due to a decrease in supervision fees.  Depletion of oil and gas properties as a percentage of oil and gas revenues was 58% and 42% for the three months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and 56% and 43% for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These percentage changes are directly attributable to changes in revenues, oil and gas reserve quantities, product prices and production volumes and changes in the depletable cost basis of oil and gas properties.  General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012 were $53,500 and $55,600, respectively, a decrease of $2,100 (4%). For the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012 these expenses were $157,000 and $163,100, respectively, a decrease of $6,100 (4%). These expenses include third-party costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our MGP. The decreases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 are primarily due to third-party costs as compared to the prior year similar period.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Cash provided by operating activities increased $142,700 in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 to $695,600 as compared to $552,900 for the nine months ended September 30, 2012. This increase was due to an increase in net income before depletion and accretion and a non-cash loss on derivative value of $276,900. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in the change in accounts receivable trade-affiliate of $105,600 and a decrease in the change in accrued liabilities of $28,600, for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2012.  Cash used in financing activities increased $73,300 during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 to $724,500 from $651,200 for the nine months ended September 30, 2012. This increase was due to an increase in cash distributions to partners.  Our MGP may withhold funds for future plugging and abandonment costs. Any additional funds, if required, will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from our MGP or its affiliates, which are not contractually committed to make loans to us. The amount that we may borrow may not at any time exceed 5% of our total subscriptions and we will not borrow from third-parties.  The Partnership is generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flows from our operations, which we believe is adequate to fund future operations and distributions to our partners. Historically, there has been no need to borrow funds from our MGP to fund operations.  Critical Accounting Policies  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the U.S. GAAP. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to our asset retirement obligations, depletion and certain accrued receivables and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of significant accounting policies we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our financial statements is included within "Notes to Financial Statements" in Part I, Item 1, "Financial Statements" in this quarterly report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED)  Forward-Looking Statements  When used in this Form 10-Q, the words "believes", "anticipates," "expects" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results stated or implied in this document. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to forward-looking statements which we may make to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-Q or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.  General  Atlas America Series 27-2006 L.P. ("we", "us", or the "Partnership") is a Delaware limited partnership, formed on July 21, 2006 with Atlas Resources, LLC serving as its Managing General Partner and Operator ("Atlas Resources" or the "MGP"). Atlas Resources is an indirect subsidiary of Atlas Resource Partners, L.P. ("ARP") 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    ARP, -1.08%
 On February 27, 2015, the MGP's ultimate parent, Atlas Energy, L.P. ("Atlas Energy"), which was a publicly traded master-limited partnership, was acquired by Targa Resources Corp. and distributed to Atlas Energy's unitholders 100% of the limited liability company interests in ARP's general partner, Atlas Energy Group, LLC ("Atlas Energy Group"; NYSE: ATLS). Atlas Energy Group became a separate, publicly traded company and the ultimate parent of the MGP as a result of the distribution. Following the distribution, Atlas Energy Group continues to manage ARP's operations and activities through its ownership of ARP's general partner interest.  We have drilled and currently operate wells located in New York, Pennsylvania and Tennessee. We have no employees and rely on our MGP for management, which in turn, relies on its parent company, Atlas Energy Group (February 27, 2015 and prior, Atlas Energy), for administrative services.  We intend to continue to produce our wells until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce, at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold. We expect that no other wells will be drilled and no additional funds will be required for drilling.  Overview  The following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Our operating cash flows are generated from our wells, which produce primarily natural gas, but also some oil. Our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated and/or third-party gas gathering systems. Our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production. We pay our MGP, as operator, a monthly well supervision fee, which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as:  � well tending, routine maintenance and adjustment;  � reading meters, recording production, pumping, maintaining appropriate books and records; and  � preparation of reports for us and government agencies.  The well supervision fees, however, do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment, materials and brine disposal. If these expenses are incurred, we pay cost for third-party services, materials and a competitive charge for services performed directly by our MGP or its affiliates. Also, beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production, our MGP, as operator, may retain $200 per month per well to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well. As of September 30, 2015, our MGP has withheld $45,500 of net production revenues for this purpose.  Markets and Competition  The availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us, and the price obtained, depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production, imports of foreign natural gas and oil, political instability or terrorist acts in gas and oil producing countries and regions, market demand, competition from other energy sources, the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce, other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity, availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities. Our MGP is responsible for selling our production. During 2014 and the first nine months of 2015, we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil. Product availability and price are the principal means of competing in selling natural gas and oil production. While it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry, we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry.  Results of Operations The following table sets forth information relating to our production revenues, volumes, sales prices, production costs and depletion during the periods indicated: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2015 2014 2015 2014 Production revenues (in thousands): Gas $ 148 $ 341 $ 607 $ 1,477 Oil 7 22 26 67 Total $ 155 $ 363 $ 633 $ 1,544 Production volumes: Gas (Mcf/day) (1) 1,022 1,400 1,114 1,317 Oil (bbl/day) (1) 2 3 2 3 Total (Mcfe/day) (1) 1,034 1,418 1,126 1,335 Average sales prices(2): Gas (per Mcf) (1) (3) (4) $ 1.57 $ 2.90 $ 2.00 $ 4.15 Oil (per bbl) (1) $ 45.37 $ 88.94 $ 48.60 $ 92.22 Production costs: As a percent of revenues (4) 144 % 77 % 121 % 61 % Per Mcfe (1) $ 2.34 $ 2.31 $ 2.50 $ 2.59 Depletion per Mcfe $ 0.41 $ 0.66 $ 0.40 $ 0.66  (1) "Mcf" represents thousand cubic feet, "Mcfe" represents thousand cubic feet equivalent, and "bbl" represents barrels. Bbl is converted to Mcfe using the ratio of six Mcfs to one bbl.  (2) Average sales prices represent accrual basis pricing after adjusting for the effect of previously recognized gains resulting from prior period impairment charges.  (3) Average gas prices are calculated by including in total revenue derivative gains previously recognized into income in connection with prior period impairment charges and dividing by the total volume for the period. Previously recognized derivative gains were $5,700 and $15,100 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, respectively.  (4) The average sales price and production costs as a percentage of revenues for natural gas for the three months ended September 30, 2014 has been adjusted to reflect $26,800 of additional revenue.  Natural Gas Revenues. During the quarter ended September 30, 2014, management identified an error in the process used to estimate our unbilled revenue. As a result, natural gas revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2014 includes an adjustment to reduce natural gas revenue by $26,800. The adjustment is the result of overstating our unbilled revenues as of June 30, 2014. Refer to the Partnership's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2014 for further explanation of this error. Our unadjusted natural gas revenues were $148,100 and $367,900 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $219,800 (60%). The $219,800 decrease in natural gas revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $120,500 decrease in our natural gas sales prices after the effect of financial hedges, which were driven by market conditions, and a $99,300 decrease in production volumes. Our production volumes decreased to 1,022 Mcf per day for the three months ended September 30, 2015 from 1,400 Mcf per day for the three months ended September 30, 2014, a decrease of 378 Mcf per day (27%). The overall decrease in natural gas production volumes for the three months ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the prior year similar period resulted primarily from a decrease in the number of producing wells due to wells shut-in as a result of a decline in natural gas prices.  Our natural gas revenues were $607,200 and $1,476,900 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $869,700 (59%). The $869,700 decrease in natural gas revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $642,100 decrease in our natural gas sales prices after the effect of financial hedges, which were driven by market conditions, and a $227,600 decrease in production volumes. Our production volumes decreased to 1,114 Mcf per day for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 from 1,317 Mcf per day for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, a decrease of 203 Mcf per day (15%). The overall decrease in natural gas production volumes for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the prior year similar period resulted primarily from a decrease in the number of producing wells due to wells shut-in as a result of a decline in natural gas prices.  Oil Revenues. We drill wells primarily to produce natural gas, rather than oil, but some wells have limited oil production. Our oil revenues were $6,700 and $21,800 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $15,100 (69%). The $15,100 decrease in oil revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to an $8,700 decrease in production volumes and a $6,400 decrease in oil prices. Our production volumes decreased to 1.60 bbls per day for the three months ended September 30, 2015 from 2.66 bbls per day for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, a decrease of 1.06 bbls per day (40%).  Our oil revenues were $26,100 and $67,100 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $41,000 (61%). The $41,000 decrease in oil revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $23,400 decrease in oil prices and a $17,600 decrease in production volumes. Our production volumes decreased to 1.97 bbls per day for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 from 2.66 bbls per day for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, a decrease of 0.69 bbls per day (26%).  Gain (Loss) on Mark-to-Market Derivatives. On January 1, 2015, we discontinued hedge accounting for our qualified commodity derivatives. As such, subsequent changes in fair value of these derivatives are recognized immediately within gain (loss) on mark-to-market derivatives on our statements of operations. The fair values of these commodity derivative instruments as December 31, 2014, which were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income within partners' capital on our balance sheet, will be reclassified to our statements of operations in the future at the time the originally hedged physical transactions settle.  We recognized a gain on mark-to-market derivatives of $14,200 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This gain was due primarily to mark-to-market gains in the current quarter primarily related to the change in natural gas prices during the year. There were no gains or losses on mark-to-market derivatives during the three months ended September 30, 2014.  We recognized a gain on mark-to-market derivatives of $14,600 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This gain was due primarily to mark-to-market gains in the current quarter primarily related to the change in natural gas prices during the year. There were no gains or losses on mark-to-market derivatives during the nine months ended September 30, 2014.  Costs and Expenses. Production expenses were $222,600 and $301,600 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $79,000 (26%). Production expenses were $768,400 and $943,700 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $175,300 (19%). The decreases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were mostly due to a decrease in transportation costs due to a decrease in the realized price of natural gas, and a decrease in the number of producing wells due to wells shut-in as a result of a decline in natural gas prices.  Depletion of oil and gas properties as a percentage of oil and gas revenues was 25% and 24% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and 20% and 16% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These percentage changes are directly attributable to changes in revenues, oil and gas reserve quantities, product prices and production volumes and changes in the depletable cost basis of oil and gas properties.  General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 were $42,700 and $47,200, respectively, a change of $4,500 (10%). For the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, these expenses were $139,900 and $137,100, respectively, an increase of $2,800 (2%). These expenses include third-party costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our MGP. The changes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 are primarily due to third-party costs as compared to the prior year similar period.  Impairment of gas and oil properties for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $1,281,200. There were no impairments of gas and oil properties for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014. Periodically, we compare the carrying value of our proved developed gas and oil producing properties to their estimated fair market value. To the extent our carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value, an impairment charge is recognized. As a result of this assessment, an impairment charge was recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. This charge is based on reserve quantities, future market prices and our carrying value. We cannot provide any assurance that similar charges may or may not be taken in future periods.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Cash flows from operating activities decreased $513,100 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to cash used in operating activities of $300 as compared to cash provided by operating activities of $512,800 for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. This decrease was mostly due to a decrease in net (loss) income before depletion, accretion, impairment and a non-cash (gain) loss on derivative value of $750,400 and an increase in the change in the asset retirement receivable-affiliate of $10,600. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in the change in accounts payable trade-affiliate of $169,300, the change in accounts receivable-affiliate of $39,600 and the change in accrued liabilities of $38,700. In addition the asset retirement obligations settled was $300, decreasing operating cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2014.  Cash provided by investing activities was $300 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 for the proceeds from the sale of tangible equipment.  Cash used in financing activities was $575,600 for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 due to cash distributions to partners. There was no cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Our MGP may withhold funds for future plugging and abandonment costs. Through September 30, 2015, our MGP has withheld $45,500 of funds for this purpose. Any additional funds, if required, will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from our MGP or its affiliates, which are not contractually committed to make loans to us. The amount that we may borrow at any one time may not at any time exceed 5% of our total subscriptions, and we will not borrow from third-parties.  We are generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flows from our operations, which we believe is adequate to fund future operations and distributions to our partners. Historically, there has been no need to borrow funds from our MGP to fund operations. However, recent declines in commodity prices may challenge the Partnership's ability to pay its obligations as they become due and its intention to produce its wells until they are depleted, as they may become uneconomical to produce. Accordingly, the MGP determined that there is substantial doubt about the Partnership's ability to continue as a going concern. The MGP has planned, as necessary, to continue the Partnership's operations and to fund the Partnership's operations for at least the next 12 months. The MGP has concluded that such undertaking is sufficient to alleviate the doubt as to the Partnership's ability to continue as a going concern.  Critical Accounting Policies  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to our asset retirement obligations, depletion and certain accrued receivables and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of significant accounting policies we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our financial statements is included within "Notes to Financial Statements" in Part I, Item 1, "Financial Statements" in this quarterly report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Get Quote Apply Online








For international travel, Atlas Travel® Insurance provides customizable coverage for travelers looking to cover specific needs while abroad.
International travel can represent financial risk. The benefits of many standard medical insurance policies do not apply beyond the borders of your home country. An Atlas Travel® Insurance
                                        plan can be the difference between a trip ruined by unexpected illness or injury, versus a trip with access to quality care and financial help if the unexpected strikes.
HCC has developed two Atlas Travel® plans that offer a complete package of international benefits available 24 hours a day. Atlas America® provides coverage for non-U.S. citizens traveling outside their home country while Atlas International provides coverage for US citizens traveling outside their home country.
Important things you should know about Atlas Visitors Insurance
There are many different types of insurance policies that are around today, but one of the best ones you can try out is the Atlas America Visitor Insurance policy. The medical insurance policy is available to visitors in the United States, as well as all foreign tourists who are traveling to the United States for business or for leisure. There is massive demand for this travel insurance package, because it is available for new immigrants in the United States, as well as international students, and overseas travelers as well.

Finally taking that trip you’ve always dreamed of to the United States? Whether you’re planning to travel solo or with your family for work, school, or pleasure, you’re probably equal parts excited and stressed.
For international visitors unfamiliar with the U.S. healthcare system, questions of health and safety can be a major source of travel anxiety. Would you be able to seek treatment if you suffered an injury or unexpected illness while exploring the country? Would your medical expenses be covered by your home country health insurance policy?
If the answer to either of these questions is no, then it’s time to explore your travel medical insurance options.
What is Atlas America insurance?
Atlas America is a travel medical insurance policy for non-U.S. citizens and residents visiting the United States. Available to individuals, families, and groups, Atlas America insurance can cover individuals from most countries who are at least 14 days old and traveling to the U.S. from abroad.
Policies must cover a minimum of 5 days, though you do not have to travel all 5 days to be eligible for coverage. Coverage is available up to 364 days.

Why do I need insurance for my trip to the U.S.?
Your home country health insurance policy may not cover you across international lines – or it may provide very limited international coverage. And in the United States, people are responsible for their own healthcare costs, meaning you’ll be financially responsible for any medical expenses stemming from an unexpected illness or injury.
According to healthcare.gov, a broken leg can cost up to $7,500 to fix in the United States, and the average cost of a 3-day hospital stay is around $30,000.
Travel medical insurance, as noted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), can reduce “the cost of a medical emergency" and the resulting “financial burden on travelers" by providing access to quality care and financial help if the unexpected occurs as you travel throughout the United States.
It can also serve as evidence that you’ll be able to pay for medical expenses incurred during your time in the U.S., which may be required if you need a visa to enter the country.


What benefits does Atlas America provide?
Atlas America insurance provides benefits for eligible medical expenses incurred in the U.S., including Hospital Room and Board, Local Ambulance, Emergency Medical Evacuation, Intensive Care Unit, and all other eligible costs.
It also provides supplemental travel benefits like Trip Interruption, Travel Delay, and Lost Checked Luggage.
Key features of Atlas America insurance include:

Up to $2,000,000 in maximum coverage per covered injury or illness and per certificate period
Your choice of deductible ranging from $0 to $2,500 per certificate period
Coinsurance at 80% of the next $5,000 of eligible expenses after the deductible, then 100% to the maximum coverage limit. Within the Preferred Provider Network (PPO), coinsurance is waived and eligible expenses are paid at 100% after the deductible, up to the overall maximum.
Provider network with over 5,000 hospitals and more than 90,000 healthcare facilities throughout the U.S.
Free travel assistance services available in multiple languages 365 days a year

Other Atlas America highlights:

Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D)
Repatriation of Remains
Political Evacuation
Terrorism
Natural Disaster
Personal Liability

To see the full list of Atlas America insurance benefits and exclusions, see the Description of Coverage. 

Why choose Atlas America insurance?
Flexibility: Atlas America policies are affordable and flexible, allowing you to select the deductible, length of coverage, and coverage maximum that best align with your travel needs.
Plus, if you need to extend your coverage after you purchase your policy, you can extend (5-day minimum) up to a maximum of 364 days from your initial coverage start date. Provided there is no break in coverage, you will not be required to re-satisfy your deductible or coinsurance and your benefit limits will not reset.
Ease-of-Use: Purchasing Atlas America insurance is fast and easy – online fulfillment is available immediately and no health screenings are required for acceptance. Plus, our provider network covers all 50 states, with easy access for the majority of the U.S.
When you purchase an Atlas America insurance policy, you will also receive a fulfillment document with detailed instructions on how to use it. These instructions will explain how to seek medical treatment, how to file a claim, and how to contact the customer service department with any additional questions you may have.
Year-Round Assistance: As an Atlas America policyholder, you will receive access to our full line of travel assistance services, available in multiple languages 365 days a year. These services include:

Lost passport and travel documents assistance
Tracking for lost luggage
Assistance with emergency cash transfers
Embassy and consulate referrals
Legal and accounting referrals

Does Atlas America meet visa requirements?
As a USA visitor, you may need a visa in order to gain entry to the United States. Whether or not you’ll need a visa is determined by your country of citizenship. The type of visa you'll need is dependent on the purpose of your travel.
Here are just a few common USA visitor visa types:

Visitor Visa: For people coming to the U.S. for a short period of time – typically 6 months or less – to visit children or relatives, tour, or vacation
Temporary Worker Visa: For individuals coming to the U.S. for a fixed period of time to receive job training or perform short-term or seasonal work
J-1 Visa: For USA visitors enrolling in work-and-study-based exchange programs in order to teach, study, conduct research, or receive on-site job training in the U.S.

In order to be approved for your visa, you’ll need to fulfill visa requirements. While your visa may not require you to have travel medical insurance, it may require you to show proof of funds to cover expenses incurred in the United States.
One way to evidence these funds is to purchase a travel medical policy like Atlas America, which provides policyholders with a visa letter to serve as proof of medical coverage.
Atlas America also meets the minimum insurance requirements of a J-1 visa as established by the U.S. Department of State.

Why do I need travel medical insurance?

Why do I need travel medical insurance?
International travel can represent financial risk. The benefits of many standard medical insurance policies do not apply beyond the borders of your home country. An Atlas Travel medical insurance plan can be the difference between a trip ruined by unexpected illness or injury, versus a trip with access to quality care and financial help if the unexpected strikes.

Atlas Travel does offer medical expense coverage in your home country in the following situations:
Benefit Period
Atlas Travel will cover eligible medical expenses in the member’s home country for 90 days after the beginning of treatment so long as the related illness or injury began while the certificate was still in effect and treatment began while the member was outside their home country.
Incidental Home Country Coverage
For individuals with the U.S. as home country, for every three month period during which the Member is covered hereunder, medical expenses incurred in the U.S. are covered up to a maximum of 15 days.
For individuals with a home country other than the U.S., for every three month period during which the Member is covered hereunder, medical expenses incurred in the member’s home country are covered up to a maximum of 30 days. Any benefit accrued under a sin­gle 3 month period does not accumulate to another period. Failure of the member to continue his or her international trip or the members return to their home country for the sole purpose of obtaining treatment for an illness or injury that began while traveling shall void any home country coverage provided under the terms of this agreement.
