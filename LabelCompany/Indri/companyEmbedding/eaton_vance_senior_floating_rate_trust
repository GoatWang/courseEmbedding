Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market volatili ty, the Fund's current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. The Fund's performance at market price will differ from its results at NAV. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value or market  price (as applicable) with all distributions reinvested and includes management fees and other expenses. Until the reinvestment of Fund distributions is completed, returns are calculated using the lower of the net asset value or market price of the shar es on the distribution ex date.  Once the reinvestment is complete, returns are calculated using the average reinvestment price.  Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative.

About Risk: 
An imbalance in supply and demand in the income market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. There can be no assurance that the liquidation of  collateral securing an investment will satisfy the issuer’s obligation in the event of nonpayment or that collateral can be readily liquidated. The ability to realize the benefits of any collateral may be delayed or limited. Investments in income  securities may be affected by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer’s ability to make principal and interest payments. Borrowing to increase investments (leverage) will exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of Fund investments. Investments rated below investment grade (typically referred to as &ldquo;junk”) are generally subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity than higher-rated investments. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. Bank loans are subject to prepayment risk. Investment s in foreign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. Changes in the value of investments entered for hedging pur poses may not match those of the position being hedged. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks.

This data reflects distributions paid on Fund shares held for the full calendar year and is not predictive of the tax character of current or future distributions.  Fund shareholders should refer to the individual IRS Form 1099-DIVs provided to them shor tly after each year-end to determine the appropriate federal income tax treatment of the distributions they receive.  Eaton Vance is not responsible for any errors in tax reporting that may result from using the above data. Non-qualified ordinary dividen ds are subject to federal income tax at ordinary rates.  Qualified dividends and capital gains distributions are taxable at long-term capital gains rates. Nondividend distributions, also known as return of capital distributions, are not subject to curren t federal income tax.  Instead, the tax cost basis of each shareholder receiving a return of capital distribution is reduced by the amount of the distribution.

 Insights & Analysis  Commentary
A Word On The Markets as of  Mar 31, 2017
The S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index (the Index)6 delivered a 1.15% total return for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017. Though investor demand remained robust throughout the period, technical conditions eased in March as prepayments slowed and  new-issue supply increased. As a result, net Index par outstandings expanded during the quarter. Performance results for the period were nearly entirely composed of income generation, with coupon income accounting for 1.17% while market value return sub tracted -0.02%. Though loan prices continued to firm in both January and February – 0.16% and 0.14% higher, respectively – prices lost -0.31% during March's modest ease in technical strength. Overall, monthly returns during the period were 0. 56%, 0.50% and 0.08% for January, February and March, respectively. The average loan price in the Index ended the period at $98.22.
In line with 2016's theme, aggregate demand outstripped net supply expansion during the period. Though quarterly loan volume increased considerably during the quarter, demand still managed to outpace alongside continued strength in both structured produc t growth as well as net mutual fund subscriptions. On the funds' side of the equation, Lipper reported more than $11 billion in net inflows to loan funds. Meantime, collateralized loan obligation (CLO) creation totaled more than $17 billion for the perio d.
On fundamentals, the par-weighted default rate ended the period at 1.49% on a last-12-months basis. The default rate remained low from a historical perspective, with about two thirds of these modest defaults having come by way of commodity-related issuer s over this period – which collectively account for a limited corner of the overall market. From this respect, the majority of the asset class outstanding continued to remain in relatively benign shape fundamentally.


Performance Summary 
Eaton Vance Senior Floating-Rate Trust (EFR) outperformed the Index at net asset value for the quarter.

Security selection within the B and BB tiers of the market was beneficial to the Funds' relative performance.
The Funds' underweight to the retailers sector – as well as security selection within – aided relative results for the three-month period.
The Funds remained underweight to the better-performing, higher-credit risk tiers of the market, although the limited weight of these segments kept the relative impact limited.
Employment of investment leverage, a strategic element of the Funds' strategies, aided performance as it amplified the positive results of the Funds' underlying portfolios.
An allocation to high-yield bonds helped performance relative to the Index, as the high-yield market generally outperformed loans.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market volatili ty, the Fund's current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. The Fund's performance at market price will differ from its results at NAV. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value or market  price (as applicable) with all distributions reinvested and includes management fees and other expenses. Until the reinvestment of Fund distributions is completed, returns are calculated using the lower of the net asset value or market price of the shar es on the distribution ex date.  Once the reinvestment is complete, returns are calculated using the average reinvestment price.  Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative.

Contributors 
Security selection within the B and BB tiers of the market was beneficial to relative performance.

The retailers segment was the worst performing area of the loan market during the quarter, generating a return of -1.97%. The Funds' underweight to this sector – as well as security selection within – aided relative results for the three-mont h period. Security selection within the oil & gas, food service and business equipment & services sectors also helped relative performance.
Employment of investment leverage, a strategic element of the Funds' strategies, aided performance as it amplified the positive results of the Funds' underlying portfolios.
The Funds' allocation to high-yield bonds – a strategic element of its investment strategy – aided performance relative to the Index, as high-yield bonds outperformed loans for the quarter. The Index does not include high-yield bonds.



Detractors 
Quarterly returns by credit tier were 0.66%, 1.14%, 5.02% and 3.06% for loans rated BB, B, CCC and D, respectively. In a similar vein, second-lien loans also outperformed, returning 3.61% for the quarter, compared with 1.06% for first liens. Though the F unds remained underweight to the better-performing, higher-credit risk tiers of the market, although the limited weight of these segments kept the relative impact limited.


Investment Outlook And Fund Positioning 
We remain constructive on the credit risk profile underlying the loan market. While the default rate is a lagging indicator, the distress ratio – defined as the percentage of performing loans trading below $80 – can often paint a clearer pict ure about the path of forward default probabilities. Through December, the ratio was 2.9%. Only 1.5% traded below $70, a level considered to be higher in default risk. Overall, we believe defaults are likely to grind modestly higher in the coming year bu t remain low and below average in an historical context. This view aligns with the latest S&P/LCD quarterly survey of loan managers, with the latest poll showing that participants have cut forecasts of near-term loan defaults. Though the current credit c ycle may indeed be in its later innings, decent economic data now and the potential for supportive Trump-era policies ahead should shift default risk from the nearer term to something further out.
Market pricing indicates positive-but-nonetheless very limited price appreciation potential from here. The average price of the Index ended March at $98.2, with 66.9% of performing loans bid at par or higher. With the price "upside" of the asset class ha ving largely played out in 2016, upside potential for the remainder of 2017 is shaping up to take its place in the coupon component of returns – as the Fed projects three quarter-point rate hikes.
With 3-month LIBOR at the average floor in the loan market and 1-month LIBOR at 0.98%, the higher income potential that may follow the next Fed rate hike will likely continue to draw investor attention. Looking ahead, we believe the market's technical ba lance remains tipped toward one of strength, and we think it's likely that asset class buyership grows as investors brace for the likelihood of higher interest rates. Though unexpected events can always translate to volatility in the shorter run, we thin k loans are set up well given competing investment opportunities across the capital markets.

An imbalance in supply and demand in the income market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. There can be no assurance that the liquidation of  collateral securing an investment will satisfy the issuer’s obligation in the event of nonpayment or that collateral can be readily liquidated. The ability to realize the benefits of any collateral may be delayed or limited. Investments in income  securities may be affected by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer’s ability to make principal and interest payments. Borrowing to increase investments (leverage) will exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of Fund investments. Investments rated below investment grade (typically referred to as &ldquo;junk”) are generally subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity than higher-rated investments. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. Bank loans are subject to prepayment risk. Investment s in foreign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. Changes in the value of investments entered for hedging pur poses may not match those of the position being hedged. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks.

About Risk: 
An imbalance in supply and demand in the income market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. There can be no assurance that the liquidation of  collateral securing an investment will satisfy the issuer’s obligation in the event of nonpayment or that collateral can be readily liquidated. The ability to realize the benefits of any collateral may be delayed or limited. Investments in income  securities may be affected by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer’s ability to make principal and interest payments. Borrowing to increase investments (leverage) will exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of Fund investments. Investments rated below investment grade (typically referred to as &ldquo;junk”) are generally subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity than higher-rated investments. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. Bank loans are subject to prepayment risk. Investment s in foreign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. Changes in the value of investments entered for hedging pur poses may not match those of the position being hedged. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks.



1. Distribution Rate at NAV and Market Price is calculated by dividing the last distribution paid per share (annualized) by NAV or market price, respectively.

About Risk: 
An imbalance in supply and demand in the income market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. There can be no assurance that the liquidation of  collateral securing an investment will satisfy the issuer’s obligation in the event of nonpayment or that collateral can be readily liquidated. The ability to realize the benefits of any collateral may be delayed or limited. Investments in income  securities may be affected by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer’s ability to make principal and interest payments. Borrowing to increase investments (leverage) will exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of Fund investments. Investments rated below investment grade (typically referred to as &ldquo;junk”) are generally subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity than higher-rated investments. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. Bank loans are subject to prepayment risk. Investment s in foreign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. Changes in the value of investments entered for hedging pur poses may not match those of the position being hedged. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks.

 Insights & Analysis  Commentary
A Word On The Markets as of  Mar 31, 2017
The S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index (the Index)6 delivered a 1.15% total return for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017. Though investor demand remained robust throughout the period, technical conditions eased in March as prepayments slowed and  new-issue supply increased. As a result, net Index par outstandings expanded during the quarter. Performance results for the period were nearly entirely composed of income generation, with coupon income accounting for 1.17% while market value return sub tracted -0.02%. Though loan prices continued to firm in both January and February – 0.16% and 0.14% higher, respectively – prices lost -0.31% during March's modest ease in technical strength. Overall, monthly returns during the period were 0. 56%, 0.50% and 0.08% for January, February and March, respectively. The average loan price in the Index ended the period at $98.22.
In line with 2016's theme, aggregate demand outstripped net supply expansion during the period. Though quarterly loan volume increased considerably during the quarter, demand still managed to outpace alongside continued strength in both structured produc t growth as well as net mutual fund subscriptions. On the funds' side of the equation, Lipper reported more than $11 billion in net inflows to loan funds. Meantime, collateralized loan obligation (CLO) creation totaled more than $17 billion for the perio d.
On fundamentals, the par-weighted default rate ended the period at 1.49% on a last-12-months basis. The default rate remained low from a historical perspective, with about two thirds of these modest defaults having come by way of commodity-related issuer s over this period – which collectively account for a limited corner of the overall market. From this respect, the majority of the asset class outstanding continued to remain in relatively benign shape fundamentally.


Performance Summary 
Eaton Vance Floating-Rate Income Trust (EFT) outperformed the Index at net asset value for the quarter.

Security selection within the B and BB tiers of the market was beneficial to the Funds' relative performance.
The Funds' underweight to the retailers sector – as well as security selection within – aided relative results for the three-month period.
The Funds remained underweight to the better-performing, higher-credit risk tiers of the market, although the limited weight of these segments kept the relative impact limited.
Employment of investment leverage, a strategic element of the Funds' strategies, aided performance as it amplified the positive results of the Funds' underlying portfolios.
An allocation to high-yield bonds helped performance relative to the Index, as the high-yield market generally outperformed loans.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market volatili ty, the Fund's current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. The Fund's performance at market price will differ from its results at NAV. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value or market  price (as applicable) with all distributions reinvested and includes management fees and other expenses. Until the reinvestment of Fund distributions is completed, returns are calculated using the lower of the net asset value or market price of the shar es on the distribution ex date.  Once the reinvestment is complete, returns are calculated using the average reinvestment price.  Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative.

Contributors 
Security selection within the B and BB tiers of the market was beneficial to relative performance.

The retailers segment was the worst performing area of the loan market during the quarter, generating a return of -1.97%. The Funds' underweight to this sector – as well as security selection within – aided relative results for the three-mont h period. Security selection within the oil & gas, food service and business equipment & services sectors also helped relative performance.
Employment of investment leverage, a strategic element of the Funds' strategies, aided performance as it amplified the positive results of the Funds' underlying portfolios.
The Funds' allocation to high-yield bonds – a strategic element of its investment strategy – aided performance relative to the Index, as high-yield bonds outperformed loans for the quarter. The Index does not include high-yield bonds.



Detractors 
Quarterly returns by credit tier were 0.66%, 1.14%, 5.02% and 3.06% for loans rated BB, B, CCC and D, respectively. In a similar vein, second-lien loans also outperformed, returning 3.61% for the quarter, compared with 1.06% for first liens. Though the F unds remained underweight to the better-performing, higher-credit risk tiers of the market, although the limited weight of these segments kept the relative impact limited.


Investment Outlook And Fund Positioning 
We remain constructive on the credit risk profile underlying the loan market. While the default rate is a lagging indicator, the distress ratio – defined as the percentage of performing loans trading below $80 – can often paint a clearer pict ure about the path of forward default probabilities. Through December, the ratio was 2.9%. Only 1.5% traded below $70, a level considered to be higher in default risk. Overall, we believe defaults are likely to grind modestly higher in the coming year bu t remain low and below average in an historical context. This view aligns with the latest S&P/LCD quarterly survey of loan managers, with the latest poll showing that participants have cut forecasts of near-term loan defaults. Though the current credit c ycle may indeed be in its later innings, decent economic data now and the potential for supportive Trump-era policies ahead should shift default risk from the nearer term to something further out.
Market pricing indicates positive-but-nonetheless very limited price appreciation potential from here. The average price of the Index ended March at $98.2, with 66.9% of performing loans bid at par or higher. With the price "upside" of the asset class ha ving largely played out in 2016, upside potential for the remainder of 2017 is shaping up to take its place in the coupon component of returns – as the Fed projects three quarter-point rate hikes.
With 3-month LIBOR at the average floor in the loan market and 1-month LIBOR at 0.98%, the higher income potential that may follow the next Fed rate hike will likely continue to draw investor attention. Looking ahead, we believe the market's technical ba lance remains tipped toward one of strength, and we think it's likely that asset class buyership grows as investors brace for the likelihood of higher interest rates. Though unexpected events can always translate to volatility in the shorter run, we thin k loans are set up well given competing investment opportunities across the capital markets.
