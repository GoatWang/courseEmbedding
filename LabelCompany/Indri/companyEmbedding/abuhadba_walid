Introducing ANSYS 17.0 – 10X Productivity, Insights and Performance

Posted on January 27, 2016  by  Walid Abu-Hadba 


With a number of emerging technologies and trends on the horizon, it is an exciting but challenging time to be an engineer. The convergence of new technologies into Industry 4.0 is ushering in an era of unbound product innovation. With the advent of the Internet of Things, a tighter integration of the digital world and the world of machines will profoundly transform consumer and industrial markets. New advanced materials are enabling engineers to create substantially lighter and sustainable designs. New technologies are changing the way we harvest, store, and use energy. And the possibilities of virtual reality and additive manufacturing are freeing engineers to explore more radical designs, free of manufacturing constraints. Make no mistake, engineering simulation will be the key to unlocking the power and potential of this new industrial revolution, and to this end, I am excited and honored to announce the next release of our simulation platform on behalf of over a thousand R&D professionals at ANSYS.

ANSYS 16.2 – The Latest Advances in Systems Engineering Technology

Posted on August 11, 2015  by  Walid Abu-Hadba 


Now that the official word is out about the launch of ANSYS 16.2, I wanted to use our blog to talk to you about this exciting development less formally. In a word, ANSYS 16.2 is all about systems — because most new products today are really complex systems that have to be designed and verified holistically upfront for successful performance.

ANSYS 15.0 Advances Engineering Simulation

Posted on December 3, 2013  by  Walid Abu-Hadba 


When I came from Microsoft to join ANSYS in April, I knew that ANSYS had been offering industry-leading engineering simulation software for more than four decades. But what I did not know was the amount of innovation and product technology that the company had lined up to deliver this year — and over the next several years. As a result of the work I’ve done with product development teams, I have grown even more passionate about ANSYS and what it has to offer the industry. I am, therefore, as proud as the rest of the team in announcing the release of our new product suite. ANSYS 15.0 builds upon the many years of leadership and includes dramatic upgrades in each of the key physics areas (electromagnetics, fluid dynamics, structures and embedded code). The combination of performance improvements, new solver capabilities, HPC scalability advances and pre-processing enhancements delivers insights into the most challenging product designs.
ANSYS 15.0

Because manmade materials are everywhere, ANSYS 15.0 provides structural analysts with advanced new functionality for simulating composites. What I find very exciting is the innovation built in to ensure efficiency throughout the entire modeling process. For example, users can apply submodeling techniques in the pre-processing workflow to create high-fidelity local results while employing a coarser model globally to reduce overall computation time.

The ABU Destination Introduced in 2011, the Airman Battle Uniform replaced the popular Battle Dress Uniform as official U.S. Air Force combat gear. It is engineered to provide maximum protection, breathability and flexibility for intense operations. Our four-pocket ABU coats are available in digital tiger stripe and made from various fabrics and weights. These coats are fire-retardant, sewn to military specifications and reinforced at the sleeves for maximum durability. Designed for optimal adaptability in a variety of climates, our ABU pants provide the breathability, protection and flexibility critical to reliable uniform pants. We also carry the official USAF utility cap, which is sewn to military specifications and is the only cap approved for use by the Air Force. Whether you are an active airman or a civilian seeking reliable tactical gear, we have you covered.

Sizing guidelines don't work.
                                            Reviewer: Craig


5/24/2017

                                                The product is great I tried twice, following their guidelines, and neither one fits. I will probably still shop here for other things but I am not real happy with this time.
                                            







Response from TacticalGear.com

I'm sorry to hear you weren't happy with the sizing, Craig. If you need help with a return, or if you ever have questions on sizing for other products, please feel free to reach out. We'd be happy to help!

                                                Make sure you get the "propper" measurement of your cranium.

                                                Measured head, used adjacent chart. Came in. Perfect fit.
Product appears to be quality! Will be testing it in the yard, swamps, and on the coastline. Thank you! 
p.s. Repels rain well. Used it today.

                                                Very well made, just what I expected.  Should last for years.
                                            












Iron clad boonie
                                            Reviewer: Bob Gillette


8/15/2016

                                                This propper boonie is much tougher  than what  I got in the seventies. Think it is the inclusion of nylon that makes it so tough. It also sheds water better; have used in rain and is very effective. High quality for low cost.

                                                A bit tight, but with some wear I should loosen up.
                                            












Great fit, design, and quality.

                                                Hi all,
I am glad that I listened to their suggestion and ordered one size up. Its a perfect fit. Would have been too tight otherwise. Its a good looking hat and
I was surprised at the quality for such a low price. 
Very happy with this purchase.

                                                Could use a heavier fabric on the top, otherwise I am pleased.

                                                Thanks this will serve me well! A bit stiff new needs to be broken in, Like I did in the Nam 69'. I lost the original copy, and couldn't bring back the real one to the world.  Thanks for your gear, and service!

could be better
                                            Reviewer: b.h.


12/5/2013

                                                Bought this in woodland before they stoped selling that color and it appears to be made well however the brim is unevenly sewn resulting in it measuring about 2.5" on one side and 1.75" on the other , although i have worn the hat i am not very happy with it and only kept it because it cost to more then its worth to send back.
                                            












Great hat
                                            Reviewer: AK


4/5/2013

                                                Boonie hats don't get much better than this.  The 50/50 nylon cotton is a bit lighter weight than the poly cotton.  Contrary to the sites recommendation, the sizing of this hat is accurate.  Only order a size up if you want it to fit a little more relaxed/loose.  The poly/cotton version is a bit stiffer and can feel tighter as a result.  I own both.
                                            












One of the best boonie hats out there!

                                                It's a great hat. It's my second hat so far from this site, and it has a beautiful design in my opinion!! This hat also does not need any adjustments with the size.
                                            












Good product but does NOT run small.
                                            Reviewer: Praetorian


12/27/2012

                                                This is my second Propper boonie, bought from another site. As expected, good quality item from Propper. However, similar to the review I had on the Propper ABU Utility Caps (Item Number: F556249376), I found this item "true to size", and did not appear to run small (ymmv, the first site advised their boonies to be bigger and advised to buy a small size down). Reordering another for me, probably resell this one to a colleague. One star off.

Designed specifically for the demands of the U.S. Air Force, the Air Force Battle Uniform (ABU) coat features a distinctive grey-blue digital tiger stripe camouflage pattern. Its four front pockets provide ample storage for essential gear, while the button closures lock your gear in place. We offer multiple fabric styles so you can select the weight and feel you prefer. All styles are comfortable, breathable and resistant to tears. Whether you are an airman shopping for a coat that meets military specification or a civilian looking to dress for a tactical operation, the combat-ready design of the ABU coat will serve your needs.

Top off your Airman Battle Uniform with the ABU Utility Cap, which is the only cap approved for official use by the U.S. Air Force. Made with a durable poly/cotton ripstop fabric, this hat provides comfortable, breathable protection. Ripstop fabric is designed to prevent tearing, which means your cap will hold up to the wear and tear of combat. Styles that are approved for the Air Force come in a digital tiger stripe camouflage pattern and are sewn to military specification. Some also repel water for an additional layer of protection and have Near-Infrared (NIR) technology. For headwear tough enough for combat, you can’t go wrong with the ABU utility cap.













Propper Nylon / Cotton Ripstop ABU Utility Caps
