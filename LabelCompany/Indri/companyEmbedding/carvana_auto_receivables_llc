PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Carvana Co. (NYSE: CVNA), a leading eCommerce platform for buying used 
      cars, today announced financial results for its first quarter ended 
      March 31, 2017. Carvana’s complete first quarter 2017 financial results 
      and management commentary can be found by accessing the Company’s 
      shareholder letter at: https://investors.carvana.com/financial-reports/sec-filings. 
      Beginning with today’s financial report, the Company intends to use its 
      investor relations website, investors.carvana.com, 
      as a disclosure method.
    

      “We are excited to announce record revenue in our first earnings report 
      as a newly public company. Our strong performance this quarter reflects 
      a significant increase in retail units, as well as expansion into new 
      markets. During the quarter we made important enhancements to the 
      customer experience through new product development, resulting in 
      ongoing optimization from website through vehicle delivery,” said Ernie 
      Garcia, Carvana founder and CEO. “We continue to see increased consumer 
      adoption of online car buying across our markets, charting a clear path 
      to consistent growth within the $710 billion U.S. used auto market. 
      Carvana’s unique business model includes proprietary technology and 
      assets, like the vending machines, that deliver customer experiences 
      that position us to execute against our aggressive growth plans.”
    

First Quarter 2017 Financial Summary


      We achieved significant unit and revenue growth in Q1 2017, coupled with 
      increased total gross profit per unit. All financial comparisons are 
      versus Q1 2016, unless otherwise noted.
    


        Retail units sold totaled 8,334, an increase of 120%
      

        Revenue totaled $159.1 million, an increase of 118%
      

        Total gross profit was $9.7 million, an increase of 146%
      

        Total gross profit per unit was $1,169, an increase of $123 per unit
      

        Net loss was $38.4 million, an increase of 122%
      

        EBITDA margin was (21.6%), an improvement from (30.6%) in Q4 2016 and 
        flat versus Q1 2016
      

        GAAP basic and diluted net loss per Class A unit was $0.44, based on 
        103.3 million Class A units outstanding
      

        Adjusted net loss per Class A share, a non-GAAP measure, was $0.28, 
        based on 136.8 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding 
        assuming the exchange of all outstanding LLC Units for shares of Class 
        A common stock and the issuance of 15.0 million shares of Class A 
        common stock pursuant to our initial public offering
      

        We opened 2 new markets, bringing our end-of-quarter total to 23
      


Q2 and Fiscal 2017 Outlook


      We anticipate further unit and revenue growth, as well as total gross 
      profit per unit improvement. For Q2 2017, we expect:
    


        Retail unit sales of 10,000 – 10,500
      

        Total revenue of $193 million - $203 million
      

        Total gross profit per unit of $1,375 – $1,425
      

        EBITDA margin of (18%) - (18.5%)
      


      For fiscal year 2017, we expect:
    


        Retail unit sales of 44,000 – 46,000, an increase from 18,761 in 2016
      

        Revenue of $850 million – $910 million, an increase from $365 million 
        in 2016
      

        Total gross profit per unit of $1,475 - $1,575, an increase from 
        $1,023 in 2016
      

        EBITDA margin of (14%) - (16%), an improvement from (23.2%) in 2016
      

        16 – 18 new market openings, bringing our end-of-year total to 37 – 39
      


      For more information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures, please 
      see the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measurements to their most 
      directly comparable GAAP-based financial measurements included at the 
      end of this press release. Guidance for EBITDA margin excludes 
      depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense. We have not 
      reconciled EBITDA guidance to GAAP net loss as a result of the 
      uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, interest 
      expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure 
      guidance to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without 
      unreasonable effort. Depreciation and amortization expense, which is a 
      component of the reconciliation between EBITDA and GAAP net loss, is 
      expected to be between 1.0% and 1.5% of total revenues for both Q2 2017 
      and FY 2017.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures


      As appropriate, we supplement our results of operations determined in 
      accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) 
      with certain non-GAAP financial measurements that are used by 
      management, and which we believe are useful to investors, as 
      supplemental operational measurements to evaluate our financial 
      performance. These measurements should not be considered in isolation or 
      as a substitute for reported GAAP results because they may include or 
      exclude certain items as compared to similar GAAP-based measurements, 
      and such measurements may not be comparable to similarly-titled 
      measurements reported by other companies. Rather, these measurements 
      should be considered as an additional way of viewing aspects of our 
      operations that provide a more complete understanding of our business. 
      We strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial 
      statements included in publicly filed reports in their entirety and not 
      rely solely on any one, single financial measurement or communication.
    

      Reconciliations of our non-GAAP measurements to their most directly 
      comparable GAAP-based financial measurements are included at the end of 
      this press release.

Adjusted Net Loss to Net Loss and Computation of Adjusted Net Loss 
      per Share


      Adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share are supplemental 
      measures of operating performance that do not represent and should not 
      be considered alternatives to net loss and net loss per share, as 
      determined under GAAP. We believe that adjusted net loss and adjusted 
      net loss per share supplement GAAP measures and enable us to more 
      effectively evaluate our performance period-over-period. A 
      reconciliation of adjusted net loss to net loss, the most directly 
      comparable GAAP measure, and the computation of adjusted net loss per 
      share are as follows:

Net Loss to EBITDA


      EBITDA is a non-GAAP supplemental measure of operating performance that 
      does not represent and should not be considered an alternative to net 
      loss or cash flow from operations, as determined by GAAP. EBITDA is 
      defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense and 
      depreciation and amortization expense. We use EBITDA to measure the 
      operating performance of our business, excluding specifically identified 
      items that we do not believe directly reflect our core operations and 
      may not be indicative of our recurring operations. EBITDA may not be 
      comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies due 
      to potential differences in methods of calculations. A reconciliation of 
      EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is as 
      follows:

 Carvana Co. (NYSE: CVNA), a leading eCommerce platform for buying used

We are excited to announce record revenue in our first earnings report
as a newly public company. Our strong performance this quarter reflects
a significant increase in retail units, as well as expansion into new
markets. During the quarter we made important enhancements to the
customer experience through new product development, resulting in
ongoing optimization from website through vehicle delivery, said Ernie
Garcia, Carvana founder and CEO. We continue to see increased consumer
adoption of online car buying across our markets, charting a clear path
to consistent growth within the $710 billion U.S. used auto market.
Carvanas unique business model includes proprietary technology and
assets, like the vending machines, that deliver customer experiences
that position us to execute against our aggressive growth plans.

Retail unit sales of 44,000  46,000, an increase from 18,761 in 2016


Revenue of $850 million  $910 million, an increase from $365 million
in 2016


Total gross profit per unit of $1,475 - $1,575, an increase from
$1,023 in 2016


EBITDA margin of (14%) - (16%), an improvement from (23.2%) in 2016


16  18 new market openings, bringing our end-of-year total to 37  39


For more information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures, please
see the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measurements to their most
directly comparable GAAP-based financial measurements included at the
end of this press release. Guidance for EBITDA margin excludes
depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense. We have not
reconciled EBITDA guidance to GAAP net loss as a result of the
uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, interest
expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure
guidance to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without
unreasonable effort. Depreciation and amortization expense, which is a
component of the reconciliation between EBITDA and GAAP net loss, is
expected to be between 1.0% and 1.5% of total revenues for both Q2 2017
and FY 2017.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures


As appropriate, we supplement our results of operations determined in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
with certain non-GAAP financial measurements that are used by
management, and which we believe are useful to investors, as
supplemental operational measurements to evaluate our financial
performance. These measurements should not be considered in isolation or
as a substitute for reported GAAP results because they may include or
exclude certain items as compared to similar GAAP-based measurements,
and such measurements may not be comparable to similarly-titled
measurements reported by other companies. Rather, these measurements
should be considered as an additional way of viewing aspects of our
operations that provide a more complete understanding of our business.
We strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial
statements included in publicly filed reports in their entirety and not
rely solely on any one, single financial measurement or communication.


Reconciliations of our non-GAAP measurements to their most directly
comparable GAAP-based financial measurements are included at the end of
this press release.

Adjusted Net Loss to Net Loss and Computation of Adjusted Net Loss
per Share


Adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share are supplemental
measures of operating performance that do not represent and should not
be considered alternatives to net loss and net loss per share, as
determined under GAAP. We believe that adjusted net loss and adjusted
net loss per share supplement GAAP measures and enable us to more
effectively evaluate our performance period-over-period. A
reconciliation of adjusted net loss to net loss, the most directly
comparable GAAP measure, and the computation of adjusted net loss per
share are as follows:

Best Car Buying Experience in my Life
 (0)  (0)


This was without a doubt the easiest and most relaxing way to purchase a pre -owned vehicle. This was my 10th car purchase in my life and I have never been less stressed. My wife questioned me about why I chose Carvana, but once the process was completed, all she did was praise me for choosing them.  Great Service, Great Price, Great Car.  Thank you.

Stress Free Car Buying
 (0)  (0)


CARVANA made car buying a breeze. I started with dealerships, and happened upon CARVANA because of their competitive financing. I got one car, drove it for a few days, and decided it wasn't a good fit for me. I called them up and exchanged the vehicle without issue or hassle. The delivery both times was easy and I now recommend CARVANA to anyone I meet who is shopping for a car... Read More

 Great Customer Service
 (3)  (4)


Was skeptical at first.  But great customer service helped me feel assured that I had nothing to worry about.  Nice smooth transaction,  prompt delivery of my Buick Verano. And a great financing rate. Couldn't be happier with Carvana, would definitely recommend!

Great process!

I needed a new car and did not want to deal with another dealership or sales person. With Carvana I was able to see the car inside and out, get a real list of all the features, and get the history of it, all within a few clicks. Got my car scheduled, test drove, picked it up and kept it. Very refreshing experience and plan to recommend for friends and colleagues.

No more sitting at the dealership for hours

Best experience ever, 5 minutes and I had purchased the exact car I was looking for. Comparable, but older vehicles with higher miles in my area were thousands more. I had my car delivered, and it even came a day early. Eric my driver was great, had the car off loaded and ready to go in minutes.

Best Car Buying Experience Ever!
 (3)  (0)


This was WITHOUT A DOUBT the BEST car buying experience I have ever experienced.  Professional, courteous, helpful and worry free.  The included warranty was an added bonus.  After years of less than stellar car busying experiences this is by far the best.  Every car I buy going forward will unquestionably be through Carvana,

Carvana also provides customers with the ability to generate real-time financing and warranty options that are tailor-made to individuals with all manner of credit.

Recently named Forbes’ 5th Most Promising Company in the U.S., Carvana offers the excitement and culture of a startup with the capitalization and infrastructure of a much more established business.

"Sam was the BEST to work with. He listened to me (not everyone did); he worked with me in a way that worked FOR me.

I would recom
mend Sam without reservation to anyone .I appreciated Sam's thoroughness, his communication and his accessibility. He is a 10 in my books."... Read More

      Beginning with today’s financial report, the Company intends to use its

      as a disclosure method.
    

      “We are excited to announce record revenue in our first earnings report 
      as a newly public company. Our strong performance this quarter reflects 
      a significant increase in retail units, as well as expansion into new 
      markets. During the quarter we made important enhancements to the 
      customer experience through new product development, resulting in 
      ongoing optimization from website through vehicle delivery,” said Ernie 
      Garcia, Carvana founder and CEO. “We continue to see increased consumer 
      adoption of online car buying across our markets, charting a clear path 
      to consistent growth within the $710 billion U.S. used auto market. 
      Carvana’s unique business model includes proprietary technology and 
      assets, like the vending machines, that deliver customer experiences 
      that position us to execute against our aggressive growth plans.”

        Revenue totaled $159.1 million, an increase of 118%
      

        Total gross profit was $9.7 million, an increase of 146%
      

        Total gross profit per unit was $1,169, an increase of $123 per unit
      

        Net loss was $38.4 million, an increase of 122%
      

        EBITDA margin was (21.6%), an improvement from (30.6%) in Q4 2016 and 
        flat versus Q1 2016
      

        GAAP basic and diluted net loss per Class A unit was $0.44, based on 
        103.3 million Class A units outstanding
      

        Adjusted net loss per Class A share, a non-GAAP measure, was $0.28, 
        based on 136.8 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding 
        assuming the exchange of all outstanding LLC Units for shares of Class 
        A common stock and the issuance of 15.0 million shares of Class A 
        common stock pursuant to our initial public offering
      

        We opened 2 new markets, bringing our end-of-quarter total to 23
      


Q2 and Fiscal 2017 Outlook


      We anticipate further unit and revenue growth, as well as total gross 
      profit per unit improvement. For Q2 2017, we expect:
    


        Retail unit sales of 10,000 – 10,500
      

        Total revenue of $193 million - $203 million
      

        Total gross profit per unit of $1,375 – $1,425
      

        EBITDA margin of (18%) - (18.5%)
      


      For fiscal year 2017, we expect:
    


        Retail unit sales of 44,000 – 46,000, an increase from 18,761 in 2016
      

        Revenue of $850 million – $910 million, an increase from $365 million 
        in 2016
      

        Total gross profit per unit of $1,475 - $1,575, an increase from 
        $1,023 in 2016
      

        EBITDA margin of (14%) - (16%), an improvement from (23.2%) in 2016
      

        16 – 18 new market openings, bringing our end-of-year total to 37 – 39
      


      For more information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures, please 
      see the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measurements to their most 
      directly comparable GAAP-based financial measurements included at the 
      end of this press release. Guidance for EBITDA margin excludes 
      depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense. We have not 
      reconciled EBITDA guidance to GAAP net loss as a result of the 
      uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, interest 
      expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure 
      guidance to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without 
      unreasonable effort. Depreciation and amortization expense, which is a 
      component of the reconciliation between EBITDA and GAAP net loss, is 
      expected to be between 1.0% and 1.5% of total revenues for both Q2 2017 
      and FY 2017.

      There is no assurance that any forward-looking statements will 
      materialize. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on 
      forward-looking statements, which reflect expectations only as of this

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures


      As appropriate, we supplement our results of operations determined in 
      accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) 
      with certain non-GAAP financial measurements that are used by 
      management, and which we believe are useful to investors, as 
      supplemental operational measurements to evaluate our financial 
      performance. These measurements should not be considered in isolation or 
      as a substitute for reported GAAP results because they may include or 
      exclude certain items as compared to similar GAAP-based measurements, 
      and such measurements may not be comparable to similarly-titled 
      measurements reported by other companies. Rather, these measurements 
      should be considered as an additional way of viewing aspects of our 
      operations that provide a more complete understanding of our business. 
      We strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial 
      statements included in publicly filed reports in their entirety and not 
      rely solely on any one, single financial measurement or communication.
    

      Reconciliations of our non-GAAP measurements to their most directly 
      comparable GAAP-based financial measurements are included at the end of 
      this press release.

Adjusted Net Loss to Net Loss and Computation of Adjusted Net Loss 
      per Share


      Adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share are supplemental 
      measures of operating performance that do not represent and should not 
      be considered alternatives to net loss and net loss per share, as 
      determined under GAAP. We believe that adjusted net loss and adjusted 
      net loss per share supplement GAAP measures and enable us to more 
      effectively evaluate our performance period-over-period. A 
      reconciliation of adjusted net loss to net loss, the most directly 
      comparable GAAP measure, and the computation of adjusted net loss per 
      share are as follows:

Net Loss to EBITDA


      EBITDA is a non-GAAP supplemental measure of operating performance that 
      does not represent and should not be considered an alternative to net 
      loss or cash flow from operations, as determined by GAAP. EBITDA is 
      defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense and 
      depreciation and amortization expense. We use EBITDA to measure the 
      operating performance of our business, excluding specifically identified 
      items that we do not believe directly reflect our core operations and 
      may not be indicative of our recurring operations. EBITDA may not be 
      comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies due 
      to potential differences in methods of calculations. A reconciliation of 
      EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is as 
      follows:

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
