Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss.
Bonds are subject to interest rate risks. Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise.
The price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a company's financial condition, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Equity securities are subject to "stock market risk" meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time.
International investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility. Changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can raise or lower returns. Also, some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the United States and other nations. Investments in emerging markets can be more volatile.
Real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry, sector or geographical sector. Real estate investments may be subject to risks including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, risks related to general and economic conditions, changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower.
Investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities, particularly if the instruments involve leverage. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments. Use of leveraged commodity-linked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but, at the same time, creates the possibility for greater loss. 
Derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment. The use of derivatives may not be successful, resulting in investment losses, and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns.
There is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investor's exposure to domestic stock market movements, capitalization, sector swings or other risk factors. Investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates. Short selling involves certain risks, including additional costs associated with covering short positions and a possibility of unlimited loss on certain short sale positions.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its affiliates do not provide tax advice. Accordingly, any discussion of U.S. tax matters contained herein (including any attachments) is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, in connection with the promotion, marketing or recommendation by anyone unaffiliated with JPMorgan Chase & Co. of any of the matters addressed herein or for the purpose of avoiding U.S. tax-related penalties.

The team is global, with senior CIO Team members based in New York, London, Geneva, Hong Kong and Singapore. Strategy and Portfolio Construction for Latin America are based in New York.

Previously, Richard held the title of Chief Investment Officer for the Global Access Portfolios, where he and his team managed in excess of $16 billion in client assets across 35 countries.

Richard brings over 20 years of experience in portfolio management and international capital markets to the firm. Prior to his roles at J.P. Morgan Private Bank, Richard held the title of Managing Director, Head of Emerging Markets Investments and Senior Portfolio Manager at Offitbank, a New York–based wealth management boutique, where he managed peak assets in excess of $1 billion in both domestic and offshore portfolios, including the firm’s flagship emerging markets mutual fund.

Morgan’s Investment Banking division in New York in the emerging markets securities business. He previously spent six years with Citicorp, first as a banker in Mexico, and then in the firm’s international corporate finance division in New York.

Richard’s commentaries have appeared in the Financial Times, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and Reuters. He is a frequent guest speaker on CNBC and the Fox Business Network, and has also appeared on CNN, Bloomberg News and Barron’s, as well as at various industry conferences.

Wealth Planning
Your Vision, Our ExperienceDecisions made at every stage of your life can have long-lasting implications. We can help you evaluate your choices, as well as provide guidance to grow and preserve your wealth for all you envision now and in the future. 




				Thinking Through Essential Questions






					We have worked with countless individuals and families for over 200 years. This experience has taught us that while each person is unique, there are common goals and concerns.

					 



					We can help you think through these essential questions:



							Will I have enough to continue enjoying my lifestyle?



							What do I need to do to provide for my family and future generations?



							How can I best establish a philanthropic legacy?






Wealth Insights


 
 
	Partnering with your other professional advisors, we help implement strategies to preserve your wealth—so you can enjoy your lifestyle, provide for your family and support the causes most important to you. 
	Specifically, we can help you:


		Analyze projected outcomes to inform your decisions

		Evaluate risks to your wealth plan, including your spending rate, who you name as trustees and how you hold your assets

		Evaluate how to take advantage of your concentrated positions

		Plan for the succession and sale of your businesses

		Develop effective charitable-giving strategies

		Help execute your plan by serving as fiduciary



Protecting Your Legacy
	For over 200 years, wealthy individuals and their families have trusted J.P. Morgan to act as their trustee, co-trustee, agent or executor — ensuring their legacies are carried out as they intended.


	Trusts not only help transfer your wealth to family or charities according to your wishes, but also guide your beneficiaries as they manage and invest what they inherit. Our Trust Officers are available to work with you and your other professional advisors to evaluate your situation and deliver a strategy tailored to your unique needs. By serving as executor, we are prepared to assume the many responsibilities required in settling and managing complex estates.

Credit
Integrating a Borrowing Strategy into Your Financial Plans
	A well-thought-out credit strategy can help you accomplish wide-ranging financial objectives, both today and well into the future.

	Your J.P. Morgan team can help you evaluate both sides of your personal balance sheet to ensure that your assets and liabilities are working well together.





				Enhancing Long-Term Plans






					A well-crafted credit strategy can be an effective complement to your long-range plans. Borrowed capital may also help protect or enhance a long-term investment strategy.

					 



					Credit strategies can allow you to:



							Transfer wealth to future generations or charitable organizations, according to your wishes



							Take advantage of tax efficiencies to help preserve and grow your wealth over time



							Diversify a concentrated stock position to lower portfolio risk without selling assets



							Add leverage to investments to potentially enhance future returns







Gaining a Tactical Advantage


 
 
	Having ready access to credit can help you optimize day-to-day cash flow and avoid selling assets that may appreciate in value or offer more favorable capital gains treatment at a future date.
 
	Having a line of credit in place, you can:


		Take advantage of unexpected opportunities as well as planned investments

		Meet tax obligations and finance large purchases or acquisitions

		Preserve cash for emergencies or other purposes

		Buy a home or vacation property








				Creating Financial Flexibility






					Often, the best credit strategy is one that you put in place ahead of when you may need the funds. In other instances, we can customize a loan to your needs.

					 



					The Capital Advisor on your J.P. Morgan team can help you decide among a range of options:



							Lines of credit secured by marketable securities, including concentrated or restricted stock



							Jumbo mortgages for U.S. properties tailored to address your specific situation, including loans to trusts, LLCs and other special entities



							Structured credit solutions to finance private aircrafts, fine art, life insurance premiums or other illiquid assets

Information about your Investments and Potential Conflicts of Interest

						Conflicts of interest will arise whenever JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or any of its affiliates (together, “J.P. Morgan”) have an actual or perceived economic or other incentive in its management of our clients’ portfolios to act in a way that benefits J.P. Morgan. Conflicts will result, for example (to the extent the following activities are permitted in your account): (1) when J.P. Morgan invests in an investment product, such as a mutual fund, structured product, separately managed account or hedge fund issued or managed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or an affiliate, such as J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc.; (2) when a J.P. Morgan entity obtains services, including trade execution and trade clearing, from an affiliate; (3) when J.P. Morgan receives payment as a result of purchasing an investment product for a client’s account; or (4) when J.P. Morgan receives payment for providing services (including shareholder servicing, recordkeeping or custody) with respect to investment products purchased for a client’s portfolio. Other conflicts will result because of relationships that J.P. Morgan has with other clients or when J.P. Morgan acts for its own account.

						Investment strategies are selected from both J.P. Morgan and third-party asset managers and are subject to a review process by our manager research teams. From this pool of strategies, our portfolio construction teams select those strategies we believe fit our asset allocation goals and forward looking views in order to meet the portfolio's investment objective.

						As a general matter, we prefer J.P. Morgan managed strategies. We expect the proportion of J.P. Morgan managed strategies will be high (in fact, up to I00 percent) in strategies such as, for example, cash and high-quality fixed income, subject to applicable law and any account-specific considerations.

						While our internally managed strategies generally align well with our forward looking views, and we are familiar with the investment processes as well as the risk and compliance philosophy of the firm, it is important to note that J.P. Morgan receives more overall fees when internally managed strategies are included. We offer the option of choosing to exclude J.P. Morgan managed strategies (other than cash and liquidity products) in certain portfolios.

Information about your Investments and Potential Conflicts of Interest
					
Conflicts of interest will arise whenever JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or any of its affiliates (together, “J.P. Morgan”) have an actual or perceived economic or other incentive in its management of our clients’ portfolios to act in a way that benefits J.P. Morgan. Conflicts will result, for example (to the extent the following activities are permitted in your account): (1) when J.P. Morgan invests in an investment product, such as a mutual fund, structured product, separately managed account or hedge fund issued or managed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or an affiliate, such as J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc.; (2) when a J.P. Morgan entity obtains services, including trade execution and trade clearing, from an affiliate; (3) when J.P. Morgan receives payment as a result of purchasing an investment product for a client’s account; or (4) when J.P. Morgan receives payment for providing services (including shareholder servicing, recordkeeping or custody) with respect to investment products purchased for a client’s portfolio. Other conflicts will result because of relationships that J.P. Morgan has with other clients or when J.P. Morgan acts for its own account.
 
Investment strategies are selected from both J.P. Morgan and third-party asset managers and are subject to a review process by our manager research teams. From this pool of strategies, our portfolio construction teams select those strategies we believe fit our asset allocation goals and forward looking views in order to meet the portfolio's investment objective.
 
As a general matter, we prefer J.P. Morgan managed strategies. We expect the proportion of J.P. Morgan managed strategies will be high (in fact, up to I00 percent) in strategies such as, for example, cash and high-quality fixed income, subject to applicable law and any account-specific considerations.
 
While our internally managed strategies generally align well with our forward looking views, and we are familiar with the investment processes as well as the risk and compliance philosophy of the firm, it is important to note that J.P. Morgan receives more overall fees when internally managed strategies are included. We offer the option of choosing to exclude J.P. Morgan managed strategies (other than cash and liquidity products) in certain portfolios.

	“I’m just a kid from the Bronx who fell in love with making artwork,” says Glenn Goldberg, whose luminous works of delicate, almost kaleidoscopic color belie both the place of his upbringing and his physical appearance. At over six feet tall, he says, “I was always a very quiet, sensitive kid. So what I look like is not necessarily indicative of what goes on inside.”



   






	Filled with images of birds, flowers, water and other natural objects, Mr. Goldberg’s intricate designs allow him, he says, “to bring out something that nothing else could. There’s intimacy, there’s love. Back in the postmodern day, it wasn’t popular to be sincere or to paint something that could be good for us. That has always been my intention—to make quiet, intimate paintings.”


Second Tapestry, 2015, by Glenn Goldberg.  Acrylic, gesso, ink and pencil on canvas, 48 x 36 inches (121.9 x 91.4 cm). JPMorgan Chase Art Collection. © Glenn Goldberg, courtesy of the artist.

	Paintings that are built out

	Born 1953 in the Bronx, New York, Mr. Goldberg grew up not with art but with music. “Art was essentially nonexistent in my household, but music was actually huge.” His father introduced him to such jazz greats as Ella Fitzgerald, Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman and Sara Vaughan.

	To this early jazz influence, Mr. Goldberg received training in contemporary art that emphasized structure. “I was trained in terms of the Bauhaus idea that you have to build a painting. So I am interested in this combination of structure and improvisation.”

	Mr. Goldberg’s paintings are literally “built out.” Working at a table in his studio in Brooklyn, New York, he creates his paintings from back to front. “They are simply additive, like life itself.  Just as we move through our lives, things might get quieted—we might forget or have resolved certain things,” he says. “They’re akin to how life moves forward.”

	A hybrid of representative and abstract forms, Mr. Goldberg’s artwork often starts with a pattern reminiscent of textiles. He will then fill in an area or little compartment with an image that may be overt or “have some kind of implication, but we couldn’t be sure what they are.”

	And he will repeat a pattern, exploring its variations. “It feels quite natural to do another one or to do a different one, and the questions are always, ‘What’s possible? What could I do?’”


There, 2012, by Glenn Goldberg. Oil on canvas, 40 x 72 inches (101.6 x 182.9 cm). JPMorgan Chase Art Collection. © Glenn Goldberg, courtesy of the artist.

	The greatest gift

	Mr. Goldberg, who studied at the New York Studio School and received his M.F.A. from Queens College, says he was very fortunate to have had great teachers. One in particular gave him a message that meant a great deal to him and that he, in turn, hopes to pass along to the young artists he teaches: “You’re doing fine. Keep going.”

	“I always remember that,” he says. “That she thought I could be an artist, in a true deeper sense of what that entails.”

	Mr. Goldberg has taught for nearly 30 years, working at times with underprivileged students. To him, the greatest gift he can give is to pass on the encouragement he received.

	“Art is always up for discourse about what’s better, worse—it’s never something that can be proven. I think it’s natural for a young artist to be a little daunted by the immeasurability of it, so I think we do need to fortify each other all the way through. There are days where one might question this at its core. When you’re young, it’s an enormous thing to think you want to take it on.”

	Closer to silence

	Over the years, Mr. Goldberg’s art has reflected an exploration of color, particularly the tension between color’s vibrancy and his wanting it to “be quiet at the same time.”

	“Color is very forceful. It has a strong disposition. I just got to a point where I wanted to remove it and focus on something quieter,” he says of a series of grey paintings he recently created. “I’m back into color again, but I’d like to think the grey paintings have made my work more intimate and a bit quieter. I’m always wanting them to live closer to silence than volume. It’s important to me.”

	Mr. Goldberg says he hopes his art “can live without words—that to be around it could be some form of a respite or quietness; a positive experience, but not void of intellect and sophistication.  It’s somewhat idealistic, but I love idealism because it brings us toward something that’s better.”

Glenn Goldberg has received grants from the Edward Albee Foundation, the Guggenheim Fellowship, and the National Endowment for the Arts. His work is held in numerous collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Academy of Arts and Letters, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, as well as in the JPMorgan Chase Art Collection.

J.P. Morgan & Co. is a commercial and investment banking institution based in the United States founded by John Pierpont Morgan and commonly known as the "House of Morgan" or simply "Morgan". The firm is a predecessor of three of the largest banking institutions in the United States and globally, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Deutsche Bank (via Morgan, Grenfell & Co.), along with a hand in the formation of Drexel Burnham Lambert.
In 2000, J.P. Morgan & Co. merged with Chase Manhattan Bank to form JPMorgan Chase & Co., one of the largest global banking institutions. Today, the "J.P. Morgan" brand is used to market certain JPMorgan Chase wholesale businesses, including investment banking, commercial banking and asset management. The J.P. Morgan branding was revamped in 2008 to return to its more traditional appearance after several years of depicting the "Chase" symbol to the right of a condensed and modernized "JPMorgan".
Between 1959 and 1989, J.P. Morgan operated as the Morgan Guaranty Trust, following its merger with the Guaranty Trust Company of New York.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]




23 Wall Street. Former headquarters of J.P. Morgan & Co.


The origins of the firm date back to 1854 when Junius S. Morgan joined George Peabody & Co. (which became Peabody, Morgan & Co.), a London-based banking business headed by George Peabody. Junius took control of the firm, changing its name to J.S. Morgan & Co. in 1864 on Peabody's retirement. Junius' son, J. Pierpont Morgan, first apprenticed at Duncan, Sherman and Company in the New York City, then founded his own firm with a cousin, J. Pierpont Morgan & Company, in 1864.[1] J. Pierpont Morgan & Company traded in government bonds and foreign exchange. It also acted as an agent for Peabody’s. Junius, however, considered some of Pierpont’s ventures to be highly speculative. So, Pierpont took on Charles H. Dabney, a connection established when he was sent to the Azores as a child, as a senior partner and the firm was known first as Dabney, Morgan and Company (beginning in 1864), then "Drexel, Morgan & Co." (in 1871). In these firms, Pierpont used his Peabody connection to bring British financial capital together with rapidly growing U.S. industrial firms, such as railroads, who needed financial capital.[2] The Drexel of Drexel, Morgan & Co. was Philadelphia banker Anthony J. Drexel, founder of what is now Drexel University.[3]
The House of Morgan[edit]
On Junius’ death in 1890, Pierpont Morgan took his place at J.S. Morgan and Company. After Drexel’s death, Drexel, Morgan reorganized in 1895 and became J.P. Morgan and Company, eventually becoming one of the most powerful banking companies in the world and helping to transform the United States from an economic novice into the strongest industrial power in the world at that time.[2] It financed the formation of the United States Steel Corporation, which took over the business of Andrew Carnegie and others and was the world's first billion-dollar corporation. In 1895, it supplied the United States government with $62 million in gold to float a bond issue and restore the treasury surplus of $100 million. In 1892, the company began to finance the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and led it through a series of acquisitions that made it the dominant railroad transporter in New England.




The Wall Street bombing September 16, 1920: a bomb exploded in front of the headquarters of J.P. Morgan Inc. at 23 Wall Street, injuring 400 and killing 38 people.


Built in 1914, 23 Wall Street was known as "The Corner" and "The House of Morgan," and for decades the bank's headquarters was the most important address in American finance. At noon, on September 16, 1920, an anarchist bomb exploded in front of the bank, killing 38 and injuring 400. Shortly before the bomb went off, an unknown person placed a warning note in a mailbox at the corner of Cedar Street and Broadway. The warning read: "Remember we will not tolerate any longer. Free the political prisoners or it will be sure death for all of you. American Anarchists Fighters." While theories abound about who was behind the Wall Street bombing and why they did it, after twenty years of investigation the FBI rendered the file inactive in 1940 without ever finding the perpetrators.
Finances Allied bonds during World War I[edit]
In August 1914, Henry P. Davison, a Morgan partner, traveled to London and made a deal with the Bank of England to make J.P. Morgan & Co. the sole underwriter of war bonds for Great Britain and France. The Bank of England became a fiscal agent of J.P. Morgan & Co., and vice versa. Over the course of the war, J.P. Morgan loaned about $1.5 billion (approximately $20.92 billion in today's dollars) to the Allies to fight against the Germans.[4]:63 The company also invested in the suppliers of war equipment to Britain and France, thus profiting from the financing and purchasing activities of the two European governments.
During the early 1920s, J.P. Morgan & Co. was active in promoting banks in the southern hemisphere, including the Bank of Central and South America.
Glass–Steagall and Morgan Stanley[edit]
In 1933, the provisions of the Glass–Steagall Act forced J.P. Morgan & Co. to separate its investment banking from its commercial banking operations. J.P. Morgan & Co. chose to operate as a commercial bank, because after the stock market crash of 1929, investment banking was in some disrepute and commercial lending was perceived to be more the profitable and prestigious business. Additionally, many within J.P. Morgan believed that a change in the political climate would allow the company to resume its securities businesses but that it would be nearly impossible to reconstitute the bank if it were disassembled.
In 1935, after being barred from securities business for over a year, the heads of J.P. Morgan made the decision to spin off its investment banking operations. Two J.P. Morgan partners, Henry S. Morgan (son of Jack Morgan and grandson of J. Pierpont Morgan) and Harold Stanley, founded Morgan Stanley on September 16, 1935 with $6.6 million of nonvoting preferred stock from J.P. Morgan partners. At the beginning, Morgan Stanley's headquarters were at 2 Wall Street, just down the street from J.P. Morgan, and Morgan Stanley bankers routinely used 23 Wall Street when closing transactions.

Morgan Guaranty Trust[edit]
In the years following the spin-off of Morgan Stanley, the securities business proved robust, while the parent firm, which incorporated in 1940,[5] was a little sleepy. By the 1950s J.P. Morgan was only a mid-size bank. In order to bolster its position, in 1959, J.P. Morgan merged with the Guaranty Trust Company of New York to form the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. The two banks already had numerous relationships between them and had complementary characteristics as J.P. Morgan brought a prestigious name and high quality clients and bankers while Guaranty Trust brought a significant amount of capital. Although Guaranty Trust was nearly four times the size of J.P. Morgan at the time of the merger in 1959, J.P. Morgan was considered the buyer and nominal survivor and former J.P. Morgan employees were the primary managers of the merged company.
Return of J.P. Morgan & Co.[edit]




J.P. Morgan & Co. logo prior to its merger with Chase Manhattan Bank in 2000


Ten years after the merger, Morgan Guaranty established a bank holding company called J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated, but continued to operate as Morgan Guaranty through the 1980s before beginning to migrate back to use of the J.P. Morgan brand. In 1988, the company once again began operating exclusively as J.P. Morgan & Co.
Also in the 1980s, J.P. Morgan along with other commercial banks pushed the envelope of product offerings toward investment banking, beginning with the issuance of commercial paper. In 1989, the Federal Reserve permitted J.P. Morgan to be the first commercial bank to underwrite a corporate debt offering.[6] In the 1990s, J.P. Morgan moved quickly to rebuild its investment banking operations and by the late 1990s would emerge as a top-five player in securities underwriting.
JPMorgan Chase[edit]




JPMorgan logo prior to its 2008 rebranding


By the late 1990s, J.P. Morgan had emerged as a large but not dominant commercial and investment banking franchise with an attractive brand name and a strong presence in debt and equity securities underwriting. Beginning in 1998, J.P. Morgan openly discussed the possibility of a merger, and speculation of a pairing with banks including Goldman Sachs, Chase Manhattan Bank, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank AG was prevalent.[7] Chase Manhattan had emerged as one of the largest and fastest growing commercial banks in the United States through a series of mergers over the previous decade. In 2000 Chase, which was looking for yet another transformational merger to improve its position in investment banking, merged with J.P. Morgan to form JPMorgan Chase & Co.[8][9] The combined JPMorgan Chase would become one of the largest banks both in the United States and globally offering a full complement of investment banking, commercial banking, retail banking, asset management, private banking and private equity businesses.

J.P. Morgan & Co. is a commercial and investment banking institution based in the United States founded by John Pierpont Morgan and commonly known as the "House of Morgan" or simply "Morgan". The firm is a predecessor of three of the largest banking institutions in the United States and globally, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Deutsche Bank (via Morgan, Grenfell & Co.), along with a hand in the formation of Drexel Burnham Lambert.
In 2000, J.P. Morgan & Co. merged with Chase Manhattan Bank to form JPMorgan Chase & Co., one of the largest global banking institutions. Today, the "J.P. Morgan" brand is used to market certain JPMorgan Chase wholesale businesses, including investment banking, commercial banking and asset management. The J.P. Morgan branding was revamped in 2008 to return to its more traditional appearance after several years of depicting the "Chase" symbol to the right of a condensed and modernized "JPMorgan".
Between 1959 and 1989, J.P. Morgan operated as the Morgan Guaranty Trust, following its merger with the Guaranty Trust Company of New York.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]




23 Wall Street. Former headquarters of J.P. Morgan & Co.


The origins of the firm date back to 1854 when Junius S. Morgan joined George Peabody & Co. (which became Peabody, Morgan & Co.), a London-based banking business headed by George Peabody. Junius took control of the firm, changing its name to J.S. Morgan & Co. in 1864 on Peabody's retirement. Junius' son, J. Pierpont Morgan, first apprenticed at Duncan, Sherman and Company in the New York City, then founded his own firm with a cousin, J. Pierpont Morgan & Company, in 1864.[1] J. Pierpont Morgan & Company traded in government bonds and foreign exchange. It also acted as an agent for Peabody’s. Junius, however, considered some of Pierpont’s ventures to be highly speculative. So, Pierpont took on Charles H. Dabney, a connection established when he was sent to the Azores as a child, as a senior partner and the firm was known first as Dabney, Morgan and Company (beginning in 1864), then "Drexel, Morgan & Co." (in 1871). In these firms, Pierpont used his Peabody connection to bring British financial capital together with rapidly growing U.S. industrial firms, such as railroads, who needed financial capital.[2] The Drexel of Drexel, Morgan & Co. was Philadelphia banker Anthony J. Drexel, founder of what is now Drexel University.[3]
The House of Morgan[edit]
On Junius’ death in 1890, Pierpont Morgan took his place at J.S. Morgan and Company. After Drexel’s death, Drexel, Morgan reorganized in 1895 and became J.P. Morgan and Company, eventually becoming one of the most powerful banking companies in the world and helping to transform the United States from an economic novice into the strongest industrial power in the world at that time.[2] It financed the formation of the United States Steel Corporation, which took over the business of Andrew Carnegie and others and was the world's first billion-dollar corporation. In 1895, it supplied the United States government with $62 million in gold to float a bond issue and restore the treasury surplus of $100 million. In 1892, the company began to finance the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and led it through a series of acquisitions that made it the dominant railroad transporter in New England.




The Wall Street bombing September 16, 1920: a bomb exploded in front of the headquarters of J.P. Morgan Inc. at 23 Wall Street, injuring 400 and killing 38 people.


Built in 1914, 23 Wall Street was known as "The Corner" and "The House of Morgan," and for decades the bank's headquarters was the most important address in American finance. At noon, on September 16, 1920, an anarchist bomb exploded in front of the bank, killing 38 and injuring 400. Shortly before the bomb went off, an unknown person placed a warning note in a mailbox at the corner of Cedar Street and Broadway. The warning read: "Remember we will not tolerate any longer. Free the political prisoners or it will be sure death for all of you. American Anarchists Fighters." While theories abound about who was behind the Wall Street bombing and why they did it, after twenty years of investigation the FBI rendered the file inactive in 1940 without ever finding the perpetrators.
Finances Allied bonds during World War I[edit]
In August 1914, Henry P. Davison, a Morgan partner, traveled to London and made a deal with the Bank of England to make J.P. Morgan & Co. the sole underwriter of war bonds for Great Britain and France. The Bank of England became a fiscal agent of J.P. Morgan & Co., and vice versa. Over the course of the war, J.P. Morgan loaned about $1.5 billion (approximately $20.92 billion in today's dollars) to the Allies to fight against the Germans.[4]:63 The company also invested in the suppliers of war equipment to Britain and France, thus profiting from the financing and purchasing activities of the two European governments.
During the early 1920s, J.P. Morgan & Co. was active in promoting banks in the southern hemisphere, including the Bank of Central and South America.
Glass–Steagall and Morgan Stanley[edit]
In 1933, the provisions of the Glass–Steagall Act forced J.P. Morgan & Co. to separate its investment banking from its commercial banking operations. J.P. Morgan & Co. chose to operate as a commercial bank, because after the stock market crash of 1929, investment banking was in some disrepute and commercial lending was perceived to be more the profitable and prestigious business. Additionally, many within J.P. Morgan believed that a change in the political climate would allow the company to resume its securities businesses but that it would be nearly impossible to reconstitute the bank if it were disassembled.
In 1935, after being barred from securities business for over a year, the heads of J.P. Morgan made the decision to spin off its investment banking operations. Two J.P. Morgan partners, Henry S. Morgan (son of Jack Morgan and grandson of J. Pierpont Morgan) and Harold Stanley, founded Morgan Stanley on September 16, 1935 with $6.6 million of nonvoting preferred stock from J.P. Morgan partners. At the beginning, Morgan Stanley's headquarters were at 2 Wall Street, just down the street from J.P. Morgan, and Morgan Stanley bankers routinely used 23 Wall Street when closing transactions.

Morgan Guaranty Trust[edit]
In the years following the spin-off of Morgan Stanley, the securities business proved robust, while the parent firm, which incorporated in 1940,[5] was a little sleepy. By the 1950s J.P. Morgan was only a mid-size bank. In order to bolster its position, in 1959, J.P. Morgan merged with the Guaranty Trust Company of New York to form the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. The two banks already had numerous relationships between them and had complementary characteristics as J.P. Morgan brought a prestigious name and high quality clients and bankers while Guaranty Trust brought a significant amount of capital. Although Guaranty Trust was nearly four times the size of J.P. Morgan at the time of the merger in 1959, J.P. Morgan was considered the buyer and nominal survivor and former J.P. Morgan employees were the primary managers of the merged company.
Return of J.P. Morgan & Co.[edit]

Ten years after the merger, Morgan Guaranty established a bank holding company called J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated, but continued to operate as Morgan Guaranty through the 1980s before beginning to migrate back to use of the J.P. Morgan brand. In 1988, the company once again began operating exclusively as J.P. Morgan & Co.
Also in the 1980s, J.P. Morgan along with other commercial banks pushed the envelope of product offerings toward investment banking, beginning with the issuance of commercial paper. In 1989, the Federal Reserve permitted J.P. Morgan to be the first commercial bank to underwrite a corporate debt offering.[6] In the 1990s, J.P. Morgan moved quickly to rebuild its investment banking operations and by the late 1990s would emerge as a top-five player in securities underwriting.
JPMorgan Chase[edit]




JPMorgan logo prior to its 2008 rebranding


By the late 1990s, J.P. Morgan had emerged as a large but not dominant commercial and investment banking franchise with an attractive brand name and a strong presence in debt and equity securities underwriting. Beginning in 1998, J.P. Morgan openly discussed the possibility of a merger, and speculation of a pairing with banks including Goldman Sachs, Chase Manhattan Bank, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank AG was prevalent.[7] Chase Manhattan had emerged as one of the largest and fastest growing commercial banks in the United States through a series of mergers over the previous decade. In 2000 Chase, which was looking for yet another transformational merger to improve its position in investment banking, merged with J.P. Morgan to form JPMorgan Chase & Co.[8][9] The combined JPMorgan Chase would become one of the largest banks both in the United States and globally offering a full complement of investment banking, commercial banking, retail banking, asset management, private banking and private equity businesses.

Early history[edit]




23 Wall Street. Former headquarters of J.P. Morgan & Co.


The origins of the firm date back to 1854 when Junius S. Morgan joined George Peabody & Co. (which became Peabody, Morgan & Co.), a London-based banking business headed by George Peabody. Junius took control of the firm, changing its name to J.S. Morgan & Co. in 1864 on Peabody's retirement. Junius' son, J. Pierpont Morgan, first apprenticed at Duncan, Sherman and Company in the New York City, then founded his own firm with a cousin, J. Pierpont Morgan & Company, in 1864.[1] J.

So, Pierpont took on Charles H. Dabney, a connection established when he was sent to the Azores as a child, as a senior partner and the firm was known first as Dabney, Morgan and Company (beginning in 1864), then "Drexel, Morgan & Co." (in 1871). In these firms, Pierpont used his Peabody connection to bring British financial capital together with rapidly growing U.S. industrial firms, such as railroads, who needed financial capital.[2] The Drexel of Drexel, Morgan & Co. was Philadelphia banker Anthony J. Drexel, founder of what is now Drexel University.[3]
The House of Morgan[edit]
On Junius’ death in 1890, Pierpont Morgan took his place at J.S. Morgan and Company. After Drexel’s death, Drexel, Morgan reorganized in 1895 and became J.P. Morgan and Company, eventually becoming one of the most powerful banking companies in the world and helping to transform the United States from an economic novice into the strongest industrial power in the world at that time.[2] It financed the formation of the United States Steel Corporation, which took over the business of Andrew Carnegie and others and was the world's first billion-dollar corporation. In 1895, it supplied the United States government with $62 million in gold to float a bond issue and restore the treasury surplus of $100 million. In 1892, the company began to finance the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and led it through a series of acquisitions that made it the dominant railroad transporter in New England.

While theories abound about who was behind the Wall Street bombing and why they did it, after twenty years of investigation the FBI rendered the file inactive in 1940 without ever finding the perpetrators.
Finances Allied bonds during World War I[edit]
In August 1914, Henry P. Davison, a Morgan partner, traveled to London and made a deal with the Bank of England to make J.P. Morgan & Co. the sole underwriter of war bonds for Great Britain and France. The Bank of England became a fiscal agent of J.P. Morgan & Co., and vice versa. Over the course of the war, J.P.

Ten years after the merger, Morgan Guaranty established a bank holding company called J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated, but continued to operate as Morgan Guaranty through the 1980s before beginning to migrate back to use of the J.P. Morgan brand. In 1988, the company once again began operating exclusively as J.P. Morgan & Co.
Also in the 1980s, J.P. Morgan along with other commercial banks pushed the envelope of product offerings toward investment banking, beginning with the issuance of commercial paper. In 1989, the Federal Reserve permitted J.P. Morgan to be the first commercial bank to underwrite a corporate debt offering.[6] In the 1990s, J.P. Morgan moved quickly to rebuild its investment banking operations and by the late 1990s would emerge as a top-five player in securities underwriting.
JPMorgan Chase[edit]

By the late 1990s, J.P. Morgan had emerged as a large but not dominant commercial and investment banking franchise with an attractive brand name and a strong presence in debt and equity securities underwriting. Beginning in 1998, J.P. Morgan openly discussed the possibility of a merger, and speculation of a pairing with banks including Goldman Sachs, Chase Manhattan Bank, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank AG was prevalent.[7] Chase Manhattan had emerged as one of the largest and fastest growing commercial banks in the United States through a series of mergers over the previous decade. In 2000 Chase, which was looking for yet another transformational merger to improve its position in investment banking, merged with J.P. Morgan to form JPMorgan Chase & Co.[8][9] The combined JPMorgan Chase would become one of the largest banks both in the United States and globally offering a full complement of investment banking, commercial banking, retail banking, asset management, private banking and private equity businesses.

J.P. Morgan & Co. is a commercial and investment banking institution based in the United States founded by John Pierpont Morgan and commonly known as the "House of Morgan" or simply "Morgan". The firm is a predecessor of three of the largest banking institutions in the United States and globally, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Deutsche Bank (via Morgan, Grenfell & Co.), along with a hand in the formation of Drexel Burnham Lambert.
In 2000, J.P. Morgan & Co. merged with Chase Manhattan Bank to form JPMorgan Chase & Co., one of the largest global banking institutions. Today, the "J.P. Morgan" brand is used to market certain JPMorgan Chase wholesale businesses, including investment banking, commercial banking and asset management. The J.P. Morgan branding was revamped in 2008 to return to its more traditional appearance after several years of depicting the "Chase" symbol to the right of a condensed and modernized "JPMorgan".
Between 1959 and 1989, J.P. Morgan operated as the Morgan Guaranty Trust, following its merger with the Guaranty Trust Company of New York.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]




23 Wall Street. Former headquarters of J.P. Morgan & Co.


The origins of the firm date back to 1854 when Junius S. Morgan joined George Peabody & Co. (which became Peabody, Morgan & Co.), a London-based banking business headed by George Peabody. Junius took control of the firm, changing its name to J.S. Morgan & Co. in 1864 on Peabody's retirement. Junius' son, J. Pierpont Morgan, first apprenticed at Duncan, Sherman and Company in the New York City, then founded his own firm with a cousin, J. Pierpont Morgan & Company, in 1864.[1] J. Pierpont Morgan & Company traded in government bonds and foreign exchange. It also acted as an agent for Peabody’s. Junius, however, considered some of Pierpont’s ventures to be highly speculative. So, Pierpont took on Charles H. Dabney, a connection established when he was sent to the Azores as a child, as a senior partner and the firm was known first as Dabney, Morgan and Company (beginning in 1864), then "Drexel, Morgan & Co." (in 1871). In these firms, Pierpont used his Peabody connection to bring British financial capital together with rapidly growing U.S. industrial firms, such as railroads, who needed financial capital.[2] The Drexel of Drexel, Morgan & Co. was Philadelphia banker Anthony J. Drexel, founder of what is now Drexel University.[3]
The House of Morgan[edit]
On Junius’ death in 1890, Pierpont Morgan took his place at J.S. Morgan and Company. After Drexel’s death, Drexel, Morgan reorganized in 1895 and became J.P. Morgan and Company, eventually becoming one of the most powerful banking companies in the world and helping to transform the United States from an economic novice into the strongest industrial power in the world at that time.[2] It financed the formation of the United States Steel Corporation, which took over the business of Andrew Carnegie and others and was the world's first billion-dollar corporation. In 1895, it supplied the United States government with $62 million in gold to float a bond issue and restore the treasury surplus of $100 million. In 1892, the company began to finance the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and led it through a series of acquisitions that made it the dominant railroad transporter in New England.




The Wall Street bombing September 16, 1920: a bomb exploded in front of the headquarters of J.P. Morgan Inc. at 23 Wall Street, injuring 400 and killing 38 people.


Built in 1914, 23 Wall Street was known as "The Corner" and "The House of Morgan," and for decades the bank's headquarters was the most important address in American finance. At noon, on September 16, 1920, an anarchist bomb exploded in front of the bank, killing 38 and injuring 400. Shortly before the bomb went off, an unknown person placed a warning note in a mailbox at the corner of Cedar Street and Broadway. The warning read: "Remember we will not tolerate any longer. Free the political prisoners or it will be sure death for all of you. American Anarchists Fighters." While theories abound about who was behind the Wall Street bombing and why they did it, after twenty years of investigation the FBI rendered the file inactive in 1940 without ever finding the perpetrators.
Finances Allied bonds during World War I[edit]
In August 1914, Henry P. Davison, a Morgan partner, traveled to London and made a deal with the Bank of England to make J.P. Morgan & Co. the sole underwriter of war bonds for Great Britain and France. The Bank of England became a fiscal agent of J.P. Morgan & Co., and vice versa. Over the course of the war, J.P. Morgan loaned about $1.5 billion (approximately $20.92 billion in today's dollars) to the Allies to fight against the Germans.[4]:63 The company also invested in the suppliers of war equipment to Britain and France, thus profiting from the financing and purchasing activities of the two European governments.
During the early 1920s, J.P. Morgan & Co. was active in promoting banks in the southern hemisphere, including the Bank of Central and South America.
Glass–Steagall and Morgan Stanley[edit]
In 1933, the provisions of the Glass–Steagall Act forced J.P. Morgan & Co. to separate its investment banking from its commercial banking operations. J.P. Morgan & Co. chose to operate as a commercial bank, because after the stock market crash of 1929, investment banking was in some disrepute and commercial lending was perceived to be more the profitable and prestigious business. Additionally, many within J.P. Morgan believed that a change in the political climate would allow the company to resume its securities businesses but that it would be nearly impossible to reconstitute the bank if it were disassembled.
In 1935, after being barred from securities business for over a year, the heads of J.P. Morgan made the decision to spin off its investment banking operations. Two J.P. Morgan partners, Henry S. Morgan (son of Jack Morgan and grandson of J. Pierpont Morgan) and Harold Stanley, founded Morgan Stanley on September 16, 1935 with $6.6 million of nonvoting preferred stock from J.P. Morgan partners. At the beginning, Morgan Stanley's headquarters were at 2 Wall Street, just down the street from J.P. Morgan, and Morgan Stanley bankers routinely used 23 Wall Street when closing transactions.

Morgan Guaranty Trust[edit]
In the years following the spin-off of Morgan Stanley, the securities business proved robust, while the parent firm, which incorporated in 1940,[5] was a little sleepy. By the 1950s J.P. Morgan was only a mid-size bank. In order to bolster its position, in 1959, J.P. Morgan merged with the Guaranty Trust Company of New York to form the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. The two banks already had numerous relationships between them and had complementary characteristics as J.P. Morgan brought a prestigious name and high quality clients and bankers while Guaranty Trust brought a significant amount of capital. Although Guaranty Trust was nearly four times the size of J.P. Morgan at the time of the merger in 1959, J.P. Morgan was considered the buyer and nominal survivor and former J.P. Morgan employees were the primary managers of the merged company.
Return of J.P. Morgan & Co.[edit]

Ten years after the merger, Morgan Guaranty established a bank holding company called J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated, but continued to operate as Morgan Guaranty through the 1980s before beginning to migrate back to use of the J.P. Morgan brand. In 1988, the company once again began operating exclusively as J.P. Morgan & Co.
Also in the 1980s, J.P. Morgan along with other commercial banks pushed the envelope of product offerings toward investment banking, beginning with the issuance of commercial paper.

Morgan moved quickly to rebuild its investment banking operations and by the late 1990s would emerge as a top-five player in securities underwriting.

J.P. Morgan Ordered to Pay $18 Million to Oil Heiress’s Trust


				By Susanne Craig			
October 10, 2012 2:30 pm
October 10, 2012 2:30 pm




James Gibbard/Tulsa WorldJudge Linda G. Morrissey of the Tulsa County District Court in Oklahoma.
8:01 p.m. | Updated 
Trust accounts require advisers to be even more diligent in putting the interests of clients ahead of the banks’.
This week, an Oklahoma judge found that JPMorgan Chase had been “grossly negligent and reckless” in its administration of one client’s trust account and ordered the bank to pay $18 million.
In a harshly worded opinion released late Tuesday, Judge Linda G. Morrissey of the Tulsa County District Court in Oklahoma said that the bank had breached a series of fiduciary duties in its handling of the trust of Carolyn S. Burford, an oil heiress who died in 1996. The court also ordered JPMorgan to pay punitive damages, to be set at a later date, along with the trust’s legal fees.
 Judge Morrissey concluded that JPMorgan had breached its fiduciary duty in 2000 when it sold what are known as variable prepaid forward contracts to the trust, a complex fee-rich product that the judge determined was unsuitable for the trust.
“We disagree with the court’s decision and will take all appropriate measures to respond, including appealing the decision,” JPMorgan said in a statement.
Erin Donovan, a lawyer for one of the Burford family members, praised the ruling. “I think the judge was affronted by the fact that JPMorgan, which was in a position of trust, betrayed it for their own benefit.”
This case is likely to put a spotlight on trust accounts. Under the current law, some stockbrokers are required to act in a customer’s best interest — but that is a less-stringent standard that allows them to sell products that are suitable, but not necessarily in a client’s best interest. Brokers who handle trust accounts are held to the higher standard and have to do what is best for the client alone.
The contracts in this case were pitched as a way to generate more income for the trust, which was established in 1955 by Ms. Burford’s parents. The trust now benefits Ann Fletcher, Ms. Burford’s daughter.
Carolyn Burford’s father founded Skelly Oil and her mother had ties with another oil company. The trust initially contained a significant amount of Exxon Mobil stock. JPMorgan and the trust entered into several variable prepaid forward contracts from 2000 to 2005.
The judge found that JPMorgan, which ended up with the account after a series of bank mergers, had not properly explained the product to its client and had failed to disclose that the bank was benefiting from the transaction. The bank also breached its duty when it invested the proceeds of the contracts in its own investment products, which the judge said “amounted to double dipping” that was unreasonable.
“The bank provided incentives to its employees to generate revenue for the bank. This created a situation in which the self-interest of employees managing and advising fiduciary accounts was placed in conflict with the interest of those to whom the bank owed fiduciary duties,” the judge wrote.
The misconduct in the case, the judge added, showed a serious disregard for customers of the bank, which was aware “or recklessly failed to be aware” of the conduct at issue.
“The court finds that beyond simply restoring the trust in the position in which it should have been maintained, it is appropriate to assess punitive damages for the sake of example and by way of punishing the bank for its conduct,” Judge Morrissey wrote.
Correction: October 10, 2012 An earlier version of this article misstated the jurisdiction of Judge Linda G. Morrissey. She is a district judge for the Tulsa County District Court, which is a state court in Oklahoma, not for the United States District Court, which is also in Tulsa.

JPMorgan Trust I - JPMorgan Research Market Neutral Fund is an open ended equity mutual fund launched by J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc. The fund invests in the public equity markets of the United States. It takes long and short positions to invest in stocks of companies operating across diversified sectors. The fund invests in value stocks of mid-cap and large-cap companies within the market capitalization range of the Russell 1000 and/or Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. It employs market neutral strategy to create its portfolio. The fund employs fundamental analysis focusing on factors like attractive valuation, catalysts that could trigger a rise in a stock’s price, impact on the overall risk of the portfolio relative to the benchmark, and temporary mispricing caused by market overreactions to create its portfolio. It benchmarks the performance of its portfolio against the BoFA Merrill Lynch 3-Month U.S. Treasury Bill Index and Lipper Alternative Equity Market Neutral Funds Average. The fund employs in-house research to create its portfolio. It was formerly known as JPMorgan Trust I - JPMorgan Market Neutral Fund.
