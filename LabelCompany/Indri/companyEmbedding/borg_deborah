  "In this role, Deborah will manage many of the U.S. issues        that in recent years have been predominantly left to corporate officers        with global responsibilities – including the Office of the Chief        Executive." 



MIDLAND, Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--In line with The Dow Chemical Company’s (NYSE: DOW) objective to 
      strengthen its geographic focus, Deborah Borg, vice president of the 
      Human Resource Partner Organization, has been named president of Dow 
      USA. In this role, she will continue to be based in Midland, Michigan, 
      and will report to Joe Harlan, chief commercial officer and vice 
      chairman, Market Businesses, and will be fully accountable to the Office 
      of the Chief Executive.
    

      “As we have said many times, our efforts are concentrated in select 
      markets where we can be narrowly, but more deeply focused, and this 
      requires a local approach to running our global businesses,” says 
      Harlan. “Deborah has been a key partner with our businesses throughout 
      her career with Dow. In addition, she has played an invaluable role in 
      the development and implementation of the Company’s corporate strategy. 
      Her experiences will help set a clear path forward for our growth 
      objectives in the United States.”
    

      In this role, Borg will be responsible for coordinating Dow’s activities 
      across the United States. She will develop and oversee a strategy for 
      Dow USA, coordinating closely with the businesses, functions and 
      operations to drive results. Borg will play an instrumental role in 
      representing Dow's interests to key stakeholders, including customers, 
      suppliers, joint venture partners, key government organizations, and our 
      communities. She will serve as a company spokesperson and manage issues 
      that affect U.S. government policy, public policy and Dow’s businesses. 
      Harlan adds, “In this role, Deborah will manage many of the U.S. issues 
      that in recent years have been predominantly left to corporate officers 
      with global responsibilities – including the Office of the Chief 
      Executive.”
    

      Andrew N. Liveris, Dow chairman and chief executive officer stated, 
      “Many large global corporations, like Dow, are increasingly focusing on 
      their home location – the United States – as a market with incredible 
      opportunities. The need for a strong leader to represent our interest 
      and to develop and oversee a strategy in the U.S. has been in discussion 
      for some years, and with Deborah’s appointment, we are now ready to 
      fully address the opportunities for Dow.”
    

      Borg joined Dow in 2000 as the Human Resource manager of Australia/New 
      Zealand. Over the ensuing 14 years, she has held a variety of roles in 
      Asia, Europe and North America which spanned the HR function and worked 
      in close partnership with Dow’s businesses and executive team. She has 
      provided HR leadership and counsel to a variety of Dow business 
      portfolios, and led the design and implementation of programs that 
      support talent attraction, compensation, retention, deployment and 
      development across the organization. Borg was named vice president of 
      Human Resources in 2010. Prior to joining Dow, she held several Human 
      Resource positions with General Motors Australia. Borg holds a Bachelor 
      of Administration in Business and a Masters in Training and Change 
      Management from Victoria University, Australia.
