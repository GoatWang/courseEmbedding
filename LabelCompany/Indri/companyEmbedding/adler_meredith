Barclays' Meredith Adler Sell-Side Rebuttal: $4.7 Billion Reasons To Remain Short - Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Barclays' Meredith Adler Sell-Side Rebuttal: $4.7 Billion Reasons To Remain ShortNov. 6.14 | About: Herbalife Ltd. (HLF) Matt Stewart Long/short equitySummarySell-side analysts have served their clients woefully on Herbalife.Barclays' analyst Meredith Adler is still bullish in spite of her obvious folly.There are $4.7 billion reasons she is mistaken.Herbalife (NYSE:HLF) investors suffered through another day of liquidation Wednesday as the common stock sliced through the $40 level. Since Monday afternoon, roughly $1.5 billion in Market Capitalization has been clipped from the equity value. As Herbalife's largest shareholder, Mr. Icahn bears the brunt of this decline. 17 million shares x $16 = $272 million in mark-to-market losses. This is on top of the losses from Herbalife's 52-week high. In the interests of rounding, let's call that $731 million. $680 million is Mr. Icahn's residual exposure. Together with Mr. Stiritz that's $1 billion shed from the highs.

Source: covertress.blogspot.com
Mr. Stiritz is Herbalife's largest personal shareholder. Assuming he still owns his shares, his losses from the 52-week high amount to roughly $300 million. His residual exposure is $280 million or so.
If you are wondering what it might have felt like to be a Herbalife long the past few days you needn't wonder anymore. Herbalife's self-described "extreme bull" John Hempton was kind enough to post the following comments to his Twitter account.
Easy to feel defeated here. Only saving grace - the position is so small now it matters less... Still I confess. It hurts.
Schadenfreude is not something to revel in. Still, I would be lying if I didn't admit that Mr. Hempton's pain is somewhat satisfying. After all, he has called me a "racist" publicly. Not to worry John, I forgive you. I just hope you have the good sense to liquidate the balance of your holdings while you still can. I apply this sentiment to Mr. Icahn and Mr. Stiritz too. It would be awful to see either of these two successful men ride the Ramey express to oblivion. There's a "Pivotal" decision you might have to make now that Herbalife's business fundamentals are deteriorating. I would take the bid while you still can.

In the wake of the recent violent price action on HLF, the question for Herbalife investors now, of course, is what do I do now?
Barclays analyst Meredith Adler published a new note to clients on Tuesday with some advice on that front. In this article, I would like to rebut Ms. Adler's arguments one by one. Here is what she said in her note to her Barclays' clients (if she still has any left). Here are my responses.

Meredith Adler: Title: Doing The Right Thing Can Hurt
HLF has been taking a variety of important steps to make involvement in its business less risky for a potential distributor.

Matt Stewart: Right off the bat Ms. Adler's note begins with nonsense. Herbalife has done nothing to make it "less risky" for a potential distributor pursuing the business opportunity. Herbalife recruits victims into the bottom levels of a mature pyramid scheme that shows robust evidence of saturation in key markets around the world. If anything, there has never been a riskier time to join Herbalife as a new business opportunity seeker. Finding new recruits is tougher than ever. Building a legitimate retail business is a pipe dream in many parts of the world. Retail profits are scarce. Being late to the game is not "less risky" no matter how you slice it.
Meredith Adler: Changes that have been contemplated for a long time, and even tested in a few countries, are being rolled out globally now and over the next several months. These changes include limits in the size of a first order and new standards to qualify as a sales leader. Not surprisingly they are dampening volume and sales growth in the short run, though to a greater extent than the company had anticipated. Yet management remains confident that these changes build a healthier and more sustainable business, and evidence from test markets shows that retention of sales leaders is higher and their productivity improves.
Matt Stewart: Again, more nonsense. The idea that lowering the qualification levels would dampen growth is absurd. Economics 101 tells us that if you lower the price of something you are trying to stimulate demand, not dampen it. The 1,100 Volume Point first time purchase limits are a Paper Tiger. Distributors can simply re-order a week later if they want and can still qualify for Supervisor in one month if they so choose. This fake antidote to inventory loading has no teeth whatsoever as a policy and is just a ruse to distract regulators. It should be obvious to any analyst that the lower qualification levels for Supervisor are supposed to be an immediate pro-growth initiative and not the opposite. Q. Why would anyone want to qualify for a 50% discount slower if they were actually retailing? This is an absurd proposition. The reason the Volume Point thresholds have been lowered has nothing to do with retailing and everything to do with keeping the mice chasing the cheese in the pay plan. As a reminder Ms. Adler, this is the cheese.

As to the retention of Sales Leaders. Q. If you make it easier to qualify for Sales Leader would you expect to retain more or less of them this coming February? Who might the company be trying to impress with this data? (if you said "me, Meredith Adler" you are starting to understand John DeSimone.)
As for productivity improving, Herbalife Sales Leaders recruited less new Members this year than they did last year. This seems like the obvious metric to hone in upon as Recruiting drives the entire business model. On that basis, productivity is down yoy not "up". E.g. Mexican Sales Leaders recruited far less than one Member each on average in the 3rd quarter as did recruiters in the USA. Does recruiting less than one obese customer per Sales Leader sound like the kind of result we might expect from a weight-loss company that is "changing people's lives". Or, is that a data point that supports the idea that we are trying our hardest to find new poor people to strive for Supervisor?
Meredith Adler: It is not exactly clear why these changes are being made so quickly, but the negative publicity around HLF's business model probably provided a strong incentive to take action now.
Matt Stewart: It is exactly clear why these changes are being made so quickly. Herbalife's pyramid scheme is stalling out around the world. Herbalife is pulling three specific levers to keep the recruiting juggernaut's momentum.

Adjusted S,G & A as a percentage of Revenue continues to climb indiscriminately as the company dumps soft dollars, incentives, etc. into Extravanganzas, trips and such. Herbalife should show evidence of massive operating leverage. Instead it shows the opposite.
The lower Supervisor qualification thresholds are designed to pre-empt Sales Leader attrition come February of next year. You seem impressed.
The company is expanding into desperate places like Vietnam and Greenland. This might be a clue that the "return to growth" might not happen any time soon.


Meredith Adler: It is also true that training distributors about the changes is probably done more efficiently all at once, rather than making numerous changes every year that need to be disseminated to established as well as new distributors. What is left for each investor to decide is whether these changes will make Herbalife less attractive to distributors given other direct selling opportunities, or, more cynically, if business momentum has already slowed and the changes being discussed are merely excuses.
Matt Stewart: The answer in Bold is correct. Business momentum has already slowed and the changes being discussed are merely excuses.
Meredith Adler: We take a more optimistic view, and importantly see that after the recent price drop investors are paid to wait and see if growth starts to re-accelerate. We are maintaining our Overweight rating, but lowering our price target to $80, based on a 13.0x P/E multiple of our new currency adjusted FY15 EPS of $6.18. As a reminder, FX is markedly pressuring reported EPS in 4Q14 and FY15 given the strength of the dollar against many currencies.
Matt Stewart: Your price target is now 2x the current price of Herbalife common even as you have revised it down once already from $94 to $80. 13x eps for a company that must replace its entire distributor base every 2 years is optimistic if not irrational. If investors are "paid to wait and see if growth starts to re-accelerate" are they also being paid to wait and see if the FTC, SEC, DOJ, NY AG, and Illinois AG arrest the company for business opportunity fraud? As for the currency headwinds, why you would assume that these headwinds are other than temporary escapes me entirely.
I also note that you publish 3 case scenarios for investors to contemplate. Here they are:
Meredith Adler: Price (04-Nov-2014) USD 44.26 Price Target USD 80.00 Why Overweight? HLF has shifted its business model from selling bulk orders sporadically to selling smaller ones more frequently. This shift has driven significant growth and we expect this momentum to continue. Given the regulatory overhang presented by Mr. Ackman, however, we are using only a 13.0x multiple on our currency adjusted FY15 EPS of $6.80.

Matt Stewart: Really? Is this true? Hasn't Herbalife always offered the choice of up-front qualifications or baby steps to get to Supervisor? Aren't these changes really cosmetic tweaks v. fundamental changes? Have you seen how Club 100 works or how Nutrition Clubs work to extract "smaller ones more frequently"? Also, did you notice how the company made no mention of Nutrition Clubs on its call?
Also, I am wondering how you define "significant growth". It strikes me that 2015 guidance calls for no growth. I note too that your model assumes tepid growth in 2016 as well. Is it your argument that because I cannot qualify for Supervisor in 1 day but must take as much as one week to do so that this is a sea change in the business model? Also, isn't it likely that more Supervisors will just lead to a more competitive pricing environment for product, more competition for limited margins and more events of failure in an already saturated Sales Leader pool? How is this good for business long term?

Meredith Adler: Upside case USD 98.00
If HLF can sustain its current momentum in the business, our estimates could prove to be conservative. If the stock returns to trading solely on fundamentals, the multiple should expand materially. Our upside scenario is based on 14.5x our currency adjusted FY15 EPS of $6.80.

Matt Stewart: I am not sure what you mean by "current momentum". Herbalife's sequential growth is non-existent. As for multiple expansion, but for the contracting multiple across the entire MLM space I might agree. E.g. Did you notice Nuskin's results today? MLM is now squarely in the cross-hairs of investors, regulators and alike. A market multiple appears way too optimistic for valid reasons #churn.

Meredith Adler: Downside case USD 40.00
Mr. Ackman has called HLF a pyramid scheme and is trying to convince regulators to open an investigation. Although an investigation would likely take years, we believe the stock may be volatile in the interim. Downside is based on 7.0x our currency adjusted FY15 EPS of $4.94


Matt Stewart: Say what? I am amazed that an institution like Barclays would allow you to publish a statement as nonsensical as this. Mr. Ackman is not trying to convince regulators to open an investigation. He has already accomplished this result along with a roster of Consumer Advocates and elected officials. Q. Do analysts at Barclays bother to read the news before they encourage investors to chase unicorns? Also, why you assume an investigation would likely take years seems wholly unsupported by any sort of evidence. E.g. FHTM was investigated over a period of less than two years before an injunction was issued and its pyramid scheme was arrested. The SEC has been investigating Herbalife for over 7 quarters now. The FTC joined the party in March. Many of these investigations culminate with restraining orders and asset freezes. Trust me, I looked it up.
As for your notion that the downside is $40. Already, all evidence suggests that this argument is nonsense too. E.g. Wednesday's closing price is $39.75. Even Herbalife "extreme bull" John Hempton is wise enough to acknowledge that the downside for this stock is $0 and not $40.
As for the rest of your report, I offer you the following thoughts. Repeatedly you state that "Management says this" or "Management believes that". Q. Do you conduct any independent thinking beyond what management spoonfeeds you?
Q. What is it about this particular management team that would allow you to rely upon anything they tell you as credible information?
They have missed guidance two quarters in a row and are being investigated by the most important regulatory bodies we have in our Republic.
It appears to me that your entire report is built on a foundation of sand, namely the assumption that Herbalife is, de facto, a legitimate enterprise. Your valuation work doesn't assign any probability to the idea that you are dead wrong. How any fiduciary could argue that clients should commit capital to a security on that basis is wholly irresponsible. Herbalife common is a speculative security at best and yet you gloss over most of the obvious risks of permanent capital loss to investors who are long.

Q. What do I mean by this?
At today's price, Herbalife has an Enterprise Value of $4.7 billion. If it lasts another year before being arrested permanently it might produce $500 million in free cash flow. The value gap between these two numbers is $4.2 billion. This sort of outcome would leave junior bondholders permanently impaired and equity holders wiped out altogether.
Increasingly other rational analysts, buy-side investors and truly independent analysts are discounting this sort of binary scenario into the stock price. Meanwhile, you seem to tell investors that they are being "paid to wait"?
So, to argue dead against this absurd notion you present I offer you the following. A no-growth MLM with an ever churning base of distributors might deserve a multiple of 10x eps/FCF or 1x sales. Let's call that $5 billion.
If regulators kill the company it's a zero.
Assigning reasonable probabilities to these outcomes gives us a mid-point valuation of $2.5 billion. Net of Net Debt that's $1.4 billion for the equity. Let's call this $16 per share.
I have no idea when and where buy-side investors are going to stop liquidating Herbalife common near term. In my view, however, the stock should trade in the $25-$40 range pending the results of the government's investigation. This evening we are at the top end of that range. Don't be surprised to see more selling in the sessions ahead.
Certainly, market participants find the notion that Herbalife's intrinsic value is anywhere near $90 thoroughly absurd. Reading the arguments in your report makes it easy to understand the reasons why.
Barclays should be better than this report. Your clients deserve better and more thorough analysis. De minimus, you should get your facts correct before recommending capital allocation towards a security of any type. Your comments on the state of the government's involvement are just plain wrong.
To close:
Herbalife is a global pyramid scheme that will be shut down by regulators. The sooner the better. When that happens, your downside estimate of $40 will be exposed as an unfortunate miscalculation.

She thrives in dynamic environments and loves to build bridges between solutions and people.Prior to joining Student Energy, Meredith was Communications Coordinator for Clean Energy Canada where she project managed the Tracking the Energy Revolution report series, and kept all communications trains running on time. Before that she could be found doing anything from running a youth trail construction crew in the Cascades, to coaching a campus tours team, to working on youth leadership programming in Latin America. A degree in Geography from The University of British Columbia kickstarted Meredith’s obsession with energy and environmental policy.If you can’t find Meredith in the office, she’s probably off on a mountaintop or hanging off the edge of a rock face somewhere - with her trusty dog Yoshi in tow. meredith@studentenergy.org@Meredith_AdlerKate Kerrane, Community Manager Kate Kerrane is Student Energy’s Community Manager. An Irish native and a passionate 23-year-old, she is determined in helping Student Energy accelerator students into a sustainable energy future.

She is overseeing Student Energy’s Chapter Model program global launch, that works to create campus level clubs dedicated to helping students and young people understand the global energy system. When she’s not working, Kate is always keeping up to date with new sustainable inventions. She is also a rugby fanatic, loving to both watch and play. She holds a vision on sustainable living by shopping in second-hand shops and having a plant based diet.
