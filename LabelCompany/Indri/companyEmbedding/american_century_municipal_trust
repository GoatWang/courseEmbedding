                AMERICAN CENTURY INVESTMENTS ANNOUNCES AGREEMENT
                        TO ACQUIRE THE MASON STREET FUNDS

     KANSAS CITY, MO. December 14, 2005 -- American  Century  Investments  today
announced  a plan of  reorganization  that will bring 10 out of 11 Mason  Street
Funds into the  American  Century fund  family.  This move will expand  American
Century's  fund  line-up,   particularly  in  the  load  area,   while  allowing
Northwestern  Mutual,  the parent  company  of Mason  Street  Advisors,  and its
affiliates   to   relinquish   retail  fund   sponsorship   and   administration
responsibilities  and allow  Mason  Street  Advisors to continue to focus on its
core asset management business.

     The  planned  reorganization,  unanimously  approved  by the  boards of the
American  Century  Funds  and the Mason  Street  Funds  and now  subject  to the
approval of the Mason  Street  Funds  shareholders,  involves 10 of the existing
Mason Street Funds merging into new or existing  American Century funds. Four of
those funds will be co-branded as new American  Century-Mason  Street  products,
with Mason Street Advisors serving as sub-advisor.

     "American  Century is  excited to be  entering  into a  strategic  business
alliance with Mason Street  Advisors and  Northwestern  Mutual," said William M.
Lyons,  American Century  president and chief executive  officer.  "The expanded
product line resulting  from the  reorganization  underscores  our commitment to
investors,  particularly  those who choose to seek the  assistance  of financial
professionals."

     "This transaction highlights the common philosophy of Mason Street Advisors
and American Century," said Mark Doll,  president of Mason Street Advisors.  "We
believe  that  American  Century's  value  proposition  of  financial  strength,
integrity  and  investment  management  expertise is  consistent  with ours.  In
addition,  this transaction  allows us to continue to provide retail access to a
number of our key investment disciplines at Mason Street Advisors."

     The  plan  of  reorganization,  if  approved  by  the  Mason  Street  Funds
shareholders,  calls  for the  Mason  Street  Funds to be  reorganized  into the
American Century family of funds in the following manner:

     1.   Four  series of Mason  Street  Funds  (Small  Cap  Growth,  Aggressive
          Growth,  Select Bond and High Yield Bond  Funds)  will be  reorganized
          into newly created,  co-branded  American  Century-Mason  Street funds
          that will be advised by  American  Century  and  sub-advised  by Mason
          Street  Advisors.  These  new  funds  will  have the  same  investment
          objectives and policies,  and the same investment management personnel
          as their Mason Street Funds predecessors.

     2.   Two series of Mason Street Funds  (International  Equity and Municipal
          Bond Funds) will be reorganized  into newly created  American  Century
          Funds to be advised by American Century,  with the International  Fund
          continuing to be sub-advised  by Templeton  Investment  Counsel,  LLC.
          These funds will have  investment  objectives and policies  similar to
          their Mason Street Funds predecessors.

     3.   Four series of Mason Street Funds  (Index 500,  Large Cap Core,  Asset
          Allocation and Growth Stock Funds) will be  reorganized  into existing
          American Century funds,  which will continue to be advised by American
          Century.

     The six  newly-created  American  Century  funds  will  be  load  products,
expanding the American Century load series to 25 funds.

     Northwestern  Mutual and Mason Street Funds anticipate that shareholders of
the Mason Street Funds will be sent a proxy statement/prospectus detailing terms
of the  reorganization  in early  February  2006,  and a shareholder  meeting to
consider and approve the proposed  reorganization will be held in March 2006. If
approved, the reorganization will be effective on or about March 31, 2006.

     Additionally,  Northwestern  Mutual and Mason Street  Advisors  advise that
this transaction in no way affects Mason Street Advisors' continued provision of
investment  management  services to the  Northwestern  Mutual Series Fund, which
underlies  Northwestern  Mutual's  variable  annuity and variable life products.
