Form 10-K
A 10-K is a comprehensive summary report of a company's performance that must be submitted annually to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Typically, the 10-K contains much more detail than the annual report. It includes information such as company history, organizational structure, equity, holdings, earnings per share, subsidiaries, etc. 

The 10-K must be filed within 60 days (it used to be 90 days) after the end of the fiscal year.
Form 10-K/A
Amended Form 10-K
Form 10-Q
The SEC form 10-Q is a comprehensive report of a company's performance that must be submitted quarterly by all public companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the 10-Q, firms are required to disclose relevant information regarding their financial position. The form must be submitted on time, and the information should be available to all interested parties. 

The 10-Q is due 35 days (it used to be 45 days) after each of the first three fiscal quarters. There is no filing after the fourth quarter because that is when the 10-K is filed.
Form 10-Q/A
Amended Form 10-Q
Form 3
A document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by an insider affiliated with a public company's operation or by any investor owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding shares

This document must be filed with the SEC no later than 10 days after an insider becomes affiliated with a company, and it must be filed for each company in which a person is an insider, regardless of whether or not the insider has an equity position in the company at that time.
Form 3/A
Amended Form 3
Form 4
A Form 4 is a document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) whenever there is a material change in the holdings of company insiders. Insiders required to submit a Form 4 include directors and officers of the company as well as any shareholders owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding stock.

This two-page document covers any buy-and-sell orders on the open market as well as the exercise of company stock options. A Form 4 is mandatory within two business days starting from the end of the day the material transaction occurred. This filing is related to Form 3 and the Form 5, which also cover changes to the company insider holdings.
Form 4/A
Amended Form 4
Form 5
The annual statement of beneficial ownership of securities.
Form 5/A
Amended Form 5
Form 8-K
An 8-K is a report of unscheduled material events or corporate changes at a company that could be of importance to the shareholders or the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Examples of events reported on an 8-K include acquisition, bankruptcy, resignation of directors, or a change in the fiscal year. Also known as Form 8k.
Form D
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required for companies that are selling securities in reliance on a Regulation D exemption or Section 4(6) exemption provisions. 

Form D is a brief notice of a company's executive officers and stock promoters, in lieu of the regular reports required when no exemption under Regulation D exists. 

Form D must be filed no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities.

Form D is also known as the Notice of Sale of Securities and is a requirement under Regulation D, Section 4(6) and/or the Uniform Limited Offering Exemption of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. 

This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, providing essential facts, are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act - requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered and prohibiting fraud in the sale of the offered securities.
Form D/A
Amended Form D
Form DEF 14A
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that must be filed by or on behalf of a registrant when a shareholder vote is required. SEC Form DEF 14A is most commonly used in conjunction with an annual meeting proxy. The form should provide security holders with sufficient information to allow them to make an informed vote at an upcoming security holders' meeting or to authorize a proxy to vote on their behalf. It includes information about the date, time and place of the meeting of security holders; revocability of proxy; dissenter's right of appraisal; persons making the solicitation; direct or indirect interest of certain persons in matters to be acted upon; modification or exchange of securities; financial statements; voting procedures; and other details. 

All other filed by non-management definitive proxy statements - typically an annual meeting proxy.

Form DEF 14A, which is also known as "definitive proxy statement", is required under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This form is filed with the SEC when a definitive proxy statement is given to shareholders and helps the SEC ensure that shareholders' rights are upheld.
Form S-1
The SEC form S-1 is the initial registration form for new securities required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for public companies. Any security that meets the criteria must have an S-1 filing before shares can be listed on a national exchange. 

Form S-1 requires companies to provide information on the planned use of capital proceeds, detail the current business model and competition, as well provide a a brief prospectus of the planned security itself, offering price methodology, and any dilution that will occur to other listed securities. The SEC also requires the disclosure of any material business dealings between the company and its directors and outside counsel. 

Form S-1 is also known as the "Registration Statement Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933". 

Investors can view S-1 filings online to perform due diligence on new offerings prior to their issue. The form is sometimes amended as material information changes or general market conditions cause a delay in the offering. 

The Securities Exchange Act of 1933, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act, which is requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered, and to prohibit fraud in the sale of the offered securities. 

A less rigid registration form is the S-3, which is for companies that don't have the same ongoing reporting requirements.

News


















Chances are good that a hotel room will cost you more this year. The Hotels.com Hotel Price Index reports that global hotel prices rose 3 percent in 2014, the fifth straight annual increase.Fortunately, we know a few tricks to help you slash rates. Here are 10 ways to make your next vacation a bit more affordable.1. Go in the off-seasonThe top way to save on your hotel room is to travel during off-peak times. Money Talks News finance expert Stacy Johnson says traveling in the off-season can cut your hotel costs by up to two-thirds.Traveling at off-peak times helped me save more than a $100 a night at Cedar Point. With fewer people traveling, hotels drop their rates in the off-season to pull in as much business as they can.2. Stay midweekIf off-season travel doesn’t work for you, try to hit your destination during the week rather than on the weekend. Unless the hotel you’re staying at caters to business travelers, you’ll probably find cheaper rates on weekdays.

3. Search online for promo codesBefore booking a hotel, try searching online for coupon codes or promo offers. If you’re booking through a third-party website, don’t forget to search for codes associated with the booking site as well as the hotel.In addition, follow your favorite brands on Facebook and Twitter. Companies occasionally distribute codes or announce flash sales on social media. You might even send a message to the company and ask if they have a coupon for loyal customers like you.4. Shop aroundHotels are a bit like cars: Each one offers roughly the same thing for a different price. Find the best rate by searching for hotel prices on a couple of different sites or use an aggregator site like Trivago.com. Be sure to clear the cookies from your computer between searches to ensure your search history isn’t influencing your results.Also, don’t neglect calling the hotel directly. In my experience, some of the best rates are offered by the hotel itself.5. Think outside the hotelSometimes the best deal isn’t a hotel at all. If you have a large family or are traveling with a group, you may find it’s cheaper to rent a vacation home.For a different experience, you could try a bed and breakfast, Airbnb or a hostel. Really adventurous souls can try couch surfing.6. Bundle your vacationIf you’re using a third-party site, try bundling your vacation. Some sites will provide discounts if you buy airfare or rent a car at the same time you book a hotel room. However, you should also price out your airfare and room separately to ensure you’re getting a bargain.7. Rethink the entertainment packageMany hotels offer entertainment packages that add meals and attraction tickets to your room. On the face of it, many of these packages seem a good deal. But do some research before making your reservation.Learn what is in the package so you don’t spend on perks you don’t want. Also, it may be just as cheap to buy the included items separately. And by waiting to make those ticket and meal purchases after you arrive, you’ll likely have greater flexibility in your schedule.8. Sign up for a loyalty programFrom Choice Hotels to Hyatt, hotel chains fitting every budget offer loyalty programs. They often work like frequent-flier miles, earning you free nights after a certain number of stays.They may also entitle you to discounts and other perks, like evening receptions or room upgrades. Best of all, most are free to join.9. Join a clubMembership has its privileges, and some organizations have negotiated discounts with hotel chains. AARP and AAA are two groups known for helping members get rate cuts. If you’re a member, be sure to ask about special rates before booking your stay.10. Ask for a dealFinally, the best way to cut your hotel rate may be to simply ask. Don’t bother using a third-party booking site or even the hotel chain’s 800-number for this strategy. Just call the front desk of the hotel and ask for the lowest nonrefundable rate they offer.Another option is to make a refundable reservation and then continue to shop around. If you find a lower price, go back to your preferred hotel and ask if it can match the competition’s price. At the very least, the hotel may offer you an upgrade.What’s your secret way to save on lodging? Share with us in comments below or on our Facebook page.
