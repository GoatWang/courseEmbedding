  Department of Health and Human ServicesPublic Health ServiceFood and Drug Administration College Park, MD 20740  SEP 21 2012 WARNING LETTERVIA CERTIFIED MAILJulio Bernabe, Managing MemberAndes Natural Skin Care LLC1802 North Carson StreetSuite 108Carson City, NV 89701Re: 257974 Dear Mr. Bernabe:This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your web sites at the Internet addresses http://www.andes-natural.com, ttp://www.bioskincare.com, http:/ /bioacnecare.com, http:/ /bioskinforte.com, http:/ /www.bioskinrepair.com, and http://bioskinexfol.com in August 2012. Based on this review, your products BioSkinCare, Bio Skin Rejuvenation, BioSkinclear, Bio Acne Care, BioSkinforte, BioSkinexfol, and BioSkinrepair appear to be promoted for uses that cause these products to be drugs under sections 201(g)(1)(B) and/or 201(g)(1)(C) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B) and§ 321(g)(1)(C)]. The claims on your web sites indicate that these products are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or are intended to affect the structure or any function of the human body, rendering them drugs under the Act. The marketing of these products with claims evidencing these intended uses violates the Act.Examples of some of the claims observed on your web sites include:BioSkinCare (at www.andes-natural.com)• "[T]riggers your body's own skin regeneration activators"• "[R]epairs sun damaged tissues at the cellular level"• "[T]akes away acne, rosacea, scars, skin blemishes and deep under skin lesions accumulated by excess UV exposure ... "• "[T]akes away all imperfections and blemishes: acne, scars, keratosis bumps, razor nicks and burns, actinic keratosis lesions, ... ezcema [sic], dermatitis, the effects on the skin of radiotherapy for cancer, blisters, scrapes, cuts ... "• "[A]ctivates the fibroblast stem cells which favor the proliferation of new healthy connective tissues and all the structural elements of healthy skin, smoothing facial crater-like skin texture." • "Inhibits microbiological activity of dangerous, pathogenic skin bacteria, including acne."• "Regulates dermal fibroblast proliferation and excess collagen, and thus prevents and reduces abnormal scars such as keloid and hyperthropic scarring and slowly but consistently gets rid of ice-pick scars or pitted acne scars."• "[Y]our skin will react to the biological enzymes by activating its own biological response modifiers thereby interacting with your body's immune system and repair mechanisms to treat skin injuries (cuts, bruises, abrasions, acne lesions, scarring), dysfunctional tissues (keratosis, keloid and hypertrophic scars ... ) and prevent immune-mediated inflammatory skin disorders (inflammatory acne, rosacea, eczema and most dermatitis reactions)."• "Topical application of the cream on skin wounds and scars regulates or decreases dermal fibroblast proliferation and excess collagen production, and thus prevents and reduces keloid and hyperthropic scarring."• "[E]nhances the skin's natural regenerative responses by stimulating new capillary formation (angiogenesis), and the orchestrated biosynthesis of collagen, elastin and the water-holding proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans."Your web site also contains disease claims in the form of personal testimonials about your BioSkinCare product, including:• "The scars in my upper arms ... are getting lighter."• "I started to get severe acne on my face and neck ... I feel like I have found a miracle cure."• "I have gotten not only my mother using it for her stretch marks ... but now my close friend for ... acne ... and ... it worked ... "• "I ... have had cystic acne for 10 years ... I can't say that it completely prevents the cysts from appearing but they ... are much less frequent and much less severe."• "I have ... used your product for an open wound (size of a pencil eraser) on a black mole removed by my doctor .... This product healed my wound faster than it would with an OTC prescription."• "[T]he inflammation on my face has considerably reduced .... Also it has cleared up my psoriasis!"Bio Skin Rejuvenation (at www.bioskinrejuvenation.com)• "[R]educes melanin hyperpigmentation and a biomimetic peptide that inhibits the accumulation of melanin pigments."• "[L]imiting both melanin production (tan) and skin reddening (erythema)."• "Promotes cell proliferation and new synthesis of collagen and elastin .... "• "Protects from UV A radiation"• "Acts as an anti-inflammatory as it metabolizes or breaks down the denatured proteins into amino-acid components, which otherwise cause inflaming, and releases them forrebuilding of the skin structures"• "Blocks melanin synthesis and reduces the formation of unwanted pigmentation, allowing control over skin tone and brown spots." • "[T]he secretion has been used on patients that have been diagnosed with malignant tumors and need radio-therapy. The results have been highly satisfactory in radiodermatitis of neck and breasts."• "The secretion also shows a UV A cytoprotective activity. It protects cells from noxious stimuli from Ultra Violet radiation which justifies the claim that applying it on skin protects the skin from UVA radiation."• "[I]nhibiting the production of the enzyme tyrosinase, leading to clearer complexion and a reduction in skin pigmentation."• "(R]egulates pigmentation tone for the total skin surface, lightening the complexion."• "[E]liminating the INFLAMMATORY effect of a 'foreign body' induced by otherwise remaining denatured collagen"• "[T]riggers the repair of cells damages by UV radiation .... "• "[R]egulation of epidermal pigmentation tone."BioSkinclear (at www.andes-natural.com/acne)• "Gel for Acne & Rosacea Inflammation"• "[E]liminates redness and post inflammatory hyperpigmentation."• "Glycoconjugates also induce the proliferation on the surface of the skin of antimicrobial peptides that perform as natural antibiotics. And they signal your immune system that it is being taken care of and moderates the inflammatory response so that it does not cause acne rashes or loss of tissues: ice-pick scars."• "[R]elieves the side effects of Accutane®."• "Topical application ... soon after the first signs of acne pimples, prevents the cells from initiating the signaling cascade that leads to acne inflammatory reactions and healing through the scarring pathway."• "[N]ot only relieves the effects of acne breakouts & rosacea, it can also prevent acne breakouts and rosacea when used twice a day on clean skin as a routine skin care regimen to keep skin clear of blemishes."• "It helps as well with the repair of everyday and accumulated damage created by exposure to UV radiation .... "• "The gel has also been effective for the treatment of rosacea symptoms, helping to halt and prevent inflammation, restore the capacity of skin to intricately orchestrate itsregeneration in an orderly way, strengthening blood vessels, cell walls and circulation; while helping to prevent further rosacea outbreaks."• "Acne Scar Removal"• "Heals micro-tears in the skin, softens coarse areas and opens constricting pores, plumps up ice-pick acne scars, shrinks raised or hypertrophic scars, reduces keloid scar tissues and stops their itching, and greatly diminishes post surgery scarring."• "Protection from UV radiation .... "Bio Acne Care (at www.bioacnecare.com)• "Natural Solution for Zits, Pimples, Blemishes, Blackheads, Acne Breakouts."• "[A] naturally occurring serum that supports the immune system of the skin by providing enzymes that dissolve blocked pores; skin regenerating activators that heal skin lesions; antimicrobials that keep bacteria under control ... cell communicating molecules that discern damaged cells from healthy cells and support the immune system in its fight against foreign matters and uncontrolled bacteria; and boosters of production of water holding molecules within the skin matrix that deeply moisturize the dermis & epidermis"• "[L]icorice extract is anti-inflammatory, anti-irritant, anti-microbial ... & has a sebum regulation activity."BioSkinforte (at www.bioskinforte.com)• "Prevents and Clears Acne"• "[P]owerful anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and sebum regulation botanicals"BioSkinexfol (at www.andes-natural.com/microdermabrasion and www.bioskinexfol.com)• "[S]timulate collagen growth and cellular regeneration thereby improving ... sagging, reduction of imperfections and blemishes ... "• "[R]emoval of ... abnormal scars and imperfections and the release of amino-acids that help rebuild damaged tissues quickly"• "[D]issolve or 'digest' non functional, damaged and worn out cells deep within the skin. This explains why BIOSKINEXFOL works so well for old and rough stretch marks, for those are scar tissues deep within the skin."• "[S]upports the protective strategies of the innate immune system of human skin ... "• "The bioactive ingredients in BIOSKINEXFOL act as:(1) regulators of enzyme activity;(2) regulators of neurite outgrowth, and(3) anti-inflammatory agents that limits oxidative damage after tissue injury;(4) stabilizers, cofactors, and/or coreceptors for:(4a) proteins produced by the human body that enable cells to communicate and effectively coordinate activities between one another (growth factors),(4b) intracellular messenger molecules whose major function is to attract immune cells to sites of infection (chemokines), and(4c) regulatory proteins released by cells of the immune system that act as intercellular mediators in the generation of an immune response (cytokines)."• "The Glycoconjugates in the Cream help the skin to(1) regenerate new collagen and elastin which improves skin firmness and elasticity,(2) increase the production of water holding glycosaminoglycans which is true moisturizing,(3) improve the skin's blood vessel microcirculation,(4) increase the natural defense mechanism against oxidative damage, and(5) repair damage to the protective skin barrier. As the skin is rebuilt and scars removed, the elastic properties of the skin pull it into a smooth surface. During skin remodeling, the old damaged protein is removed and replaced with new collagen and elastin fibers. This removes scar tissue, restores skin elasticity, and reduces wrinkles."BioSkinRepair (at www.bioskinrepair.com)• "[H]elps to prevent and reduce all types of scars, including hypertrophic and keloid scars, because it orchestrates an orderly repair of damaged skin, scarless healing &enhanced skin regeneration"• "[S]timulating new capillary formation (angiogenesis), and the orchestrated biosynthesis and orderly deposition of new collagen, elastin, and the water-holding proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans in the skin matrix .... "• "Regulates dermal fibroblast proliferation and excess collagen, and thus helps to prevent and reduce scar keloids and hyperthropic scarring."• "Stimulates the formation of the extracellular binding between cells .... "• "[P]otent ... anti-inflammatory and anti-itching agent."• "Inhibits microbiological activity of dangerous, pathogenic skin bacteria, including acne."• "Stimulates the formation of glycosaminoglycans ... helps to thicken the dermis resulting in a lessening of sagging and less fine lines and wrinkles."Your products are not generally recognized among qualified experts as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are new drugs as defined in section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321 (p)]. Under section 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 355(a)] a new drug may not be legally marketed in the U.S. without prior approval from FDA in the form of an approved New Drug Application (NDA). A description of the new drug approval process can be found on FDA's internet website at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/NewDrugApplicationNDA/default.htm.

ANDES 9,
INC.

 


  NOTES
TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(UNAUDITED)

 

 




 



1.



DESCRIPTION
OF BUSINESS AND HISTORY




 

Description
of business . Andes 9,
Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of
the State of Delaware on July 27, 2015, and has been inactive since
inception. The Company intends to serve as a vehicle to affect an
asset acquisition, merger, exchange of capital stock or other
business combination with a domestic or foreign
business.

 




 



2.



SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT POLICIES




 

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements of the Company have
been prepared without audit pursuant to the rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission requirements for interim
financial statements. Therefore, they do not include all of the
information and footnotes required by accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States for complete financial
statements. The financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the audited financial statements in our Form 10-K filed on
February 1, 2016.

 

The
interim financial statements present the balance sheet, statements
of operations and cash flows for the Company. The financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

 

The
interim financial information is unaudited. In the opinion of
management, all adjustments necessary to present fairly the
financial position as of September 30, 2016 and the results of
operations and cash flows presented herein have been included in
the financial statements. All such adjustments are of a normal and
recurring nature. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of
results of operations for the full year.

 

Use of
estimates . The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires the
Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and
related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. These
estimates and judgments are based on historical information,
information that is currently available to the Company and on
various other assumptions that the Company believes to be
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

 

Cash and
cash equivalents . Cash and
cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term investments with
original maturities of less than 90 days. Cash equivalents are
placed with high credit quality financial institutions and are
primarily in money market funds. The carrying value of those
investments approximates fair value.

 

Revenue
Recognition . Revenue
is only recognized when all of the following criteria are met:
(1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
(2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered,
(3) the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and
(4) collectability is reasonably assured.

Earnings
(loss) per share . Basic
earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income
(loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income
available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of
shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to
include the number of additional shares of common stock that would
have been outstanding if potentially dilutive securities had been
issued. There were no potentially dilutive securities outstanding
during the periods presented.

 

Stock-based
compensation . The
Company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the
receipt of goods or services from other than employees in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) ASC 718-10, Compensation – Stock
Compensation, and the conclusions reached by FASB ASC 505-50,
Equity – Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. Costs are
measured at the estimated fair market value of the consideration
received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments
issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of equity
instruments issued for consideration other than employee services
is determined on the earliest of a performance commitment or
completion of performance by the provider of goods or services as
defined by FASB ASC 505-50.

 

Income
taxes . The
Company records income taxes under the asset and liability method,
whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on
the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and attributable to
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Accounting standards
regarding income taxes requires a reduction of the carrying amounts
of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance, if based on the
available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets
will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation
allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed at each reporting
period based on a more-likely-than-not realization threshold. This
assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency
and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future
profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, the
Company’s experience with operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards not expiring unused, and tax planning
alternatives.

 

The
Company recorded valuation allowances on the net deferred tax
assets. Management will reassess the realization of deferred tax
assets based on the accounting standards for income taxes each
reporting period. To the extent that the financial results of
operations improve and it becomes more likely than not that the
deferred tax assets are realizable, the Company will be able to
reduce the valuation allowance.

 

Significant
judgment is required in evaluating the Company’s tax
positions and determining its provision for income taxes. During
the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and
calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
Accounting standards regarding uncertainty in income taxes provides
a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax
positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for
recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence
indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be
sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or
litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax
benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely, based
solely on the technical merits, of being sustained on examinations.
The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating
its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic
adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual
outcomes.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements . The
Company has evaluated recent pronouncements through Accounting
Standards Updates (“ASU”) 2016-18 and believes that
none of them will have a material impact on the Company’s
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

 




3.



GOING
CONCERN




 

 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the
satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The
Company has incurred losses since inception and had accumulated
deficit of $28,401 as of September 30, 2016. The Company requires
capital for its contemplated operational activities. The
Company’s ability to raise additional capital through the
future issuances of common stock is unknown. The obtainment of
additional financing, the successful development of the
Company’s contemplated plan of operations, and its
transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations
are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The ability
to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The
financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments
that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned
uncertainties.

 

In order
to mitigate the risk related with this uncertainty, the Company
plans to issue additional shares of common stock for cash and
services during the next 12 months.

 




4.



STOCKHOLDERS’
EQUITY




 

Preferred
Stock . The
Company is authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par
value preferred stock. As of September 30, 2016, no shares of
preferred stock had been issued.

 

Common
Stock  -
The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of $0.0001
par value common stock. As of September 30, 2016, 20,000,000 shares
were issued and outstanding.

 

Upon
formation of the Company on July 27, 2015, the Board of Directors
issued 10,000,000 shares of common stock for $1,000 in services to
the founding shareholder of the Company. In addition, the founding
shareholder made a contribution of $1,000 to the Company for the
period ended June 30, 2016, which is recorded as additional paid-in
capital.

 

Subsequently,
and as previously reported on Form 8K, on September 12, 2016 the
Company entered into a Subscription Agreement with Dongzhi Zhang
for the purchase of 20 million shares of its restricted common
stock at a price of $0.0001 per share. The sale was the result of a
privately negotiated transaction without the use of public
dissemination of promotional or sales materials. Richard Chiang,
our then sole shareholder, officer and director, and the Company
agreed to the redemption of 10,000,000 shares of the
Company’s common stock at par value, i.e. $1,000, which had
previously been issued to Mr. Chiang.

 




5.



COMMITMENT




 

There is
no commitment or contingency to disclose during the period ended
September 30, 2016.

I have difficulty finding footwear that is comfortable, that is, until I found Naot's Andes sandals. Without question the finest quality, fit and comfortable pair of sandals I have ever owned, including both Ecco and Birkenstock. Without reservation, I can recommend all the footwear produced by Naot as the most comfortable and durable I have ever owned.

Finally...Comfort & Quality!
I like the look of the Montblanc better, but after having 2 pairs physically come apart at the seams due to poor design of the back strap I switched over to the Andes. While not as stylish, this seems to be built to last! As with all Naot footwear, this rivals (and may actually surpass) my gym shoes in comfort. I highly recommend them, especially if you purchase from Zappos. The customer service team was brilliant in getting replacing my defective Montblancs! Zappos is top notch!

Sierra Los Andes Malbec 2015.
The Sierra Los Andes Malbec is a superb value for money red wine. This lovely Malbec combines power and finesse to give a soft and velvety red wine which is full of sweet spicy fruit flavours. Ideal served on it's own or with a juicy steak from Argentina of course.
Sierra Los Andes is a stunning duo of wines from the heart of Argentina's wine making land. From a country infused with passion and vibrancy, these wines are equally as exciting. The elegantly packaged wines highlight perfectly the purity of fruit from Argentina. The stylish, crisp Torrontés and the heady intense Malbec, charmingly show case these quintessentially Argentinian varieties.
Vineyard
El Alto Vineyard is located in Ugarteche, in the southern part of Luján de Cuyo and is situated at 1,050 metres above sea level. The soils range from sandy loam to clay loam, with a variable stone content. The climate typically presents warm days and cool nights, with an average temperature variation of 14°C and an average annual rainfall of 250mm. Yielding 12 tonnes per hectare, the vines are grown on espalier training systems, with drip irrigation.
Winemaking
The grapes were harvested from mid to late March, destemmed and softly crushed. A cold pre-fermentation maceration took place, in order to preserve the primary aromas. The must was then cooled and traditional fermentation commenced at controlled temperatures. A post-fermentation maceration lasted between 10 and 15 days, followed by the malolactic fermentation.
Tasting Note
Deep, violet red in colour with intense, sweet, spicy aromas combined with rich red fruits and floral hints of violet. On the palate it is soft, velvety, fresh and well balanced.
Serving Suggestion
The perfect partner to a chargrilled steak, roasted red meats, fajitas, charcuterie and rich, flavoursome vegetable bakes.
