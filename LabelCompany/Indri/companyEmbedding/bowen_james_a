James A. Bowen

















 



                James A. Bowen              
Director

James A. Bowen is CEO of First Trust Portfolios L.P. and its affiliate, First Trust Advisors L.P. He is responsible for the strategic direction of the firms and putting teams in place to meet the many demands of the marketplace with the products and services the firms offer. Prior to forming First Trust Portfolios with several partners, Mr. Bowen was responsible for the First Trust product line at Clayton Brown & Associates, an innovative unit investment trust sponsor. In 1991, Mr. Bowen was instrumental in leading the purchase of the First Trust product line. Since that time, First Trust Portfolios has grown to be the largest independent unit investment trust sponsor, by sales, in the United States. Under Mr. Bowen’s direction, the firms have expanded their offerings to include closed-end funds, separately managed accounts, variable annuity sub-accounts, exchange-traded funds and mutual funds. The firms are also affiliated with several specialized money managers, which allows them to offer additional investment solutions to their client bases. Mr. Bowen has over 30 years of experience with packaged products for the financial services marketplace. Prior to forming First Trust, he held executive positions at various financial institutions. Mr. Bowen earned his bachelor’s degree from Wheaton College in Wheaton, Illinois.

GET DETAILSClickFIND A STOREBuilding High Tech Product Companies: The Maelstrom Effectby Bowen, James E.A perfect blend of technology and entrepreneurship, Building High-Tech Product Companies equips entrepreneurs and managers with the tools necessary to grow a technologically driven company, as it delivers insightful information on how to anticipate the market and the technology and develop strategy, while perfecting management techniques.  James Bowen uses the Maelstrom paradigm, which is the simultaneous pull of a Technology Life Cycle, a Product Life Cycle, and an Adoption of Innovation Life cycle on a company.  This offers executives and managers better understanding of market and technology trends to help them form clear strategies for product development and release.  It also includes interviews from dozens of executives from high-tech companies that have introduced successful products into the marketplace.Manufacturing IndustriesCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
