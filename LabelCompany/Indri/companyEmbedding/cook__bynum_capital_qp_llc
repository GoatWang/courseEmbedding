Leverage creates forced sellers, and not just in the financial markets. Balance sheets should be built for all economic conditions. Having financial flexibility when other market participants are gasping for air is a key ingredient in realizing attractive long-term returns on capital.




Learning to Love Volatility »



Nassim Taleb has written a new book that is, in many ways, a description of what works in a world (and markets) that inevitably encounter black swan events.  One of our takeaways is that society should focus less on trying to predict or manage/smooth outlying events, but rather should create and employ frameworks that best navigate them.  We believe that Graham’s insistence on a margin of safety – the heart of value investing – is one of these frameworks.

How to Invest
 





					Objective				

Cook & Bynum seeks long-term growth of capital by making concentrated investments in a select few undervalued domestic and foreign businesses. We do not artificially constrain ourselves by style boxes or other arbitrary factors. Instead, we are opportunistic. We will go anywhere we can find value across geographic regions, industry sectors, and market capitalizations. This pure value investing philosophy has been heavily influenced by the teachings of Benjamin Graham, John Burr Williams, Warren Buffett, and Charles Munger, among others.
To minimize the risk of permanent capital loss and maximize long-term returns, we make our investment selections using the following core criteria:



Circle of Competence
We only invest in businesses whose core economics and future prospects we can understand and reliably predict. We know our ability to recognize our limitations will be as important as our ability to execute competencies.




Business
We seek to invest in companies that have durable competitive advantages that allow them to produce predictable cash flows and earn high returns on equity for extended periods of time. Without sustainable competitive advantages, a company’s results will be difficult to effectively forecast.



People
We invest in companies whose management teams are capable and trustworthy, think and act like shareholders, employ conservative balance sheet and other accounting policies, and make wise capital allocation decisions. The risk of permanent capital loss can be lowered significantly if we only invest in businesses whose managers view shareholders as partners.



Price
We seek to invest in companies whose shares are trading at significant discounts to our estimate of their intrinsic values, as this “margin of safety” serves to both prevent permanent capital loss when we make mistakes and also provide outsized returns when we are correct.


We use fundamental, bottom-up research to carefully assess whether an individual company meets these core criteria. This research often includes, but is not limited to, review and analysis of company filings, discussions with management, visits to company facilities, and conversations with the company’s customers, competitors, and suppliers. When a company appropriately satisfies the first three of these criteria (Circle of Competence, Business, and People), we will value it by projecting the future cash flows expected to be generated by the business and then discounting these ‘‘owner earnings’’ into present-value dollars using an appropriate interest rate. We will only buy a company’s security only as long as it is trading at a large discount to our conservative appraisal of its intrinsic value.

					How We Think				

This manager commentary provides insight into our philosophy and the key tenets that have consistently underpinned our investment approach, which have remained unchanged since our founding. These excerpts are not all-encompassing, though they should provide a clear sense of "how we think" and to our application of a value investing philosophy as pioneered by - among others - Ben Graham, Warren Buffett, and Charlie Munger.




Increasing Our Odds

									As the new Lindley investment reflects, our mandate (i) is focused on finding attractive investments one-by-one and (ii) affords us the flexibility to invest capital only when we think an investment is truly compelling on an absolute basis. We assess individual investment opportunities based on our estimate of their expected returns and the likelihood that the underlying businesses will perform close to our expectations for them. 								

 


A New Investment In Latin America

									Based in Lima, Corporación Lindley SA bottles, distributes, and markets soft drinks, fruit juices, water, sports drinks, and concentrate in Peru. The company has the exclusive rights to produce Coca-Cola products in the country, including Inca Kola, which is the top-selling carbonated drink with a 33% market share (Coca-Cola is a strong #2). We have followed the business for some time, and since the fall of 2014 we have visited Peru three times to meet management and to survey execution at the point of sale. This research suggested that execution could be improved and that certain parts of the business needed more investment.								

 


Thoughts on Walmart & Our Trip to South Africa

									We have been interested in investment opportunities in Africa for several years.  While there are certainly many challenges, the potential to reach a large, young, and growing population should yield some attractive opportunities over time.  As a starting point for better understanding consumers in Africa, Richard spent ten days in South Africa meeting with the management teams of several interesting companies as well as visiting a variety of stores.  He returned very impressed with management at one company in particular, and we hope that we will get the chance to buy this business or one or two others that Richard visited when appropriate margins of safety are present.								

 


Observations from South America & Western Europe

									One of the main reasons to visit a country is to observe firsthand the facts on the ground. Another is to talk to people doing business there who are not primarily reading the English-language media, which means that they often have viewpoints that diverge from ours. Both practices broaden our perspective and give us a worldview that is closer to reality.								

 


The Mystery of the Missing Goods

									A number of recent news accounts have highlighted the increasing scarcity of basic foodstuffs and hygienic products in Venezuela . The situation, which will likely be worse by the time you receive this letter, is a direct result of a series of government policies that are having dire consequences for the country.								

 


Recency Bias, Global Interest Rates, and Return Expectations

									As we demonstrated in our last letter, the rate of return of an asset is inversely related to its price.  That is, as the asset’s price goes up, its future rate of return falls.  So inevitably, at the very time that recent positive returns trigger a feeling of safety because one’s expectation for future returns is growing, the opposite is actually happening.  Risk rises as actual future long-term returns decline.  The inverse is true, as well.								

 


Incentive Misalignment in the Money Management Business

									The benchmark index is by definition fully invested, so inherent in this incentive structure is also the pressure to be fully invested, particularly in a market that has recently risen.  This pressure is greatest at precisely the wrong time.  Expensive securities offer low expected returns and a high risk of permanent capital loss, but a manager’s perception of career risk – even if merely subconscious – can cloud his assessment of value and weaken his discipline. 								

 


Price Matters

									The math of investing is not difficult and can be done with a little division and some basic algebra, but the math is essential.  Buying and selling securities without a fluent understanding of how intrinsic value is calculated is mere speculation.								

 


Determining Intrinsic Value

									We have written extensively in the past about the centrality of intrinsic value in our investment process.  A company’s stock price can sometimes diverge widely from its intrinsic value, which Ben Graham explained thusly, “In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine.”								

 


What to Build (or Buy) in Today’s Opportunity Set

									Based on the historic real rates of return of 3-4% and adding inflation expectations of 2-3%, long-term nominal rates of returns on assets are adequate in the 5-7% range.  Historically, we have used those assumptions as a base and then insisted on a margin of safety by buying assets at a substantial discount to their intrinsic values.  Our goal with this approach is to earn positive returns even when we make mistakes and achieve outsized returns (i.e. above 5-7%) when we are correct.  An investment with a prospective return in the 10-14% range has been our minimum satisfactory expectation (i.e. a hurdle rate) before we will put capital at risk.								

 


The Virtue of Inactivity

									We have heard many variants on this theme from Munger and others over the years, and yet it remains one of the least appreciated aspects of investing. Really great investment opportunities are rare, and our job is to recognize them when they occur and to avoid putting capital in harm’s way in their absence.								

 


Focus On The Customer’s Decision

									Because the size and duration of cash flows are ultimately a function of a company’s competitive advantages our core emphasis as investors is on correctly assessing the sustainability of these advantages.  We believe a critical aspect of this analysis is to understand why a company’s customer makes the decision he does, and whether he is likely to repeat that decision.								

 


Research Trips in Eastern Europe, Greece & Turkey

									We have been fortunate to cover a lot of ground in the last four months.  We took trips to England in March and in May, spent three weeks driving through Central and Eastern Europe in late May and early June, and recently returned from a multi-week trip to Greece and Turkey during the first half of July...								

 


The Mind of a Value Investor

									The human condition is such that investors are rarely deficient in arrogance, but humility in decision making tends to be in short supply.   We are relentlessly trying to impose a system of checks in an effort to resist this negative natural propensity, including constantly challenging the assumptions key to every current and potential holding...								

 


Wal-Mart De Mexico Postmortem

									We have seldom seen a company with competitive advantages as big as those Walmex enjoys – larger than even the advantages Wal-Mart (US) had over its domestic competitors in 1990.  The combination of exceptional operations, the accumulated knowledge of best practices, a deeper management team, and superior access to capital makes Walmex truly an extraordinary business and, to us, perhaps the finest large company in the world. Nonetheless, at the current price we no longer feel that the company trades at an adequate discount to our appraisal of its intrinsic value, which regrettably leads us to sell the business. 								

 


Einstein, CERN and the Limitations of Models

									Ultimately, our models are necessarily inadequate at describing reality, so we spend time thinking through their limitations to avoid mistakes.  We continuously contemplate and discuss how the individual businesses that constitute the Fund’s portfolio are positioned for the unexpected.  Following Einstein’s example, we hypothesize what would alter our expectations for a business, and we recognize that our valuations are just theories, not certainties.								

 


Overpriced Markets

									We do not think it is unreasonable to expect the Fund to underperform in runaway markets and make up for that underperformance in other types of markets. An overpriced market is a substantial risk to a long-term investor, as deploying capital at high price-to-value ensures mediocre long-term performance...								

 


Arca:  Dissecting an Investment

									As a way of further elucidating our investment approach, we wanted to illustrate the research and investment process for one of our major holdings, Embotelladoras Arca, S.A.B. de C.V...								

 


Commitment Bias

									Any honest post-mortem of the investment decisions we have made at Cook & Bynum over the past nearly ten years will reveal plenty of mistakes. We have made mistakes because we lacked perfect information.  We have made mistakes because we improperly processed the information we did have...								

 


Avoiding the Loser and the “Too Hard” Pile

									Short-term quotational changes in the value of a business do not concern us.  We do, however, spend a significant amount of time thinking about how we might suffer permanent capital loss in a holding, as this type of loss is a major obstacle to long-term investment success...								

 


The Importance of Price

									One of our four guiding principles of investing is to be disciplined about the price we pay for any security. Our circle of competence includes many businesses that possess attractive durable competitive advantages and that are run by capable management. However, unless the market offers bargain prices, we cannot build in the appropriate margin of safety your capital deserves when deployed. 								

 


2009 Post Mortem

									When we think about our goals at Cook & Bynum, we are not trying to earn a certain return or accumulate a certain amount of assets. Rather, we are trying simply to execute well a pure, concentrated value investing philosophy on whatever assets we have under management and given whatever opportunities the market presents at that point...								

 


Expanding Our Geographic Circle of Competence

									We can magnify our informational and decision-making edge in such places because a large percentage of Western managers and investment banks simply refuse to bother with such places.  Many that do invest are not doing the type of on-the-ground work that we think gives us an advantage.  The less sophisticated the market participants and the more difficult the research, the greater the likelihood that we can identify good businesses trading at irrationally low prices.								

 


Pricing Power and the Potential Impact of Inflation

									The recent shifts in monetary and fiscal policy in many of the world’s largest economies have made it timely to discuss the effects of inflation on intrinsic value. Pricing power is a key factor to predicting how a business will perform in an inflationary environment...								

 


Greedy When Others Are Fearful

									The first quarter of 2009 saw continued turmoil and fallout from the bursting of the housing bubble.  The broad-based decline of virtually all equity markets around the world continues to present us with attractive buying opportunities...								

 


Making Disciplined Allocation Decisions

									We put little stock in our ability to predict when either the economy or the market will turn around, but our lack of leverage and stable of quality businesses give us the liberty to wait.  And just as importantly, because we own quality businesses, we expect that the fund will both avoid permanent capital loss and earn an acceptable return when the market begins to recognize the intrinsic value of our holdings.  We suspect the returns from holding equity securities in general will be more than satisfactory over the next 20 years from these levels.								

 


“Invert, Always Invert”

									The great 19th century mathematician Carl Jacobi was fond of saying that when you encounter a tough problem, “Invert, always invert.”  This principle has applications in many fields, not the least of which is investing.  The purpose of investing is to make money. Using Jacobi’s principle we ask the question, “How do we not lose money?”								

 


The Danger of Leverage

									As value investors, we make the assumption that the market is irrationally pricing a security now, and we expect the market to value the same security more rationally in the future...								

 


What Does a “Moat” Look Like?

									We often talk about a “moat” around a business. A moat is a sustainable competitive advantage that allows a business to earn outsized returns on capital over time and allows us to better predict the future prospects of a business. We could not buy businesses with conviction without a moat.								

 


The Psychology of Errors

									An important differentiator between our selection process and the processes of the value managers we respect is the time and effort we spend on analyzing how psychological factors affect decision making.  A number of different factors cause people to systematically make mistakes in judgement...								

 


Geometric Means, Kelly Criterion, etc.

									We continuously have in-depth discussions surrounding the purchase or sale of a given security, but there exists another equally important problem for the investor – how to allocate capital between competing qualifying ideas. It is not good enough to simply say, “This is an undervalued business with a high margin of safety..."								

 


“Real” Risk

									We are often asked to discuss our investment philosophy as it relates to our expected long-term returns. Many people making investment decisions today at very large, sophisticated institutions believe that an investment is less risky if it has a smooth progression of returns month after month and year after year...								

 


When “Mr. Market” Frets, Opportunity Knocks

									Diligence when adding new capital is imperative to ensure that existing partners are not diluted out of sizable positions in businesses that we currently own. We have been quite fortunate to acquire new positions and to add to most of our previously-held positions during periods of growth...								

 


Margin of Safety

									We are actively looking for more investments that meet our qualitative criteria of good businesses with a sustainable competitive advantage and with talented, honest management.  If these qualitative criteria were our only concern, we would have dozens of qualifying investment ideas.  However, price is essential to our process.

					Building Our Portfolio				

Establishing and Sizing Positions

We typically build concentrated positions in equity securities as we prefer to invest more capital in our best ideas, recognizing that bigger stakes can be taken when information is adequate and outcomes are more certain.  Our assessment of the attractiveness of each potential investment is informed by our deep research, shaped by our requirement of a ‘margin of safety,’ and driven by the strict application of our core criteria, among other considerations.  This approach reflects our desire to make investments only when we feel that risk is low and potential returns are high.  Consistent with our long-range investment horizon, we define risk as the probability that a business performs materially worse than we predict, leading to a permanent loss of capital rather than a temporary decrease in the quoted price of a stock.  We specifically reject the concept that price volatility is a form of risk, and instead consider it our friend – an opportunity to either buy a business cheaply or sell it dearly.  In fact, because we anticipate being a large net purchaser of companies for the foreseeable future, we welcome low and declining prices to build positions – even in positions we currently hold.  We are only concerned with the intrinsic value of the businesses in which we invest.  Stagnant or declining prices in the face of solid business performance are simply an opportunity to own a greater proportion of the future profits of a business.
 

The position size of and concentration in each of our ideas are influenced by the Kelly Criterion.  Our main takeaway from Kelly is that a position’s size should be a function of both the security’s expected return and its potential range of outcomes, such that:

Although the math cannot be done explicitly in investing, it implies two critical points when thinking about how big a position should be in a portfolio (with the first point being more obvious than the second):
(i)     the larger the expected return, the bigger the position should be, and
(ii)    the larger the possible range of outcomes, the smaller the position should be.
As absolute value investors, we are comfortable holding cash and equivalents in the absence of compelling opportunities that meet our minimum hurdle rate requirements.  It is our obligation to not put our partners’ capital in harm’s way without the prospect of an adequate return, and cash allows us to act quickly in volatile and/or falling markets.  We are staunch adherents to the belief that the avenue to superior returns is being “fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.”  This investment strategy may not be the best way to earn high returns in any given year, but we believe it yields a portfolio that avoids the permanent capital losses endemic to short-term strategies, and earns the highest cumulative returns over a 20+ year time horizon.

Selling Positions
While our long-term approach typically produces low turnover and extended holding periods, we will generally sell a security under the following conditions:
»  We will begin to liquidate an investment when it appreciates to the point that it approaches or moves beyond our estimate of its intrinsic value.  An investment reaching our appraisal may have further upside potential, but it will no longer offer an appropriate margin of safety for putting capital at risk.
»  We will also sell any investment that has a material adverse change in business, management, or return prospects since we invested.  Negative developments by themselves do not necessarily trigger the selling of a position, but should an event lower our appraisal enough or prevent us from reliably appraising the intrinsic value of the investment, we will sell it.  Positive events may cause us to adjust our appraisal of value upwards.  We appraise our positions on an ongoing basis throughout the life of the investment.
»  Based on opportunity cost considerations, we will generally sell relatively overpriced securities to buy relatively underpriced securities as these specific opportunities arise.  This situation happens most often in times of market dislocations or disruptions.

                            Thoughts on Investing                        

                            This manager commentary provides insight into our global, concentrated absolute value investing philosophy and the key tenets that have consistently underpinned our value investing approach.

                            C&B Notes                        

                            The purpose of C&B Notes is to pass along ideas, concepts, stories, and information that are informing and influencing our worldview and “latticework of mental models.”                        




Leverage, Flexibility & Opportunity »



Leverage creates forced sellers, and not just in the financial markets. Balance sheets should be built for all economic conditions. Having financial flexibility when other market participants are gasping for air is a key ingredient in realizing attractive long-term returns on capital.




Learning to Love Volatility »



Nassim Taleb has written a new book that is, in many ways, a description of what works in a world (and markets) that inevitably encounter black swan events.  One of our takeaways is that society should focus less on trying to predict or manage/smooth outlying events, but rather should create and employ frameworks that best navigate them.  We believe that Graham’s insistence on a margin of safety – the heart of value investing – is one of these frameworks.

                            There is no substitute for being on the ground to assess how businesses are really performing. Accordingly, international and domestic travel is a critical component of our research. This Travelogue includes snippets from some of these international trips.
