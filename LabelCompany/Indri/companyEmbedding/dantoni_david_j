The NBAâs coaches have spoken: No one did a better job this season than Miamiâs Erik Spoelstra and Houstonâs Mike DâAntoni. 
Spoelstra and DâAntoni were announced Sunday as co-recipients of the inaugural Michael H. Goldberg NBCA Coach of the Year Award. It is named for the longtime executive director of the National Basketball Coaches Association, who died earlier this year. 
The leagueâs 30 head coaches are the only voters for the NBCA award. A media panel voted separately for the NBAâs Coach of the Year award, which will be announced June 26.
âCongratulations to Mike and Erik on their outstanding work this year,â said Dallas Mavericks coach and NBCA President Rick Carlisle. âAnd somewhere up above our good friend Michael Goldberg is very proud.â

DâAntoni guided the Rockets to the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference and third-best record in the NBA at 55-27, and his team broke the leagueâs regular-season record with 1,181 3-pointers. In his first season on the sidelines in Houston, DâAntoni helped the Rockets win 14 more games than they did a year ago.
DâAntoni, speaking before Houstonâs playoff game with San Antonio on Sunday, said the award shows that many people in the organization â from front office to players â have been doing things the right way.
âWeâre a product of everybody else,â DâAntoni said. âYou try to do your job the best you can. â¦ Without our guys in that locker room, this doesnât even come close to happening.â 
Spoelstra led the Heat on a huge turnaround â after going 11-30 in its first 41 games, Miami went 30-11 in its last 41 games and wound up losing a tiebreaker for the final Eastern Conference playoff spot. It was the biggest first half-to-second half turnaround in NBA history, in a season in which Miami led the league with 328 player games lost to injury or illness.
âNo question, Spo should be coach of the year,â Heat point guard Goran Dragic said.
Other coaches who received votes from their peers were Washingtonâs Scott Brooks, Memphisâ David Fizdale, Golden Stateâs Steve Kerr, Milwaukeeâs Jason Kidd, San Antonioâs Gregg Popovich, the Los Angeles Clippersâ Doc Rivers and Utahâs Quin Snyder.
Spoelstra and DâAntoni will receive their awards at the NBCAâs annual meeting in September. The NBCA says the award will be âpresented annually to a head coach who helps guide his players to a higher level of performance on the court and shows outstanding service and dedication to the community off the court.â

Spoelstra, D'Antoni share NBCA Coach of the Year awardHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0Spoelstra, D'Antoni share NBCA Coach of the Year awardTIM REYNOLDSAssociated PressMay 7, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareView photosFILE - In this Tuesday, April 25, 2017, file photo, Houston Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni yells at the officials during the first half against the Oklahoma City Thunder in Game 5 of an NBA basketball first-round playoff series, in Houston. Erik Spoelstra and DâAntoni are the co-winners of the National Basketball Coaches Associationâs coach of the year award, announced Sunday, May 7, 2017. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip, File)MoreThe NBA's coaches have spoken: No one did a better job this season than Miami's Erik Spoelstra and Houston's Mike D'Antoni.Spoelstra and D'Antoni were announced Sunday as co-recipients of the inaugural Michael H. Goldberg NBCA Coach of the Year Award. It is named for the longtime executive director of the National Basketball Coaches Association, who died earlier this year.The league's 30 head coaches are the only voters for the NBCA award. A media panel voted separately for the NBA's Coach of the Year award, which will be announced June 26."Congratulations to Mike and Erik on their outstanding work this year," said Dallas Mavericks coach and NBCA President Rick Carlisle. "And somewhere up above our good friend Michael Goldberg is very proud."It's the first time Spoelstra has been coach of the year. D'Antoni won the NBA's top-coach award with Phoenix in 2005."Great choices, well deserved in both cases," San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. "Couldn't have done better. We all got to vote on it, so it's coming from we coaches. We're more intimately involved in this than anybody else, and for those two to share it is fantastic because of the jobs they did with their teams. Simple as that."D'Antoni guided the Rockets to the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference and third-best record in the NBA at 55-27, and his team broke the league's regular-season record with 1,181 3-pointers. In his first season on the sidelines in Houston, D'Antoni helped the Rockets win 14 more games than they did a year ago.D'Antoni, speaking before Houston's playoff game with San Antonio on Sunday, said the award shows that many people in the organization â from front office to players â have been doing things the right way."We're a product of everybody else," D'Antoni said. "You try to do your job the best you can. ... Without our guys in that locker room, this doesn't even come close to happening."Spoelstra led the Heat on a huge turnaround â after going 11-30 in its first 41 games, Miami went 30-11 in its last 41 games and wound up losing a tiebreaker for the final Eastern Conference playoff spot. It was the biggest first half-to-second half turnaround in NBA history, in a season in which Miami led the league with 328 player games lost to injury or illness."No question, Spo should be coach of the year," Heat point guard Goran Dragic said.Other coaches who received votes from their peers were Popovich, Washington's Scott Brooks, Memphis' David Fizdale, Golden State's Steve Kerr, Milwaukee's Jason Kidd, the Los Angeles Clippers' Doc Rivers and Utah's Quin Snyder.Spoelstra and D'Antoni will receive their awards at the NBCA's annual meeting in September. The NBCA says the award will be "presented annually to a head coach who helps guide his players to a higher level of performance on the court and shows outstanding service and dedication to the community off the court."ReblogShareTweetSharePopular in the Community8 dead, about 30 injured are found in hot semitrailer in Texas in 'horrific' human-trafficking incident3,731 reactions4%73%23%Eight bodies found in overheated truck in a Walmart in Texas157 reactions4%74%22%Robot finds likely melted fuel heap inside Fukushima reactor499 reactions4%78%18%Teenage cheerleader accused of killing newborn baby and burying it in garden1,495 reactions4%72%24%Venezuelaâs symphony of protests96 reactions4%69%27%President Trump's first six months in office4 reactions0%50%50%Luis Fonsi On Justin Bieber's Spanish, 'Despacito' Hitting No. 1492 reactions3%80%17%Teacher convicted of having sex with her student suing teenage boy for defamation2,136 reactions3%72%25%Saturday Night Live honours Sean Spicer in hilarious Melissa McCarthy tribute to outgoing press secretary948 reactions7%60%33%Mom encourages parents to teach their children about differences after son ridiculed at church1,819 reactions8%63%29%Amazing images of light under desert archways124 reactions15%76%9%Joshua Green: Bannon got 'steamrolled' by Scaramucci appointment1 reactionsHistoric Pearl River Mart Reopens to Bring 'Cross-Cultural Joy' to NYC206 reactions8%68%24%Baby Charlie protesters rally as hospital reports threats427 reactions4%67%29%This is not a typo: Flights to Europe in the fall cost around $300 round-trip right now148 reactions4%75%21%Texas deputy facing charges in deadly altercation at Denny's restaurant terminated3,082 reactions4%66%30%Hillary Clinton is America's BiggestâAnd Most ImportantâLoserGrega: I am liberal and I am glad that we elected Trump for president instead Hillary.Join the Conversation1 / 53.2k

NBA
Spoelstra, DâAntoni share NBCA Coach of the Year award

The NBAâs coaches have spoken: No one did a better job this season than Miamiâs Erik Spoelstra and Houstonâs Mike DâAntoni.
Spoelstra and DâAntoni were announced Sunday as co-recipients of the inaugural Michael H. Goldberg NBCA Coach of the Year Award. It is named for the longtime executive director of the National Basketball Coaches Association, who died earlier this year.
The leagueâs 30 head coaches are the only voters for the NBCA award. A media panel voted separately for the NBAâs Coach of the Year award, which will be announced June 26.




âCongratulations to Mike and Erik on their outstanding work this year,â said Dallas Mavericks coach and NBCA President Rick Carlisle. âAnd somewhere up above our good friend Michael Goldberg is very proud.â
DâAntoni guided the Rockets to the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference and third-best record in the NBA at 55-27, and his team broke the leagueâs regular-season record with 1,181 3-pointers. In his first season on the sidelines in Houston, DâAntoni helped the Rockets win 14 more games than they did a year ago.
DâAntoni, speaking before Houstonâs playoff game with San Antonio on Sunday, said the award shows that many people in the organization â from front office to players â have been doing things the right way.
âWeâre a product of everybody else,â DâAntoni said. âYou try to do your job the best you can. â¦ Without our guys in that locker room, this doesnât even come close to happening.â
Spoelstra led the Heat on a huge turnaround â after going 11-30 in its first 41 games, Miami went 30-11 in its last 41 games and wound up losing a tiebreaker for the final Eastern Conference playoff spot. It was the biggest first half-to-second half turnaround in NBA history, in a season in which Miami led the league with 328 player games lost to injury or illness.
âNo question, Spo should be coach of the year,â Heat point guard Goran Dragic said.
Other coaches who received votes from their peers were Washingtonâs Scott Brooks, Memphisâ David Fizdale, Golden Stateâs Steve Kerr, Milwaukeeâs Jason Kidd, San Antonioâs Gregg Popovich, the Los Angeles Clippersâ Doc Rivers and Utahâs Quin Snyder.
Spoelstra and DâAntoni will receive their awards at the NBCAâs annual meeting in September. The NBCA says the award will be âpresented annually to a head coach who helps guide his players to a higher level of performance on the court and shows outstanding service and dedication to the community off the court.â
