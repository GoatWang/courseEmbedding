The Company will receive no proceeds from this selling shareholders sale.


There are many companies competing in the 34.6 billion dollar Over The Counter
(OTC) analgesic product market. The major players being the Internal analgesic
manufacturers including; Bayer, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Prestige Brands, and
Sanofi all hold a substantial market share and have been dominating this
industry for ages. Bayer leads the category with three main brands known as
Aleve, Bayer Aspirin and Midol. The balance held by these Internal analgesic
product manufacturers has to do with the mix held by private label companies and
others. The major strengths of these major labels are obvious compared to
Zap-Away present market position. The major players have:

. A Manufacturing cost advantage,

. Sophisticated market knowledge and access,

. Established sales capability,

. Strong R&D capacity,

. and of course brand loyalty

An important strength of Zap-Away is that its topical- pain relief is
accomplished without any adverse risk of overdose and without consequent risk of
side effects. This competitive strength is derived from the eversion and the
cataclysmic shift previously noted in the market of Internal analgesic products.
This shift is consumer preference, along with Zap-Away effectiveness and its
ability to be a both a substitute or supplement to these competitors. Management
is fully mindful that mainstream pharmaceutical companies have a watchful eye on
the homeopathic product market and will act accordingly should market share be
eroded due to homeopathic remedies. Becoming an acquisition candidate for any
one of the leading competitors is very realistic goal. Management is committed
to quality product development and in favor of partnering and forming strategic
alliances which would enhance market capability, stimulate growth and
sustainability.

The competition in the Topical analgesic pain market is head-to-head. These
competitors consist of:

* Zostrix Capicasin

* Osmoflex Menthol

* BenGay Menthol

* Aspercreme Tromaline Salicylate

* Icy Hot Menthol

* Tiger Balm Menthol

* Sportscreme Menthol

* Mineral Ice Menthol

The basis for the competitive analysis is Zap-Aways most competitive feature:

* It doesn’t have any aforementioned advantages held by its predecessors-yet

* It doesn’t have a widespread brand recognition-yet.

* It doesn’t have any appreciable market share in the topical analgesic,
  alternative health, or homeopathy-yet.

* It does have a unique patented formula of safe effective ingredients that none
  of the enlisted products have.

Most Topical Analgesic products contain counter-irritants, including camphor,
menthol, methyl salicylate, eucalyptus, wintergreen, and the ever so popular
capsaicin. These ingredients even when blended cause a superficial inflammation
on the skin serving to only hide pain by deadening pain receptors in the skin.
What separates Zap-Away from these inferior products is our enriched all natural
ingredients that stimulate blood flow to the body’s micro-capillaries and act
synergistically with the body's tissue. This promotes self-healing of the body
by getting to the root of the pain treating it at its source. Management feels
that the effective nature of our product will give it clout amongst our
competitors and will evoke consumer awareness.

Although our competitors have been around for quite some time and control the
majority share of the market, they are vulnerable to new product introductions.
Through negative publicity, recalls and individuals continuously seeking
alternative options for a product that actually works to heal and restore using
the body’s natural functions we feel through consumer awareness and the boosted
use of our product will relatively enhance marketability.

Zap-Away will be position and marketed as the superior product to brands such as
Icy Hot, Zostrix, Tiger Balm, Aspercreme and several others. However these
venerated brands, large advertising budgets, and consumer loyalty are formidable
competitive advantages but also give a clear unidentified target market for
immense opportunity. The key indicator is implementing the proper strategy that
will position the brand for immediate resonation to the consumer that will help
create a new segment in the market that is attractive and popular across the
various segments of this industry.

Zap-Away will promote itself as high quality value product that will be priced
competitively and spread out strategically in a position of readiness for quick
purchasing and packaged for convenient on the go usability. The analgesic,
alternative, and homeopathic product market all support pricing based on
perceived value. We will create value in the way the product is advertised,
marketed, used and consumed, we will also look to acquire other brands (not
topical analgesic products) but other products that can complement the brand and
extend its other lines in order to generate sales growth. Zap-Away will monitor
the life cycle of all its competitors closely in order to gain a competitive
advantage and erode market share from the competition.

The best way to compete effectively in this market is to constantly position the
product in the direct sight of consumers. Icy hot a primer leader in the
industry does this constantly through various marketing campaigns, product
versatility, celebrity endorsements, television ads, etc. These techniques have
really registered with the consumer and has created a bond that has built
consistent brand loyalty and stimulated sales growth dramatically. We feel that
this strategy will underscore the importance of Zap-Aways plans and solidify our
market presence outlining the purity, effectiveness and benefits passed directly
to the consumer. Zap-Away will be a reputable opponent for the leading
competition through aggressive marketing and advertising exploits we can
successfully bridge the gap between industry segments and crossover into the
mainstream market relatively easy. This more inclusive formula gives the product
wider applicability on the competitive ingredient/effectiveness basis, the most
critical factor will be creating the resources necessary to promote the product.

Previously denoted prior, the topical analgesic category, including natural
ingredient products, will continue to be influenced through clinical studies,
medical advancements and product innovations. The three main sources of new
competition are as follows:

1. New formulas and/or new innovations of existing ingredients. Some examples
   are products that include ammonium compounds. These products are designed to
   provide pain-relief without the objectionable training smells, burning
   sensation and stinging from abraded skin that are usually caused by the
   overuse of menthol, methyl salicylate, and capsaicin as active ingredients.
   Zap-Aways formula is more high-tech and will serve the consumer more
   favorably.

2. Existing companies who are already increasing market share in this space and
   establishing themselves as major players. Zap-Away plans to position itself
   and become among the elite.

3. Drug chains that stretch across borders may produce their own private label
   homeopathic product and corral a share of this growing market- similar to the
   already proven analgesic product market. This scenario is more likely to
   happen as the homeopathic companies expand the sales volume in this market
   which will strip share points away from the market.

4. Zap-Away can be very competitive with proper execution and the right
   promotional support.
