 CHINA UNITED INSURANCE SERVICE, INC. (OTCMKTS:CUII) Files An 8-K Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

Item1.01. Entry into Material Definitive Agreement



On June 14, 2017, Action Holdings Financial Limited (AHFL), a
wholly-owned British Virgin Islands subsidiary of China United
Insurance Service, Inc. (the Company or CUIS), entered into an
Amendment 3 (the Third Amendment) to Strategic Alliance Agreement
(the Alliance Agreement) with AIA International Limited Taiwan
Branch (AIATW) to further revise certain provisions in the
Alliance Agreement and the previous amendments to the Alliance
Agreement entered into by and between AHFL and AIATW.



On June 10, 2013, AHFL entered into the Alliance Agreement with
AIATW. The purpose of the Alliance Agreement is to promote life
insurance products provided by AIATW within the territory of
Taiwan by insurance agency companies or insurance brokerage
companies affiliated with AHFL or CUIS. The term of the Alliance
Agreement is from April 15, 2013 to August 31, 2018. to the
Alliance Agreement, subject to certain terms and conditions
therein, AHFL is entitled to the payment of an execution fee by
AIATW which will be recorded as revenue upon fulfilling sales
target over the five-year period, including the satisfaction of
the performance targets and the threshold 13-month persistency
ratio. The execution fee may be required to be recalculated if
certain performance targets are not met by AHFL.



On July 25, 2013, AHFL entered into an Amendment to the Alliance
Agreement (the First Amendment) with AIATW. to the First
Amendment, AIATW paid the execution fees to AHFL in accordance
with Section 4 of the Alliance Agreement.



On September 30, 2014, AHFL entered into an Amendment 2 to the
Alliance Agreement (the Old Second Amendment) with AIATW, to
which the expiration date of the Alliance Agreement was extended
from May 31, 2018 to December 31, 2020. In addition, both AHFL
and AIATW agreed to adjust certain terms and conditions set forth
in the Alliance Agreement, including the downward adjustment of
the performance targets as well as the mechanism and formula
calculating the execution fee to be refunded, if any.



On January 6, 2016, AHFL entered into a new Amendment 2 to the
Alliance Agreement (the New Second Amendment) with AIATW to
further revise certain provisions in the Alliance Agreement and
the Old Second Amendment. to the New Second Amendment, the
expiration date of the Alliance Agreement was extended from May
31, 2018 to December 31, 2021, and the effect of the Alliance
Agreement during the period from October 1, 2014 to December 31,
2015 has been suspended. In addition, both AHFL and AIATW agree
to adjust certain terms and conditions set forth in the Alliance
Agreement to, among which: (i) expand the scope of services to be
provided by AHFL to AIATW to include, without limitation,
assessment and advice on suitability of cooperative partners,
advice on product strategies suitable for promotion channel
development, advice on promotion/sales channel improvement,
advice on promotion channel marketing and strategic planning, and
promotion channel talent training; and (ii) remove certain
provisions related to performance milestones and refund of
execution fees. On March 15, 2016, AHFL unilaterally issued a
confirmation letter to AIATW (the 2016 Letter), where it
emphasized its commitment to achieve certain sales targets within
a specific time frame and covenanted to refund certain portion of
execution fees calculated based on the formula therein upon
failure to achieve the applicable sales target, and the Old
Second Amendment was terminated.





       



to the Third Amendment, except for the first contract year (April
15, 2013 to September 30, 2014), the sales targets for the
remaining contract term under the Alliance Agreement shall be
changed by reference to (i) the amount of the value of new
business (VONB) and (ii) the 13-month persistency ratio as set
forth therein, provided that to the extent any underlying
insurance contract is revoked, invalid or terminated and premiums
is refunded to such policyholder, the amount of the related VONB
shall be correspondingly reduced. Both AHFL and AIATW agree to
calculate the business promotion fees (equivalent to the
execution fee referred above) to be returned in case of failure
to achieve the sales targets or the fees to be increased in case
of exceeding the sales targets, as the case may be, based on two
formulas specified in the Third Amendment. The primary factor
under formula one focuses on the annual and/or accumulated
achievement rate(s), while the primary factor under formula two
focuses on the 13-month persistency ratio(s), subject to terms
and conditions therein. The expanded scope of services to be
provided by AHFL to AIATW as set forth in Section 4 of New Second
Amendment is removed under the Third Amendment as well.



On June 14, 2017, with AIATW’s consent, the 2016 Letter has been
revoked in order to conform with the latest terms and conditions
regarding the cooperation between AHFL and AIATW as set forth in
the Third Amendment.



An English translation of the Third Amendment is included as
Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is the legal
document that governs the terms of the cooperation described
therein and the other actions contemplated by the Third
Amendment. The foregoing description of the cooperation does not
purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the complete text of the Third Amendment, which is
filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto, and incorporated herein by
reference.

China United Insurance Service Inc's Comment on Competitors and Industry Peers  

A number of industry players are involved in the distribution of insurance products 
in Taiwan and PRC. We compete for customers on the basis of product offerings, 
customer services and reputation. Because we primarily distribute individual insurance 
products, our principal competitors include:

 Professional insurance intermediaries. Life insurance is our core business 
and has a strong regional feature. Through years of business development, we believe 
that we can compete effectively with other insurance intermediary companies as 
we have a longer operational history and over the years have assembled a strong 
and stable team of managers and sales professionals. With the implementation of 
our unified operating platform, we believe that we could strengthen our lead in 
our developed local regions and expand our operation to our newly selected areas. 
However, with increasing consolidation expected in the insurance intermediary 
sector in the coming years, we expect competition within this sector to intensify.

 Insurance companies. The distribution of individual life insurance products 
in Taiwan and China historically has been dominated by insurance companies, which 
usually use both in-house sales force and exclusive sales agents to distribute 
their own products. We believe that we can compete effectively with insurance 
companies because we focus only on distribution and offer our customers a broad 
range of insurance products underwritten by multiple insurance companies.


 Other business entities. In recent years, business entities that distribute 
insurance products as an ancillary business, primarily commercial banks and postal 
offices have been playing an increasingly important role in the distribution of 
insurance products, especially life insurance products. However, the insurance 
products distributed by these entities are usually confined to those related to 
their main lines of business, such as investment-related life insurance products. 
We believe that we can compete effectively with these business entities because 
we offer our customers a broader variety of products.

	Explanation of Responses:










	(1)

	(2) 





	The total includes the acquisition of (i) 18.0688 shares on 04/08/10; 27.7861 shares on 07/08/10; 30.9044 shares on 10/07/10; 29.9074 shares on 12/30/10; and 30.6378 shares on 04/07/11 which were received in lieu of cash under the Hewlett-Packard Company Dividend Reinvestment/Stock Purchase Plan ("DRIP") in transactions exempt under Rule 16b-3, and (ii) 0.0151 shares on 04/12/10; 0.0182 shares on 07/12/10; 0.0199 shares on 10/12/10; 0.0191 shares on 01/04/11; and 0.0200 shares on 04/07/11 through the broker's dividend reinvestment plan that operates on substantially similar terms to HP's DRIP thereby qualifying for the Rule 16a-11 exemption.
