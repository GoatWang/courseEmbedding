Alphabet Inc. is an American multinational conglomerate created in a corporate restructuring on October 2, 2015.[3] It is the parent company of Google and several former Google subsidiaries.[4][5][6][7][8] The two founders of Google assumed executive roles in the new company, with Larry Page serving as CEO and Sergey Brin as President.[9] The company is based in Mountain View, California. It has over 72,053 employees as of 2017.
Alphabet's portfolio encompasses several industries, including technology, life sciences, investment capital, and research. Some of its subsidiaries include Google, Calico, GV, CapitalG, Verily, Waymo, X, Nest Labs and Google Fiber. Some of the subsidiaries of Alphabet have altered their names since leaving Google—Google Ventures becoming GV, Google Life Sciences becoming Verily and Google X becoming just X. Following the restructuring Page became CEO of Alphabet while Sundar Pichai took his position as CEO of Google.[4][5] Shares of Google's stock have been converted into Alphabet stock, which trade under Google's former ticker symbols of "GOOG" and "GOOGL".
The establishment of Alphabet was prompted by a desire to make the core Google Internet services business "cleaner and more accountable" while allowing greater autonomy to group companies that operate in businesses other than Internet services.[5][10]

History[edit]
On August 10, 2015, Google Inc. announced plans to create a new public holding company, Alphabet Inc. Google CEO Larry Page made this announcement in a blog post on Google's official blog.[5] Alphabet would be created to restructure Google by moving subsidiaries from Google to Alphabet, narrowing Google's scope. The company would consist of Google as well as other businesses including X, CapitalG, and GV.[9][11][12] Sundar Pichai, Product Chief, became the new CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page.[13][14]
In his announcement, Page described the planned holding company as follows:[5][15]

Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies. The largest of which, of course, is Google. This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products contained in Alphabet instead. […] Fundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren’t very related.

As well as explaining the origin of the company's name:

We liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search! We also like that it means alpha‑bet (Alpha is investment return above benchmark), which we strive for!

Page says the motivation behind the reorganization is to make Google "cleaner and more accountable." He also said he wanted to improve "the transparency and oversight of what we’re doing," and to allow greater control of unrelated companies.[5][10]
On February 1, 2016, Alphabet Inc. surpassed Apple to become the world's most valuable publicly traded company until February 3, 2016, when Apple surged back over Alphabet to retake the position. Experts cited Apple's lack of innovation as well as increasing Chinese competition as reasons for the poor performance.[16][17]
Website[edit]
Alphabet has chosen the domain abc.xyz with the .xyz top-level domain (TLD), which was introduced in 2014. It does not own the domain alphabet.com, which is owned by a fleet management division of BMW. BMW has said that it is "necessary to examine the legal trademark implications" of the proposals. It also does not own abc.com, which is the promoted domain of the Disney-owned American Broadcasting Company (though abc.com redirects to a subdomain of go.com, through which most of Disney's sites are hosted).[18][19]
The website features an Easter egg in the paragraph where Larry Page writes, "Sergey and I are seriously in the business of starting new things. Alphabet will also include our X lab, which incubates new efforts like Wing, our drone delivery effort. We are also stoked about growing our investment arms, Ventures and Capital, as part of this new structure." The period after "drone delivery effort" is a hyperlink to "hooli.xyz", a reference to the television series Silicon Valley.[20]
Structure[edit]
Alphabet's largest subsidiary is Google, but Alphabet is also the parent company to Calico, DeepMind, GV, CapitalG, X, Google Fiber, Nest Labs, Jigsaw, Sidewalk Labs, Verily and Waymo. While many companies or divisions formerly a part of Google became subsidiaries of Alphabet, Google remains the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet-related businesses. These include many of the most widely used products and services long associated with Google, such as the Android mobile operating system, YouTube, and Google Search, which remain direct components of Google Inc. and were not made subsidiaries of Alphabet.[9][21]
Proposed growth[edit]
Eric Schmidt said at an Internet Association event that there may eventually be more than 26 Alphabet subsidiaries. He also said that he was currently meeting with the CEOs of the current and proposed Alphabet subsidiaries. He said, "You'll see a lot coming."[22]







Restructuring process[edit]
Alphabet was created as a subsidiary directly owned by Google Inc. The roles of these two companies – one as the owner and the other as the subsidiary – was then reversed in a two-step switch. First, a dummy subsidiary of Alphabet was created. Then Google merged with that dummy subsidiary while converting Google stock to Alphabet stock. Under Delaware law, a holding company reorganization such as this can be done without a vote of shareholders, as this reorganization was.[23]
The restructuring process was completed on October 2, 2015.[3] Alphabet retains Google Inc.'s stock price history and continues to trade under Google Inc.'s former ticker symbols "GOOG" and "GOOGL"; both classes of stock are components of major stock market indices such as the S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100.
Lawsuit[edit]
Alphabet Inc. is suing Uber over technology similar to Alphabet's proprietary self-driving car technology. Alphabet's autonomous vehicle technology has been under development for a decade by Alphabet's Waymo (self-driving vehicle division). The proprietary technology is related to 14,000 documents believed to have been downloaded and stolen by a former Waymo engineer, subsequently employed by Uber.[24][25]

History[edit]
On August 10, 2015, Google Inc. announced plans to create a new public holding company, Alphabet Inc. Google CEO Larry Page made this announcement in a blog post on Google's official blog.[5] Alphabet would be created to restructure Google by moving subsidiaries from Google to Alphabet, narrowing Google's scope. The company would consist of Google as well as other businesses including X, CapitalG, and GV.[9][11][12] Sundar Pichai, Product Chief, became the new CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page.[13][14]

Alphabet has chosen the domain abc.xyz with the .xyz top-level domain (TLD), which was introduced in 2014.

We are also stoked about growing our investment arms, Ventures and Capital, as part of this new structure." The period after "drone delivery effort" is a hyperlink to "hooli.xyz", a reference to the television series Silicon Valley.[20]

Alphabet's largest subsidiary is Google, but Alphabet is also the parent company to Calico, DeepMind, GV, CapitalG, X, Google Fiber, Nest Labs, Jigsaw, Sidewalk Labs, Verily and Waymo.

Alphabet Inc. is an American multinational conglomerate created in a corporate restructuring on October 2, 2015.[3] It is the parent company of Google and several former Google subsidiaries.[4][5][6][7][8] The two founders of Google assumed executive roles in the new company, with Larry Page serving as CEO and Sergey Brin as President.[9] The company is based in Mountain View, California. It has over 72,053 employees as of 2017.
Alphabet's portfolio encompasses several industries, including technology, life sciences, investment capital, and research. Some of its subsidiaries include Google, Calico, GV, CapitalG, Verily, Waymo, X, Nest Labs and Google Fiber. Some of the subsidiaries of Alphabet have altered their names since leaving Google—Google Ventures becoming GV, Google Life Sciences becoming Verily and Google X becoming just X. Following the restructuring Page became CEO of Alphabet while Sundar Pichai took his position as CEO of Google.[4][5] Shares of Google's stock have been converted into Alphabet stock, which trade under Google's former ticker symbols of "GOOG" and "GOOGL".
The establishment of Alphabet was prompted by a desire to make the core Google Internet services business "cleaner and more accountable" while allowing greater autonomy to group companies that operate in businesses other than Internet services.[5][10]

History[edit]
On August 10, 2015, Google Inc. announced plans to create a new public holding company, Alphabet Inc. Google CEO Larry Page made this announcement in a blog post on Google's official blog.[5] Alphabet would be created to restructure Google by moving subsidiaries from Google to Alphabet, narrowing Google's scope. The company would consist of Google as well as other businesses including X, CapitalG, and GV.[9][11][12] Sundar Pichai, Product Chief, became the new CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page.[13][14]
In his announcement, Page described the planned holding company as follows:[5][15]

Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies. The largest of which, of course, is Google. This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products contained in Alphabet instead. […] Fundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren’t very related.

As well as explaining the origin of the company's name:

We liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search! We also like that it means alpha‑bet (Alpha is investment return above benchmark), which we strive for!

Page says the motivation behind the reorganization is to make Google "cleaner and more accountable." He also said he wanted to improve "the transparency and oversight of what we’re doing," and to allow greater control of unrelated companies.[5][10]
On February 1, 2016, Alphabet Inc. surpassed Apple to become the world's most valuable publicly traded company until February 3, 2016, when Apple surged back over Alphabet to retake the position. Experts cited Apple's lack of innovation as well as increasing Chinese competition as reasons for the poor performance.[16][17]
Website[edit]
Alphabet has chosen the domain abc.xyz with the .xyz top-level domain (TLD), which was introduced in 2014. It does not own the domain alphabet.com, which is owned by a fleet management division of BMW. BMW has said that it is "necessary to examine the legal trademark implications" of the proposals. It also does not own abc.com, which is the promoted domain of the Disney-owned American Broadcasting Company (though abc.com redirects to a subdomain of go.com, through which most of Disney's sites are hosted).[18][19]
The website features an Easter egg in the paragraph where Larry Page writes, "Sergey and I are seriously in the business of starting new things. Alphabet will also include our X lab, which incubates new efforts like Wing, our drone delivery effort. We are also stoked about growing our investment arms, Ventures and Capital, as part of this new structure." The period after "drone delivery effort" is a hyperlink to "hooli.xyz", a reference to the television series Silicon Valley.[20]
Structure[edit]
Alphabet's largest subsidiary is Google, but Alphabet is also the parent company to Calico, DeepMind, GV, CapitalG, X, Google Fiber, Nest Labs, Jigsaw, Sidewalk Labs, Verily and Waymo. While many companies or divisions formerly a part of Google became subsidiaries of Alphabet, Google remains the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet-related businesses. These include many of the most widely used products and services long associated with Google, such as the Android mobile operating system, YouTube, and Google Search, which remain direct components of Google Inc. and were not made subsidiaries of Alphabet.[9][21]
Proposed growth[edit]
Eric Schmidt said at an Internet Association event that there may eventually be more than 26 Alphabet subsidiaries. He also said that he was currently meeting with the CEOs of the current and proposed Alphabet subsidiaries. He said, "You'll see a lot coming."[22]







Restructuring process[edit]
Alphabet was created as a subsidiary directly owned by Google Inc. The roles of these two companies – one as the owner and the other as the subsidiary – was then reversed in a two-step switch. First, a dummy subsidiary of Alphabet was created. Then Google merged with that dummy subsidiary while converting Google stock to Alphabet stock. Under Delaware law, a holding company reorganization such as this can be done without a vote of shareholders, as this reorganization was.[23]
The restructuring process was completed on October 2, 2015.[3] Alphabet retains Google Inc.'s stock price history and continues to trade under Google Inc.'s former ticker symbols "GOOG" and "GOOGL"; both classes of stock are components of major stock market indices such as the S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100.
Lawsuit[edit]
Alphabet Inc. is suing Uber over technology similar to Alphabet's proprietary self-driving car technology. Alphabet's autonomous vehicle technology has been under development for a decade by Alphabet's Waymo (self-driving vehicle division). The proprietary technology is related to 14,000 documents believed to have been downloaded and stolen by a former Waymo engineer, subsequently employed by Uber.[24][25]

Alphabet Inc. is an American multinational conglomerate created in a corporate restructuring on October 2, 2015.[3] It is the parent company of Google and several former Google subsidiaries.[4][5][6][7][8] The two founders of Google assumed executive roles in the new company, with Larry Page serving as CEO and Sergey Brin as President.[9] The company is based in Mountain View, California. It has over 72,053 employees as of 2017.
Alphabet's portfolio encompasses several industries, including technology, life sciences, investment capital, and research. Some of its subsidiaries include Google, Calico, GV, CapitalG, Verily, Waymo, X, Nest Labs and Google Fiber. Some of the subsidiaries of Alphabet have altered their names since leaving Google—Google Ventures becoming GV, Google Life Sciences becoming Verily and Google X becoming just X. Following the restructuring Page became CEO of Alphabet while Sundar Pichai took his position as CEO of Google.[4][5] Shares of Google's stock have been converted into Alphabet stock, which trade under Google's former ticker symbols of "GOOG" and "GOOGL".
The establishment of Alphabet was prompted by a desire to make the core Google Internet services business "cleaner and more accountable" while allowing greater autonomy to group companies that operate in businesses other than Internet services.[5][10]

History[edit]
On August 10, 2015, Google Inc. announced plans to create a new public holding company, Alphabet Inc. Google CEO Larry Page made this announcement in a blog post on Google's official blog.[5] Alphabet would be created to restructure Google by moving subsidiaries from Google to Alphabet, narrowing Google's scope. The company would consist of Google as well as other businesses including X, CapitalG, and GV.[9][11][12] Sundar Pichai, Product Chief, became the new CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page.[13][14]
In his announcement, Page described the planned holding company as follows:[5][15]

Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies. The largest of which, of course, is Google. This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products contained in Alphabet instead. […] Fundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren’t very related.

As well as explaining the origin of the company's name:

We liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search! We also like that it means alpha‑bet (Alpha is investment return above benchmark), which we strive for!

Page says the motivation behind the reorganization is to make Google "cleaner and more accountable." He also said he wanted to improve "the transparency and oversight of what we’re doing," and to allow greater control of unrelated companies.[5][10]
On February 1, 2016, Alphabet Inc. surpassed Apple to become the world's most valuable publicly traded company until February 3, 2016, when Apple surged back over Alphabet to retake the position. Experts cited Apple's lack of innovation as well as increasing Chinese competition as reasons for the poor performance.[16][17]
Website[edit]
Alphabet has chosen the domain abc.xyz with the .xyz top-level domain (TLD), which was introduced in 2014. It does not own the domain alphabet.com, which is owned by a fleet management division of BMW. BMW has said that it is "necessary to examine the legal trademark implications" of the proposals. It also does not own abc.com, which is the promoted domain of the Disney-owned American Broadcasting Company (though abc.com redirects to a subdomain of go.com, through which most of Disney's sites are hosted).[18][19]
The website features an Easter egg in the paragraph where Larry Page writes, "Sergey and I are seriously in the business of starting new things. Alphabet will also include our X lab, which incubates new efforts like Wing, our drone delivery effort. We are also stoked about growing our investment arms, Ventures and Capital, as part of this new structure." The period after "drone delivery effort" is a hyperlink to "hooli.xyz", a reference to the television series Silicon Valley.[20]
Structure[edit]
Alphabet's largest subsidiary is Google, but Alphabet is also the parent company to Calico, DeepMind, GV, CapitalG, X, Google Fiber, Nest Labs, Jigsaw, Sidewalk Labs, Verily and Waymo. While many companies or divisions formerly a part of Google became subsidiaries of Alphabet, Google remains the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet-related businesses. These include many of the most widely used products and services long associated with Google, such as the Android mobile operating system, YouTube, and Google Search, which remain direct components of Google Inc. and were not made subsidiaries of Alphabet.[9][21]
Proposed growth[edit]
Eric Schmidt said at an Internet Association event that there may eventually be more than 26 Alphabet subsidiaries. He also said that he was currently meeting with the CEOs of the current and proposed Alphabet subsidiaries. He said, "You'll see a lot coming."[22]







Restructuring process[edit]
Alphabet was created as a subsidiary directly owned by Google Inc. The roles of these two companies – one as the owner and the other as the subsidiary – was then reversed in a two-step switch. First, a dummy subsidiary of Alphabet was created. Then Google merged with that dummy subsidiary while converting Google stock to Alphabet stock. Under Delaware law, a holding company reorganization such as this can be done without a vote of shareholders, as this reorganization was.[23]
The restructuring process was completed on October 2, 2015.[3] Alphabet retains Google Inc.'s stock price history and continues to trade under Google Inc.'s former ticker symbols "GOOG" and "GOOGL"; both classes of stock are components of major stock market indices such as the S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100.
Lawsuit[edit]
Alphabet Inc. is suing Uber over technology similar to Alphabet's proprietary self-driving car technology. Alphabet's autonomous vehicle technology has been under development for a decade by Alphabet's Waymo (self-driving vehicle division). The proprietary technology is related to 14,000 documents believed to have been downloaded and stolen by a former Waymo engineer, subsequently employed by Uber.[24][25]

This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products contained in Alphabet instead. […] Fundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren’t very related.

As well as explaining the origin of the company's name:

We liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search! We also like that it means alpha‑bet (Alpha is investment return above benchmark), which we strive for!

Page says the motivation behind the reorganization is to make Google "cleaner and more accountable." He also said he wanted to improve "the transparency and oversight of what we’re doing," and to allow greater control of unrelated companies.[5][10]
On February 1, 2016, Alphabet Inc. surpassed Apple to become the world's most valuable publicly traded company until February 3, 2016, when Apple surged back over Alphabet to retake the position. Experts cited Apple's lack of innovation as well as increasing Chinese competition as reasons for the poor performance.[16][17]
Website[edit]
Alphabet has chosen the domain abc.xyz with the .xyz top-level domain (TLD), which was introduced in 2014. It does not own the domain alphabet.com, which is owned by a fleet management division of BMW. BMW has said that it is "necessary to examine the legal trademark implications" of the proposals. It also does not own abc.com, which is the promoted domain of the Disney-owned American Broadcasting Company (though abc.com redirects to a subdomain of go.com, through which most of Disney's sites are hosted).[18][19]
The website features an Easter egg in the paragraph where Larry Page writes, "Sergey and I are seriously in the business of starting new things. Alphabet will also include our X lab, which incubates new efforts like Wing, our drone delivery effort. We are also stoked about growing our investment arms, Ventures and Capital, as part of this new structure." The period after "drone delivery effort" is a hyperlink to "hooli.xyz", a reference to the television series Silicon Valley.[20]
Structure[edit]
Alphabet's largest subsidiary is Google, but Alphabet is also the parent company to Calico, DeepMind, GV, CapitalG, X, Google Fiber, Nest Labs, Jigsaw, Sidewalk Labs, Verily and Waymo. While many companies or divisions formerly a part of Google became subsidiaries of Alphabet, Google remains the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet-related businesses. These include many of the most widely used products and services long associated with Google, such as the Android mobile operating system, YouTube, and Google Search, which remain direct components of Google Inc. and were not made subsidiaries of Alphabet.[9][21]
Proposed growth[edit]
Eric Schmidt said at an Internet Association event that there may eventually be more than 26 Alphabet subsidiaries. He also said that he was currently meeting with the CEOs of the current and proposed Alphabet subsidiaries. He said, "You'll see a lot coming."[22]







Restructuring process[edit]
Alphabet was created as a subsidiary directly owned by Google Inc. The roles of these two companies – one as the owner and the other as the subsidiary – was then reversed in a two-step switch. First, a dummy subsidiary of Alphabet was created. Then Google merged with that dummy subsidiary while converting Google stock to Alphabet stock. Under Delaware law, a holding company reorganization such as this can be done without a vote of shareholders, as this reorganization was.[23]
The restructuring process was completed on October 2, 2015.[3] Alphabet retains Google Inc.'s stock price history and continues to trade under Google Inc.'s former ticker symbols "GOOG" and "GOOGL"; both classes of stock are components of major stock market indices such as the S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100.
Lawsuit[edit]
Alphabet Inc. is suing Uber over technology similar to Alphabet's proprietary self-driving car technology. Alphabet's autonomous vehicle technology has been under development for a decade by Alphabet's Waymo (self-driving vehicle division). The proprietary technology is related to 14,000 documents believed to have been downloaded and stolen by a former Waymo engineer, subsequently employed by Uber.[24][25]

Alphabet Inc. is an American multinational conglomerate created in a corporate restructuring on October 2, 2015.[3] It is the parent company of Google and several former Google subsidiaries.[4][5][6][7][8] The two founders of Google assumed executive roles in the new company, with Larry Page serving as CEO and Sergey Brin as President.[9] The company is based in Mountain View, California. It has over 72,053 employees as of 2017.
Alphabet's portfolio encompasses several industries, including technology, life sciences, investment capital, and research. Some of its subsidiaries include Google, Calico, GV, CapitalG, Verily, Waymo, X, Nest Labs and Google Fiber. Some of the subsidiaries of Alphabet have altered their names since leaving Google—Google Ventures becoming GV, Google Life Sciences becoming Verily and Google X becoming just X. Following the restructuring Page became CEO of Alphabet while Sundar Pichai took his position as CEO of Google.[4][5] Shares of Google's stock have been converted into Alphabet stock, which trade under Google's former ticker symbols of "GOOG" and "GOOGL".
The establishment of Alphabet was prompted by a desire to make the core Google Internet services business "cleaner and more accountable" while allowing greater autonomy to group companies that operate in businesses other than Internet services.[5][10]

History[edit]
On August 10, 2015, Google Inc. announced plans to create a new public holding company, Alphabet Inc. Google CEO Larry Page made this announcement in a blog post on Google's official blog.[5] Alphabet would be created to restructure Google by moving subsidiaries from Google to Alphabet, narrowing Google's scope. The company would consist of Google as well as other businesses including X, CapitalG, and GV.[9][11][12] Sundar Pichai, Product Chief, became the new CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page.[13][14]
In his announcement, Page described the planned holding company as follows:[5][15]

Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies. The largest of which, of course, is Google. This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products contained in Alphabet instead. […] Fundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren’t very related.

As well as explaining the origin of the company's name:

We liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search! We also like that it means alpha‑bet (Alpha is investment return above benchmark), which we strive for!

Page says the motivation behind the reorganization is to make Google "cleaner and more accountable." He also said he wanted to improve "the transparency and oversight of what we’re doing," and to allow greater control of unrelated companies.[5][10]
On February 1, 2016, Alphabet Inc. surpassed Apple to become the world's most valuable publicly traded company until February 3, 2016, when Apple surged back over Alphabet to retake the position. Experts cited Apple's lack of innovation as well as increasing Chinese competition as reasons for the poor performance.[16][17]
Website[edit]
Alphabet has chosen the domain abc.xyz with the .xyz top-level domain (TLD), which was introduced in 2014. It does not own the domain alphabet.com, which is owned by a fleet management division of BMW. BMW has said that it is "necessary to examine the legal trademark implications" of the proposals. It also does not own abc.com, which is the promoted domain of the Disney-owned American Broadcasting Company (though abc.com redirects to a subdomain of go.com, through which most of Disney's sites are hosted).[18][19]
The website features an Easter egg in the paragraph where Larry Page writes, "Sergey and I are seriously in the business of starting new things. Alphabet will also include our X lab, which incubates new efforts like Wing, our drone delivery effort. We are also stoked about growing our investment arms, Ventures and Capital, as part of this new structure." The period after "drone delivery effort" is a hyperlink to "hooli.xyz", a reference to the television series Silicon Valley.[20]

Restructuring process[edit]
Alphabet was created as a subsidiary directly owned by Google Inc. The roles of these two companies – one as the owner and the other as the subsidiary – was then reversed in a two-step switch.

Alphabet













































Alphabet




is for Google

As Sergey and I wrote in the original founders letter 11 years ago, “Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one.” As part of that, we also said that you could expect us to make “smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to our current businesses.” From the start, we’ve always strived to do more, and to do important and meaningful things with the resources we have. more
We did a lot of things that seemed crazy at the time. Many of those crazy things now have over a billion users, like Google Maps, YouTube, Chrome, and Android. And we haven’t stopped there. We are still trying to do things other people think are crazy but we are super excited about.
We’ve long believed that over time companies tend to get comfortable doing the same thing, just making incremental changes. But in the technology industry, where revolutionary ideas drive the next big growth areas, you need to be a bit uncomfortable to stay relevant.
Our company is operating well today, but we think we can make it cleaner and more accountable. So we are creating a new company, called Alphabet. I am really excited to be running Alphabet as CEO with help from my capable partner, Sergey, as President.
What is Alphabet? Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies. The largest of which, of course, is Google. This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products contained in Alphabet instead. What do we mean by far afield? Good examples are our health efforts: Life Sciences (that works on the glucose-sensing contact lens), and Calico (focused on longevity). Fundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren’t very related.
Alphabet is about businesses prospering through strong leaders and independence. In general, our model is to have a strong CEO who runs each business, with Sergey and me in service to them as needed. We will rigorously handle capital allocation and work to make sure each business is executing well. We’ll also make sure we have a great CEO for each business, and we’ll determine their compensation. In addition, with this new structure we plan to implement segment reporting for our Q4 results, where Google financials will be provided separately than those for the rest of Alphabet businesses as a whole.
This new structure will allow us to keep tremendous focus on the extraordinary opportunities we have inside of Google. A key part of this is Sundar Pichai. Sundar has been saying the things I would have said (and sometimes better!) for quite some time now, and I’ve been tremendously enjoying our work together. He has really stepped up since October of last year, when he took on product and engineering responsibility for our internet businesses. Sergey and I have been super excited about his progress and dedication to the company. And it is clear to us and our board that it is time for Sundar to be CEO of Google. I feel very fortunate to have someone as talented as he is to run the slightly slimmed down Google and this frees up time for me to continue to scale our aspirations. I have been spending quite a bit of time with Sundar, helping him and the company in any way I can, and I will of course continue to do that. Google itself is also making all sorts of new products, and I know Sundar will always be focused on innovation—continuing to stretch boundaries. I know he deeply cares that we can continue to make big strides on our core mission to organize the world’s information. Recent launches like Google Photos and Google Now using machine learning are amazing progress. Google also has some services that are run with their own identity, like YouTube. Susan is doing a great job as CEO, running a strong brand and driving incredible growth.
Sergey and I are seriously in the business of starting new things. Alphabet will also include our X lab, which incubates new efforts like Wing, our drone delivery effort. We are also stoked about growing our investment arms, Ventures and Capital, as part of this new structure.
Alphabet Inc. will replace Google Inc. as the publicly-traded entity and all shares of Google will automatically convert into the same number of shares of Alphabet, with all of the same rights. Google will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alphabet. Our two classes of shares will continue to trade on Nasdaq as GOOGL and GOOG.
For Sergey and me this is a very exciting new chapter in the life of Google—the birth of Alphabet. We liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity’s most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search! We also like that it means alpha‑bet (Alpha is investment return above benchmark), which we strive for! I should add that we are not intending for this to be a big consumer brand with related products—the whole point is that Alphabet companies should have independence and develop their own brands.
We are excited about…

Getting more ambitious things done.
Taking the long-term view.
Empowering great entrepreneurs and companies to flourish.
Investing at the scale of the opportunities and resources we see.
Improving the transparency and oversight of what we’re doing.
Making Google even better through greater focus.
And hopefully… as a result of all this, improving the lives of as many people as we can.

What could be better? No wonder we are excited to get to work with everyone in the Alphabet family. Don’t worry, we’re still getting used to the name too!

Alphabet, Inc. Key Developments

Alphabet Announces the Launch of the Next Phase of Development for its 'Icon' SME Technology Platform
Nov 30 16
Alphabet announced the launch of the next phase of development for its 'icon' SME technology platform. This is the culmination of a significant financial investment to enhance the overall leasing experience for Alphabet's SME customers, retailers and brokers. The 'icon' platform - a bespoke system originally developed for the launch of Alphabet Partner in late 2014 - has been significantly upgraded and now provides an easy-to-use quotation tool for both brokers and the Alphabet's Business Partnership Programme retailer channel. The new approach simplifies and streamlines the increasingly complex leasing options for SMEs. By putting dynamic, real-time pricing information from Alphabet at the fingertips of brokers and retailers, 'icon' provides business leasing customers with an experience more akin to that of a retail customer. 'icon' allows brokers and retailers to virtually walk a customer around the car to build both the vehicle and the leasing contract to the customer's precise specification and requirements. Once a customer has chosen their vehicle and options, the advanced calculation engine at the heart of the 'icon' system performs literally thousands of quotes per second which are then visualised in the unique 'Deal Selector'. These are graphically displayed so that the broker or retailer can see the full spectrum of options including initial and monthly payment, contract term and mileage options available to help the customer choose which best suits their needs. In addition, the 'icon' system features a visual 'Carousel' displaying exclusive, limited, real-time vehicle offers and provides brokers and retailers with a completely trackable, end-to-end sales platform from quote through to paperless invoice. There is even the ability to easily compare vehicle quotations between all types of powertrain or solely electric and PHEV ones. All of which gives brokers and retailers the tools to meet SME customers' needs and stay in touch more easily, as well as enabling them to help customers make better, more informed decisions on business vehicles.

Google has announced that it will be folding itself into a larger company, called Alphabet. The new “slimmed down” Google, as current CEO Larry Page put it, will now be run by Sundar Pichai, hitherto the company’s product chief. Pichai will manage Google’s core businesses—like search and advertising. Alphabet will essentially be a holding company for Google, as well as all the projects, crazy ideas, capital investments, and subsidiaries that Google has acquired over the years. Page will stay on as the CEO of Alphabet, and Google co-founder Sergey Brin will be its president. 
And it’s a pretty fitting name, seeing as there is in fact a project, business or product of Google’s—sorry, Alphabet’s—for each letter of the alphabet. (Though it’s not yet clear in every case which of these will be run as Alphabet business units separate from Google.) Hopefully Page will be able to keep them all straight.

Here Are The Nine Companies Under Alphabet Inc. 
January 12, 2016 - Written By Kishalaya Kundu


 

In an unexpected move back in mid-August, Google announced a major restructuring of the company, whereby all its non-core businesses were spun off as distinct entities that are separate from Google’s bread and butter internet and related assets such as search, ads (AdSense), Google Maps, Google Apps, DeepMind (Artificial Intelligence research unit), Google ATAP research and of course, Android – all of which will continue to remain under the Google brand. A new holding company called Alphabet Inc. was created, which functions as the parent company for the new, streamlined Google, as well as all other diverse and often unwieldy businesses. Most of the top management, meanwhile, kept their old designations at the new entity, once the new structure became functional last October, after getting the necessary regulatory clearances.
What that means in essence, is that the two Google co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin are now the CEO and the President respectively at Alphabet, having held those two exact positions at the old Google at the time of the restructuring. Eric Schmidt and David Drummond have transitioned from being the Chairman and Chief Counsel respectively at Google, to functioning in the exact same capacities at Alphabet. The then-CFO at Google, Ruth Porat, has assumed duties as the new CFO of both Google and Alphabet, post restructuring. Meanwhile, the then-VP of products at Google, Sunder Pichai, has since taken over as the CEO of the single most valuable entity within the Alphabet setup – Google Inc.
While there are as many as nine distinct companies currently within the Alphabet fold, another one is widely expected to join the list anytime now. That would be the autonomous car project that has thus far been a part of Google X. Google – and Alphabet – however, have been maintaining a studied silence regarding the issue thus far. The current list of Alphabet companies include Google, of course, along with Nest, the home automation company and makers of the eponymous thermostat. The company was acquired by Google back in January 2014, but continues to be headed by its celebrated co-founder and ex-Apple employee, Tony Fadell. Then there is Access and Energy – the company that’s responsible for the Gigabit broadband service, Fiber. Verily, the company that was known as Google Life Sciences, comes next, followed by Calico, Google’s biotech venture that looks to combat aging and associated illnesses.
Next comes Sidewalk labs, an Alphabet-owned company that looks to improve urban living by tackling issues such as pollution, energy usage and transportation. Coming to Alphabet’s Investment arm, Google Capital is an equity fund that’s headed by David Lawee, whereas the Venture Capital division of the company, GV (formerly Google Ventures), is led by Bill Maris. Last, but definitely not the least, is Google X, which is a hotbed for wacky and out-there research including Project Wing, a drone delivery service; Project Loon, a service that aims to provide internet connectivity via balloons in the stratosphere; and Google Glass – the controversial augmented reality eyewear that never quite caught on with mainstream consumers the way Google would have wanted it to. While the robotics unit of the company – Replicant – was initially a separate company under Alphabet, it was recently incorporated within Google X.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM)  32.75 (07/25/17)      EPS (TTM)  $29.59      Market Cap $684.34 B     Shares Outstanding 297.63 M     Public Float 297.08 M     Yield GOOGL has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.

Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest (07/14/17)    Shares Sold Short 2.79 M     Change from Last  14.18%      Percent of Float 0.94%       ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.89      Net Money Flow ($)  -167.64 M    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

From cards to electronics, our wide selection of games includes something for everyone. Whether you're shopping for puzzles or prefer interactive electronics, Walmart carries the classics as well as the newest items available. For years, board games have kept little ones and adults engaged for hours. From puzzle making to strategic thinking, the focus of many toys is to educate and entertain at the same time. Start a collection of character-themed games based on popular movies and TV series. If you're shopping for preschoolers, consider choices that nurture cognitive- and memory-development skills as well as reinforce color recognition. Teach kids about the basics of counting with math-based games that build confidence. Stocking up on games for your home entertainment center or a child's playroom has never been easier. The selections you'll find at Walmart will take center stage at backyard parties and birthday celebrations. If you're having a contest, there are plenty of exciting options that build suspense and keep everyone guessing. Getting ready for a road trip is the ideal time to pick up a few card games to pack in your luggage to occupy your backseat passengers. With Walmart's Every Day Low Prices, it's easy to find games for everyone on your shopping list. Many games come in original and deluxe versions.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147349563, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-
