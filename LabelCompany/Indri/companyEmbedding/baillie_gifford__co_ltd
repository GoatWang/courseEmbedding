                Accessibility
            


We recognise the importance of making our website accessible for all our users.  The following details how we have approached accessibility on www.bailliegifford.com.  
 
Navigation
All areas of our website are available through accessible links. Any user who has javascript disabled will be able to access all areas of the site regardless. Our navigation is accessible through screen readers to make it available to all users.
 
Headings and navigation menus
HTML heading tags are used to convey document structure. H1 tags are used for main titles, H2 tags for subtitles etc.
Navigation menus are marked up as HTML lists. This ensures that the number of links in the list is read out at the start and it can be skipped easily.
 
Images
All images used in this site include descriptive alt tag attributes. Where an image has no use other than being decorative the alt tag is set to null to allow easy reading of the site by all users.
 
Colours
We have taken care to ensure that the site's font and background colour combinations contrast significantly and are effective in ensuring information is still clear when viewed in different colour combinations.
If you wish to override the site's colours, you can do this by changing your browser settings to your own preference.
 
Font size
Most of the font sizes we use on our site are sizable. You can change the font size to make it either larger or smaller via your browser settings.
You can change the font size in the following ways depending on your browser;

In Internet Explorer; select View, then Text Size, and then your preferred size.
In FireFox; select View, then Zoom, and then Zoom in or Zoom out to alter the text size.
In Safari; click on display icon (top right) and select Zoom, Click Zoom in or Zoom out to change font size.

 
Stylesheets
This site uses cascading style sheets for all visual layout. If your browser or browsing device does not support stylesheets at all, the use of structured semantic mark up ensures that the content of each page is still readable and clearly structured.
You can apply your own stylesheet onto this website by;

Internet Explorer; select Tools, then Internet Options, then Accessibility, next click on any or all 3 checkboxes to ignore colours, font styles or font sizes, in the same window you can change your style sheet by clicking the checkbox that says, 'format document using my style sheet' then browse to your style sheet and click OK.
In Firefox; select Main Menu, then View and then Page Style and No Style. Select Basic Page Style to restore the page styling. 
In Safari; click on the Develop in the main menu and Disable Styles.
Note: If the Develop Menu item isn’t available on the main menu, then Select preferences in the Display a Menu of General Safari Settings and click on Preferences. Select the Advanced Tab and click on Show Develop menu in bar

 
Tables
Most data tables have properly scoped header cells, to allow screen readers to render them intelligently. We have also ensured table summaries are used as well as captions where appropriate. Tables used for layout use none of the above attributes to ensure that they are not confused with data tables.
 
Forms and fields
All forms fields follow a logical tab sequence to ensure easy navigation.
Most form fields also have ‘label’ and ‘id’ attributes to explicitly associate the form field with its label to allow for easy entry of data.
 
JavaScript
This site uses JavaScript to render some areas of the site, including tools and navigation items. Where it is used all pages and process are still accessible should Javascript be turned off.
 
Links
All links have been written to make sense when taken out of context. Where appropriate, we have also added link title attributes to describe the link in greater detail.
 
Copy
Abbreviation and acronym tags have been used where appropriate to ensure abbreviations and acronyms are given a full textual explanation.
We have also ensured that blockquotes are only ever used for identifying quotations. They are not used for formatting purposes.

Contact the Elderly | About Us | Baillie Gifford



























Contact the Elderly








Contact the Elderly

Each year Baillie Gifford invites staff to nominate a small local charity as its Charity of the Year. Nominations are only accepted for small charities where Baillie Gifford's support will make a real impact on the services they provide. A shortlist is produced, and staff then vote for the charity they would like the firm to support.
The chosen charity for 2015/16 was Contact the Elderly, a local charity dedicated to tackling loneliness and isolation among older people.
The backbone of Contact the Elderly is its volunteers, who host the tea parties and drive the elderly to and from each event. This includes a number of staff from Baillie Gifford, some of whom spoke about their experience of volunteering for the charity
















You can tell that these parties mean so much to the guests and it’s something they clearly look forward to.






Hannah Dobson – Compliance Analyst
“I was really nervous when I picked up my guests for the first time, but I had no need to be. We had lots to chat about and there was so much laughter – it was like we had known each other for years.
“It’s fantastic to see the older guests connect with each other. In fact, two of the ladies I pick up went to school together and hadn’t seen each other for around 75 years until they attended the same tea party. They still recognised each other after all that time and they instantly connected over past friendship.
“You can tell that these parties mean so much to the guests and it’s something they clearly look forward to.”
Tracey Squires – Compliance Policies and Training Co-ordinator
“I have wanted to volunteer for a long time, but I struggled to find something that wasn’t too time intensive. Since the Contact the Elderly tea parties only take place once a month, it’s perfect for me as it’s not too much of a time commitment.
“The older people love telling us stories from their youth, and last week when I was in the car with one of the guests, we drove past the church where she got married in 1948. It’s a real honour to be in the company of people who have done so much in their lives.
“We are all going to get older and it’s nice to know that Contact the Elderly is there, looking out for us and our loved ones. I think that’s why the charity resonates with so many people.”
Jessie Wilson – Client Service Manager
“I’ve only recently become a driver for Contact the Elderly. Lack of free time previously held me back from volunteering but being a driver for the charity only involves a few hours once a month.
“It’s been amazing to see the elderly guests get out of the house and be in the company of a group of people, enjoying some conversation.
“I find volunteering for Contact the Elderly very enjoyable, so it doesn’t feel like I’m going out of my way to help people. It has given me the opportunity to meet some lovely people, who have great life stories, all while I get to enjoy eating some cake, too!”
Máirín Eydmann – Project Manager
“I was part of the Baillie Gifford Habitat for Humanity team last year, which was a great experience. I really enjoyed going to Ethiopia and working with the local community. The experience made me want to seek out an opportunity to work with my local community in Edinburgh.
“When I heard that Contact the Elderly was looking for volunteers, it seemed like a good fit for me. I’m a keen baker, so hosting tea parties meant that I could combine my enthusiasm for baking with volunteering.
“I also enjoy socialising with our elderly neighbours, so extending that to tea party guests was the natural thing for me to do. And volunteering for Contact the Elderly is no hardship. I get to have great conversations with the group and eat cake. It’s a fantastic way to spend a Sunday afternoon.”
Dorothy Green – Receptionist
“I had been thinking about volunteering for a while, so when Contact the Elderly became our charity of the year, it seemed like the ideal opportunity.
“I’m so glad I got involved with the charity. I am now the driver of a lovely 90-year-old lady and together we go along to a tea party hosted by a Baillie Gifford volunteer, one Sunday each month.
“There are six older ladies in the group along with six Baillie Gifford drivers plus the host and we spend two hours chatting over cups of tea and delicious cakes. The whole process is very rewarding, and above all enjoyable. I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who might be considering volunteering.”
Sarah Mitchell – Investment Assistant
“I was keen to get involved in some charity work in my local area when I heard about Contact the Elderly through Baillie Gifford.
“I’m a volunteer driver for a lovely lady, who is 98 years old. She had a great time at the tea party, which got her out of the house and gave her the chance to meet new people. I also really enjoyed chatting to her and hearing more about her life.
“My first tea party was great – it’s nice to spend an afternoon listening to the group’s stories. I’m already looking forward to my next tea party.”

Our Story | About Us | Baillie Gifford



























Our Story








CULTURE
In a nutshell Baillie Gifford has fostered a culture based on partnership, rigorous research methods and an investment philosophy that focuses on growth over the long term.





From our Edinburgh base, we have been able to harness this intellectually curious yet rigorous approach – where the sharing of ideas and robust debate between our investment teams is central to our investment process.
The result is a successful business that continues to grow organically. We now have £166 billion under management and advice in specialist equity, fixed income and multi-asset portfolios for a global client base.







                FOCUS ON CLIENTS
            


We would be nothing without our clients. That may seem obvious, but can easily be overlooked. All too often the financial sector will chase new business to the detriment of existing clients.
At Baillie Gifford, existing clients’ interests are paramount and we frequently close our products to new business to ensure that the integrity of our strategies and the quality of service are maintained. This commitment to professional excellence ensures clients receive our full attention.Thanks to our partnership structure we are free to focus entirely on our long-term vision to deliver the best results for our clients without the distraction of short-term shareholder demands.
This single-minded approach has enabled us to enjoy relationships with clients that have spanned generations.
Today we manage money on behalf of some of the world’s largest institutional investors. We manage international portfolios for US and Canadian clients and have a blue chip client base covering corporate, public and foundation assets. We have had Asian Clients since 1989 and we manage funds for some of Continental Europe’s leading pension funds and financial institutions.Our broad geographical exposure also encompasses institutional clients in Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Thailand, Korea, the Middle East and South Africa.








Thanks to our partnership structure we are free to focus entirely on our long-term vision to deliver the best results for our clients.





PARTNERSHIP
Since 1908 when Baillie Gifford was founded as an investment partnership, the firm has been wholly owned by the people who invest for and look after our clients.





Through each successive generation of partners, our singular focus on generating superior long-term investment results for our clients has been the bedrock of our own growth. Baillie Gifford today is wholly owned by its 43 partners – all of whom work within the firm. Growth has been organic, with no mergers or acquisitions, and we are committed to remaining independent.
This partnership style is rare among large investment management companies and creates one key advantage; with no external shareholders demanding short-term gains, we can focus solely on what we do best, seeking out long-term investment returns for our clients.
The organisational stability created by this ownership structure means that we can recruit and retain some of the best people in the industry.
And partnership encourages personal responsibility, creating a strong culture of questioning, debate and respectful trust in which the finest investment minds are nurtured and thrive.
This, in turn, means we can continue to find the best long-term investment opportunities. It’s a virtuous circle that has served us well for over a century.







                LONG TERM
            


Baillie Gifford are long-term investors, not speculators. Our investment philosophy focuses on growth while our universe is global. In equities, our belief is that sustained growth in company profits leads to higher share prices over time. In bonds, we take a differentiated investment approach, which focuses on long-term prospects rather than the potential for short-term price movements.
Our rigorous process of fundamental analysis and proprietary research, combined with a depth of expertise, are core to a successful, long-term, bottom-up investment approach. This allows us to exploit global opportunities over periods of, typically, five years or more. It’s a philosophy that has guided our investment strategy for 108 years, so no one can say we don’t practice what we preach.








We are not interested in following fads and fashions or pursuing short-term performance. We are active investors, driven to deliver value-added performance after fees, over the long term.





CAPABILITIES
We actively manage specialist equity, fixed income and multi-asset portfolios for a global base. As at 30 June 2017, we have £166bn under management.





EQUITIES
In markets seduced by complexity, we believe in keeping things simple. We invest in what we believe to be the most competitive, innovative and efficient growth companies.
Over a century of global investment experience has taught us that patience is vital, so we build long-term, committed portfolios that aim to anticipate the next decade, not the next quarter. Most importantly, we love what we do and we don’t invest by rote or by numbers alone. Our analysts conduct rigorous, qualitative, fundamental analysis to determine whether to invest. We know that the equity markets may not agree with us, and that’s okay; it’s more profitable to lead than to follow, and we never stop questioning or challenging the status quo.  
FIXED INCOME
We are different. We are truly active investors, looking to construct focused portfolios of long-term investments. With a global opportunity set, we invest in government bonds and currencies, emerging market bonds, investment grade and high yield. Our highly experienced investors undertake rigorous proprietary analysis focused on fundamental investment characteristics to identify attractive opportunities around the world. We recognise that the asymmetric nature of bonds, with capped upside, makes risk management key to achieving our investment objective and it is integral to our approach.
MULTI ASSET
We don’t believe in limiting our investment opportunities. Listed equities, property, high yield credit, commodities, emerging market government bonds and insurance linked securities – these are just some of the asset classes we invest in. It is our core belief that diversifying across asset classes can reduce risk without significantly reducing returns. Maximising our investment opportunities raises the likelihood of finding individually attractive asset classes and also helps us to achieve a balanced and well-diversified portfolio. We focus only on absolute risk and absolute return, considering an asset class for its ability to enhance returns or reduce volatility. We offer our clients access to a broad mix of asset classes through the convenience of a single actively-managed portfolio.
 








From Edinburgh, our research covers the globe. We set no barriers to the imagination of our investors, encouraging fresh perspectives and the use of diverse sources of information.







                RESEARCH
            


In short, we’re curious about the world. And we truly believe that the best investment ideas spring from thinking about future possibilities, not short-term probabilities.
We appreciate of course that the world is complex but we believe that the way to generate long-term returns for our clients is to focus on the deceptively simple task of identifying and investing in those companies which have the potential to grow at a faster rate, on a more sustainable basis, than their peers.So we conduct rigorous qualitative research to establish whether prospective investments have the competitive, financial and strategic advantages to deliver on that potential. And we love to share our insights.
Our investment ideas are discussed and debated across our investment teams, from those of the most junior analysts to partners of the firm. We are always looking for that novel insight, offbeat observation or penetrating challenge to help round out the investment case and enhance our collective knowledge.
And because there are no enduring right answers in investment, we never stop asking questions.

Corporate Governance |About Us |Baillie Gifford



























Corporate Governance








Overview
Well-managed companies are more likely to make successful, long-term investments for our clients.




Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues span our investment universe. Whether it be the impact of increasing carbon legislation on fossil fuel companies or director remuneration in the banking sector, as long-term active managers we need to ensure that we are assessing the issues that are relevant, not just to the companies we invest in, but to the world as a whole.
Our dedicated Corporate Governance Team works with our fund managers to assess ESG concerns both before and after we invest in a company.
As long-term investors, we seek to build relationships with investee companies and therefore management attitudes to shareholders are important to us. We look to engage with management to discuss topics directly related to the investment case. That might include everything from strategy, capital management and board composition, to remuneration, environmental impact and reputational risk.




















I think corporate governance is absolutely central to how we go about investing at Baillie Gifford because we are bottom-up stock-pickers, we are owners of businesses rather than renters of shares.

            What is the Fund’s objective?


        The objective is to produce capital growth over the long term by investing primarily in the shares of companies that are either domiciled, incorporated or conduct a significant portion of their operations in one or more of mainland China, Hong Kong or Taiwan. The ACD will determine what constitutes conducting a significant portion of a company’s operations in a country and in doing so the ACD will consider various factors including whether the majority of the company’s revenues or profits are derived from or the majority of its assets are in that country.  The Fund may also invest in shares of companies that are listed in mainland China, Hong Kong or Taiwan. From time to time the portfolio may be concentrated and contain around only forty stocks.Up to (but no more than) 10% in value of the Fund may be invested in each of the following: collective investment schemes and deposits.
