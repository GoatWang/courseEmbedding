Previously an executive with Alliance Boots, Barra’s responsibilities grew considerably with the official creation of Walgreens Boots Alliance in December 2014. The supersized pharmacy chain—Barra helped lead the integration of the two companies—has 370,000 employees and a market cap of $96 billion. Barra’s role at the new company, which is headed by her partner Stefano Pessina, is likewise staggering: she runs the pharmaceutical wholesale business, which spans 19 countries and a network of 200,000 some pharmacies and healthcare providers, as well as international retail. She’s also now spearheading Walgreen Boots Alliance’s corporate social responsibility efforts and supervises global communications. —Erika Fry

Barra earned another promotion in June—her third in three years—to co-COO of Walgreens Boots Alliance, the $103 billion global pharmacy chain that is run by her partner Stefano Pessina. (Though the recently merged, much-enlarged entity is based in Chicago, Barra, who oversees, among other things, international retail and global brands, is based in Europe.) Indeed, the scope of Barra’s responsibilities is vast: she also leads the company’s Pharmaceutical Wholesale division—which extends to 200,000 healthcare providers in 19 countries—as well as supply chain, communications, HR and IT functions. Barra, an Italian who began her career as a pharmacist, built her own small business before merging it with Pessina’s in the 1980s. They kept building—and hundreds of deals later, their company ranks No. 47 on Fortune’s Global 500.

Biography[edit]
Ornella Barra was born in December 1953[6] in Chiavari, Genoa, northwest Italy,[7][8] into a family of entrepreneurs.[9] Having graduated as a pharmacist from the University of Genoa in 1979,[7] she worked at the start of her career as a manager of a pharmacy which she then acquired.[citation needed] After building up a regional pharmaceutical distribution company, Di Pharma, she later sold the business to Alleanza Farmaceutica, founded and managed by Italian entrepreneur Stefano Pessina, which later grew to become Italy's leading pharmaceutical wholesaler. He and Barra became partners in both personally and professionally, sharing a house in Monaco.[10]
Career[edit]

In 1984, Barra founded a pharmaceutical distribution company in Italy and was made managing director two years later, the same year the company was acquired by Alleanza Salute Italia[13] (now Alliance Healthcare Italia). During this time, Barra also contributed to the creation of Alliance Santé, the Franco-Italian group with interests spanning Europe, and was made Board member in 1990.[14] Following Alliance Santé's merger with UniChem in 1997, she then went on to become a Board member and Executive Director of Alliance Unichem.[15]
Barra is an honorary professor[16] of the University of Nottingham's School of Pharmacy, where she delivers lectures on the four-year MPharm degree. Barra will also act in an advisory capacity to assist the school in the further development of the course and has joined the external advisory board for the school's activity at the University's Malaysia Campus, where it runs the first two years of an MPharm degree accredited by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain.[17] She is active in the European Pharmacists Forum, an organisation that supports European Pharmacists, discussing new ideas.[citation needed]

Biography[edit]
Ornella Barra was born in December 1953[6] in Chiavari, Genoa, northwest Italy,[7][8] into a family of entrepreneurs.[9] Having graduated as a pharmacist from the University of Genoa in 1979,[7] she worked at the start of her career as a manager of a pharmacy which she then acquired.[citation needed] After building up a regional pharmaceutical distribution company, Di Pharma, she later sold the business to Alleanza Farmaceutica, founded and managed by Italian entrepreneur Stefano Pessina, which later grew to become Italy's leading pharmaceutical wholesaler. He and Barra became partners in both personally and professionally, sharing a house in Monaco.[10]
Career[edit]
Barra is co-chief operating officer of Walgreens Boots Alliance.[2] Walgreens Boots Alliance was created through the combination of Walgreens and Alliance Boots in December 2014.[11]
The Pharmaceutical Wholesale Division is present in 19 countries and supplies more than 180,000 pharmacies, doctors, health centres and hospitals from 340 distribution centres. Moreover, it supports a large network of independent pharmacies and operates a number of owned pharmacies. Barra also oversees International Retail, which includes main business units (Thailand, Norway, The Netherlands, Mexico and Chile), as well as China and The Gulf.[12]
In 1984, Barra founded a pharmaceutical distribution company in Italy and was made managing director two years later, the same year the company was acquired by Alleanza Salute Italia[13] (now Alliance Healthcare Italia). During this time, Barra also contributed to the creation of Alliance Santé, the Franco-Italian group with interests spanning Europe, and was made Board member in 1990.[14] Following Alliance Santé's merger with UniChem in 1997, she then went on to become a Board member and Executive Director of Alliance Unichem.[15]
Barra is an honorary professor[16] of the University of Nottingham's School of Pharmacy, where she delivers lectures on the four-year MPharm degree. Barra will also act in an advisory capacity to assist the school in the further development of the course and has joined the external advisory board for the school's activity at the University's Malaysia Campus, where it runs the first two years of an MPharm degree accredited by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain.[17] She is active in the European Pharmacists Forum, an organisation that supports European Pharmacists, discussing new ideas.[citation needed]
Barra is the chair of the WBA Social Responsibilities Committee [12] In April 2013, Barra was appointed to the board of directors of Assicurazioni Generali, Italy's largest insurance company.[18]

European Pharmacists Forum (EPF)[edit]

The EPF brings together the 150,000 pharmacist customers of Walgreens Boots Alliance to facilitate the discussion of new ideas, the sharing of best practice and the exchange of positive dialogue between public authorities and manufactures. The EPF members represent 10 countries: the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, the Czech Republic, The Netherlands, Switzerland, Turkey and Germany.[21]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
