You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

Robert E. Lee





   
 



A Bouncer Son 
 It takes years in cattle breeding to be able to say with certainty
what animals were especially treasured in the breed.  It is rare indeed to find an
animal that passes on his positive characteristics in the purest form, (his offspring look
exactly like him).  Sadly, most animals are dead by the time this fact is
discovered.  Only through modern genetic techniques is it possible to use such
animals in the breed long after their deaths. 
We are offering you this possibility in the new bull Robert E. Lee.  Robert
brings the genetic security of the three most proven bulls together in one animal, Aron (Egg), Nelson (Metmenstetten), and Willabar Bouncer 3G.  In the North American Braunvieh
Breeding program, these are without a doubt the most legenday bulls of the last 30
years.  You can read about them on this web site.  It is important to note that
these are three independent bloodlines.
Robert E. Lee is the product of embryo transfer technology between one of the nicest
Nelson cows and Willabar Bouncer 3G.  If you saw Bouncer when he was alive, you will
immediately see his characteristics in Robert.  Robert has 4 full sisters, all of
them look extremely similar. 
As Robert is used during the summer in natural breeding, it is only possible to collect
semen during the winter months.  This is the reason that there are only several
thousand straws available per year.  As there is interest in his semen worldwide, and
since it is being offered for a special introductory price, it is highly recommended that
you order early.  Much of it has been pre sold.
  
Here are some photos of Robert's 1998 male offspring.  These F1 crossbred steers are
11 months old and show perfectly the characteristics of the bull Bouncer.  They were
shipped to market on the first load out at 13 months of age.
 
Here are some photos of Robert's 1998 female offspring.  These heifers are 11 months
old and also show the Bouncer characteristics.
 
Photo of Bouncer sons. (Brothers to Robert)
