Education[edit]
Kassam started school at Bayview Glen School in 1994.

Career[edit]
Anson Group[edit]
In 2007, Kassam founded Anson Group, a hedge fund with three core strategies: classic shorts, value longs and opportunistic investments.[1] He is the primary Portfolio Manager of AIMF, a multi-strategy investment fund. AIMF was ranked 9th on the BarclayHedge Top 30 Hedge Fund List for performance between February 2010 and June 2012, generating a 54.25% return.[8]
Bloomberg Markets Magazine ranked AIMF in the top 10 mid-sized hedge funds for generating an annual return of 24% in 2014.[3]
In 2015, AIMF generated a return of 16.2%.[9] "The performance was driven by many small stock picks, especially bets on their decline" with a net neutral exposure.[9] AIMF was also recognized by Bloomberg for its 2015 performance making the Top-Performing Funds (between $250 million to $1 billion in assets).[10]
Anson Group was ranked 69 in Barron's 2016 Best 100 Hedge Fund's list with a 14.5% 3 year compound return [11]
Timothy Sykes, an American penny stock trader and entrepreneur mentions that Kassam has '"a few-thousand-to-millions-like" stories similar to himself. He is also invested in Kassam's Anson Funds.[12]
Board Memberships[edit]
Kassam is a board member of the Young Presidents Organization (YPO).[13] In this position he has contributed to the Ronald McDonald House Charities Toronto.[14] Kassam also serves on the board of Kids Cook to Care,[15] a charitable organization, which, through the use of food, shows youth they can make a difference in their world.[16] Kassam was recently added to the Advisory Council of IAF Canada (Immigrant Access Fund), which supports newcomers who arrive in Canada while equipping them with professional skills and knowledge.[17] Moez is also a board member for Reh'ma Community Services, a non-profit organization that focuses on seniors, women and new comers to fully participate in the social, economic, and civil life of Canada.[18]
Moringa Media Ltd.[edit]
Since 2011, Kassam has been an Executive Producer at Moringa Media Ltd.: a multi-media production company.[19] It uses technological innovation to create various artistic commodities and create content for clients.[19] Kassam merges the world of business and art through his involvement in Moringa Media projects, which are oriented towards the film and television production departments.[20]

Personal life[edit]
Kassam, a Toronto foodie, hosted a dinner party with Franco Stalteri, where he prepared "chicken tikka, beef mishkaki and sikh kebabs." [21] One of Kassam’s favourite dishes in Toronto is the Spaghetteni Ai Gamberi from Carisma (right) - he described the dish as “the dream of Toronto.” [22]
He is a judge of Canada's 100 Best Restaurants and Vacay Food.[23][24]
Kassam has been noted for donating to the University of Toronto,[25] The Toronto Rehab Foundation,[26] and to Better Together.[27] He was a top five fundraiser of Chef's Challenge: The Ultimate Battle for a Cure, raising more than $18,000. Kassam is a part of the IAF (Immigrant Access Fund) Advisory Council and a committee member of the Toronto Taste Steering Committee.[28][29]
Moez Kassam is the Fundraising Lead for the Ryerson University Lifeline Syria Challenge (RULSC), an event where universities based in Toronto work together to assist with the humanitarian crisis in Syria by mobilizing communities to bring and resettle Syrian refugees throughout Canada.[30] He also hosted a charitable dinner for the homeless at Homes First, a social service agency working to provide affordable, permanent housing and transitional supports for homeless or those who have few options.[31] Furthermore, he was also able to invite Abdulaziz Sachedina to join Emmanuel College at the University of Toronto as a Distinguished Visiting Professor of Islamic Studies.[32]

In 2015, AIMF generated a return of 16.2%.[9] "The performance was driven by many small stock picks, especially bets on their decline" with a net neutral exposure.[9] AIMF was also recognized by Bloomberg for its 2015 performance making the Top-Performing Funds (between $250 million to $1 billion in assets).[10]
Anson Group was ranked 69 in Barron's 2016 Best 100 Hedge Fund's list with a 14.5% 3 year compound return [11]
Timothy Sykes, an American penny stock trader and entrepreneur mentions that Kassam has '"a few-thousand-to-millions-like" stories similar to himself. He is also invested in Kassam's Anson Funds.[12]

He is a judge of Canada's 100 Best Restaurants and Vacay Food.[23][24]
Kassam has been noted for donating to the University of Toronto,[25] The Toronto Rehab Foundation,[26] and to Better Together.[27] He was a top five fundraiser of Chef's Challenge: The Ultimate Battle for a Cure, raising more than $18,000. Kassam is a part of the IAF (Immigrant Access Fund) Advisory Council and a committee member of the Toronto Taste Steering Committee.[28][29]
