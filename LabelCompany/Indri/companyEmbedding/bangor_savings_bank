 by STAFF

Bangor Savings Bank has expanded its footprint outside Maine for the first time, announcing that it recently opened a loan production office in Portsmouth, N.H.The move into New Hampshire follows a decade of strong growth in Maine's York and Cumberland counties for the Bangor-based bank, which has 16 locations in southernmost Maine and 54 throughout the state."We look forward to bringing the same high-quality personal and business lending services and products to the Portsmouth region as we have provided to Mainers for over 165 years," Bangor Savings President and CEO Bob Montgomery-Rice said in a news release announcing the move into New Hampshire.Montgomery-Rice joined other bank executives and members of the Portsmouth community at Portsmouth's 100 Club in making that announcement last Thursday.The new office, located at 36 Maplewood Ave. in Portsmouth, will include a team of commercial and mortgage lenders; additional staff would follow as necessary. The bank plans to expand the office's business services to include payroll and merchant offerings after it receives the required regulatory approvals.Bangor Savings Bank has 800 employees and has recorded 16 consecutive years of earnings growth, with a record net income of nearly $25 million and more than $3.6 billion in assets in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.Other Maine-based banks also see New Hampshire as a growth area, most notably Bar Harbor Bank & Trust, which acquired Newport, N.H.-based Lake Sunapee Bank Group in an all-stock deal valued at around $143 million earlier this year.

Online shopping is convenient, sparing you the hassle of having to drive back and forth to brick-and-mortar stores, the cost of the gasoline to get there and the frustration of waiting in long lines.
However, buying something online doesn't necessarily mean that you'll be getting a deal. You might end up spending more if you are not careful.
Fortunately, you can avoid overspending by shopping around before you make an online purchase. The best news is that doing this is not much of a hassle. There are several price comparison sites on the Web that can help you complete your comparison-shopping in minutes.
The Federal Trade Commission provides several tips for consumers who want to buy a product online. The most important? You need to think about your goals before you start shopping. The Federal Trade Commission recommends that you decide whether you want a product that is at the top of its line or one that is budget-priced. The commission recommends that you identify particular brands that you like and calculate your shopping budget before you start your online hunt for refrigerators, cars or tablets.
It is important, too, for consumers to read online reviews of products. Almost anything you'd want to buy online comes with customer reviews. These reviews can help you determine whether the flat-screen TV you are thinking of buying is a hit or a dud. You can also hunt online for coupons or discount offers, which many manufacturers offer to Web-based shoppers.
Once you've done your preliminary research, it is time to search the many comparison-shopping services on the Internet. These sites allow you to type in a particular product -- say the latest PlayStation video game -- and pull up the prices that these products are being sold at by various online merchants.
You can use these sites to compare not only prices, but also shipping options and costs to determine which online retailer provides the best overall value.
Google Shopping is probably the most popular, and largest, comparison-shopping engine today. Type a product in this engine -- anything from board games and video games to furniture and hardware -- and you'll be sure to find plenty of online buying options.
However, Google Shopping is far from your only choice. Other popular comparison-shopping engines include PriceGrabber and Nextag, both of which have their loyal fans and will provide a wide variety of results for just about any product you can imagine.
Shopping.com is a good way to find the lowest-priced products on online auction house eBay. That is because Shopping.com is part of the eBay family of companies. This site is a good one if you are looking for the best deals available on the traditional auction site.
Shopzilla is another biggie, having operated since 1996. The site is especially useful if you are searching for DVDs, CDs and other electronic items.
Online shopping takes much of the hassle out of buying. However, it does not eliminate all of them, and neither do price-shopping engines. It is true that these comparison-shopping engines can help you find the lowest prices for a broad range of products. However, remember that the product with the lowest price tag is not always the product that you should buy. Never purchase a product online based on price alone.
Before making a purchase, read the reviews of the merchant offering the product. These reviews will tell you whether the merchant has a history of delivering products on time, selling products that work or responding quickly to consumer complaints. If you do not do this research before buying? You might get stuck with a product that doesn't work while trying to contact the merchant that doesn't respond to your email messages or phone calls.to your email messages or phone calls.

                            With the rising costs of college, families are taking a multigenerational approach to planning for education and other life goals.
                        





It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.
With the costs of higher education trending higher each year, paying for college has become a top-tier life expense, alongside other big-ticket goals like buying a home and planning for retirement. However, education costs have now skyrocketed to the extent that saving for both of those life goals—retirement and home-buying—has become hampered in some families.

Some parents are cutting back on retirement savings contributions to help fund their children’s education.  At the same time, children are entering their 20’s with student loan debt, which in some cases is delaying the purchase of their first home. Even grandparents have modified life goals, choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now, rather than leaving a larger legacy later.
In short, paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern. But with a little advance planning, families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college. 





The Growing Cost of Education



According to the College Board's latest “Trends in Higher Education" report, the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes, financial aid and many consumer goods and services. It now costs, on average, $45,370 per year for tuition, fees, room and board, for a four-year private college. Assuming a college-cost inflation rate of 3%, today’s 8-year-old child may need $255,090 come college time in 2027.
“For parents, the number-one goal from a financial planning perspective is still retirement, but close behind is paying for a child’s education,” says Marc Dextraze, Executive Director, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions.

One option, says Dextraze, is for parents to start saving early with a 529 college savings plan.  “Having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on, avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans," he says. For the child, “Having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options, like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals, as opposed to the college that offers the most aid. And graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom."
Named after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, a 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save, or even pay in advance, for college expenses. Earnings in a 529 plan can be tax deferred, and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition, fees, room and board and supplies. Many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that.





Making Education a Family Affair



Motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education, grandparents, relatives and even family friends have also begun creating 529 accounts in a child’s name. Not only do 529 plans offer potential tax advantages, they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt.
“Today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college," says Jennifer Tierney, Vice President, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions and 529 plans product manager. “It's so important to plan ahead. For grandparents, aunts and uncles, family friends, it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that 529 plans provide to a child and from a tax-perspective, to themselves.”

A Flexible Way to Save and Invest for College



The appeal of 529 plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility.
There are no income restrictions, no required minimum distributions, no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own, generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account, and high contribution limits. Virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child, grandchild, niece, nephew, spouse, even a friend.1
According to Chris Stack, a managing consultant at Savingforcollege.com, one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the 529 account, as opposed to a UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) or UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act) account or other strategy. “With 529s, grandparents or extended family give themselves an option, but not an obligation, to apply their funds to help pay college costs," he says. 


Another significant benefit of 529 plans is tax-free compounding. “Earning on an account’s growth, rather than paying taxes on the earnings, provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality," Stack says. “Having the ability to withdraw the principal and tax-deferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit, especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account."
Stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible. While as soon as the child is born is ideal, he said, some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future."
Says Dextraze, “At the end of the day, the idea is to harmonize all of your goals, taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there, including 401Ks, 529s and others. It’s using all of the available tools. That’s how you reach your goals.”


Morgan Stanley offers many 529s from some of the nation’s leading mutual fund companies. You can choose from a range of investment strategies depending on the specific plan, the age of the beneficiary, your financial objectives and risk tolerance. Talk with your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor, or find one using the locator below, for more information. 
















1 Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes, and beneficiary changes may result in an immediate tax liability if the new beneficiary is not a member of the old beneficiary’s family. Contribution limits vary by state. Refer to the individual plan for specific guidelines.


Disclosures
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses associated with 529 plans and municipal fund securities before investing. More information about municipal fund securities is available in the issuer's official statement – the 529 Plan Program Disclosure – which is available from your Financial Advisor. It should be read carefully before investing.
Investments are subject to market risk and may fluctuate in value. Before investing, investors should consider whether tax or other benefits are only available for investments in the investor’s home-state 529 college savings plan. Assets can accumulate and be withdrawn federally tax-free only if they are used to pay for qualified expenses. Earnings on nonqualified distributions will be subject to income tax and a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some states offer favorable tax treatment and other benefits to their residents only if they invest in the state’s own Qualified Tuition Program. Investors should consult with their financial and tax advisor before investing in any 529 plan, or contact their state tax division for more information.
