Protalex Announces Appointment of Marco M. Elser to Its Board of Directors | Business Wire


























































Protalex Announces Appointment of Marco M. Elser to Its Board of 
      Directors






February 05, 2014 08:30 AM Eastern Standard Time



FLORHAM PARK, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Protalex, Inc. (OTCQB:PRTX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, 
      today announced that Marco M. Elser has been appointed to its Board of 
      Directors. Mr. Elser is a partner with AdviCorp Plc, a London-based 
      investment banking firm. Mr. Elser’s appointment fills the vacancy on 
      the Board resulting from the untimely passing of John Doherty last 
      month. Mr. Doherty was a co-founder of Protalex and served as a director 
      and a member of its Scientific Advisory Board since November 2009.
    

      From 1994 to 2001, Mr. Elser served as International Vice President of 
      Northeast Securities, managing distressed funds for family offices and 
      small institutions. Prior to that, from 1985 through 1995, he served as 
      a First Vice President of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in Rome and 
      London. Mr. Elser served on the Board of Directors of Pine Brook 
      Capital, a Shelton, CT-based engineering company from 2007 to 2012 and 
      was its Chairman from 2009 through 2012. He is presently a director 
      (since 2002) of North Hills Signal Processing Corporation, a Long 
      Island, NY-based technology company and a director (since 2012) of 
      Trans-Lux Corporation, a Norwalk, CT-based designer and manufacturer of 
      digital signage display solutions. Mr. Elser is also the president of 
      the Harvard Club of Italy, an association he founded in 2002 with other 
      alumni in Italy where he has been living since 1984. He received his BA 
      in Economics from Harvard College in 1981.
    

      Commenting on Mr. Elser’s appointment, Arnold Kling, President of 
      Protalex noted, “We expect that Marco’s extensive knowledge of 
      international finance and commerce will allow him to make valuable 
      contributions to the Board as we enter an exciting growth period for 
      Protalex. We are deeply appreciative of his willingness to join the 
      Board and assist us in advancing the development and commercialization 
      of our lead drug PRTX-100.”
    

      James W. Dowe III, Vice Chairman of the Protalex Scientific Advisory 
      Board, commented on the loss of the Company’s founder, “John’s 
      unfettered dedication, passion and commitment to finding a more 
      effective and cost efficient clinical treatment for rheumatoid arthritis 
      has been a driving force in Protalex’s history and in the various 
      initiatives to date. He will be deeply missed by me and my colleagues at 
      Protalex. He was one of a kind.”
    

About Protalex, Inc.


      Protalex, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on 
      the development of a class of drugs for treating autoimmune and 
      inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Protalex’s 
      lead product, PRTX-100, is a formulation of a proprietary, highly 
      purified form of Staphylococcal Protein A, which is an immunomodulatory 
      protein produced by bacteria. Protalex has completed a Phase 1b clinical 
      trial in adult patients with active RA in South Africa which 
      demonstrated that PRTX-100 was generally safe and well tolerated at all 
      dose levels, and at the higher doses, more patients showed improvement 
      in their CDAI (Clinical Disease Activity Index) for RA than did patients 
      at the lower dose or placebo cohorts. PRTX-100 has the ability, at very 
      low concentrations, to bind to human B-lymphocytes and macrophages and 
      to activate processes that mediate inflammation in certain autoimmune 
      diseases. Laboratory studies indicate that the mechanism involves 
      interaction with specific immunologic signaling pathways. The safety, 
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of PRTX-100 have now been 
      characterized in four clinical studies, with a fifth U.S. study nearing 
      completion.
