A post-election rally left Marriott (MAR) hotels up 53% since the end of October, with Hilton Worldwide (HLT), Wyndham Worldwide (WYN) and Holiday Inn owner InterContinental Hotels (IHG) close behind.

Interesting LQ Put And Call Options For December 15th
Investors in La Quinta Holdings Inc saw new options begin trading this week, for the December 15th expiration.

Short Interest Decreases By 15.6% For LQ
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 11/15/2016 settlement date, which shows a 557,714 share decrease in total short interest for La Quinta Holdings Inc , to 3,021,086, a decrease of 15.58% since 10/31/2016. Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
