Dennis J. Maggi, CAE
Executive Director
TITLE: Attorney Admitted to American College of Trial Lawyers
RELEASE DATE: IMMEDIATE
 
Tim C. Holleman of Gulfport, Mississippi has become a Fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers, one of the premier legal associations in America.
The induction ceremony at which Tim C. Holleman became a Fellow took place recently before an audience of 1,150 persons during the recent 2003 Annual Meeting of the College in Montreal, Canada.
Founded in 1950, the College is composed of the best of the trial bar from the United States and Canada. Fellowship in the College is extended by invitation only and only after careful investigation, to those experienced trial lawyers who have mastered the art of advocacy and whose professional careers have been marked by the highest standards of ethical conduct, professionalism, civility and collegiality. Lawyers must have a minimum of fifteen years trial experience before they can be considered for Fellowship.
Membership in the College cannot exceed one per cent of the total lawyer population of any state or province. There are currently approximately 5,200 members in the United States and Canada, including active Fellows, Emeritus Fellows, Judicial Fellows (those who ascended to the bench after their induction) and Honorary Fellows.
The College strives to improve and elevate the standards of trial practice, the administration of justice and the ethics of the trial profession. Qualified lawyers are called to Fellowship in the College from all branches of trial practice. They are carefully selected from among those who customarily represent plaintiffs in civil cases and those who customarily represent defendants, those who prosecute accused of crime and those who defend them. The College is thus able to speak with a balanced voice on important issues affecting the legal profession and the administration of justice.
Tim C. Holleman is a partner in the law firm of Boyce Holleman & Associates, 1913 15TH Street,  Gulfport, Mississippi. The newly inducted Fellow is a graduate of The University of Mississippi, BA, 1974 and the University of Mississippi, School of Law, January 1981. He was born in Wiggins, Mississippi in 1956 and moved to Gulfport in 1967. He has practiced law with his father, Boyce Holleman, deceased, and brother, Dean Holleman, for more than 22 years. He is married to Lisa and has two children, Addle and Matthew
