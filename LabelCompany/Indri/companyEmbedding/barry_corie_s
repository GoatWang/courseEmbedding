CFO Corie Barry takes key role in Best Buy's surge
 Pushed to succeed, she is doing just that amid Best Buy's surge.

Corie Barry was groomed by Sharon McCollam to succeed McCollam as CFO of Best Buy, a career-building service she tries to pay forward to other women.

Corie Barry never saw herself in one of the top jobs at Best Buy.
That began to change in the fall of 2012 when she met her new boss at the nation's largest electronics chain. Barry was a vice president at the time, waiting to meet the company's next chief financial officer and fully expecting a man in a suit.
Instead, she did a double take when the petite Sharon McCollam breezed in, wearing an impeccable dress and designer shoes along with an air of confidence and friendliness.


"I literally thought I might run up and hug her," said Barry, 42, in a recent interview over sushi at the company's Richfield headquarters. "I felt like my whole life had changed."
In many ways, it did. McCollam, who became a key figure in Best Buy's storied turnaround, immediately saw potential in Barry and began grooming Barry to be her successor. Last year, when McCollam retired, Barry replaced her as the CFO of the $40 billion company.
Soon after, Barry was stunned to discover she was one of only about 70 female CFOs in the Fortune 500, or less than 15 percent. It was a stark reminder of how much of a glass ceiling remains in the executive suites and boardrooms of corporate America. While growing in number, there are still only about 32 female CEOs among the nation's largest 500 companies.

"It really blew my mind when I first looked up the stats," Barry said at a recent women in business event in Minneapolis.
But it's been a different story at Best Buy in recent years. Barry is part of a major sea change in the retailer's C-Suite, where women now hold nearly half the positions — and at times have outnumbered men. And 40 percent of Best Buy's board members are women, compared with the nationwide average of 20 percent.
In addition to matching online prices and partnering with some of the tech industry's biggest brands, company executives and industry analysts say a key ingredient of Best Buy's turnaround has been building a diverse and high-caliber leadership team.
"It's no accident that it had a good number of women on it," Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly said. "For us, it's part of our secret weapon."
It's a significant change for a company long dominated by men, as well as a stark contrast to the headlines coming out of Silicon Valley these days, where recent sexual harassment scandals at places like Uber have given the tech industry a reputation for hostility to women.
New visibility
In her role as CFO, Barry has found herself in high demand as a speaker. With a "lean in"-type spirit, she has been encouraging women to have more confidence in themselves and be more courageous in articulating their ambitions.
"Ladies, there's a big difference between being a braggart and advocating for yourself," she told graduates when delivering the commencement address at her alma mater, the College of St. Benedict in St. Joseph, Minn., whose board she recently joined.
And she speaks passionately about the importance of having not just mentors, but sponsors, who will lift you up and challenge you at the same time, as McCollam did for her.
"Sharon was equal parts advocate and critic in all of the best possible ways, because she was from day one hell-bent on trying to help me advance my career," Barry said. "But she knew that in order to do that, there's going to need to be some tough conversations and hard feedback along the way."
The feedback was often immediate and sometimes painful to hear, such as being told not to play with her hair in meetings or pushed to sometimes be the one with a more controversial point of view in the room.
"Once I got my head around it, it was so incredibly useful," Barry said. "I think she always had bigger dreams for me than maybe I even had for myself."
For her part, McCollam said she knew she was only going to be at Best Buy for three to four years. Barry was the obvious choice to replace her, she said, because of her deep understanding of the business, ability to "see the big picture beyond the numbers," willingness to keep learning, integrity and love of people.
And she proved herself to be a star performer, McCollam said in an e-mail.
McCollam said she learned firsthand how important it is to have advocates in advancing her own career, though in her case they were never other women.
"There was no greater privilege in my career than to do everything in my power to see that such an extraordinary executive and compassionate person achieve their professional dream," she said of Barry.

McCollam wasn't the only one pushing Barry. In 2015, Joly asked Barry to step in as the interim president of the Geek Squad. She hesitated, given that most of her experience was in finance.
"I said, 'Why me?' " Barry said. "He looked at me and said, 'Well, why wouldn't you?' For me that was … 'Boy, am I holding myself to a high enough standard around what else it is I'm capable of?' "
Changing culture
When Joly arrived as CEO in September 2012, there were only two women in Best Buy's C-Suite. The company was in the midst of a crisis, not only as it grappled with the Amazon factor, but also as it recovered from the departure of the company's previous CEO, Brian Dunn, who stepped down after it was revealed he had an inappropriate relationship with a female employee.
Joly immediately set a new tone from the top.
"He was as out loud as I've ever heard any leader be about the importance of diversity on a leadership team," said Barry, noting that he quickly backed it up by picking McCollam as one of his first key hires.
While emphasizing that it's broader than just gender, Joly says he's always seen diversity as an "essential element" of corporate success in bringing different skills and styles to the table. Part of his view was informed by his background at McKinsey & Co., which has done many studies showing multiple benefits from having a diverse leadership team, and at Minnetonka-based hotel company Carlson, where he worked with prominent female leaders such as Marilyn Nelson.
Today, other top female executives at Best Buy include Shari Ballard, president of multichannel retail; Kamy Scarlett, who was recently promoted to human resources chief; and Trish Walker, head of services.
Barry admits it was daunting to replace McCollam, who was considered a rock star by Wall Street. So much so that when the company announced her departure and Barry's promotion last year, the stock tumbled 7 percent. Barry took a screenshot of the stock drop that day and keeps it in her office.
"It's a good humility reminder," she said.
These days Best Buy's stock has been trading near record highs despite the tough retail environment, a sign that investors are gaining even more confidence in Best Buy's team and strategy.
"In the end, Wall Street respects results," said David Schick, lead retail analyst with Consumer Edge Research.
He added that Barry has done a great job transitioning into the CFO role, noting that she had a big hand in the company's turnaround, too.
Mentoring others
Now Barry is trying to pay it forward. She is executive sponsor of Best Buy's Women's Employee Network, an internal group that sets up mentoring circles and holds an annual summit.
The company still has a ways to go, she said, especially in recruiting more women to don blue shirts in its stores, where the workforce tends to be male-dominated.
Allison Peterson, president of e-commerce at Best Buy, said Barry has already become a role model for many young people within the company. Not only do people respect her because she's smart and has risen through the ranks, but she's approachable and genuine, she said.
"She inspires a ton of people," Peterson said. "Every time they hear her speak, they leave in awe."
After growing up in the small town of Cambridge, Minn., Barry sometimes marvels at her journey. Her father sometimes does, too.
She recalled at a recent talk how her father, an artist, once remarked that she now works for "the Man."
No, she quipped back. "Dad, I am the Man."
The audience full of early to midcareer women erupted into cheers.

CFO Corie Barry takes key role in Best Buy's surge
 Pushed to succeed, she is doing just that amid Best Buy's surge.

Corie Barry was groomed by Sharon McCollam to succeed McCollam as CFO of Best Buy, a career-building service she tries to pay forward to other women.

Corie Barry never saw herself in one of the top jobs at Best Buy.
That began to change in the fall of 2012 when she met her new boss at the nation's largest electronics chain. Barry was a vice president at the time, waiting to meet the company's next chief financial officer and fully expecting a man in a suit.
Instead, she did a double take when the petite Sharon McCollam breezed in, wearing an impeccable dress and designer shoes along with an air of confidence and friendliness.


"I literally thought I might run up and hug her," said Barry, 42, in a recent interview over sushi at the company's Richfield headquarters. "I felt like my whole life had changed."
In many ways, it did. McCollam, who became a key figure in Best Buy's storied turnaround, immediately saw potential in Barry and began grooming Barry to be her successor. Last year, when McCollam retired, Barry replaced her as the CFO of the $40 billion company.
Soon after, Barry was stunned to discover she was one of only about 70 female CFOs in the Fortune 500, or less than 15 percent. It was a stark reminder of how much of a glass ceiling remains in the executive suites and boardrooms of corporate America. While growing in number, there are still only about 32 female CEOs among the nation's largest 500 companies.

"It really blew my mind when I first looked up the stats," Barry said at a recent women in business event in Minneapolis.
But it's been a different story at Best Buy in recent years. Barry is part of a major sea change in the retailer's C-Suite, where women now hold nearly half the positions — and at times have outnumbered men. And 40 percent of Best Buy's board members are women, compared with the nationwide average of 20 percent.
In addition to matching online prices and partnering with some of the tech industry's biggest brands, company executives and industry analysts say a key ingredient of Best Buy's turnaround has been building a diverse and high-caliber leadership team.
"It's no accident that it had a good number of women on it," Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly said. "For us, it's part of our secret weapon."
It's a significant change for a company long dominated by men, as well as a stark contrast to the headlines coming out of Silicon Valley these days, where recent sexual harassment scandals at places like Uber have given the tech industry a reputation for hostility to women.
New visibility
In her role as CFO, Barry has found herself in high demand as a speaker. With a "lean in"-type spirit, she has been encouraging women to have more confidence in themselves and be more courageous in articulating their ambitions.
"Ladies, there's a big difference between being a braggart and advocating for yourself," she told graduates when delivering the commencement address at her alma mater, the College of St. Benedict in St. Joseph, Minn., whose board she recently joined.
And she speaks passionately about the importance of having not just mentors, but sponsors, who will lift you up and challenge you at the same time, as McCollam did for her.
"Sharon was equal parts advocate and critic in all of the best possible ways, because she was from day one hell-bent on trying to help me advance my career," Barry said. "But she knew that in order to do that, there's going to need to be some tough conversations and hard feedback along the way."
The feedback was often immediate and sometimes painful to hear, such as being told not to play with her hair in meetings or pushed to sometimes be the one with a more controversial point of view in the room.
"Once I got my head around it, it was so incredibly useful," Barry said. "I think she always had bigger dreams for me than maybe I even had for myself."
For her part, McCollam said she knew she was only going to be at Best Buy for three to four years. Barry was the obvious choice to replace her, she said, because of her deep understanding of the business, ability to "see the big picture beyond the numbers," willingness to keep learning, integrity and love of people.
And she proved herself to be a star performer, McCollam said in an e-mail.
McCollam said she learned firsthand how important it is to have advocates in advancing her own career, though in her case they were never other women.
"There was no greater privilege in my career than to do everything in my power to see that such an extraordinary executive and compassionate person achieve their professional dream," she said of Barry.

McCollam wasn't the only one pushing Barry. In 2015, Joly asked Barry to step in as the interim president of the Geek Squad. She hesitated, given that most of her experience was in finance.
"I said, 'Why me?' " Barry said. "He looked at me and said, 'Well, why wouldn't you?' For me that was … 'Boy, am I holding myself to a high enough standard around what else it is I'm capable of?' "
Changing culture
When Joly arrived as CEO in September 2012, there were only two women in Best Buy's C-Suite. The company was in the midst of a crisis, not only as it grappled with the Amazon factor, but also as it recovered from the departure of the company's previous CEO, Brian Dunn, who stepped down after it was revealed he had an inappropriate relationship with a female employee.
Joly immediately set a new tone from the top.
"He was as out loud as I've ever heard any leader be about the importance of diversity on a leadership team," said Barry, noting that he quickly backed it up by picking McCollam as one of his first key hires.
While emphasizing that it's broader than just gender, Joly says he's always seen diversity as an "essential element" of corporate success in bringing different skills and styles to the table. Part of his view was informed by his background at McKinsey & Co., which has done many studies showing multiple benefits from having a diverse leadership team, and at Minnetonka-based hotel company Carlson, where he worked with prominent female leaders such as Marilyn Nelson.
Today, other top female executives at Best Buy include Shari Ballard, president of multichannel retail; Kamy Scarlett, who was recently promoted to human resources chief; and Trish Walker, head of services.
Barry admits it was daunting to replace McCollam, who was considered a rock star by Wall Street. So much so that when the company announced her departure and Barry's promotion last year, the stock tumbled 7 percent. Barry took a screenshot of the stock drop that day and keeps it in her office.
"It's a good humility reminder," she said.
These days Best Buy's stock has been trading near record highs despite the tough retail environment, a sign that investors are gaining even more confidence in Best Buy's team and strategy.
"In the end, Wall Street respects results," said David Schick, lead retail analyst with Consumer Edge Research.
He added that Barry has done a great job transitioning into the CFO role, noting that she had a big hand in the company's turnaround, too.
Mentoring others
Now Barry is trying to pay it forward. She is executive sponsor of Best Buy's Women's Employee Network, an internal group that sets up mentoring circles and holds an annual summit.
The company still has a ways to go, she said, especially in recruiting more women to don blue shirts in its stores, where the workforce tends to be male-dominated.
Allison Peterson, president of e-commerce at Best Buy, said Barry has already become a role model for many young people within the company. Not only do people respect her because she's smart and has risen through the ranks, but she's approachable and genuine, she said.
"She inspires a ton of people," Peterson said. "Every time they hear her speak, they leave in awe."
After growing up in the small town of Cambridge, Minn., Barry sometimes marvels at her journey. Her father sometimes does, too.
She recalled at a recent talk how her father, an artist, once remarked that she now works for "the Man."
No, she quipped back. "Dad, I am the Man."
The audience full of early to midcareer women erupted into cheers.

Best Buy CFO Corie Barry had professional foundation built at CSB







August 23, 2016


By Mike Killeen

Not long after Corie Barry was named chief financial officer (CFO) at Best Buy Company, she decided to do a quick "audit" of the top 1,000 companies in America.
The 1997 College of Saint Benedict graduate was curious how many of those companies had female CFOs.
"I didn't want to be a female CFO to prove a point," Barry said. "It was more like an afterthought that I looked at it, because I felt like I had such a foundation that was built (at CSB), and I continue to bring that passion with me around what women can do in both the working world and obviously lots of other areas, too.
"But I think I wouldn't discount — and never will — having that as my starting point," Barry said. "I think that brought me a level of intestinal fortitude that was very different.
"There was something really important for me going to an all-women's school, and having it juxtaposed with so many of my classes being co-ed in nature," Barry added. "I got this amazing ability to really focus on women's leadership and women's issues, but at the same time I had this balance with discussions on an average day that included both men and women. It jolted me, and it gave me a great deal of confidence and passion around this idea that you really as a woman can do anything."
The new CFO
Barry assumed her new post on June 14 after working with the company in various financial roles since 1999. AS CFO, she oversees audits and closing the books among other duties, and replaced Sharon McCollam, who retired from the position.
"My personal belief — and I learned this from Sharon — I think the best CFOs are very operational in nature," Barry said. "There are CFOs who try to deeply understand the business, and then can translate that into financial outcomes. So, I actually spend a great deal of my time learning about and understanding how the business works, and then try to think about how we could construct the business differently and deliver the best financial outcome for the shareholders.
"Sharon said that to me early in my career, and now I can feel that weight. The shareholder is constantly on my shoulder. Every decision that we make as a leadership team I'm trying to think about that constituency above all others. It's my job to be the constant voice of how to think about the shareholder and ultimately our employees and all of our own engagement in the financial returns of the company," Barry said.
Surprisingly, not long ago she would never have dreamt about the financial returns of a company. When Barry came to CSB in the fall of 1993, she wanted to be a chemical engineering major and complete the Honors program.
"I loved the subject matter, and I did well at it," Barry said. "I loved my professors, obviously, like everybody does. But it wasn't clicking for me. You get a feel pretty quickly for, the majority of your life is going to be focused in a way that doesn't feel like it fits, which was really hard for me. Being a high achiever, it was hard to think about giving up on this thing."
Check out business related majors at CSB/SJU 
Not sure what way to go, she turned to her first-year symposium teacher, Ernie Diedrich, professor emeritus of economics at CSB and SJU.
"I can say that Ernie was life-changing for me," Barry said. "I just sat down with him and said, 'Oh my goodness, am I a failure? Where do I go from here?' He did a nice job of just kind of coaxing out of me, 'What is it you actually like to do? In your first year, what resonated with you?'
"I just realized that the things I liked were very math-based, very linear, very ... they had an answer. I was really drawn to that world. And he said, 'You may want to try an accounting class. What's the worst thing that could happen?' It is a skill set, and one of the things a liberal arts education opens up for you is pursuing things you might not otherwise do.
"That really freed me up think differently about how I was going to pursue my education. I thought, 'Well, I will take an accounting class and see what I think,' and sure enough I loved it."
A switch to accounting
Her first accounting class was with Lucy Larson, professor emerita of accounting at CSB and SJU, "just a cool, laid-back accounting professor," Barry said. "There were four people that were really instrumental in my life and my life at Best Buy, and Lucy was absolutely one of them."
Following her graduation with degrees in accounting and business administration, Barry spent two years as a public accountant at Deloitte and Touche, one of the "Big Four" accounting firms.
"The truth is, I didn't come to Best Buy because I loved retail, or I loved CDs. I interviewed with a woman named Anne Loughrey. I wanted to go work for Anne. I thought in my mind, coming from Saint Ben's, here's a woman who's finding her way in a pretty typically male-dominated industry, she's in a pretty high position in the company and she seems interested in helping me advance my career and do things in my career. That was incredibly appealing, and then the company was cool, too. "
Barry said that the liberal arts has helped her in two ways.
"You spend a disproportionate amount of time learning how to speak softly, crisply and then how to write in a way that takes a myriad of complex things and starts to make them simple," Barry said. "That is my day in a nutshell. I don't think people give enough credit practicing how to speak and how you write and being very thoughtful about that.
"The second piece — and it ties right in — is critical thinking. ... That idea of pushing yourself to think in a really different way about subjects you never would touch otherwise, that for me has come to life more often than anything else," Barry said. "And, that well-rounded ability to think around the edges of things, to see the world from other people's perspectives, to open yourself up to listening how someone else sees the world, those are the skills I use more often.
"Yes, baseline accounting knowledge is super important. You've got to have the basics. But especially as you progress your career, it looks a little less about your technical skills and a lot more about some of those other skills that I think a liberal arts education sets an amazing groundwork for."

Barry’s best advice
Best Buy chief financial officer Corie Barry was asked what advice she would give CSB/SJU students majoring in accounting and/or global business leadership. Here were her responses:

"Don't be afraid to step into the unknown. What's the worst thing that could happen? The upside is incredible."
"Tell people what you want. I think people make the mistake of thinking that if I do good work and put my head down and keep chugging along, everyone else will notice. That's not always going to be true in your career."
"Find sponsors. And, that's not just mentors. The difference for me, sponsors are people who will advocate on your behalf."
"Stay focused on what's important. I think that's very true for the company and the shareholders and my role here. I also think it's very true personally."
