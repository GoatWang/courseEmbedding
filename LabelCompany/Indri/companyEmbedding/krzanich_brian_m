Brian M. Krzanich


Brian M. Krzanich was appointed chief executive officer of Intel Corporation and elected a member of the board of directors on May 16, 2013. He is the sixth CEO in the company’s history, succeeding Paul S. Otellini.
Krzanich has progressed through a series of technical and leadership roles at Intel, most recently serving as the chief operating officer (COO) since January 2012. As COO, his responsibilities included leading an organization of more than 50,000 employees spanning Intel’s Technology and Manufacturing Group, Intel Custom Foundry, supply chain operations, the NAND Solutions group, human resources, information technology and Intel’s China strategy.
His open-minded approach to problem solving and listening to customers’ needs has extended the company’s product and technology leadership and created billions of dollars in value for the company. In 2006, he drove a broad transformation of Intel’s factories and supply chain, improving factory velocity by more than 60 percent and doubling customer responsiveness. Krzanich is also involved in advancing the industry’s transition to lower cost 450mm wafer manufacturing through the Global 450 Consortium as well as leading Intel’s strategic investment in lithography supplier ASML.
Prior to becoming COO, Krzanich held senior leadership positions within Intel’s manufacturing organization. He was responsible for Fab/Sort Manufacturing from 2007-2011 and Assembly and Test from 2003 to 2007. From 2001 to 2003, he was responsible for the implementation of the 0.13-micron logic process technology across Intel’s global factory network. From 1997 to 2001, Krzanich served as the Fab 17 plant manager, where he oversaw the integration of Digital Equipment Corporation’s semiconductor manufacturing operations into Intel’s manufacturing network. The assignment included building updated facilities as well as initiating and ramping 0.18-micron and 0.13-micron process technologies. Prior to this role, Krzanich held plant and manufacturing manager roles at multiple Intel factories.
Krzanich began his career at Intel in 1982 in New Mexico as a process engineer. He holds a bachelor’s degree in Chemistry from San Jose State University and has one patent for semiconductor processing. Krzanich is also a member of the board of directors of the Semiconductor Industry Association.

Brian M. Krzanich, who on Thursday was named Intel’s next chief executive, knows he faces a hefty challenge when he takes over the world’s biggest maker of semiconductors.The company that became a household name through its “Intel inside” stickers on personal computers is still the king of PC chips. But that is a shrinking business, and Intel is a laggard in making chips for hot products like smartphones and tablets.That has put Intel in a bind, as semiconductor competitors long under the thumb of the Silicon Valley giant have gained traction through relationships with mobile device leaders like Apple and Samsung.But Mr. Krzanich (pronounced KREZ-nick), a 52-year-old company veteran who started with Intel as an engineer when he was 22, says he is cleareyed about the challenges and has a plan to stop his company’s slide.

“I look at this world and see all kinds of devices connected to computers, and people connected to it all the time,” Mr. Krzanich said in an interview. “We can bring things to companies that others haven’t dreamed of.” Continue reading the main story

He even has a broader picture of Intel’s future, like imagining moving beyond today’s popular mobile devices and into other gadgets in people’s homes and even into so-called wearable computing devices. “If you’re just talking phones, you’re shooting behind the duck,” he added.Last year, almost two-thirds of Intel’s $53 billion in revenue came from making chips for PCs, a market Mr. Krzanich acknowledges is “not growing, let’s be honest.”Last month, researchers at the information technology firm IDC said PC demand declined more than 13 percent annually in the first quarter, as buyers turned to mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. In the same period, IDC said worldwide tablet shipments were up 142.4 percent, while smartphone shipments were up 41.6 percent. The bulk of Intel’s remaining revenue came from chips for computer servers, a business Intel still dominates.Mr. Krzanich, who is the company’s chief operating officer and is an expert in running big chip factories, will become Intel’s sixth chief executive on May 16, succeeding Paul S. Otellini, who unexpectedly announced his retirement last November. Intel also promoted Renee James, the 48-year-old chief of the company’s software division, to president on Thursday.Some analysts saw the appointment of Mr. Krzanich as a signal that the company would increase investment in its manufacturing while chasing new customers with chips meant for mobile products.

“The PC and server markets are so big, so important, that you can’t take your eye off the ball,” said Doug Freedman, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. Mr. Krzanich, he noted, “is very much about the results. He comes from a world of schedules and manufacturing.”But Mr. Freedman also said, “There’s a part of the investment community that would have preferred an outsider” to shake up the company. This was never likely at Intel, he noted, where employment shorter than a decade marks one as a newcomer. Intel said it considered both inside and outside candidates.Mr. Krzanich was one of several internal candidates who made their final pitches to Intel’s board last weekend. Ms. James was also vying for the job, and Mr. Krzanich said the two had privately discussed working together, no matter who became chief executive.

“She was a very viable candidate,” he said. “Our vision of a mobile, connected computing environment was so close, we saw together we could drive things faster.”Though he would not detail his entire strategy in the interview, Mr. Krzanich said he saw no reason to reduce Intel’s spending on cutting-edge chip technology and manufacturing. “I fought for this job for a reason,” he said. “The assets that made us great in PCs and servers are even stronger in the mobile and cloud world.”In part, Mr. Krzanich says he believes he is carrying through on a plan that’s already under way.On Monday, for example, Intel will introduce a new version of its low-power Atom chip designed for communications products, where its market is negligible.If successful, Mr. Krzanich will create an Intel markedly different from the past.Under Andrew S. Grove, the executive who coined the unofficial company slogan, “Only the paranoid survive” and led Intel to dominance in providing chips for PCs and servers, the company honed a business known for a few close relationships with partners like Microsoft, and then PC manufacturers like Hewlett-Packard and Dell. Those relationships and the fortunes of those companies have declined in recent years.Today, Intel faces competition from Qualcomm and Nvidia in the manufacturing of chips for mobile devices. H.P. is showing off servers that use parts from five or more competitors.Even Microsoft, once the other half of a relationship so close that pundits called the two companies Wintel, is working with other chip makers for its video game consoles and tablets.

 Correction: May 4, 2013  
An article on Friday about the challenges facing Intel’s new chief executive, Brian M. Krzanick, misspelled the surname of the company’s departing chief executive. He is Paul S. Otellini, not Ottellni.

Brian Matthew Krzanich (born May 9, 1960)[2] is the Chief Executive Officer of Intel. He was elected CEO on May 2, 2013, concluding a six-month executive search after incumbent CEO Paul Otellini announced his resignation in November 2012. Krzanich assumed the role of CEO on May 16, 2013 at the company's annual general meeting.[3] Before becoming CEO, he was Intel's Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.
Krzanich earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry from San Jose State University and holds a patent for semiconductor processing. He joined Intel in 1982 in New Mexico as an engineer. He was promoted to COO in January 2012.[4][5] He often visits Intel-sponsored hackathons and Best Buys with his wife and two daughters.[6][7] Krzanich is of Croatian descent.
Controversies[edit]





This section may lend undue weight to certain ideas, incidents, or controversies. Please help to create a more balanced presentation. Discuss and resolve this issue before removing this message. (February 2017)


On June 1, 2016, Krzanich cancelled a fundraiser at his home in Atherton, California[8] for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump after the New York Times asked Intel that day for details about the event, originally scheduled for June 2, 2016.[9][10] The invitation to the event was sent by Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and was also going to feature Steven Mnuchin and Elliott Broidy.[11][12] A spokesperson for Intel told the New York Times that the fundraiser would include “a full exchange of views” before Krzanich announced on Twitter that he did not intend to endorse a candidate and was interested in engaging both the Trump and the Clinton campaigns in dialogue about technology issues.[13][14] A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign said the event was cancelled due to a scheduling conflict,[10] and Trump held a rally in San Jose on June 2.[15] The fundraiser was widely seen as incongruous with Intel’s support for immigration reform and US$300 million effort to attract women and minorities, as well as detrimental to the company’s interests in China, the biggest market for the semiconductor industry.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Intel Corporation second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Henninger. You may begin.
Mark H. Henninger - Vice President-Finance & Director-IR
Thank you and welcome, everyone, to Intel's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call.
By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com. I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO, and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by the Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Also, if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we'll post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliation to our website, intc.com.
So with that, let me hand it over to Brian.
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Mark.
Our top line results for the quarter came in right in line with outlook, and profitability this quarter exceeded our expectations. Year-over-year growth this quarter was 3% overall, as we transform Intel into a company that powers the cloud and billions of smart connected devices.
We continue to focus on growth in line with this transformation, as evidenced by results in the data center, IoT, and Programmable Solutions business this quarter. I'd like to take a few minutes to walk through these results and their implications.
I'll start with the Client Computing Group, where we saw a 3% decline in revenue year over year this quarter, while operating margin was up 19%. These results were a little better than we expected, as the PC supply chain reduced inventories at a slightly slower rate, while the 2-in-1 and enthusiast product lines continued to grow. We also started shipping our seventh generation Core microprocessor, formerly known as Kaby Lake, and our latest LTE modem, known as 7360.
Next, the data center, where revenue grew 5% year over year, cloud services providers grew 9%, comm service providers grew 10%, and enterprise was down 1%. We achieved some critical milestones in the quarter that give us confidence in our growing momentum as we enter the second half of the year.
In the data center, we're seeing an ongoing preference for performance up and down the pricing stack. Average selling prices increased year over year in every microprocessor product segment from Atom and Xeon D SOCs at the low end, up through Xeon and Xeon Phi at the high end. We continued to gain share in Network Infrastructure throughout the entire segment, as Intel architecture becomes the solution of choice for the transformation of the network to SDN, NFV, and 5G. The significant share gains at the low end of the Network Infrastructure segment resulted in an overall 1% decline in data center CPU average selling prices.

Progress in the data center extended beyond our CPU product lines. Our latest Xeon Phi accelerator, formerly known as Knights Landing, continued to ramp after shipping the first limited production units in December of last year. Xeon Phi revenue grew 8x in the first six months of this year versus all of 2015, gaining share in the supercomputing and machine learning segments.
Omni-Path, our high-performance computing fabric, was launched earlier this year and has already achieved 30% market segment share of the 100-gig fabric market. In June's Top 500 Supercomputing list, Omni-Path was deployed in half of the new 100-gig systems, pointing to the performance that this technology brings to the market.
This quarter, we also shipped our first silicon photonics products for revenue, the industry's only fully integrated solution. We expect DCG's adjacent product lines, including Omni-Path, silicon photonics, and Ethernet, to collectively grow more than 20% for the full year and this quarter make up 12% of DCG's revenue.
The Internet of Things business was up 2% over last year, coming in below our expectations. We saw growth in the industrial and video verticals, offset by an inventory burn after a very strong first quarter. We continue to see tremendous potential in this business.
A great example was demonstrated earlier this month when we announced our autonomous driving collaboration with BMW and Mobileye, marking a significant step for the auto industry as we work together to establish an industry standard open platform for autonomous driving. In addition, we are bringing Indian computing technology to power the next generation of BMW's highly autonomous and fully autonomous products, from the door locks to the data center.
Our Memory business was down 20% over last year and fell short of our expectations as a result of a more competitive pricing environment. While we acknowledge the cyclical and competitive nature of this business, we remain confident in our long-term growth prospects as a result of the new technologies we are bringing to this market.
Fab 68 in Dalian, China, started its initial 3D NAND wafers late in the second quarter, but ahead of schedule. We also remain on track to ship 3D XPoint SSDs, branded Optane, by the end of the year, and look forward to delivering this exciting new breakthrough in memory to the industry.
The Programmable Solutions Group, formerly known as Altera, delivered great results. PSG grew 12% over Altera's results last year on strength in comms, infrastructure, and the channel. PSG is on track to ship 14-nanometer Stratix 10 samples this year, and I'm very pleased with both the integration of this business and their strong execution.
Our Security business was up 10%, as the restructuring the team completed last year and their focused execution continues to deliver results.
And finally, our restructuring initiative that we began last quarter is solidly on track. This program is changing where and how we invest in everything from research and development to sales and marketing. In April, we announced some important changes to our roadmaps in areas like SOCs and perceptual computing. These changes are accelerating our transformation to a company that powers the cloud and the billions of smart connected computing devices while increasing the profitability in our client business. In total, we expect this initiative will drive net run rate OpEx savings of $1.4 billion by mid-2017.
Looking ahead, I'm very excited about the growing momentum heading into the second half of the year. While we remain cautious about the PC segment and continue to expect a decline in the high single digits this year, we're expecting our businesses outside of CCG to collectively deliver double-digit growth in the third quarter.

We are seeing clear signs that our strategy is working, laying a solid foundation for growth built on the data center and the Internet of Things business, reinforced by the combination of memory and FPGAs and bound together by connectivity.
With that, let me turn it over to Stacy.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Thanks, Brian.
In the second quarter, we met our financial commitments and made good progress towards our restructuring goals. Our forecast reflects growing momentum as we enter the back half of 2016.
Revenue for the second quarter was $13.5 billion, in line with expectations and up 3% year over year. Gross margin for the quarter of 62% was approximately a point higher than our expectations, primarily driven by lower platform unit costs.
Spending on R&D and MG&A was $5.2 billion, in line with our expectations. We are on track to the restructuring announced on the last earnings call, with a reduction of about 6,000 employees in the second quarter.
Operating income of $3.2 billion was down 2% from a year ago. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%. Earnings per share at $0.59 was down $0.03 from a year ago.
The Client Computing Group had revenue of $7.3 billion, down 3% year over year. Client Computing Group operating profit was $1.9 billion, up 19% from a year ago. This improvement is driven by lower overall spending and margin improvements in our mobile products and higher ASPs in the PC segment. The worldwide PC supply chain inventory levels came down a bit in the second quarter, and as we enter the second half they are at healthy levels.
Data Center revenue was $4 billion, up 5% year over year. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.8 billion, down 4% year over year, primarily driven by increased costs as we ramp 14-nanometer data center products. As we enter the second half, we expect the enterprise segment of the business to stabilize and the cloud segment growth rate to accelerate. In addition, we expect increasing ASPs as we ramp our Broadwell-based server products.
Our Internet of Things segment achieved revenue of $572 million, with year-over-year growth of 2%. Our security business had revenue of $537 million, up 10% year over year. Our memory business had revenue of $554 million, down 20% year over year. This segment had an operating loss of $224 million as a result of continued pricing pressures, higher startup costs as we ramp 3D NAND in our China factory, and increased 3D XPoint spending.
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $465 million, up 12% year over year when compared to Altera's results from a year ago. Operating profit was negative $62 million. This includes about $160 million in non-cash charges for inventory adjustments. Excluding these charges would result in about $100 million in positive operating profit.
Total cash balance at the end of the quarter was roughly $17.7 billion, up $2.6 billion from the first quarter. Our total debt is $28.6 billion. Our net cash balance, total cash less debt and inclusive of our other longer-term investments, is negative $5.7 billion. We are projecting to improve this net cash balance over the second half of the year.
We are generating healthy levels of free cash flow, which enable us to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders. This is demonstrated our Q2 results, as we generated $3.8 billion of cash from operations in the second quarter, purchased $2.3 billion in capital assets, and repurchased approximately $800 million of stock. In the second quarter, we also paid $1.2 billion in dividends. And as of yesterday's close of market, our dividend yield was about 3%.
As we look forward to the third quarter of 2016, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range of $14.9 billion. This forecast is at the high end of the average seasonal increase for the third quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to be 62%.

Turning to the full year 2016, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits. We continue to expect the overall PC market to be down in the high single digits, and we expect to achieve low double-digit growth in our Data Center business. Gross margin for the full year of 2016 is expected to be 62%, consistent with our prior outlook.
You can see our strategy playing out in our first half results and our expectations for the second half. We expect above-seasonal growth in the back half of the year, led by strong growth in the Data Center, Internet of Things, and Memory businesses. And for the year we expect that growth in those businesses will offset the PC market decline, and with the addition of the Programmable Solutions Group, will result in mid-single-digit revenue growth.
Additionally, we are executing to our restructuring program, which allows us to increase investments in strategically important areas, generate financial returns for our owners, and build the foundation for future financial growth.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark H. Henninger - Vice President-Finance & Director-IR
Okay, thank you, Brian and Stacy. Moving on now to the Q&A, as is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask one question and one follow-up if you have one. Operator, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Our first question comes from the line of Chris Danely of Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hey, thanks, guys, just a question on the server expectations for the second half. What's giving you the confidence that things are going to bounce back so nicely?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure, I'll start and then Stacy can add. This is Brian, Chris. I think it's really a mix of a couple of things. One, we saw in the second quarter and we project out into the second half a bit of stabilization of the enterprise side of the market. The enterprise side was down only about 1%, which is a bit more stable than it has been. Second thing is we are ramping our Broadwell E server in the second half of the year, and so we expect strong demand. And we typically see an ASP uplift as people by up in the stack with these new server systems coming out. And we have customer signals that just indicate that there's a second half seasonal buying pattern kicking in a bit as well. So those three things are the second half keys.
And if you take a look at a broader view of this or just overall, our view of the data center and really the cloud continues to be that the cloud is going to continue to expand. It's going to be driven by the many, many machines that connect to the cloud that drive orders of magnitude more data than what the average human creates today, and that's getting to the cloud. So there's the short versus the longer-term point of view. I don't know, Stacy, if there's anything you want to add.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Perfect.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
And for my follow-up, you mentioned you started shipping the 7360. Was that material to Q2 or will it be material to the second half, and any comments on profitability there?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
I'm not going to talk specifically about the 7360 because our policy is to let our customers announce any design wins that they want to announce when they want to announce them.
In terms of the overall impact on financials, when I look at the second half, you'll note that we have an above-seasonal growth rate in there. The biggest driver of that is what Brian just talked about in the data center, so that's the biggest driver. We were below the average annual growth rate in the first half. We expect to be above that, low double digits, in back half, driven by the three things he talked about, in particular the cloud buying patterns that we've identified with some of those large customers. And then behind that, we see an improvement in revenue in Memory and an improvement in revenue in IoT. And so those are the big drivers as we go into the back half.

Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Thanks, guys.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Stacy, you did a nice job relative to the full year guidance giving us your expectation for PC demand for the year. I'm just curious. As you look into the third quarter, the guide is the high end of normal seasonality, as you talked about. How would you characterize your view of the PC business going into Q3? And to the extent that it's still a subdued view, is this really confidence in data center, or what other parts of the business would drive above-seasonal – or high end of seasonal, sorry?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hey, John, how about if I start on just the view of the PC, especially into the third quarter, and then Stacy can get into where is the above-seasonal numbers coming from and all? I think if you look at the second half, we already said that Q2 ended up being a little bit better than what we had anticipated, and we had built the year at the high single digits. And if you take a look at Q2, it ended up coming at the mid-single-digit decline. We've tried to be relatively cautious as we look out into the rest of this year and built the year and the forecast around that high single-digit number set for decline of the PC. We are carrying momentum out of Q2, so there's still data that needs to be collected on how it looks. But right now we've maintained our cautious view of high single digits.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
So just to translate that into seasonality against the backdrop of what Brian just said, which is high single-digit decline in the PC business, we're expecting that segment to play out more or less seasonally, John. We tend to do a little bit better than that because of mix and ASP, but from a unit standpoint should be fairly seasonal. And then the driver is what I just talked about. The data center growth rate as we move into the back half should be significantly higher than what we saw in the first half based on stabilization in enterprise, what we see with the cloud customers, and then some ASP uplift as we ramp Broadwell server – 14-nanometer Broadwell servers into the product mix.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
That's helpful, guys. And then maybe for my follow-up, just looking at the Memory businesses, as you guys characterized, tough quarter in the June quarter. If you annualize the operating loss, it's a fairly large number. I'm just curious. Have startup costs there peaked, or do we have another couple of quarters of startup costs going up in Memory? And I guess more importantly, as Dalian ramps and you think about XPoint, how should we think about your profitability goals longer term and what the fall-through on that business looks like as revenue does start to accelerate?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
So there's a short-term and a long-term component to this. So in the short term, as I think about the second half, in rough math I'd expect a consistent loss in the second half to what we saw in the first half. I think startup costs will be slightly higher. We'll see the first production costs play through on 3D XPoint, which as you know from watching us over the years, those first production costs tend to be fairly high in any factory when you're starting it up. Offset by the underlying existing NAND business, I think it's a bit better as we go into the back half. So that's the short-term answer.
To your longer-term question, and I'll turn this over to Brian to talk about the technology, but I think the combination of 3D NAND and the cost structure we're going to achieve and then the disruptive nature of 3D XPoint, we should have a very good value proposition and a very good overall profit position for the business.

Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, John, I would just echo what Stacy said. We're just now starting to ramp our 3D NAND. So as we go through this back half of this year and into next year, it's really starting to ramp up. We think large cost advantages and good performance position there. And then as we said, 3D XPoint SSDs start to ship at the end of this year, 3D XPoint DIMMs next year. And so these investments that we're making this year, which we've talked about, are really playing forward those two technologies. So we're still very bullish on the long-term prospects. The units and the gigabytes continue to grow. Our cost structure gets better and better as we go through the back half and into next year. And then 3D XPoint, as we said, will really in our minds change the whole memory storage architecture.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great, thank you so much. I wonder if you could talk about first the data center. The growth – your mid-single-digit growth for about three consecutive quarters, and I know you had higher expectations for that a few quarters ago. Can you talk about – is that entirely an enterprise phenomenon, or is that a timing issue around cloud? Just how should we think about the last few quarters of DCG?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah, I'd say – so overall, relative to the expectations we had at the beginning of the year, let's say, it's primarily enterprise driven. And then there's some – what we commonly use as lumpiness quarter on quarter. So to how you ask the question, we actually weren't surprised by the Q2 results. In fact, they came in right in line, actually just a hair above what our internal forecast was. We have I think pretty good insight into the large cloud customers, and so we had some good insight into the buying patterns as those customers went from Q1 to Q2. And now as we look at the back half, we see several purchasing cycles kicking in for some of the large guys. So we expect that the cloud piece will accelerate as we get into the back half.
Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great, that's helpful. Thank you. And then with regards to the balance sheet, I noticed both days sales outstanding and days of inventory bumped up a little bit, and I hadn't expected that. Can you just talk about what drove that?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah, those are two different things. I'll just start with the easy one, days sales outstanding. I'm not seeing anything unusual there, it's just the amount of net billing at the end of the quarter. The average day paid and all of that still looks really healthy, so I'm not seeing anything unusual there.
On the inventory side, as I talked to you last quarter, we ended Q1 higher than where I wanted to be. Our yields got better in Q1. Frankly, they got a lot better in Q2 as well. And we under-shipped a little bit in Q1 relative the units that we were expecting. So we took some actions in the second quarter to start bringing inventory levels down. What you see inside of inventory was – it was flattish, right in line with what we expected Q1 to Q2. There was a remixing, so you see some more expensive server parts and some Skylake parts going up. And then you see some of the older-generation CPUs going down. And as we get into the back half, we would expect inventory to click down and be down pretty meaningfully by the time we get to Q4.
Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great, thanks so much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. PC gaming has been a bright spot for the team, with growth in the double-digits year-over-year range for the past number of quarters; your desktop ASPs were up again in Q2, maybe due to the strength here. It seems like the graphics guys are rolling out some new products. There appears to be a good pipeline of new games for the second half. So I guess the question is, did the PC gaming segment continue to drive double-digits growth for the team in Q2, and how do you see that trending into the second half?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. If you take a look at it, there were three-ish, maybe four-ish major segments of the PC that did better and continue to do better than the rest of the segment and just overall. Laptops, mobile PCs continue to do better. They did better in the second quarter. 2-in-1 devices specifically are doing very well and continue to grow in double digits. And then as you said, we often call the enthusiast gaming, you see our K SKUs in there, and then you saw us also announce the X SKU, which is our new 10-core system that has been selling much, much better than what even we anticipated. And so yes, gaming and enthusiast continues to grow at a double-digit rate.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great, thanks for the insights there. And then on the deceleration in the IoT business in June, you talked about an inventory burn. Sorry if I missed this, but what vertical was that focused on? And does the team expect reacceleration on a year-over-year basis as you move into the second half of the year? And if so, what verticals are going to be driving the growth?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Let me take the revenue question, and I'll let Brian take what we see in the verticals part. It was not one vertical. If you just look at it, I think our customers got out a little ahead of their skis in the first quarter. If you remember, I think we had a 21% or 22% year-on-year growth rate in Q1. There was a little more inventory out there than we anticipated, and that took some of the – that was a bit of headwind as we started Q2.
To your question on the back half, we do expect a reacceleration. So I had said at the investor meeting that we expect double-digit growth in excess of what we had achieved last year. We still expect that. We had a strong Q1, an inventory burn in Q2, and we expect a strong Q3 and Q4.
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
And from which verticals? The verticals that have been the strongest growing for us, especially in recent, has been industrial and in the security video type applications. Those have been the two real growers. We have a lot of I'll call it longer-term growth vectors. Retail is a longer-term growth vector. And then you saw, as we mentioned on the call, the automotive ADAS section in the announcement with BMW. There are several other programs in that space as well.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great, thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to verify. On the DCG I guess growth target into the back half, it sounds like you need enterprise to keep getting better into the second half as well as for I guess the cloud and comm side of DCG to significantly reaccelerate to get there. Cloud was up 9% year over year, and it's good but that's a significant deceleration. Can you give us a feeling for what you need for enterprise into the back half and what drove the deceleration in the high-growth parts of this business into Q2?

Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
So I'd say – I'd characterize enterprise in the back half consistent with what we saw in Q2. If it stabilizes at that rate, that gives us the ability to grow to the levels that we're projecting. And then for the cloud, yes, you're right. It's what I said earlier. We had actually forecasted a pause in purchasing based on what we knew of the customer – the big cloud players' ordering patterns. And based on the signals we're seeing from them, we do expect a reacceleration in the back to something more consistent with what we're seeing through the last couple years.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
So what gives you confidence that enterprise will continue to stabilize and that what we saw in Q1 is not a one-quarter blip, given it's been down pretty meaningfully for the last few years pretty consistently?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
It's what we saw in Q2.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
In Q2, I mean.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yes, we saw it down slightly. And again, it's just what we see of the big enterprise customers' signals to us in terms of what they want to purchase.
Mark H. Henninger - Vice President-Finance & Director-IR

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Given that dynamic in the cloud and the enterprise side within DCG, do you still expect a crossover in the percentage of revenues that those two generate the back half of this year, or is it pulled forward a little bit – or pushed out, given the dynamics that you've described so far?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Sorry, crossover from what to what, Ross?
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
When you said – I believe at your last analyst meeting you talked about the cloud revenue, the percentage of DCG would be somewhere in the mid-30%, and that would cross over the enterprise-generated revenue in that. And that was therefore viewed as a point of acceleration for the entire group. I'm wondering, given the slower growth year to date in that business, if that crossover is going to be achieved in the time you expected.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
I'll be honest. I haven't looked at the data from that lens. But what I said – let me just take you back to the answer that I gave – I think it was to Joe's question earlier, that if you look to the expectations we had at the beginning of the year, the enterprise is a bit weaker than we thought overall for the year. And I think cloud will be in line with what we thought. So my guess is that's still true. Which quarter it happens may be a jump ball, but my guess is it's still true. But I'd like the opportunity to actually go look at the data and I can give you a crisper answer next time we talk.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. I guess as my follow-up question, sticking with DCG then, is on the gross margin side. It sounds like you're expecting some pretty significant growth, not only on the unit side of the equation in DCG but also on the ASP side. And then you also talked about some of the ASP benefits that might happen in CCG, at least in the PC portion of it. If I put that all together, I'm a little surprised that either mix or ASPs, neither of those are mentioned in your gross margin reconciliation for it to go to 62% in the third quarter. Can you talk a little bit about how those dynamics fit into your gross margin?

Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Sure, so first let me start with your question on data center. There's a lot in there. So I do expect an operating margin improvement in the data center as we work through this year. I think we were around mid-40% in the second quarter, and our historical range has been closer to 50%. As I expect it, that picks up some as we move into the back half. The big driver there is costs. And so the early production on the Broadwell server is fairly expensive. Costs come down as we get into the back half. And as you said, we do expect some ASP uplift in the back half.
Overall for the company, what we're seeing, so I'll just Q3 as the anchor point. We're seeing some good news in Q3 associated with higher volumes. And then the big offset there is we're seeing 10-nanometer startup costs going up pretty significantly in the back half. So that may be the piece that you're missing in the equation in Q3. That continues into Q4, by the way. We see a little bit more startup costs. If you do your algebra, you're probably coming up with a gross margin for Q4 that's about 62%. So think of that as some good things happen, but we have again an increase in startup costs and we have some of the Dalian costs with the first production of 3D XPoint that also kick in a bit more in Q4.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great, thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso of CLSA. Your line is now open.
Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC
Yes, thank you, just a clarification on some of your earlier comments on inventory in PC. You talked about the customers taking down the inventory a little bit less than you had expected in Q2. Can you clarify why they chose to do that? And I guess with the inventory levels right now, where do they stand relative to where you'd expect them to be into the third quarter?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
So overall we continue to see inventory levels as being very healthy. I think that the PC, the worldwide PC supply chain has moved towards a stance of being fairly lean and fairly cautious, and we see that continuing. You would typically see an inventory burn in the second quarter. It was a little bit less of an inventory burn then what we expected. I think it goes back to Brian's comments that he made at the beginning of the call that from their perspective, the PC market was a little better in Q2, so I think they probably just brought down inventory levels a little bit less.
Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC
Okay. As a follow-on to that, maybe you can clarify what you consider to be normal PC seasonality in the third quarter because I think that's been changing over the past several years. Last year, the build into the third quarter was a little stronger. Obviously, there were some product launches there. How do you characterize the build this year relative to what we've seen last year and the year before?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
So I would say for the company, you would expect to see the seasonality of revenue, seasonality for us that's in the high single digits as we go from Q2 to Q3. Our guide is a little higher than that for the reasons that we've been talking about. The PC market is probably in line with that, maybe just a pinch higher in terms of the overall PC TAM.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay of Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.
Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.

Yes, thank you very much. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. I guess it's a follow-on to the DCG question that Ross had brought up in terms of margin. The DCG business is obviously going to diversify itself some going forward with some of the new products that you're introducing and the networking business taking off. The operating margin percentage is down fairly sharply year over year, and I would expect that to ramp back up some as revenue reaccelerates. But maybe, Stacy, you could talk about what the long-term margin structure looks like from an operating margin perspective in DCG as the business diversifies some. Thanks.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Sure. So we'll talk about that in more depth at the investor meeting, but I'll give you some off-the-cuff comments here. First, to just put it in perspective, the operating margin percent decline that we saw in Q2 had nothing to do with the new products, or the new products weren't driving it. It was the 14-nanometer costs of Broadwell server. And when we get into the back half, we're going to see an ASP impact associated with that because we think that the performance of that product enables customers to get a better value proposition by buying a richer mix. So that's why I'm pretty confident when we get in the back half, we see the margins snapping back towards that 50% that we've articulated as our long-term goal.
We'll talk more about the mix of products and whatnot at the investor meeting, but the one thing I'd point you to is, remember something like networking, which is an Atom-based server product that's going in, while it does have a lower ASP than the average within DCG, it has an ASP that's actually been going up and has a very different cost structure then a Xeon does. So I wouldn't just immediately assume that because it's a lower priced segment of the market that it's a margin-hindered segment of the market because that's not the case.
Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Great, thank you. That's really helpful. And then I guess to follow up on that, sticking on margin, maybe you could talk a little bit about how adding the third chip on 14-nanometer may affect margins going into 2017 in the PC business to offset some of the 10-nanometer ramp costs you had talked about. I think it's a little bit of a different dynamic than we've seen with the business traditionally with a tick-tock approach. So any broader comments you can give there about margins would be really helpful. I appreciate it, thanks.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Let me take the margin side, and then I'll let Brian come in over the top to talk a little bit about the roadmap and how we think about that from the customer's perspective. So first off, we haven't forecast 2017 margins, so we'll give you the first glimpse of that when we get to the investor meeting, and then we'll put a formal stake in the ground when we get to next January. But I would say that there's nothing that I'm seeing in the overall roadmap that for me is a significant headwind as we go in 2017. So we'll give you a lot more insight on that in a few months, but I'm not seeing anything that has me worried as we go into 2017.
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I guess what I would talk about is Kaby Lake. So one of the things we've learned on 14 nanometers is how to make meaningful performance improvements both in the silicon and then with the silicon combined with the architecture. So we said we already started shipping Kaby Lake to our customers and OEMs. We're seeing meaningful performance across all of the various SKUs of Kaby Lake relative to Skylake. Kaby Lake is built off a Skylake core. And as a result, the die size doesn't significantly grow. So you don't see – there's no driver in the silicon itself to shift the margin structure of this product. We're able to get the performance and feature enhancements with relatively small silicon increases but good improvement on the raw silicon technology itself. So there's not an intrinsic driver that should say die size got twice as big so margins are cut. There's nothing like that.

Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
And it comes in on a process technology that's mature with healthy yields and a healthy cost structure. So from that perspective, you get a nice performance boost at a good cost structure.
Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Thank you very much.
Mark H. Henninger - Vice President-Finance & Director-IR

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah of Nomura Securities. Your line is now open.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Yes, thanks. Brian, I know that you remain cautious overall in the PC market. But when you look at some of the third-party data, it definitely seems like North America was better; Asia, Latin America a little mixed. I'm wondering, has your view, at least on a regional basis, changed at all?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
So my regional view would say that certain of the – so North America and Western Europe has been stronger for us for some period of time, and it continues to be the stronger segment for us. As you said, South America – Latin America continues to be weak. We see weakness in Asia, but it did get a little bit better than in the past, and that combined with North America were the two drivers that made Q2 perform better than what we had modeled in our high single digits. And as I said, I'm being relatively cautious in this and making sure that we put an estimate out there that we are very comfortable with, and that's why we have gone with – stuck with our high single-digit view of the year.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
The other thing that's been reported is that commercial models have seen some momentum. Windows 10 has been a catalyst. Your view on commercial enterprise, has that improved at all over the last 90 days?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes, and we're hearing that same thing from our customers. And as we go out and talk to CIOs, we're hearing the same thing. Those cycles, though, can sometimes take – you'll hear of them, and they sometimes can take some time to really kick in. So again, we've built that into the cautiousness of the second half and making sure that we know what we're going into the second half with. But we are hearing similar things around the enterprise conversion. It's comfort with Windows 10, ability to make that transition, and wanting to do it on new hardware.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Great, thank you.
Operator
Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC
Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question on XPoint. You talked about stronger growth expectations looking out over the next couple years. I'm just curious if you could share what conversations you've had with customers, what use cases you've uncovered, and any thoughts in terms of sizing the market.
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
So we haven't really tried to – we have pretty widespread guesstimates and models right now on sizing the market because we're still really learning. We've actually started to ship some sample units to customers already to let them try out and start to learn. Those are to the big, call it service providers, is mostly who we're sending those to. You're going to see it enter as SSDs. You'll see those SSDs, both enterprise-class SSDs and also commercial consumer type SSDs, we demonstrated in several live demonstrations anywhere from 5x to 7x, 8x, 9x, 10x improvement in performance depending on the workload through those SSDs. So you're going to see those be the first implications.
When I think about where the big volume will come from, I think it will come in that DIMM form factor. You're going to see it in cloud applications, everything from machine learning, big data. Anyplace where you have memory-intensive and where you can do in-memory applications, the 3D XPoint is going to be nicely configured for that. It allows you to bring large amounts of storage-like data into a memory-like performance. And that's the real key here.

I also believe you'll see it in consumer devices. You'll see laptops and devices like that. Gaming machines, we think it will have gaming applications where you can preload in a cache-like environment the next level of your game, and so it loads almost instantly as you transition within the game. So there's going to be a variety of those. And actually the more we go and start to play with it, start to give it out to customers, the more types of applications and workloads we're finding that it can be used for.
C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC
That's very helpful. And I guess as a quick follow-up, Stacy, can you provide an update on your targeted capital structure here, and at what point with net leverage – net cash we should start to see more aggressive buybacks?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Sure. As I communicated I think at the investor meeting or in the last six months, our goal is to get back to net cash zero. At one point I predicted that that would happen in the back half of this year. The combination of business levels being lower from what we thought at the beginning of the year as well as some pretty significant restructuring charges will push that out, so that will happen sometime in 2017, although I do think we'll make good progress towards net cash zero as we move into the back half. Today, our net debt level is right around $5 billion, so we'll take a big chunk out of that as we move into the back half.
In terms of then – now that said, we're still generating excess free cash flow. You can see that even in the first half, even inclusive of the restructuring charges we did. And so you can see we did I think $1.6 billion of buybacks in the first half, and we have a dividend yield that as of yesterday was about 3%. So I think you see us executing to the priorities that we had articulated.
Mark H. Henninger - Vice President-Finance & Director-IR
Thanks, C.J. And, operator, I think we have time for two more questions.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thanks for taking my question. For my first one, Brian, I'm curious. There are expectations of Intel becoming successful with your 4G modems in the back half, and I'm curious. How's the longer-term visibility around sustaining growth in the business and just the timing as to when you can bring those products from foundry to your own fabs?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure, so let's just talk about modems. Really to stay on a leading-edge modem, you need to have a yearly cadence of modem technology. And so we have just that, a yearly cadence laid out. We had the 7260 last year, we have the 7360 this year. We have a series of modems out. We've got them built out and planned for the next several years. We haven't publicly stated when we'll bring it inside, but clearly we plan to. We'll do that when the right point of intercepting the roadmap and getting the right performance off the 14-nanometer is required. Right now, I'm more concerned about getting the leading-edge momentum going for us with the 7360 and then the follow-on in 2017 and really showing that we are a world-class modem company.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
All right. And as my follow-up, staying on the DCG team, are you still comfortable this can be a double-digit growth business over the longer term? And I guess as part of that, what role does competition play into it with all the recent noise around SoftBank buying ARM and presumably putting more resources into it? I understand there are no near-term implications. But just longer term, how do you think about growth and competition in DCG? Thank you.

Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure, so let me try and talk about why I am so confident in growth. We can talk about competition, and then we'll see if that does not answer your question. When I think of the cloud, the cloud that we have today is really built on the backs of people. It's your Facebook data, it's your Salesforce data, it's your Twitter data. It's all data that is really across the devices that we pretty much handle day to day. The current estimates are, if you look out into 2020, that average person will generate about 1.5 gigabytes a day of data off those devices, and those are going to be all your posts and pictures and all that kind of information.
If you take a look at the average autonomous car in 2020, the estimates right now are it will throw off about 40 gigabytes a minute of data. If you take a look at the average autonomous drone doing some kind of scan, looking for somebody lost in the forest or scanning a mine, it's going to throw off about 20 gigabytes a minute. If you take something like our replay technology that is filming in virtual reality, a basketball game or a football game, it's throwing off 200 gigabytes a minute right now. And as we continue to refine the accuracy of that, that number will likely just grow. So it's that growth in data and the need to both process it at the edge and then through the data center and into the cloud, to be able to store it, to be able to apply machine learning to all of those applications. Those all tell me that the cloud is going to continue to grow.
It's going to be lumpy. These guys don't build out their data centers in a linear fashion. They build out a big chunk of overcapacity so that they can go and then sell that and have expansion space, and they don't build for a while. And so I know people worry about is it slowing down? But these trends in data that tell me no, it's not slowing down over the long term, and what you're really going to see is just the buying patterns and the build-outs of the various structures that are going up.
As far as competition, there's always going to be competition in this market. I expect it. That's okay. We think of ourselves as competition, in fact. We are built on a model that says we have to build a continuous improvement of our products such that we are replacing ourselves with a better cost-per-performance model over time. And so we know that just even if there was no competition, the competition is we've got to build a product that's better and drives replacement as well as growth. And so I look at the competition as it's welcome. It keeps us better. It's always been out there. There will always be somebody out there. But really what we have to do is build products that are so competitive that people want to replace our products with our new product. That then is one of the best models to use for making sure you stay ahead.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Great, thank you.
Mark H. Henninger - Vice President-Finance & Director-IR
Thanks, Vivek. Operator, can you please go ahead and introduce our first questioner – or last questioner, excuse me?
Operator
Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of David Wong of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks very much. Just following up from the earlier round, can you give us some feel for your attitude to total amount of debt? You have a goal of net cash neutrality, but you have an upper limit on the total amount of debt you're willing to carry. Might you choose at some point to repatriate overseas cash to bring down debt or pay dividends and stock purchases?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Wow, so there certainly is a limit to the amount of overall debt that I feel comfortable with, but it's not something that we've articulated externally, and it will vary by the size of the company and the cash flow. To my philosophy, just generally I'm not a believer in taking on debt to do stock buybacks. You really have not seen us do that. Obviously, it's a board decision, but I'm just sharing with you my view of it. I wouldn't take on debt in order to do buybacks or to do a special dividend or anything like that.

David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great, thanks very much.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
You're welcome.
Mark H. Henninger - Vice President-Finance & Director-IR
David, did you have a follow-up? It sounds like you're all set, David. All right, thank you all for joining us today. Operator, please go ahead and wrap up the call.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Intel Corporation Q1 2016 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference to Mark Henninger, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Mark H. Henninger - Vice President-Finance & Director-IR
Thank you, Nicole, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release, CFO commentary and the announcement of our restructuring program. If you've not received all three documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com.
I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by the Q&A. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.
And a brief reminder that this quarter, we provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, following the acquisition of Altera, now our Programmable Solutions Group. Today, we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures. The CFO commentary and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations.
With that out of the way, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Mark. Our results in Q1 were in the lower half of the range we set in January and reflect an extra work week in the quarter. Revenue increased year-over-year, driven by an expanding business portfolio that now includes the Programmable Solutions Group, formerly known as Altera. Strength in our Data Center, Internet of Things and Programmable Solutions businesses partially offset weaker-than-expected PC revenues in our Client business. I'll take a minute to review our Q1 results before talking about the restructuring program we're announcing today.
CCG revenue grew 2% year-over-year. We saw ongoing declines in the PC TAM, particularly in China and other emerging markets, which also led to greater-than-anticipated reductions in worldwide PC supply chain inventory. Declines in the PC segment were offset by a richer core mix and the 14th work week.
The Data Center business posted another good quarter, growing 9% over last year on strong cloud and comms service provider demand, partially offset by ongoing softness in the enterprise. The Internet of Things Group grew a remarkable 22% year-over-year due largely to the performance of the video and retail verticals. In the Memory business, strong unit growth was offset by pricing declines leading to revenue that was 6% lower year-over-year, and in our Security business, revenue grew 12%, as this team continues to tighten its focus and execution.

And finally the PSG Group, formerly known as Altera, got off to a great start. It delivered a revenue of $359 million. And after adjusting for $100 million in acquisition-related accounting charges, the business achieved mid-single-digit growth. In less than a quarter after the deal closed, we are shipping our first FPGA Xeon co-packaged parts to customers in sample form.
These results tell the story of Intel's ongoing strategic transformation, which is progressing well and will accelerate in 2016. We are evolving from a PC company to a company that powers the cloud and billions of smart connected and computing devices. The Data Center and Internet of Things businesses are now Intel's primary growth engines, and combined with Memory and FPGAs form and fuel a virtuous cycle of growth.
Last year, we achieved record revenue in the Data Center, Internet of Things and Memory businesses. They delivered a combined $2.2 billion in revenue growth and made up 40% of our total revenue and contributed the majority of our operating profit.
Today, we announced a series of actions that will build on the strength of those franchises and accelerate our strategic transformation. Through this initiative, we will intensify our investments in the products and technologies that fuel the growth in the Data Center, IoT, Memory and FPGA businesses. And we expect it will result in an even more profitable Client business.
These changes will reduce our global employment by about 12,000 positions by mid-2017. We'll do this through site consolidation, voluntary and involuntary separations, project reevaluation and an intensified focus on efficiency across a variety of programs. These are not changes we take lightly. We will be saying goodbye to colleagues who have played an important role in Intel's success. Yet acting now gives us flexibility, flexibility to continue to invest in those Client segments that are growing, including 2-in-1, gaming, and home gateway, among others.
Even more importantly, acting now enables us to increase our investments in areas that are critical to our future success. This restructuring program will allow us to expand our investments in the Data Center, the Internet of Things, Memory and connectivity, even as we reduce our spending run rate by roughly $1.4 billion by mid-2017. This is a comprehensive initiative. It's designed to create long-term value by accelerating the fundamental long-term change already happening at the company today. We will emerge as a more collaborative, productive team with broader reach and sharper execution and we expect it to result in the highest revenue per employee in the company's history.
Last, but certainly not least, we have one additional announcement today. I'm happy to share that Stacy Smith will be taking on a broader new role within Intel and reporting to me, leading sales, manufacturing and operations. Stacy has been a great business partner and a world-class CFO and I'm looking forward to continuing the partnership as he brings his leadership, his depth of knowledge, and his breadth into these critically important areas for Intel's future. We expect this transition to occur over the next few months, following a formal CFO search that will assess internal and external candidates. Stacy will remain in his CFO role throughout the search and transition process. Congratulations, Stacy.
And with that, let me turn the call over to you.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Thank you very much, Brian, and I really appreciate the kind words.
Revenue for the first quarter was $13.8 billion, up 8% year-over-year. The quarter showed year-on-year growth and was in the low end of the range of our prior outlook. Within this, we are seeing growth in the Data Center, Internet of Things, Security and Programmable Solutions Groups, all of which helped offset a weak PC market.

First quarter gross margin of 62.7% was approximately a point higher than our expectations, driven by lower 14nm costs. R&D and MG&A was $5.4 billion, down over $100 million from our guidance. Operating income of $3.3 billion was up 13% from a year ago. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.4%, about seven points lower than our prior outlook. Earnings per share of $0.54 was up 20% from a year ago.
The Client Computing Group had revenue of $7.5 billion, a 2% increase year-over-year. This was below our expectations due to a weaker-than-expected PC market. Operating profit for the Client Computing Group was $1.9 billion, up 34% from a year ago. This improvement is driven by lower 14nm unit costs on notebooks, lower overall total spending and margin improvements in our mobile products. Data Center Group had revenue of $4 billion, delivering 9% growth on a year-over-year basis. Relative to our expectations, we saw a weaker enterprise business offset by strength in the cloud segment. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.8 billion, up 4% year-over-year as we ramp are 14nm server products.
Our Internet of Things segment achieved revenue of $651 million, with year-over-year growth of 22%. We saw strength in both the retail and video display segments of our business. Internet of Things operating profit was $123 million, up over 40% relative to last year. Our Security business had revenue of $537 million, up 12% year-over-year. Our Memory business had revenue of $557 million, up 6% year-over-year. The segment had an operating loss of $95 million as a result of challenging pricing, increased 3D XPoint spending and startup costs as we ramp 3D NAND in our China factory.
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $359 million. When adjusted for the approximately $100 million of deferred revenue and compared to Altera's results from a year ago, the business achieved mid-single-digit revenue growth. Operating profit was a negative $200 million. This included over $300 million in non-cash charges for deferred revenue and inventory adjustments plus certain acquisition-related charges. Excluding these charges would result in low double-digit operating margin growth for this business.
We generated $4.1 billion of cash from operations in the first quarter. We purchased $1.3 billion in capital assets, paid $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchased approximately $800 million of stock in the first quarter. Total cash balance at the end of the quarter was roughly $15 billion, down $10 billion from the prior quarter as a result of closing the Altera acquisition. Our total debt is approximately $25 billion, consistent with our prior commentary on the financing plan for the Altera acquisition.
As we look forward to the second quarter of 2016, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $13.5 billion. After adjusting for the extra work week in the first quarter, this forecast is in the low end of the average seasonal increase for the second quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to be 61%, plus or minus a couple of points. This decrease in comparison to the first quarter is driven by lower platform volumes.
Turning to the full year 2016, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits from 2015, down from the prior guidance. We are forecasting robust growth rates in the Data Center, Internet of Things, Non-Volatile Memory Solutions and Programmable Solutions Groups, which we expect to offset the decline in the Client Computing Group. We now expect the PC markets to decline in the high single digits in 2016 versus our prior forecast of mid-single-digit decline.
Our projection of the PC market remains more cautions than third-party estimates. We are forecasting the midpoint of the full year gross margin to be 62%, a one-point decrease from the prior outlook driven by lower platform volumes. Our execution of our strategy is driving growth. We are building on our strong position in Client and are investing for growth in the Data Center, Internet of Things markets and disruptive differentiated memory technology.

The trends over the last two years demonstrate that we are well into this transformational journey. From 2013 to 2015, the PC TAM declined 10%, yet Intel's revenue grew 5% and our operating profit grew 14% over this horizon. But as Brian mentioned, we want to accelerate that execution. In order to do that, we're going to go through a significant restructuring over the next several months. The goal is to come out of this more agile, more efficient, with more investment on our key growth initiatives and more profitable.
When completed by mid-2017, these actions will result in a 12,000-person workforce reduction and a $1.4 billion reduction to our spending run rate. Relative to full-year 2016, we are now revising our spending guidance down by over $700 million to $20.6 billion. We expect to realize over half of the total workforce reduction by the end of this year.
In the second quarter of this year, we are taking a $1.2 billion restructuring charge on the GAAP P&L as an estimate for the related actions. These actions are significant, and we don't embark on this lightly. But we are confident that they will build on the strong position we have across markets and accelerate the transformation of the company that is already underway.
I would like to end on a brief personal note by saying thank you to Brian for the upcoming new leadership opportunity. Intel changes the world with amazing technology, and I am proud of what we have accomplished and I'm excited about the opportunity that's in front of us.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark H. Henninger - Vice President-Finance & Director-IR
All right, thank you, Brian and Stacy. Moving on now to the Q&A, as is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask one question and just one follow-up if you have one. Nicole, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess first and foremost, B.K., if you can, go into a little bit more about what led to the restructuring announcement. Not only the one today, but there have been significant changes in senior management over the last three months. So if you could, just talk us through some of what's changed strategically in the company that's led to such a large amount of turnover so recently.
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. If you take a look at it, so let's step back for a second and just talk about why are we doing the restructuring now, and then we can talk about some of the specifics beyond that. So we've talked about this transformation, that we're moving from a client-centric – Intel's been typically known as the PC company, to a company that is focused more and more on a much broader set of products and really focused around the cloud, and the cloud and all the connected devices that connect to that cloud and the connectivity that brings those devices to the cloud. And that includes the PC, but it's much more than that.
And so what this effort around the restructuring is, is to say it's time now to try and – we've made enough progress. You take a look at it, 40% of our revenue, 60% of our margin comes from areas other than the PC right now. It's time to make this transition and push the company over all the way to that strategy and that strategic direction. So that's why we wanted to do it now.
Let's talk then about the leadership changes. There have really only been three leadership changes, if we just take the last couple of quarters. We had Doug Davis, he's simply retiring. Those are personal reasons. It has nothing to do with his leadership or direction of the company. It's IoT. We've talked about IoT as one of our growth segments that grew 22% this quarter. (16:19) performance in the group is strong. And he's staying until we find a successor, roughly the end of the year we think, something like that. Kirk chose to leave for some outside opportunities.

And the one with Stacy, Stacy and I have been working for several months, actually several quarters, on what does he do next, how do we grow his both exposure to other parts of the company, but also let the rest of the company see his leadership style. And so what we wanted to do is as soon as we'd made the decision to go ahead and start a search and start looking for a CFO replacement, we wanted to be completely transparent, be very open about that and let everyone know. It's just going to be an orderly transition. We are just going to start the search, see if Stacy's solid in the CFO seat in the meantime. But this gives him a chance to see other parts of the company. If you take a look at the group manufacturing operations, which is everything from purchasing to building construction and all, and sales, it's roughly half the company and people, and so it's a really good opportunity to see how the real operations of the company work.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good, thanks for all those details. I guess my follow-up would be the full-year guidance of mid-single-digit growth, when I put that together with the high single-digit decline now that you have in the PC business, I'm having a little hard time seeing how if you take the seasonality of PCs out of the equation in large part, what would be the lever that would get you there in the back half of the year, considering that a ramp to well into the $15 billion range in revenue seems to be a prerequisite? Are there some moving parts you could describe to us that get you comfortable with that number?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Sure. Let me walk you through how we're viewing the year. And first let me just put it at the highest level. What we're projecting for the year is overall growth, and we think we'll see growth in the data center, growth in IoT, growth in memory that's offsetting some. And of course we have added in Altera now into our product family. And so you take that, and that's offsetting some of the weakness that we're seeing in the PC market.
Specific to the PC market, as we said in our prepared remarks, we are now expecting that the PC market is down in the high single digits, and when we started the year we were in the mid-single-digits decline.
The linearity, so first you have to understand. The first half is impacted by the fact that as our customers' view of the market came down, and if you recall, we had a more cautious view of the market than they did when we started the year, that they were bringing down inventory levels. That impacted us in Q1, and I think you'll see the same impact as we forecast a roughly seasonal second quarter; that we'll continue to see those customers burning off inventory. We think that doesn't repeat in the back half. So that's a little bit of a tailwind.
I'd also say you want to be careful of – we guided to mid-single digits. That's a range. If you're mathematically trying to drive to a specific number there, you may be driving more back end than what we're really anticipating. So just a caution there that that's a range that's meant to be directional of how we see the business. All of that said, I just want to say I think Brian and I are very comfortable with the back end and what's implied in our guide based on everything that we know.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yes, thanks for taking my question. I really just wanted to follow up on the restructuring. Is it more an effort to make the Client more profitable, or are you really trying to drive revenue and re-signing maybe more employees than you're letting go?

Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
So it is absolutely a situation where we are restructuring to be able to allow ourselves to invest at a faster rate in those growth areas. If you take a look at it, 2016 to 2015 in the areas of Memory with our NAND technology, IoT, data center, even before this action, we were investing more in 2016 than in 2015 in those areas. This will allow us to – even with the cuts, even with the dollar figures that Stacy has read out on the savings, it's allowing us to invest even more in those segments.
And I always want to make sure it's not just about cutting costs necessarily in the Client area. We think that we can become more focused. There are areas in the Client space that are growing. 2-in-1s are growing at double-digit rates year-over-year. Our gaming PCs are growing at double-digit rates year-over-year. Set-top boxes are growing, and we're gaining share in the set-top box space. So we are doing very well in segments that are growing in the Client space and the PC space. And we are going to continue to double down, focus on those. So it's really a narrowing down and allowing us as a result also to invest more in those growth areas. That's really what we're doing here with this restructuring.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
And, Blayne, just to make sure, if you look at the CFO commentary, just to give – kind of make sure the financial answer is clear there, that the $1.4 billion in run rate savings is a net number. So I just want to be clear on that. That's what we expect to achieve, and that is encompassing the fact, like Brian said, that we'll be increasing investments in a lot of different areas.
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Correct.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks. And then I know mobile is within Client, but I was wondering if that's a segment that you expect to contribute to growth this year, and if you could just talk about your confidence in reaching the cost savings for the year?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. Absolutely on schedule for hitting our committed $800 million and just like last year, we'll shoot to do better than that. Mobile is absolutely continuing to grow for us as a segment, and we are continuing to increase our profitability. If you look underneath the numbers here, you'll see that the profitability within the mobile space continues to improve for us this year over last year.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yes, you can really see it, Blayne, in the CCG operating profit, that's up over 30%, which is on roughly flat revenues, revenues that were up a little bit, and when you parse out the big contributions there, there's some ASP good news, but the really big chunks are the improvement in the margin on our mobile products and decreases in investments that we talked to you about in the past that were all included in that mobile profitability. So you will see this play out in the CCG profitability over the course this year, and you can see it in Q1.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great, thanks, guys.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I'm trying to see if you can be just a bit more specific on your full year view. Does the team anticipate double-digit growth this year in PCG? And if I look at it fundamentally, I mean cloud and hyperscale CapEx looks to be up this year. There seems to be a big upgrade cycle in networking with the move to 25-gigabit. You guys are rolling out 14nm Broadwell. Can you guys just be a bit more specific on expectations for DCG growth?

Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. You did a great job explaining exactly why we believe that the data center will continue in double-digit growth this year. And if you take a look at the numbers that Stacy has talked about, they incorporate double-digit growth and it's for exactly those reasons. We believe we have great products that we are introducing with the Broadwell lineup. We have got – we started shipping our first Xeon plus FPGA samples to customers, which was part of our additional gaining more footprint and more performance in certain segments of the Data Center.
We're shipping an Omni-Path Fabric now. Later this year, we will have Silicon Photonics. We've got 3D XPoint starting to be sampled, and will start to ramp later this year. So we're very confident on our Data Center roadmap and we are still absolutely forecasting double-digit growth in that space.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great, thanks for the insights there. And then in the Memory Solutions Group, I mean that's a business that grew 20% last year. I think it was up year-over-year every single quarter last year, obviously it was down in Q1. You guys mentioned aggressive price declines. Can you just talk about some of the trends that you're seeing there? Are the sharp declines more focused on capacity or performance optimized SSDs? And then you also mentioned your view on a strong growth outlook for the full year. So what drives the acceleration from the Q1 decline?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. So let me start, and then we can just talk about – remember the majority of our Memory space is built into SSDs that are going into the Data Center. So you call those, really those higher end performance class systems. What we are seeing, if you take a look at the units, units grew quite nicely year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter for the Memory Group. You are right. We are seeing aggressive pricing in this space. The Memory segment, the NAND segment especially tends to go on these cycles where there's overcapacity in the industry and aggressive pricing, and then it shifts back to more normal pricing, and then tight pricing, which is always very positive.
So this is just a normal cycle. We think we've done a very good job of structuring the business that we ride through these with a high degree of confidence. If I look forward, we believe the 3D NAND technology that we're just beginning to ramp in our factories today and we're building out the Dalian factory for later this year startup, gives us a real cost advantage in this space and will allow us to even be more profitable in even these kinds of environments.
So we are still confident that this business will continue to grow. We will ride through this capacity situation within the industry and our 3D NAND technology will position us very nicely as we move out of this and start up our Dalian factory in China.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great, thank you.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
And the operating margin, Harlan, you're looking at that?
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yes.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Part of it is the competitive pricing environment that Brian is talking about, but there's a big piece of that that is associated with the investments that we are making in 3D XPoint and the startup costs associated with the factory in China. And it just points to, yes, it's cyclically a tough time in what we consider a very good business and we're investing in technology that we think give us a very strong position as we go forward.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
I understand. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.

Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one on DCG in the quarter, so up 9% year over year, but that was with the extra week. Can you tell us what it might have been year over year without the extra week? And why did pricing fall again this quarter?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yes, so like we said when we started the quarter, that extra week was that week between Christmas and New Year's. When you look at where that 14th week fell, it's a relatively light week. It certainly had some impact, so I don't want to say, none, but it's a little hard to figure it out on any given business. It certainly had some impact on DCG though.
In terms of the pricing, it's pretty simple in that it was the growth rate that we saw in the networking segment. So what you would see if – the constant mix, we would have seen ASP up in the Data Center. But the networking segment grew 60% year on year, which is exactly consistent with our strategy. And so what you see there is strong unit growth offset by a little bit of a mix down.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research
Got it, thank you. For my follow-up, I just wanted to touch on channel inventories. So you had your notebook and desktop volumes I guess down kind of low single digits year over year. I think it's fair to say the PC builds in the industry were down quite a bit more than that. I mean, you suggest that you drained out – I guess that the channel drained on inventory. What happened with your own inventory in the channel? And how do you see that changing for the rest of the year?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
You said own inventory in the channel...
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research
The stuff you're shipping into the channel because it seems like your performance year-over-year was quite a bit better than what the industry was? I mean maybe it's some share gains, maybe it's the extra week. However, you just said the extra week didn't amount for very much. So can you explain the differential between your year-over-year unit shipment performance in PCs and what the market seems to be doing?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
So I would point to two things relative to the overall – like what we saw from our customers. One is, yes, we had a 14th week. That's going to make our compares different from a IDC and a Gartner for sure. But then the second thing is when you look at the results of our customer base, they would see a weaker quarter and I think that's because they were catching up to our view of the market and bringing inventory levels down. So, we were impacted by two things. I'll put it like that. We were impacted by a TAM that wasn't terribly strong and the fact that our customers were bringing their inventory levels down some.
Mark H. Henninger - Vice President-Finance & Director-IR

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah of Nomura. Your line is now open.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Yes. Thanks very much. Stacy, you're below your run rate on CapEx in Q1, and I know you reiterated for the year, but curious if you're giving yourself flexibility in case the second half doesn't prove out to be as strong as you guys are anticipating?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
No. What's going on there is that when you look at the two items that really dominated our CapEx this year, it's 10 nm capacity, so it's getting that first production capability in place. And it's the ramp of the Memory factory in China, and those are both backend loaded, so that causes the linearity to be off a little bit.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.

Okay, thanks. And then just staying on the theme of CapEx with the restructuring you guys are talking about, site consolidation, and I'm wondering if longer-term, there will be an impact to the capital expenditures required to support the business and, by extension, free cash flow.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
I'd say the same answer. When you look at those two items that are the majority of what we're spending the CapEx on, 10nm and Memory, neither one of those is impacted by the restructuring, and so we haven't let our foot off the gas one bit on those two things.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Okay, thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI
Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess I had a follow-up on DCG. Thank you for the commentary around the pricing around network. I'm curious how we should think about the mix shift through as we go through 2016, and here curious in terms of presumably slowing enterprise and an uptick in hyperscale and what that means to ASPs. And then as you layer in ongoing growth in networking, how we should think about platform versus ASPs moving through the year?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure, a bit of a complex question, so let me try and give you a lot of data that I hope will answer various parts of that question. So first, the simple answer. If you take a look at our forecast, we continue to forecast ASPs increasing through this year, so that's absolutely built into our forecast. And we've modeled in things like you described, the weaker enterprise computing and the difference between the pricing segments. And I always remind people that – let's just start at the very top. When you take a look at the Data Center, it's not one product. It's a family of products that really span from Xeon Phis that sell for several thousand dollars to networking processors that are a few hundred dollars at times.
But within each one of those families, so whether you have networking or cloud or hyperscale or enterprise computing, our ASPs are increasing. And that's mostly due to bringing in better products, people buying up the ladder in product and resulting in a higher ASP on average for any one of those segments. So you will see slight shifts in the overall Data Center ASP. We have a boomer quarter like this, like Stacy talked about. Networking is a little bit higher or something like that, but if you take a look inside any one of those segments, ASPs are increasing and our forecast for the overall segment for the year is an increasing ASP. It's driven by people buying up the stock, and that's because we're bringing more performance for a better price to those customers.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI
That's very helpful. And I guess as a quick follow-up, you outlined the cost savings, but it doesn't appear as though there's really anything on the COGS side, so curious if you see cost savings on that front as well.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Certainly. We are equally focused on efficiencies in the factory space. There's a little bit baked into the 2016 gross margin. I think you'll see a bit more of it kick in, in 2017. And just realize the labor cost in the factories is a relatively small component. The real opportunity for us is some of the other things around capital efficiency and how fast we convert over processes and things like that, and that takes a little while to play through.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI
That's very helpful. Thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.

John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. I guess my first one, I wanted to get a little bit more into profitability within the Data Center Group. Revenue was down about $309 million sequentially. Operating profit was down $411 million sequentially. I know there are lots of moving parts. You had the extra week of OpEx that might not have been fully covered by revenue. And, Stacy, you talked about in your opening comments the 14nm ramp starting to hit there.
But with this new narrative of declining ASPs because of mix, I'm wondering if you could tell me how we should be thinking about operating profits in the business going forward. I think it was about 44% in the March quarter, down pretty significantly in the December quarter. Is this change in mix also having an impact on operating profits?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
So, John, you nailed it in terms of what's going on with operating profit in Q1. It's just the early cost of the ramp of the 14nm server product. That's what's causing that to behave a little differently from revenue. And back to Brian's point, I would say no. There's nothing in the mix that per se would cause me to have a different view of the overall profit potential of this business. So taking networking as the example, it does have a lower ASP than the Xeon product line does. It also has a very different cost structure than the Xeon product line does. So it doesn't cause us to be in a different space from an overall operating profit percent.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
That's helpful. And then maybe for my follow-up to Brian, you guys gave us your view for the PC market this year. I'm just curious, in lieu of the restructuring, how you're thinking about the PC market longer term. And specifically, there's lots going on in the market that you probably can't control, but there's always been this view at Intel that the best use of cash is to invest in the business and to innovate, and innovation drives growth. How do you balance that innovation desire with the realities of PC market? And how do you think about the structural unit growth of PCs going forward? And do we want to risk at some point that PCs just don't provide the scale that you've talked about in the past to invest in other businesses like DCG and IoT?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. So again, John, that's a bit of a two-sided question. So let me start with the back half and then we'll move into the first half. So first is no, I'm not worried that PC will shrink to a point where the scale will get large enough to fund either the factories or the other innovations. The fact that we talked about the restructuring actually makes us more profitable in the PC. That's allowing us to invest even more in those growth areas. Remember also, those growth areas are growing, and so they are replacing some of the volume in the factories as they grow.
Now, let's talk about the PC. You asked, how do we take a look at the PC long term and how do we make sure we're making the right investments, which to me that's the key. That's what we really tried to do with this restructuring, is take a look at the areas that are growing, that we believe we can bring innovation to, that will make a difference to the end user. You're going to see more investments in 2-in-1s. You're going to see more investments in thin-and-light devices. You're going to see us push even harder on high-end gaming systems, which are growing at a very fast rate, and they tend to buy up the stack to the very, very top. And then we're continuing to gain share in segments like set-top boxes, which are becoming more and more PC-like in their capabilities, if you think about it from a hardware standpoint.

So there are absolutely segments we'll continue to invest and continue to innovate in. There are some very innovative systems in design right now that bring new functionality and new thinness and lightness to the market for the second half of this year. And we'll do that. What we're going to do is make sure we're not doing – that we're doing this as most efficiently, and not doing it spread out across all PCs and all form factors. And that's what we've really tried to do with this effort right now.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks a lot. I think just to start, could you just talk about from a restructuring cost perspective, how much of that is going to be cash versus non-cash? And would all the cash outlays happen in the back half of this year?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
You were a bit faint. I think you asked on the restructuring, how much of that is cash versus non-cash, and how does that play out over the year?
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yes.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yes, now you're loud and clear. Thanks. So I would say the restructuring charge is a mix of cash and non-cash, but it's probably – it's more heavily weighted towards cash costs. And it will be relatively frontend loaded on the year, but some of it will extend over the course of the year, and some of it frankly will extend into the first half of next year.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Perfect. And I guess if I could just follow up, ASPs in the clients were up 19%. Just talk about how much of that was potentially CPE improvements on notebook and desktop pricing versus the lower mobility that may have had a better part to play there?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
And if you look at the CFO commentary, we actually gave you desktop and notebook. What you'll see is that notebook was pretty flat from an ASP standpoint year on year. Desktop was up 6%. So that is one of the adders to profitability.
And then the big difference is what happened in phones and tablets. On a year-on-year basis I think I termed it in the CFO commentary, up significantly as we weaned ourselves out of some of those contra revenue programs that we talked to you about. So that actually had a fairly significant impact on the overall ASP for CCG.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Perfect, thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you for taking my question. Brian, on the Data Center Group, there are a lot of headlines from IBM, from the different ARM server vendors, and even from some of your cloud customers, like Google, who want to try new architectures. And I understand there is no near-term impact, but longer-term, how do you assess the competitive landscape? And especially how do you think it plays out in the compute market, where you are a very large incumbent versus the comms market where you're not the incumbent?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure, good question, Vivek. First, I'll just tell you that having been raised by Andy Grove, always paranoid about the competition, always driving. And we know that we live or die by the performance of our products. We believe if you take a look at our roadmaps, we have a strong competitive leadership that should allow us to continue to have the position in the market that we currently have.

I think also you have to take a look at some of our strategy that is becoming much, much broader than just the CPU. What we are trying to do is really provide top-of-rack to bottom-of-rack solutions that bring, that work together and bring performance across the whole rack. And that starts with Rack Scale Architecture itself, which is a very unique architecture that will allow people to build racks in a much denser and lower cost way to Silicon Photonics for within rack communication. Then we've got a 3D XPoint, and then you have our whole CPU architecture from networking, storage, up through server.
So we believe we are uniquely positioned to provide that whole rack viewpoint and have everything work together, and come together to bring really performance that is just unbelievable. And that's what's key to really keeping our position is to own that, is to understand that whole rack from top to bottom. And that really is our strategy when you take a look at it.
In the other areas, like you said, networking and storage and the telco area, those are areas that we're gaining share. And we are, as they move to software-defined infrastructure, and basically virtualized infrastructure, it plays right into the Intel architecture and really what we do best, which is general purpose computing. And that same architecture from top of rack to bottom of rack plays out in those areas as well like in the telco area. So we believe our strategy absolutely will maintain our position in that. But we're always paranoid and we're always realizing we get there by performance of those products.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it, thanks for those details. As a follow-up, I know you probably have answered different pieces of this question. But perhaps if, Stacy, you could, help us quantify what Intel's target operating margins are this year or maybe even longer term. Because when I look at a lot of fabless semiconductor companies, they can get towards 20% – 25% operating margins. And when I look at a foundry like TSMC, it's able to get close to 40% operating margin. So given those bookends, where should Intel be after all these restructuring actions are taken?
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Let me give you some elements of it. And then I would expect we'll have a much more in-depth conversation on that at the next investor meeting. But I will give you some insight into how Brian and I are thinking of this. First and foremost, we believe there is growth potential here. So just from a top line overall company standpoint, we think that there's significant opportunity to grow. And I think we've executed well in terms of growing over the last couple few years, even as the PC TAM declined, and that's very consistent with our strategy, is invest in the Data Center and Memory and IoT and things like 5G, where we think there's opportunity and focus our investments on the Client that we talked about.
In terms of the overall model and the financial model for the company, I've given you this range of 55% to 65% gross margin as being most of the data points landing between those goalposts. If you look at it over the last five years, we've very consistently been in the very high end of that gross margin range, so a bit more like between 60% and 65%. Last year we were at 63%, this year we believe we're at 62%. So that just continues. I don't see anything on the horizon that changes that in the near term.
And then with these actions that we're taking, when we get to full realization, and I want to stress we do believe that this will give us an opportunity to reinvest in the business and actually accelerate growth. But if you just look at the cost side of it, it's two to three points of spending as a percent of revenue. When we get to mid-2017 and full realization, that takes our spending as a percent of revenue, even just based on your estimate of 2016 revenues of two to three points, it takes it back down into the low 30% from a spending as a percent of revenue, and you can do the math from there and see what we think we can achieve next year in terms of overall operating margin.

Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay, thank you very much.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
You're welcome.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely of Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hey. Thanks, guys, just a quick follow-up on the last question on restructuring. So should we assume that total expenses will drop roughly $150 million a quarter from 4Q 2016 to the second quarter of 2017? And then if you guys could, break that out between how much of the savings would be on COGS versus OpEx.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
So no, I'm not going to give that level of granularity of forecasting by quarter in 2017, but I'll say and I want to be clear that the $1.4 billion is all OpEx. So that's an OpEx savings number that we think we get to by mid-2017. And so just to recap some of the financial data that we've provided you, we get to that level by mid-2017. That's $1.4 billion in savings. That is a net number, so that's including some reinvestment that we plan to make. We think that that's 12,000 positions that get eliminated, which is a very difficult thing for us to go through, but that's what's in these numbers. We think we'll achieve half of those employment reductions by the end of this year.
And overall for 2016, we've brought down our OpEx by $700 million. That is again due to this restructuring program. And we've added in a line that you'll see on the GAAP P&L of $1.2 billion in restructuring charges to achieve that. So beyond that, I'm not going to go into any more granular data. I think that should be plenty, and now we want to go have the conversation with the employees and help them understand what this program means.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Yes, very fair response. And as for my follow-up, in terms of the growth opportunities that you guys are really pushing for, IoT, DCG, et cetera, I guess if you look at the margin profile of the Memory and basically cell phone processors, it's substantially below your current margins. So I guess my question is why would you want to pursue two markets like that where the margin profile is so much lower than yours?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure, so let's dissect those. For Memory, one, we believe that if you take a look at our typical margins, they're better than cell phone margins on typical quarters, but also it's integral to the Data Center. So it really actually is this virtual cycle that especially as we move to 3D NAND and then to 3D XPoint, as we've talked about 3D XPoint and how that really re-architects how Memory and storage is played out in the server rack and in the Data Center overall. It's a chance to really very uniquely shift that whole infrastructure. So we believe that's actually critical to our strategy in the Data Center, and we'll bring a product with good margins.
Now let's talk about IoT. If you take a look at it first, it's growing quite well. And if you take a look at the IoT right now, it grew 22% this quarter, and it has PC-like margins. So this is not cell phone chips. They don't tend to be cell phone chips. If you take a look at the segments we're really going after, which are things like automotive, or what I'll call autonomous vehicles, industrial and retail, they tend to be systems that have a fair amount of compute at the edge. They tend to have machine learning capabilities, and they tend to have a high degree of comms, and more and more will move into 5G.
So that link also between those products in IoT and 5G, and the 5G infrastructure, we believe also plays into the Data Center and the whole Data Center strategy, and will be critical that you can provide end-to-end solutions. So if you're somebody out trying to build whatever that autonomous vehicle is, you need to be able to provide the 5G backend, but also the 5G out on the device, whether it's a car, or a drone, or a robot, or whatever it is out there autonomously moving about.

Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
And, Chris, let me just, on the margin point, I would take you back to points that Brian and I had made at the Investor Meeting and at other places, which is, remember, and IoT is the perfect example of this. Those businesses lever IP that we create broadly for the company. And so our cost of entry in something like IoT actually is relatively low because we have the Atom core. We have the graphics. We're investing in the connectivity. We're investing in the wireless win for other businesses, and that's where we really get leverage in this model. And that's one of the reasons that the IoT profit margins have been as high as they have been.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Got it. Thanks, guys.
Mark H. Henninger - Vice President-Finance & Director-IR
Thanks, Chris. And, operator, I think we have time for two more questions.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava of BMO. Your line is now open.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Hi. Thank you very much. Actually I wanted to continue on IoT, Brian. A couple of years ago, you had laid out a 20% CAGR target for this. Then I think a year later, you had brought it down to mid-teens. And yes, it grew very strong this quarter, but last full year it was a 7% grower. So the question is, what's the right way to think about the growth profile for this business? And what happened in the past? Was it a one-year off event or kind of just help us understand the drivers? And why it should re-accelerate? And why the first quarter is not an anomaly? And then I had a quick follow-up.
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. I would tell you that I'd reiterate what I said, which is it's a mid-teen type of growth rate. And you got to take a look at this over the long haul. The IoT space is like similar to the embedded space a little to some extent and to the FPGA space where you have, especially where we're trying to go, where you're trying to go into products that require that higher level of compute, the machine learning and those capabilities. You have a design time, a design-in time to win the design, and then you have a ramp for that product, and so those tend to take a little while.
Autonomous driving vehicles are a good example. If you're out winning designs today, you're winning 2018/2019 car designs. Those are what are being won today. So as you bring your products to market, that's what you're winning. So I'm still believing that over the long-term, this will be a mid-teens growth. It'll have for the most part PC-like margins and we've tried to pick the segments that play to our strengths and that also use the connectivity that we believe we're uniquely qualified to bring.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Okay, thank you. And then my quick follow-up, Stacy, what explains such a big swing in the tax rate for the quarter, for the reported quarter, and then for the rest of the year? Thank you.
Stacy J. Smith - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Sure. For the reported quarter, the big driver of the tax rate was a discrete item associated with one of the divestitures that we drilled out of our Security business. And we got a one-time tax benefit associated with that. And it's just coming back to the strategy, you can see the performance of the Security business both in terms of the revenue growth and their profit growth. I think the team there is doing a really good job of focusing in on a few key areas where we think we have competitive advantage and then driving them hard. And we've divested a few smaller businesses and then we happened to get a tax benefit on one of them. As we look at the year, so part of it is just what happened in Q1, and then the other part is we would expect to have a higher proportion of our profits in lower tax jurisdictions as we work our way through the year. It will bring down the tax rate a little bit.

Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Okay, thank you.
Mark H. Henninger - Vice President-Finance & Director-IR
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Wong of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks very much. A clarification of the commentary you gave earlier on your restructuring. Will there be any product lines or types of products that you'll be pulling out of in the future with all the cuts that you're making?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes, I'm sure that as we go through this and we finish the project evaluations, there will be some products that will exit from those as they're defined. Murthy, who we brought into the company is doing a complete review of all of our products, and he's going to report back to me in the near future and give me a proposal for what those look like. So we don't have any that are set out today, but at the end, I'm sure there are going to be a few that are part of that.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And related to that, does the restructuring affect your longer-term expectations for technology transitions? And in particular, are you still hoping to get back to a two-year tick-tock cadence?
Brian M. Krzanich - Chief Executive Officer & Director
So no, it does not have any effect on our technology cadence. It has not touched that at all. And Stacy talked about even our CapEx and how the CapEx that we're spending this year, which has not moved, is mostly for either the 3D NAND ramp or 10 nm. As far as Moore's Law, we are always constantly striving to get back to two years. We're giving you a timing that's for 10 nm that's more like 2.5 years. We haven't talked about 7 nm, partly it's still in definition and alignment, so we're not sure. But I can truly tell you we are constantly working to get back to two years. And they have tried to lay out, all right, if you look at the history of Moore's Law, there have been anywhere from 18 months to three years in the length of cycles over the time. More importantly, what I always remind people, is the leadership you have over the competition, which is always what's important.
All of these are getting harder and they get hard for everybody. And so you want to make sure also that your leadership gap, what you're able to do relative to the competition, remains constant as well. Both of those are as important as the other.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great, thanks very much.
Mark H. Henninger - Vice President-Finance & Director-IR
Thanks, David. And thank you all for joining us today. Nicole, please go ahead and wrap up the call.

Remarks by President Trump and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich on U.S. Jobs





	Oval Office  

	12:52 P.M. EST

	THE PRESIDENT:  You've never seen so much paper on a President’s desk.  (Laughter.)  That's because we're negotiating lots of deals for our country, which will be tremendous.  

	And I just want to introduce Brian Krzanich, who's the CEO of Intel, a great, great company.  And Brian called a few weeks ago and said, we want to do a very big announcement having to do with our country, but also having to do mostly with Arizona, and the jobs and the great technology that will be produced.

	So this is Brian.  And, Brian, why don't you say a few words and maybe also talk about the product you're going to be making.  It’s amazing.

	MR. KRZANICH:  Yes.  Thank you, Mr. President, for this.  It’s an honor to be here today representing Intel and to be able to announce our $7 billion investment in our newest, most advanced factory -- Fab 42 in Chandler, Arizona.  We’ll be completing that factory to make the most advanced 7-nanometer semiconductor chips on the planet.

	Intel is very proud of the fact that the majority of our manufacturing is here in the U.S. and the majority of our research and development is here in the U.S., while over 80 percent of what we sell is sold outside of the U.S.  And we're consistently one of the top five exporters in the country and one of the top two research and development spenders in the United States.  And we've been able to do that even while the regulatory and tax policies have disadvantaged us in the past relative to the competition we have across the world.  

	And Fab 42 is an investment in Intel, but also the U.S.’s future in innovation and leadership in the semiconductor industry.  Fab 42 will employ approximately 3,000 direct high-paying, high-wage, high-tech jobs at its peak, and over 10,000 people in the Arizona area in support of the factory.  And this factory will produce, as I said, the most powerful computer chips on the planet, powering the best computers, the best data centers, autonomous cars.  All of these devices are the most powerful computing devices on the planet.

	And at Intel we have a simple saying that says, while other people predict the future, we build the future.  And this factory is a great example of that.

	I want to thank the President for this opportunity to be here today.

	THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Brian.  And you have something over there.  Show a little bit about the new product.

	MR. KRZANICH:  This is an example of the wafer that will be built in Fab 42.  This is one of our newest 10-nanometer silicon wafers.  Seven-nanometers will be built in Fab 42.  And this is the future of computing.

	THE PRESIDENT:  That's great, thanks.  Do you have any questions for Brian?  I know you have none for me, so how about -- (laughter) --   

	Q    Are you going to bring back jobs?  The other business you have outside the country, do you plan on bringing them back here?

	MR. KRZANICH:  This is actually expansion.  This is about growth.  So this position is actually about growth and new jobs in the U.S. 

	THE PRESIDENT:  Great thing for Arizona.  Unbelievable company and product, and we're very happy.  And I can tell you the people of Arizona are very happy.  It’s a lot of jobs.  Probably the investment -- what are you saying, your total investment will be what?

	MR. KRZANICH:  Total investment in just this factory is $7 billion.  But if you take Arizona, we already have two other factories in Arizona.  So we have several tens of billions of dollars of investments in factories in Arizona.  We're the number-one private employer in Arizona.

	Q    And how long have you been planning this investment?

	MR. KRZANICH:  We've been working on this factory for several years.  We held off actually doing this investment until now.

	Q    Was there something that President Trump did or said that made you want to announce this here and now?

	MR. KRZANICH:  It’s really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward that really make it advantageous to do manufacturing in the U.S. 

	THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, all.

Brian Krzanich



Krzanich in 2014



Born
Brian Matthew Krzanich
(1960-05-09) May 9, 1960 (age 57)
Santa Clara County, California, U.S.


Alma mater
San Jose State University


Occupation
CEO of Intel


Salary
U$14.6 million (2015)[1]


Spouse(s)
Brandee Krzanich


Children
2


Brian Matthew Krzanich (born May 9, 1960)[2] is the Chief Executive Officer of Intel. He was elected CEO on May 2, 2013, concluding a six-month executive search after incumbent CEO Paul Otellini announced his resignation in November 2012. Krzanich assumed the role of CEO on May 16, 2013 at the company's annual general meeting.[3] Before becoming CEO, he was Intel's Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.
Krzanich earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry from San Jose State University and holds a patent for semiconductor processing. He joined Intel in 1982 in New Mexico as an engineer. He was promoted to COO in January 2012.[4][5] He often visits Intel-sponsored hackathons and Best Buys with his wife and two daughters.[6][7] Krzanich is of Croatian descent.
Controversies[edit]





This section may lend undue weight to certain ideas, incidents, or controversies. Please help to create a more balanced presentation. Discuss and resolve this issue before removing this message. (February 2017)


On June 1, 2016, Krzanich cancelled a fundraiser at his home in Atherton, California[8] for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump after the New York Times asked Intel that day for details about the event, originally scheduled for June 2, 2016.[9][10] The invitation to the event was sent by Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and was also going to feature Steven Mnuchin and Elliott Broidy.[11][12] A spokesperson for Intel told the New York Times that the fundraiser would include “a full exchange of views” before Krzanich announced on Twitter that he did not intend to endorse a candidate and was interested in engaging both the Trump and the Clinton campaigns in dialogue about technology issues.[13][14] A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign said the event was cancelled due to a scheduling conflict,[10] and Trump held a rally in San Jose on June 2.[15] The fundraiser was widely seen as incongruous with Intel’s support for immigration reform and US$300 million effort to attract women and minorities, as well as detrimental to the company’s interests in China, the biggest market for the semiconductor industry.

Brian Matthew Krzanich (born May 9, 1960)[2] is the Chief Executive Officer of Intel. He was elected CEO on May 2, 2013, concluding a six-month executive search after incumbent CEO Paul Otellini announced his resignation in November 2012. Krzanich assumed the role of CEO on May 16, 2013 at the company's annual general meeting.[3] Before becoming CEO, he was Intel's Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.
Krzanich earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry from San Jose State University and holds a patent for semiconductor processing. He joined Intel in 1982 in New Mexico as an engineer. He was promoted to COO in January 2012.[4][5] He often visits Intel-sponsored hackathons and Best Buys with his wife and two daughters.[6][7] Krzanich is of Croatian descent.
Controversies[edit]

On June 1, 2016, Krzanich cancelled a fundraiser at his home in Atherton, California[8] for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump after the New York Times asked Intel that day for details about the event, originally scheduled for June 2, 2016.[9][10] The invitation to the event was sent by Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and was also going to feature Steven Mnuchin and Elliott Broidy.[11][12] A spokesperson for Intel told the New York Times that the fundraiser would include “a full exchange of views” before Krzanich announced on Twitter that he did not intend to endorse a candidate and was interested in engaging both the Trump and the Clinton campaigns in dialogue about technology issues.[13][14] A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign said the event was cancelled due to a scheduling conflict,[10] and Trump held a rally in San Jose on June 2.[15] The fundraiser was widely seen as incongruous with Intel’s support for immigration reform and US$300 million effort to attract women and minorities, as well as detrimental to the company’s interests in China, the biggest market for the semiconductor industry.

Intel's 'Bay Trail' Atom chip could blur the line between PCs, tablets





Intel's Atom is on a collision course with Core—and everybody loses






Intel’s next-gen CEO must get inside next-gen devices






Video
Asus ROG Zephyrus GX501 Review























While the PC isn’t disappearing anytime soon, it may as well be the deranged grandmother locked away within Intel’s attic, whose faint screams are ignored in the rooms below.
Indeed, Intel’s newly minted chief executive, Brian Krzanich, speaking to analysts and investors in his Q2 2013 earnings call, didn’t even mention notebooks, let alone the desktop, in his prepared remarks. And the only mention he made of the personal computer was a mea culpa: “We were slow to respond to the ultramobile PC trend,” he said, admitting that part of Intel’s job was to scan for trends and react to them.
IntelIntel chief executive Brian Krzanich.Krzanich has an excuse: He’s been on the job for just two months, taking over for Intel’s prior chief executive, Paul Otellini. As analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights noted, Intel was bailed out once again by its success in the data center market, where revenue was up 6.1 percent sequentially and flat year-over-year in Intel’s second-quarter earnings, which it reported on Wednesday. But sales within the PC Client group plunged 7.5 percent compared to the same period a year ago, representative of the continuing slide in the PC market.
But Krzanich made clear several things:

Minimizing power, not maximizing performance, is now the point of almost everything Intel does.
”Ultramobile” is now synonymous with PC. Desktops and notebooks exist, but they won’t be the priority. And tablets will make up a small, but increasing portion of Intel’s business, using its Atom processor.
Those with the best fabs, win. Intel will ramp its next-generation 14-nm manufacturing technology this fall, a fundamental approach to increasing performance, lowering power consumption, and extending battery life. Defect densities with Intel’s current 22-nm process are at record lows.
Intel’s Atom processor is now on an equal footing with Intel’s Core chips with the PC. “Atom will be an equal player in technological leadership within the product space,” Krzanich said.
IntelManufacturing will continue to be a key to Intel’s success.

Intel’s call with analysts was also notable for what it downplayed: performance. Over the years I’ve covered chipmakers in Silicon Valley, every conversation at least touched upon performance: the frame rates GPUs achieved in leading-edge games, how well a particular DSP performed a particular operation, or the number of MIPS generated by an embedded CPU. Instead, Krzanich applied the performance argument really only where Intel faces a disadvantage: in the tablet market, competing with the lower-cost ARM processors. (Intel executives have said previously that the upcoming Silvermont or Bay Trail Atom chips outperform ARM’s Cortex-A15 in both performance and battery life. A recent dispute appears to give ARM an edge over Intel’s current Clover Trail+ chip, however.)
”So Bay Trail really first and foremost we believe gives solid performance, solid battery life relative to the competition in price points and markets that we’re simply not in, in a big way today,” Krzanich said.
Intel executives reiterated two key points, over and over: cost, and power. Krzanich didn’t paint Intel’s next-generation Core chip, Haswell, as a tool for healthcare or engineering. Instead, it will help power what Krzanich said were 50 next-generation “two-in-one” convertible tablet designs. And Samsung will include Intel’s next-generation “Bay Trail” chip and LTE baseband solution inside Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Tab 3 tablet.
IntelIntel’s Atom processor.Intel chief financial officer Stacy Smith staked out some pretty aggressive price points during Intel’s first-quarter call in April: touch-enabled ultrabooks will sell for $499 and $599 during the holidays, he said, with $300 “Bay Trail” Windows and ARM tablets making up the low end. On Wednesday, Krzanich went even further, stating that clamshells and touch-enabled convertibles could be priced under $400, and even under $300 in some cases. Intel-based tablets should cost about $199, and as low as $150. (Whether those ultra-cheap tablets will be powered by the older Clover Trail tablets or the newer Bay Trail tablets wasn’t clear.) The fact that Intel’s Atom processors can be used both with Windows and Android makes them even more attractive to customers, Krzanich claimed.
 I’ve wondered before whether Intel’s Atom and Core processors would collide at the low end, and whether or not the company would be able to set up a clear delineation between the two. If Intel can really hit both price points with its two chip families, it appears that won’t be a problem.
And Krzanich said as much during Thursday’s call. “Let me say our view right now on Bay Trail is that we don’t believe it will be cannibalistic in nature,” Krzanich said. “We believe what it really does it allows us to get into these markets that we’re not in, in a big way today.”
The underlying message is that Intel believes that is has essentially won the PC market, relegating rival AMD to the values segment within desktops and notebooks. To its credit, however, AMD has captured all of the major consoles, and has shown a willingness to design semicustom chips for key partners. Nevertheless, Intel is far more worried about the threat ARM poses in the tablet and ultraportable market, where cost and power are the key metrics.
To date, buyers have been suspicious of heavily discounted tablets and notebooks, precisely because the performance has ranged from disappointing to awful. Intel clearly believes the Atom can change that perception; if it can, Intel will also change the game.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
