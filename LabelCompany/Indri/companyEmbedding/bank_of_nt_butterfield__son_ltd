We appreciate that this may cause some inconvenience, hence our early notification to provide you with adequate time to make any adjustments, if needed.

Butterfield is well positioned to continue this trend.We expect the bank to pay a solid dividend.The Bank of N.T. Butterfield (TKR: NTB) will offer 10.6 million shares at an expected price range of $22 to $25 on Friday, September 16, 2016. If the underwriters price the IPO at the midpoint of that range, N.T. Butterfield will have a market capitalization of $249 million. N.T. Butterfield expects to raise $305.8 million through the issuance of its shares. It filed for the IPO on August 4, 2016 and underwriters include: Goldman Sachs, Citigroup Global Markets, and Sandler O'Neill as joint book-running managers, and Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Raymond James, and Wells Fargo Securities as co-managers. Business Summary: Full Service Bank and Wealth Manager Based in Bermuda The Bank of N.T. Butterfield & Son Limited provides various specialized financial and banking services. The company operates in six segments: Bermuda, Cayman, Guernsey, Switzerland, The Bahamas, and United Kingdom. It offers current and checking accounts, savings accounts, call accounts, and fixed term deposits; personal loans, mortgages, home equity loans, and overdraft protection services; debit and credit cards; and Internet and automated teller machines banking services. The company offers investment solutions and services, such as investment products, brokerage, and portfolio management services; home and contents, vehicle, yacht and pleasure craft, creditor life insurance, and credit card balance protection insurance products; and trust and estate services, including trust management, personal trust, wills and estate planning, company management, insurance trust, purpose trust, and special purpose vehicles.
 On the commercial side, N.T. Butterfield provides commercial credit products, such as mortgages, loans, foreign exchange facilities, overdraft facilities, and letters of credit; cash management and asset management solutions; unit, bond, voting, institutional insurance, and reinsurance trusts, as well as collateral trusts/special purpose vehicles services; pension plans and retirement savings trusts; treasury and money market services; and merchant services, as well as purchases and sells securities. Further, the company provides custodial services; wealth management services, including investment management, advisory, and brokerage services; private banking; and payroll, remote banking, fiduciary and ancillary, and administered bank services. The bank was founded in 1858, and serves a variety of clients including SMEs, individuals, and privately owned businesses. As of June 30, 2016, the bank held $11.3 billion in total assets, $3.9 billion in net loans, $10.1 billion in customer deposits, $101.3 billion in trust assets under administration, and $4.8 billion in assets under management. It has approximately 1,088 employees. 

 (Bank Of N.T. Butterfield & Son Ltd., SEC Filing) Use of Proceeds Bank of N.T. Butterfield intends to use the net proceeds of this IPO for general corporate purposes and for potential future refinancing of its issued and outstanding preference shares. Executive Management CEO Michael Collins has been in his current position since September 2015. His previous experience includes positions at Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, Bank of Bermuda, and HSBC Bank Bermuda. Mr. Collins holds a BA in Economics from Brown University. CFO Michael Schrum has served in his position since September 2015. His previous experience includes senior financial positions at HSBC Bank Bermuda in London, New York and Bermuda. He is a Chartered Financial Analyst and a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. Mr. Schrum holds Master's (University of London) and Bachelor's (Southern Denmark Business School) degrees in Economics.
 Tough Competition in the Financial Service Industry The financial service industry is highly competitive both domestically and internationally. Due to the trend towards consolidation, N.T. Butterfield's largest competitors are banks which offer a broad range of products and services. In the global banking marketplace, N.T. Butterfield faces competition from the largest retail and commercial banks, investment banking firms, and brokerage firms. These include HSBC Holdings, J.P. Morgan Chase, BNP Paribas, Bank of America and Deutsche Bank. In Bermuda specifically, competition comes from Bermuda Commercial Bank and Clarien Bank. Financial Performance In 2015, N.T. Butterfield generated $379.5 million in net revenue before provision for credit losses and other gains/losses. This figure was up $6.1 million from 2014. Net income in 2015 was $77.7 million, down from $108.2 million in 2014. According to management, the difference was largely driven by non-core expenses, including restructuring and business acquisition costs. As of June 30, 2016, the bank had $11.28 billion in total assets and $10.47 billion in total liabilities. Conclusion: Consider Investing In the most recent quarter, seven financial firms have gone public and have had an average return of 11.8%. N.T. Butterfield is positioned to continue this streak of strong performance for financial service firms going public. NTB has shown high return on investments and is well-backed by underwriters. We recommend this IPO and we expect the bank will pay a solid dividend to its shareholders.

Acquired

Status
Exited







Carlyle, along with several other investors, led the recapitalization of the Bank of N.T. Butterfield & Son Limited. The new equity capital, which allowed the bank to remain independent, was part of a comprehensive plan to increase equity capital and de-risk Butterfield’s balance sheet. In addition, the new capital provided flexibility to restructure Butterfield’s investment portfolio, provision for non-performing loans, decrease earnings volatility, and maintain capital ratios well in excess of regulatory requirements.




About Butterfield and the Transaction
Carlyle invested in Butterfield in March 2010 through Carlyle Global Financial Services Partners.

Established in 1958, Butterfield is the largest independent Bermuda-based depository institution. A publicly traded company, Butterfield shares are listed on the New York (NYSE), Bermuda (BSX) and Cayman Islands (CSX) stock exchanges. With operations in six international jurisdictions, Butterfield is a full service community bank and a provider of specialized financial services. 

On March 2, 2010, Carlyle, along with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Wellcome Trust, The Bermuda Government Pension Funds, and certain other investors (collectively the “Investors”), announced an investment of $550 million in a recapitalization of Butterfield. In exchange for the $550 million investment, the Investors received an 82.5% ownership stake in the Company. 

As part of the transaction, the Company launched a rights offering of $130 million on April 12, 2010, so as to allow the pre-transaction shareholders to participate in the recapitalization of the Company. The rights offering, which closed on May 12, 2010, was fully subscribed and the proceeds were used to repurchase shares from the Investors. Carlyle and the Investors viewed the success of the rights offering as an important step towards aligning the interests of the Company’s pro forma shareholders, while offering the pre-transaction shareholders an opportunity to minimize the level of dilution.
Key Value Creation Metrics
During Carlyle’s period of ownership, Butterfield was focused on streamlining its multi-jurisdictional operations, de-risking its balance sheet, generating new avenues of growth and strengthening its management team. During our investment, Butterfield expanded its deposit base 15% from $8.9 billion in 2009 to $10.0 billion in 2016 while also increasing its net interest income from $187 million to $258 million, representing an increase of 38%, and growing from a net income loss of $223 million in 2009 to a positive core net income of $123 million in 2016. 
Highlights of value creation initiatives during Carlyle’s investment include:
 - Identified and implemented best practices involving asset & liability, capital and investment portfolio management: 
Through an enhanced understanding of Butterfield’s stable deposit franchise, drove meaningful changes to the investment portfolio including extending duration and improving asset allocation 
Investment portfolio changes taken immediately after Carlyle’s investment were key to growing Butterfield’s net interest income and resulted in a lower risk, less interest-rate sensitive balance sheet that was more capital efficient, liquid and significantly more profitable 
Furthermore, in an effort to de-risk and improve its balance sheet, Butterfield sold a portfolio of held-to-maturity asset-backed securities for a gain of $820 million 
 - Implemented a number of strategic initiatives that re-focused the bank on its core businesses: 
Sold non-core subsidiaries including its Hong Kong, Malta and Barbados operations
Completed three accretive acquisitions, which included HSBC’s Bermuda Trust Company Ltd, HSBC’s retail and corporate banking business in the Cayman Islands and Legis Group’s trust and fiduciary services business
 - Completed numerous internal initiatives that decreased costs and improved efficiency: 
Restructured its employee post-retirement medical benefit plan. Additionally, Butterfield successfully implemented the conversion of its back office IT systems into one centralized platform
 - Bolstered Butterfield’s management team:
Made several executive leadership appointments, including Michael Collins as CEO, Michael Schrum as CFO, Daniel Frumkin as Chief Risk Officer, Michael Neff as Head of Asset Management and Richard Saunders as Head of European Asset Management
Executing Successful Sale in the Public Markets  
Carlyle exited its investment in Butterfield through a public listing on the NYSE in September 2016 and through a subsequent follow-on public offering in February 2017.
On September 16, 2016, Butterfield completed a public listing on the New York Stock Exchange by selling 12 million common shares for a total offering size of $288 million; 6 million shares were sold by Butterfield in the form of primary capital ($140 million) and 6 million shares were sold by the institutional shareholders ($148 million) who participated in the Bank’s 2010 recapitalization, including Carlyle who sold 3 million shares. 
On February 23, 2017, Butterfield completed a follow-on public offering by selling 11 million common shares (including the greenshoe) for a total offering size of $349 million; all of the shares were sold by the institutional shareholders who participated in the Bank’s 2010 recapitalization, including Carlyle who sold its remaining 7.6 million shares.

We expect to receive approximately $127 million of net proceeds from the sale of 
common shares by us in this offering after deducting the underwriting discounts 
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us in connection with 
this offering, based on the public offering price of $23.50 per common share. We 
will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of common shares by the 
selling shareholders.

We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of common shares by us in this 
offering for general corporate purposes, including without limitation, for the 
potential future refinancing, if any, of our issued and outstanding preference 
shares.


The financial services industry and each of the markets in which we operate are 
highly competitive. We face strong competition in gathering deposits, making 
loans and obtaining client assets for management. We compete, both domestically
and internationally, with globally oriented asset managers, retail and
commercial banks, investment banking firms, brokerage firms and other investment
service firms. Due to the trend toward consolidation in the global financial
services industry, our larger competitors tend to have broader ranges of product
and service offerings, increased access to capital, and greater efficiency.
Larger financial institutions also have greater ability to leverage increasing
regulatory requirements and investment in expensive technology platforms. We
also face competition from non-banking financial institutions. These
institutions have the ability to offer services previously limited to commercial
banks. In addition, non-banking financial institutions are not subject to the
same regulatory restrictions as banks, and can often operate with greater
flexibility and lower cost structures.

The Bermuda banking segment currently consists of four licensed banks and one 
licensed deposit-taking institution including one large global bank and four 
domestic institutions, including Bermuda Commercial Bank and Clarien Bank, as
well as subsidiaries of international banks, such as HSBC. In the Cayman
Islands, the Bank is one of six Category 'A' full service retail banks licensed
to conduct business with domestic and international clients. There are also five
non-retail Category 'A' banks and 168 limited service Category 'B' banks,
including Cayman National and subsidiaries of international banks, such as RBC.
In certain interest rate environments, additional significant competition for 
deposits may be expected to arise from corporate and government debt securities 
and money market mutual funds.

In our wealth management business line, we face competition from local 
competitors as well as much larger financial institutions including financial
institutions that are not based in the markets in which we operate. Revenues
from the trust and wealth management business depend in large part on the level
of assets under management, and larger international banks may have higher
levels of assets under management.

In our trust business line, we face competition primarily from other specialized 
trust service providers. There are approximately 500 trust companies in the main 
international financial centers, and many of our competitors in this sector 
offer fund administration and corporate services work alongside private client 
fiduciary services.

Competition for deposits is also affected by the ease with which customers can 
transfer deposits from one institution to another. Our cost of funds fluctuates 
with market interest rates and may be affected by higher rates being offered by 
other financial institutions. Our management believes that our most direct 
competition for deposits comes from international and domestic financial
services firms that target the same customers as the Bank.


Company Description
We are a full service bank and wealth manager headquartered in Hamilton,
Bermuda. We operate our business through six geographic segments: Bermuda, the
Cayman Islands, and Guernsey, where our principal banking operations are
located; and The Bahamas, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, where we


 offer
specialized financial services. We offer banking services, comprised of retail
and corporate banking, and wealth management, which consists of trust, private
banking, and asset management. In our Bermuda and Cayman Islands segments, we
offer both banking and wealth management. In our Guernsey, Bahamas, and
Switzerland segments, we offer wealth management. In our United Kingdom segment,
we offer residential property lending.

For the year ended December 31, 2015 and six months ended June 30, 2016, we 
generated $379.5 million and $199.1 million, respectively, in net revenue before
provision for credit losses and other gains/losses ("Net Revenue"). Our Net
Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2016 consisted of 56% from our Bermuda
segment, 30% from our Cayman Islands segment, 10% from our Guernsey segment, 2%
from our United Kingdom segment, and 1% from each of our Bahamas and Switzerland
segments. As of June 30, 2016, we had $11.3 billion in total assets,
$3.9 billion in net loans, $10.1 billion in customer deposits (64% USD deposits,
18% USD-pegged deposits), $101.3 billion of trust assets under administration
("AUA"), and $4.8 billion of assets under management ("AUM").

In our Bermuda and Cayman Islands segments, our bank provides a full range of 
retail and corporate banking services to individuals, local businesses, captive 
insurers, reinsurance companies, trust companies, and hedge funds. The key 
products we offer include personal and business deposit services, residential 
and commercial mortgages, small and medium-sized enterprise and corporate loans, 
credit and debit card suite, merchant acquiring, mobile / online banking, and 
cash management. With seven branches and 49 ATMs as of June 30, 2016, we have a 
39% Bermudian Dollar ("BMD") deposit market share in Bermuda and a 35% local 
deposit market share in the Cayman Islands as of December 31, 2015 based on data 
from the BMA and the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority ("CIMA"), respectively. 
We were named "Bermuda Bank of the Year" and "Cayman Bank of the Year" in 2013, 
2014, and 2015 by The Banker and "Best Developed Market Bank in Bermuda" by 
Global Finance in 2015 and 2016.

In all of our segments except the United Kingdom, we offer wealth management to 
high net worth and ultra-high net worth individuals, family offices, and 
institutional and corporate clients. Our wealth management platform has three 
lines of business: trust, private banking, and asset management. The wealth 
management business has received a number of industry awards from Euromoney, the 
Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners ("STEP"), Citiwealth, PWM/The Banker, 
and Global Finance, including "Trust Company of the Year" at the STEP Private 
Client Awards in 2015 and "Best Private Bank 2015, Bermuda" by both PWM/The 
Banker and Global Finance in 2015.

The trust business line, which utilizes specialists in each of our geographic 
areas, meets client needs in estate and succession planning, administration of 
complex asset holdings, and efficient coordination of family affairs. In 
addition, the business provides pension and employee benefits services for 
multinational corporations, as well as services that involve administration of 
and fiduciary responsibility for customized trust structures holding a wide 
range of asset types including financial assets, property, business assets, and 
art. As of June 30, 2016, trust AUA totaled $101.3 billion.

Our private banking business line offers access to a suite of services that can 
be customized to each client's needs and preferences and delivered as part of a 
coordinated strategy by a dedicated private banker. We provide clients in our
Bermuda, Cayman Islands, and Guernsey segments with an integrated model that 
combines traditional wealth management with banking, lending, cash management,
foreign exchange services, custody and access to asset management and trust
professionals within Butterfield. We also provide our clients with immediate
access to their account information through the use of internet banking. Our
target market is comprised of high net worth individuals, trusts, and family
offices. As of June 30, 2016, total deposits and loans in our private banking
business were $2.7 billion and $590 million, respectively.(1)

Our asset management business line provides a broad range of portfolio 
management services to institutional and private clients. Our target client base
includes institutions such as pension funds and captive insurance companies with
investable assets over $10 million and private clients such as high net worth
individuals, families, and trusts with investable assets over $1 million. Our
principal services include discretionary investment management, managed
portfolio services, money market, and mutual fund offerings. We also offer
advisory and self-directed brokerage options. Over 90% of the business's
discretionary investment mandates call for balanced growth to conservative
allocations. We focus on delivery of reasonable appreciation with an emphasis on
capital preservation. The Bank relies on well-recognized and leading third
parties to provide research and investment management expertise, while our own
services are concentrated on portfolio construction and managing client
relationships. We also provide customized reporting to meet specific needs of
our major clients. As of June 30, 2016 our asset management AUM were
$4.8 billion.

From 2011 to 2015, our GAAP net income to common shareholders and our core net 
income to common shareholders ("Core Net Income to Common") had compound annual 
growth rates ("CAGRs") of 24% and 56%, respectively.(2) These results were 
achieved despite a low interest rate environment. We attribute this financial 
performance to our attractive markets in our segments, leading position in those
markets, strong operating discipline, conservative balance sheet deployment, and 
ability to grow our award-winning wealth management business. Our earnings 
generation has allowed us to build capital to return to shareholders and invest 
strategically, both organically and through acquisitions, to further enhance the 
growth prospects of our company. We aim to continue to build excess capital in 
the future, which we can redeploy into growing our business and return to 
shareholders.

(1) Excludes the balances held, managed, or administered by the deposit-taking
    and investment management and custody business of Butterfield Bank (UK)
    Limited, which is being wound down and is anticipated to be closed by the
    end of 2016.

(2) Core Net Income to Common is a non-GAAP financial measure that is
    calculated by adjusting net income for income or expense items which
    management considers not to be core to the operations of our business and
    deducting dividends payable to preferred shareholders. 

(3) Core earnings per common share fully diluted is a non-GAAP financial measure 
    that is calculated by dividing Core Earnings to Common by weighted average 
    shares outstanding.

History[edit]




Butterfield Bank in George Town, Grand Cayman


It grew out of a Bermuda trading company founded by Nathaniel Butterfield in 1758; Butterfield's son, Nathaniel T., expanded the business to include financial services. In 1858 the Bank of N. T. Butterfield was founded as Bermuda's first bank. Butterfield was incorporated by an Act of Parliament in Bermuda in 1904.
In 1941, during World War II, the bank opened a branch in St. George's, Bermuda, to serve military personnel. Following the war the bank experienced rapid growth, increasing its number of shareholders by 42% and thus becoming the largest Bermuda company in terms of shareholders. During the 1960s, the bank opened branches in the United Kingdom and the Cayman Islands and formed new companies to handle mortgages and trusts, followed by its third Bermuda branch, in Somerset, Bermuda, in 1970. During the 1980s the bank took over the Bermuda National Bank, expanded its overseas business and introduced automated teller machines (ATMs) into Bermuda. In 2004, the bank acquired City of London merchant bank Leopold Joseph, This purchase also included Leopold Joseph Guernsey Limited.[1]
In March 2010, Butterfield Group posted a US$213 million loss, and announced that CIBC, the Carlyle Group and other institutional investors had collectively purchased a majority stake in the bank through a capital injection of US$550 million.[2]
It was also announced at that time that CEO & President Alan Thompson had stepped down from leadership of the company, with then-CFO Brad Kopp assuming the role of President & CEO.
Butterfield returned to profitability in 2011, posting net income for the year of US$40.5 million.
In 2012, Brendan McDonagh, who was previously Chief Executive Officer of HSBC North America Holdings and Group Managing Director, HSBC Holdings plc, joined Butterfield as a Director and Executive Chairman. In August 2012, Mr. McDonagh was named Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
In 2014, Butterfield acquired the Trust and Fiduciary Services business of Guernsey-based Legis Group, adding further scale to its international trust business. In 2015, Butterfield completed the acquisition of select personal and corporate banking business from HSBC in the Cayman Islands, similarly expanding its market presence in that market.
On April 30, 2015, Butterfield repurchased and cancelled the majority of CIBC's shareholding in the Bank, with other shareholders taking up CIBC's remaining shares, and CIBC ceased to be a Butterfield shareholder.
In September 2015, Michael Collins, who was previously Senior Executive Vice President, was named Butterfield's Chief Executive Officer; Brendan McDonagh, former CEO, became the bank's Executive Chairman.
McDonagh retired from the Bank and Board in October 2015, at which time Barclay Simmons, previously Vice Chairman, became Chairman of the Board.
In February 2016, Butterfield announced that it had commenced an orderly wind down of its deposit taking and investment management businesses in the UK. The Bank intends to utilize the capital that was deployed to the UK operations to support the development of other businesses within the Butterfield Group.
Butterfield is an Official Supplier and has been named Official Bermuda Bank of the 2017 America's Cup, which is being held in Bermuda.

Butterfield, officially The Bank of N. T. Butterfield & Son Limited, is a bank founded and based in Bermuda. Butterfield offers a full range of community banking services in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, encompassing retail and corporate banking and treasury activities. Butterfield also provides private banking, asset management and personal trust services from its headquarters in Bermuda and subsidiary offices in the Cayman Islands, Guernsey and the United Kingdom. In Switzerland and The Bahamas, Butterfield provides personal trust and company services. It is listed on the Bermuda Stock Exchange (BSX).
History[edit]




Butterfield Bank in George Town, Grand Cayman


It grew out of a Bermuda trading company founded by Nathaniel Butterfield in 1758; Butterfield's son, Nathaniel T., expanded the business to include financial services. In 1858 the Bank of N. T. Butterfield was founded as Bermuda's first bank. Butterfield was incorporated by an Act of Parliament in Bermuda in 1904.
In 1941, during World War II, the bank opened a branch in St. George's, Bermuda, to serve military personnel. Following the war the bank experienced rapid growth, increasing its number of shareholders by 42% and thus becoming the largest Bermuda company in terms of shareholders. During the 1960s, the bank opened branches in the United Kingdom and the Cayman Islands and formed new companies to handle mortgages and trusts, followed by its third Bermuda branch, in Somerset, Bermuda, in 1970. During the 1980s the bank took over the Bermuda National Bank, expanded its overseas business and introduced automated teller machines (ATMs) into Bermuda. In 2004, the bank acquired City of London merchant bank Leopold Joseph, This purchase also included Leopold Joseph Guernsey Limited.[1]
In March 2010, Butterfield Group posted a US$213 million loss, and announced that CIBC, the Carlyle Group and other institutional investors had collectively purchased a majority stake in the bank through a capital injection of US$550 million.[2]
It was also announced at that time that CEO & President Alan Thompson had stepped down from leadership of the company, with then-CFO Brad Kopp assuming the role of President & CEO.
Butterfield returned to profitability in 2011, posting net income for the year of US$40.5 million.
In 2012, Brendan McDonagh, who was previously Chief Executive Officer of HSBC North America Holdings and Group Managing Director, HSBC Holdings plc, joined Butterfield as a Director and Executive Chairman. In August 2012, Mr. McDonagh was named Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
In 2014, Butterfield acquired the Trust and Fiduciary Services business of Guernsey-based Legis Group, adding further scale to its international trust business. In 2015, Butterfield completed the acquisition of select personal and corporate banking business from HSBC in the Cayman Islands, similarly expanding its market presence in that market.
On April 30, 2015, Butterfield repurchased and cancelled the majority of CIBC's shareholding in the Bank, with other shareholders taking up CIBC's remaining shares, and CIBC ceased to be a Butterfield shareholder.
In September 2015, Michael Collins, who was previously Senior Executive Vice President, was named Butterfield's Chief Executive Officer; Brendan McDonagh, former CEO, became the bank's Executive Chairman.
McDonagh retired from the Bank and Board in October 2015, at which time Barclay Simmons, previously Vice Chairman, became Chairman of the Board.
In February 2016, Butterfield announced that it had commenced an orderly wind down of its deposit taking and investment management businesses in the UK. The Bank intends to utilize the capital that was deployed to the UK operations to support the development of other businesses within the Butterfield Group.
Butterfield is an Official Supplier and has been named Official Bermuda Bank of the 2017 America's Cup, which is being held in Bermuda.
