BUILDING
NOT BETTING.
Great companies aren’t built in a day.


 Blog: What’s Your Problem? Starting a Company from Personal ExperienceRead More Blog: Building a successful venture fund and staying true to your DNARead More Blog: A new home for RomulusRead More




We’re Hungry  Like You
Romulus was founded in an MIT dorm room in 2008, when the world was mired in a deep recession. Starting a venture capital firm from scratch was a big bet, and we needed to build a strong foundation to ensure Romulus could last.
Nearly a decade later, Romulus is thriving, and we know what it’s like to wear a founder’s shoes. We’ve grown 200X over the past four years, and we aim to help our companies do the same. We look to partner with innovative, passionate entrepreneurs with vision, conviction, and drive.
We’ve built something that has the power to last, and we’re still hungry—just like you

Romulus & Placester
“Today, picking investors is simultaneously easy and hard. Easy because of their prevalence, particularly at the early stage. Hard because the best are all the more difficult to find. I met Romulus six years ago and have watched them be an exceptional ally in building our business.”
– Matt Barba, Founder and CEO, Placester
Romulus was an early investor in Placester, an all-in-one digital marketing platform for real estate professionals. Since leading the company’s seed round in 2013, Romulus has continued to offer both funding and value, assisting in hiring, product development, customer acquisition, and strategy. In 2015, Romulus co-led Placester’s $27M Series C round, along with New Enterprise Associates.
Learn More

Romulus & Cogito
Like several companies in Romulus’ portfolio, Cogito originated in the MIT Media Lab. The company uses machine learning and artificial intelligence technology to analyze signals in the human voice, giving real-time feedback to sales and customer service professionals.
Romulus led Cogito’s Series A round and has continued to work closely with the company on strategy and customer acquisition, steering Cogito toward a successful Series B round and beyond.
