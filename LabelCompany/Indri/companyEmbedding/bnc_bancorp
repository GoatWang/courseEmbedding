History[edit]

The bank opened in Thomasville, North Carolina on December 3, 1991 (as Bank of North Carolina) in a temporary location in a trailer, moving to its permanent home in Fall 1992.[2]
On December 29, 2001, the Bank of North Carolina and Kernersville-based Independence Bank announced their merger. Bank of North Carolina had $211 million in assets and $171 million in deposits, and Independence Bank had assets of $59 million and deposits of $52 million.[3]
On August 1, 2003, BNC Bancorp began trading on NASDAQ. At the time it had added branches in Archdale, Lexington and Oak Ridge.[4]
After fifteen years of operation, BNC had expanded to 14 branches and $1 billion in assets, doubling its size in 30 months. It was the ninth community bank in the Piedmont Triad to reach that milestone. A 15,000-square foot administrative office was planned in High Point. Only one of the Harrisburg branches had opened.[5] The move to High Point happened in 2007.[1]
On September 7, 2012, BNC announced plans to move from its 10,000-square-foot Eastchester Drive headquarters to 22,500 square feet in Premier Center. The company planned to keep a portion of its existing space and move some operations from Thomasville.[6]
During the first quarter of 2014 BNC opened branches in Raleigh, North Carolina and Greenville, South Carolina. This is in addition to buying 11 banks since 2010.[7]
As Bank of North Carolina, BNC used the name BNC Bank in South Carolina and Virginia, and the bank had planned to change to BNC Bank everywhere. However, in June 2016, a federal judge denied a restraining order and injunction by BNCCORP of North Dakota, which operates as BNC National Bank and has protested this change.[8] On November 1, 2016, Bank of North Carolina rebranded to BNC Bank across their entire footprint. [9]
On January 22, 2017, Nashville, Tennessee-based Pinnacle Financial Partners, parent company of Pinnacle Bank, announced it was acquiring BNC Bank. The deal completed June 16, 2017 gives Pinnacle operations in four states.[10][11]

On April 12, 2010, in a deal arranged by the FDIC, Beach First branches reopened as Bank of North Carolina, giving the bank its first operations in South Carolina.[15]
Blue Ridge Savings Bank of Asheville, started in 1978, had 10 branches including one in South Carolina when it was closed October 14, 2011 by the state's commissioner of banks, with "essentially all" its $160.1 million in assets sold to BNC, which assumed $158.7 million in deposits. It was the fourth state-chartered bank to fail since 1991.[16] In April 2012, BNC opened a Charlotte branch on Carmel Road.

The $23.7 million purchase of South Street Financial Corp, doing business as Home Savings Bank, would add four locations in Albemarle and Stanly County, and $274.1 million in assets. The Albemarle bank was over 100 years old and would likely consolidate some branches.

History[edit]

The bank opened in Thomasville, North Carolina on December 3, 1991 (as Bank of North Carolina) in a temporary location in a trailer, moving to its permanent home in Fall 1992.[2]
On December 29, 2001, the Bank of North Carolina and Kernersville-based Independence Bank announced their merger. Bank of North Carolina had $211 million in assets and $171 million in deposits, and Independence Bank had assets of $59 million and deposits of $52 million.[3]
On August 1, 2003, BNC Bancorp began trading on NASDAQ. At the time it had added branches in Archdale, Lexington and Oak Ridge.[4]
After fifteen years of operation, BNC had expanded to 14 branches and $1 billion in assets, doubling its size in 30 months. It was the ninth community bank in the Piedmont Triad to reach that milestone. A 15,000-square foot administrative office was planned in High Point. Only one of the Harrisburg branches had opened.[5] The move to High Point happened in 2007.[1]
On September 7, 2012, BNC announced plans to move from its 10,000-square-foot Eastchester Drive headquarters to 22,500 square feet in Premier Center. The company planned to keep a portion of its existing space and move some operations from Thomasville.[6]
During the first quarter of 2014 BNC opened branches in Raleigh, North Carolina and Greenville, South Carolina. This is in addition to buying 11 banks since 2010.[7]
As Bank of North Carolina, BNC used the name BNC Bank in South Carolina and Virginia, and the bank had planned to change to BNC Bank everywhere. However, in June 2016, a federal judge denied a restraining order and injunction by BNCCORP of North Dakota, which operates as BNC National Bank and has protested this change.[8] On November 1, 2016, Bank of North Carolina rebranded to BNC Bank across their entire footprint. [9]
On January 22, 2017, Nashville, Tennessee-based Pinnacle Financial Partners, parent company of Pinnacle Bank, announced it was acquiring BNC Bank. The deal completed June 16, 2017 gives Pinnacle operations in four states.[10][11]

In a $36 million deal announced February 6, 2006, BNC Bancorp purchased SterlingSouth Bank & Trust of Greensboro, started in 2000, with assets of $148 million, two Greensboro branches and plans for a third. BNC had also opened a branch in High Point and a loan office in Winston-Salem. The deal would give BNC Bancorp ten branches and about $743 million in assets.

It was started in 1996 and had seven branches in the Grand Strand area and in Hilton Head, and $585.1 million in assets and $516 million in deposits. On April 12, 2010, in a deal arranged by the FDIC, Beach First branches reopened as Bank of North Carolina, giving the bank its first operations in South Carolina.[15]
Blue Ridge Savings Bank of Asheville, started in 1978, had 10 branches including one in South Carolina when it was closed October 14, 2011 by the state's commissioner of banks, with "essentially all" its $160.1 million in assets sold to BNC, which assumed $158.7 million in deposits. It was the fourth state-chartered bank to fail since 1991.[16] In April 2012, BNC opened a Charlotte branch on Carmel Road.

The $24.2 million purchase of Community First Financial Group, Inc., parent company of Harrington Bank of Chapel Hill, started in 1999, would add 3 branches and $228.5 million in assets. The $23.7 million purchase of South Street Financial Corp, doing business as Home Savings Bank, would add four locations in Albemarle and Stanly County, and $274.1 million in assets. The Albemarle bank was over 100 years old and would likely consolidate some branches. The deals would give BNC over $3.4 billion in assets and 40 branches.[18] The South street purchase was completed April 1, and the Community First purchase was completed June 2, 2014.[7]
On November 17, 2014 BNC announced its first acquisition in Virginia, Valley Financial Corporation of Roanoke, started in 1995. The $101.3 million deal, the bank's largest yet, would add nine branches in Roanoke and Salem, $857 million in assets (21 percent of BNC's assets before the deal), and $682 million in deposits.[19] The deal was completed July 1, 2015.[20]

High Point Bank has a long, rich tradition in High Point and the Triad, and as neighbors and competitors over the years, we have admired their brand of banking and their dedication to their communities. My first bank account was with High Point Bank and as a lifelong member of the High Point community I am excited about the opportunities we have going forward to honor their long heritage and continue to drive progress here in our communities. We also look forward to engaging both their insurance and trust businesses as two new lines of business that we can advance across our three-state footprint. This transaction epitomizes our current strategy of growing within our existing markets both organically and through acquisition, thus further leveraging our infrastructure to produce greater performance for our shareholders, and provide greater resources to our customers." 
Mark L. Williamson, President and Chief Executive Officer of HPTB, added, "We are pleased to join forces with BNC to provide enhanced and long-term value to our customers and communities. Our combination with BNC, with combined total assets of approximately $6.8 billion, will provide greater capital resources and operational scale that will allow us to grow together with a diverse product mix and allow our team to continue to support the High Point and Triad communities. With BNC's executive team having deep roots in the High Point community, we know the heritage of High Point Bank is in good hands. In addition, BNC's track record for creating and growing shareholder value will be a major plus for our shareholder base."

How the FDIC backs up your bank deposits -- to $250,000
By Marcie Geffner • Bankrate.com


Did you know that the amount of money in your bank account matters in the unlikely event your bank fails?While your deposits are insured for up to $250,000 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., or FDIC, that doesn't mean every account at a particular bank is covered for that amount. The way you structure your accounts could put you at risk. But there also are ways to set up accounts so you're insured for far more than $250,000."A lot of consumers don't understand what the limits are," says Thomas Healy, deputy chief compliance officer at Ally Bank. "People think it's $250,000. Period."MASTERING YOUR MONEY: Make this the starting point on your money road map.What is FDIC insurance?Since it was established in 1933, the FDIC has provided insurance on your money in case your bank goes belly up.The insurance covers checking, savings and money market accounts, and certificates of deposit, or CDs. It also covers other types of accounts, such as individual retirement accounts, or IRAs, and trust accounts.All state and nationally chartered banks must carry the insurance, says FDIC spokeswoman LaJuan Williams-Young.Why the government created the FDICOn June 16, 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Banking Act of 1933, which established the FDIC, among other things. The FDIC was created in response to thousands of bank failures during the early years of the Great Depression that resulted in about $1.3 billion in losses to depositors.The act was designed "to raise the confidence of the U.S. public in the banking system by alleviating the disruptions caused by bank failures and bank runs," according to the FDIC.FDIC insurance doesn't cover investment products, such as mutual funds, annuities, life insurance policies, stocks, bonds or the contents of your safe-deposit box.If your money is on deposit at a federally chartered credit union or the vast majority of state-chartered ones, you have coverage through the National Credit Union Administration, or NCUA, which operates similarly to the FDIC.FDIC insurance coverage limitsRATE SEARCH: Looking for another place to stash your cash? Let Bankrate.com help you find a great local savings account today.Yes, you have coverage up to $250,000, but that doesn't mean every account you have is insured for that much. Instead, coverage is based on how the accounts are owned.Single accountsThe maximum amount of coverage for single accounts at one bank is $250,000. All single accounts at the same bank are added together. Let's look at the example of an account holder we'll call Mark.Mark's accountsSavings$100,000CD$150,000Checking$50,000  Total$300,000Amount insured$250,000Amount uninsured$50,000Joint accountsEach co-owner receives $250,000 in insurance for each account, plus $250,000 in insurance for individual accounts at a bank. Let's look at an example of married account holders we'll call Ron and Pat.Ron and Pat's accountsJoint savings$500,000Ron's CD$250,000Pat's savings$250,000  Total$1 millionAmount insured$1 millionYou can boost your coverage limits higher by opening other types of accounts within the same bank. Other ownership categories include:Certain retirement accounts.Revocable trusts.Irrevocable trusts.Employee benefit plan accounts.Corporation, partnership and unincorporated association accounts.Government accounts."It's very easy as an individual to have $1 million (insured) -- if not more, in some cases -- at specific institutions," Healy says.Consumers need to keep in mind that their accounts are still subject to FDIC limits even if they have accounts at different branches of the same bank, Healy says. But if they have accounts at two different banks, the insurance limits apply at each bank individually. They aren't lumped together.More on insurance coverageThe FDIC offers multiple ways for depositors to find out how to set up their accounts to maximize their protection:A toll-free consumer hotline, 1 (877) ASK-FDIC or 1 (877) 275-3342, allows depositors to talk to a live person at no cost.An online customer assistance form allows depositors to ask questions or submit complaints by email.An automated interactive online service, the Electronic Deposit Insurance Estimator, also known as "EDIE," helps depositors analyze whether accounts are properly set up.Depositors can ask questions or submit complaints by mail to: FDIC, Attn: Deposit Insurance Outreach, 550 17th St. NW, Washington, D.C., 20429-9990.Only bank failures are coveredFDIC insurance applies only if your bank fails. And after a few volatile years, bank failures have again become rare. Just a handful of banks have been shuttered in 2015.That's a huge improvement. From 2008 to 2012, the FDIC reported 465 bank failures. The largest was Washington Mutual, which had $307 billion in assets when it failed in 2008. The government blamed the failure on WaMu's high-risk lending strategy.When a bank fails, the FDIC must collect and sell the assets of the failed bank and settle its debts. If your bank goes bust, the FDIC will typically reimburse your insured deposits the next business day, says Williams-Young.Banks cover you in case of fraudIt's a different story if your bank account is hacked or someone writes a bogus check and drains your account."It's only for bank failure that FDIC insurance covers the account," Williams-Young says.Instead, it's the banks themselves that are covering your losses if someone steals your money, says Doug Johnson, senior vice president of payments and cybersecurity policy for the American Bankers Association, or ABA. "Banks as a matter of policy fully reimburse customers for fraud on their accounts."Banks can purchase insurance to protect against losses from fraud, and also have reserves to cover such losses, Johnson says.A study by the ABA found that in 2012, fraud against deposit accounts cost banks $1.74 billion, but banks prevented $13 billion in fraud, Johnson says.If you suffer a loss due to fraud, you should report it to your bank as soon as possible so it can be investigated. "We're getting pretty good at doing the investigations," he says.By law, banks have to give customers provisional credit within 10 days. "They generally give provisional credit much sooner, or full credit," Johnson says.If you’re a victim of fraud, grab a free copy of your credit report at myBankrate.
