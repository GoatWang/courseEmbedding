Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.


Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments.


Mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") and commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS") are subject to prepayment and extension risk and therefore react differently to changes in interest rates than other bonds. Small movements in interest rates may quickly and significantly reduce the value of certain mortgage-backed securities.


International investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks often are heightened for investments in emerging/developing markets or in concentrations of single countries.


Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.


Index returns are for illustrative purposes only. Index performance returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Indexes are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index. Past performance does not guarantee future results.


After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown. The after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.


Certain sectors and markets perform exceptionally well based on current market conditions and iShares Funds can benefit from that performance. Achieving such exceptional returns involves the risk of volatility and investors should not expect that such results will be repeated.


The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).

Commercial Mortgage Originations Remain 'Anemic': Barclays

Commercial Mortgage Originations Remain 'Anemic': Barclays

KEYWORDS Backed Loan Facility Banking Banking in the United States Barclays Barclays Capital Business Commercial mortgage Commercial mortgage-backed security Economy of the United States facility CMBS TALF Federal Reserve System Finance Mortgage Mortgage-backed security TALF facility Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility United States Department of the Treasury US Federal Reserve

Barclays Capital this week saw commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS)-eligible Term Asset-Backed Loan Facility (TALF) demand outstrip supply. And TALF has a long way to go, as new issuance remains low on "anemic" lending.

CMBS spreads pushed wider this week in the midst of the second legacy TALF facility, which brought in $2.3bn of bids. The Federal Reserve received no bids for new issuance CMBS in this week's facility.

Barclays estimated 2005 vintage last cash flow triple-As -- a highly TALF-eligible product -- widened around 30bps this week despite the 340% gain in bids from the previous facility CMBS TALF facility. Investors fueled selling pressure as they looked to book profits or shed exposure, according to Barclays' securitization research report Friday.

Barclays estimates there were $4.1bn of TALF-eligible bid lists since the July facility, which led to bloated dealer inventories and larger hedging demand. It expects bids on CMBS TALF facilities to increase in future subscription dates, although demand so far has failed to absorb the surge in selling pressure.

Although the Fed recently extended the deadlines of both the legacy and new issue CMBS-eligible TALF programs through March 31, 2010, from December 31, commercial real estate lending remained "anemic" on tighter underwriting standards and falling appraisal values.

"[N]ew issue TALF would lend support to the refinancing of maturing loans and hopefully restart the CMBS market," Barclays said in the research report. "The deterioration of fundamentals, coupled with aggressive underwriting of recent vintage loans, will still prove to be a difficult hurdle to overcome, especially given the magnitude of the decline in property values."

New appraisals reinforce the picture of deteriorating commercial property value, with an average decline in valuation of 49% since the previous appraisal on all sectors of commercial real estate, Barclays said. The multi-family (apartment housing) sector showed a 46% decline since the previous valuation while office properties slipped 51% and hotel properties fell 56%.

Fannie Mae: from legacy to startup


        You'd be forgiven for thinking that a quasi-federal agency founded in the 1930s is the last place you’d describe using words like innovative or agile. But you’d be wrong. Defying all stereotypes, Fannie Mae’s recent actions read a lot more like a startup than a $2.8 billion company with more than 7,000 employees. In the last two years, the company has implemented a user experience strategy, adopted design thinking and accelerated time to market for an innovative array of products.

Prime status: an update on luxury residential real estate


Deborah Huso


Real Estate


        In the years leading up to the housing bubble of 2007, it seemed like everyone was getting a piece of the American Dream of homeownership (or maybe even second homeownership). Ten years after the Great Recession, how is luxury residential real estate faring? Was the recent market slowdown just a temporary blip on the radar and will the sector continue to draw the aspirational interest of buyers as it did in the early to mid-2000s?

Convert leads like a top producer



Casey Cunningham


Lending


        Most mortgage professionals know that the client feels a sense of loyalty to the first person they speak with. When they establish themselves as the first contact, loan officers gain a critical sales advantage. In fact, speed-to-call is the single largest driver of conversion for new customer leads. 
Studies show that returning a call from a new customer within the first 30 minutes produces an average of a 62% increase in conversion rates.

Key Points:
Current economic trends, U.S. commercial real estate fundamentals, and factors specific to the CMBS market are conducive to positive long-term CMBS performance

Strong excess spread relative to alternatives, attractive risk-adjusted return trends, and portfolio diversification benefits are some of the main reasons investors should  consider adding CMBS exposure


CMBS has a place in both real estate and fixed income portfolios, offering diversified, efficient, and liquid  exposure to commercial real estate debt via publicly traded securities


Introduction
Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (“CMBS”) represents a prominent segment of the U.S. commercial real estate investment landscape, carrying an outstanding balance of over $564  billion.1  Principal Real Estate Investors believes current economic trends, U.S. commercial real estate fundamentals, and factors specific to the CMBS market are conducive to positive long-term CMBS performance. Moreover, strong excess spread  relative to alternatives, attractive risk-adjusted return trends, and portfolio diversification benefits are some of the main reasons investors should consider adding CMBS exposure within the context of broader fixed  income and/or real estate portfolios.
The majority of the CMBS market consists of fixed-rate bonds collateralized by diversified pools of first mortgages on commercial real estate properties located throughout the U.S. A simple  bond structure is used to create individual bond classes, called tranches, which each carry  a distinct rating and risk/return profile. (Please see our “CMBS FAQ” at www.principalglobal.com for answers  to common investor questions). Since CMBS has attributes of both the commercial real estate and fixed  income asset classes, CMBS has a home  in both real estate and fixed  income portfolios, offering diversified, efficient, and liquid exposure to commercial real estate debt via publicly traded securities.
Economic and Space Market Fundamentals
The performance of U.S. commercial real estate, including CMBS, is driven in large part by the health of the labor market. Indeed, 2014 was a strong year for job growth as total employment surpassed the pre-recession peak in April and full year payrolls rose by over 3.1 million (nearly 260,000 per month)2. With unemployment levels dropping, low interest rates persisting, and inflationary pressures remaining manageable, consumer spending ended the year on a high note, up 4.3% in the fourth quarter3. U.S. commercial real estate is benefitting from these trends in the form of generally positive rent growth and declining vacancy rates, resulting in year-over-year increases in net operating income (NOI), as seen in EXHIBIT 1.0. This trend is supported by historically low levels of new construction (EXHIBIT 1.1), allowing landlords to benefit from attractive supply/demand dynamics in most U.S. real estate markets. These factors have culminated in rising real estate values, with prices exceeding prior peak levels in major markets, although nonmajor markets have yet to fully recover (EXHIBIT 1.2).

 


Property Type Outlook
Each property type is impacted by “distinct storylines,” creating diversification benefits within each CMBS investment. (Please see Principal Global Investor’s “Inside Real Estate Annual Strategy Outlook for 2015”  for further information.) Notably, the collateral for each CMBS issuance is well-diversified across geography and property type.
Office: Approaching an upside inflection point with demand, occupancy, and rent growth poised to accelerate. Improving job market spurs on demand, especially for more modern and efficient space.
Industrial: Secular change  drives strong performance as increasing global trade, a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing and the rapid expansion of e-commerce lift demand for industrial/warehouse space.
Multi-Family: Unprecedented demand results in low vacancy, strong rent growth, and new supply. Near-term deceleration in revenue growth should be tempered long term as secular trends favor multi-family over single-family.
Retail: High correlation to U.S. economy and consumer spending. Sluggish wage growth has been a headwind; however discount stores and luxury retailers (wealth effect) have performed well.
Lodging: Strong RevPAR (revenue per available room) growth driven by economic recovery and increased personal/business travel. New supply on the horizon and slowing global demand bear watching.

CMBS Market Landscape
Five years of U.S. economic growth, supportive supply/demand dynamics in the real estate space markets and fully functional capital markets are generating a solid fundamental landscape for CMBS. The 60+ day delinquency rate has fallen to the lowest level since early 2010, as new defaults approach 2008 levels and loan resolutions progress4. Notably, the 60+ day delinquency rate for the 2010-2014 vintages is extremely low, ranging from 0.0%-0.2%4.
Looking out over the next two to three  years, 10-year mortgages originated between 2005 and 2008 will reach maturity and require refinancing; a significant event  for the CMBS market given  the size of this refinance wave and the aggressiveness with which many of these loans were underwritten. The previously discussed growth in property NOIs and valuations is beneficial to refinancing prospects through improved debt service  coverage ratios (DSCR) and loan-to-value (LTV) metrics. Additionally, the CMBS new-issuance market has demonstrated strong year-over- year growth, providing an important source  of first mortgage capital for future CMBS refinancing needs. There is also a significant amount of subordinate debt capital available in the capital markets, helping to fill the gap between elevated maturing loan balances and more  conservative first-mortgage sizing offered by core mortgage lenders. These dynamics have already resulted in the payoff rate for maturing loans increasing from 42% as of 2Q 2012 to over 88% as of 3Q 2014 when including loans paid off within three  months of original maturity5. Additionally, the size of the refinance wave is declining as borrowers prepay loans early to take advantage of the current low rate environment (note: CMBS loans contain strong call-protection and borrowers are only able to prepay via defeasance or yield  maintenance as discussed later). This is helping to moderate the potential impact of the refinance wave as nearly  $67 billion of future maturities have prepaid over the past two years (EXHIBIT  1.3).

CMBS: A Changing Landscape and Terminology
Since the global financial crisis, there  have been several  changes in the CMBS market, which have required a change  in terminology. For instance, bonds issued prior to 2010 are referred to as “legacy CMBS,” while those  issued in 2010 and beyond are generally referred to as “CMBS 2.0.” The advent of CMBS 2.0 has been accompanied by a return to relatively more  disciplined cash-flow underwriting, more conservative credit rating agency assumptions, and a simpler bond structure. These changes have created positive effects for CMBS investors. When  compared with 2006/2007 vintages, CMBS 2.0 loan collateral displays lower average LTVs and higher average DSCRs (EXHIBIT  1.4). Importantly, CMBS 2.0 also offers significantly higher subordination levels across the CMBS bond structure (EXHIBIT  1.5).


While  CMBS 2.0 offers a relatively more  secure credit profile than legacy CMBS, loan originators are becoming more aggressive as competitive pressures mount in the lending market. This competition has mainly been reflected in higher LTV ratios.  Although loan-level leverage is increasing, we have not seen the quality of underwritten cash flows deteriorate materially (i.e. limited “pro forma underwriting”), which is a positive trend compared to underwriting in 2006 and 2007. Additionally, the credit rating agencies are increasing subordination levels in response to higher loan- level LTVs in an attempt to offset riskier  collateral with stronger structural credit enhancements (EXHIBIT  1.6). Finally, investors are demanding higher spreads  for deals that are perceived to be riskier. This activity can be seen in EXHIBIT 1.7 which shows that more  recent vintages with higher leverage levels are carrying higher market credit spreads. Importantly, CMBS is a non-homogenous product and careful security selection based on an understanding of each issuance’s unique pool  of underlying mortgage collateral is critical.


CMBS Relative Value
In addition to positive market fundamentals, CMBS 2.0 currently offers attractive relative value versus corporate bonds and private commercial mortgages of similar  duration. Over the past year, CMBS 2.0 AA-  bonds have averaged 75 basis points in excess spread  and CMBS 2.0 BBB- bonds have averaged 150 basis points in excess spread  vs. comparably rated corporate bonds (EXHIBIT  1.8). Notably, CMBS exhibits comparable liquidity to corporate bonds and offers a wide  range of duration and credit exposures, providing a flexible fixed-income investment alternative.
In addition to excess spread  and flexibility, CMBS provides strong call protection, which differentiates it from residential mortgage-backed securities. Call protection in CMBS typically moves  through three  consecutive forms over  the typical 10-year loan term, thus providing:

A lockout period (usually the first two years)


A period allowing prepayment via defeasance (replacement of the cash-flow stream with government securities) or yield maintenance (a prepayment penalty to help  the CMBS trust recoup the loss of future cash flows) for the bulk of the loan’s  term


A final three- to six-month open-at-par period (i.e. freely prepayable)


As compared to private mortgages, CMBS provides diversified real estate debt exposure in a liquid investment vehicle.  Each unique CMBS 2.0 issuance  is secured by between 50 to over  100 mortgages on properties located across the U.S. Accordingly, CMBS is well diversified by property type,  geography, borrower, and tenancy. For investors familiar with private mortgages, CMBS loan collateral includes a diversified mix of property types, markets, property qualities, and leverage levels, some of which would be considered “core” and some of which would be considered “non-core” from an institutional lender  perspective. However, CMBS overlays the pool of mortgages with varying levels of subordination (i.e. credit enhancement) to provide a discrete risk/return spectrum at the bond level. With these differences in mind,  CMBS and private mortgages complement one another with CMBS offering liquidity and excess spread  to comparable mortgages (EXHIBIT  1.9). Notably, this excess spread  is greater further out  on the risk spectrum versus both mortgages and corporate bonds,  as CMBS investors receive greater compensation for incremental risk for rolling down the credit curve.


CMBS Liquidity and Volatility
Since the global financial crisis, CMBS remains  an active market that affords an individual account the ability to transact $100 million or more  in a single day without materially moving the market at bid-ask spreads  comparable to competing fixed  income sectors. Over the past year, average weekly trading volume has averaged approximately $5 billion, resulting in an approximate annual market turnover ratio of over  50%6. Post-crisis dealer  balance sheets are smaller  and more  highly regulated across the fixed  income industry, and dealers  are transitioning from true market makers  to market facilitators that line up buyers and sellers alongside their  downsized ability to take positions on balance sheet.
While  there  are some common misperceptions about a lack of liquidity in the sector, in reality CMBS trades in a very active market. In fact, the ability to trade was one of the factors contributing to the volatility CMBS experienced during the height of the global financial crisis. As other asset classes were going “no bid,” CMBS dealers  continued to put out bid-side levels. Because of this, accounts were able to sell CMBS during the height of the crisis, which exacerbated the relative spread  widening versus other fixed  income sectors.
Like almost any asset class, liquidity in the CMBS market can be driven by technical factors unrelated to market fundamentals, or can change  during periods of macro-market volatility. However, volatility can offer opportunity in addition to risk if these dynamics are closely monitored. Over the post global financial crisis time  period, volatility of investment-grade CMBS fell measurably as buyers began  to recognize value and demand for CMBS resurfaced. In fact, the trailing 12-month standard deviation of the Barclays Investment Grade CMBS Index crossed below that of the Barclays U.S. Corporate Investment Grade Index in late 2011 and has remained there  since. In the higher-yielding CMBS 2.0 space, this phenomenon is displayed in the dramatic reduction in average spreads  and annual spread volatility of BBB- rated bonds in EXHIBIT 1.10. Absent a significant macro shock, we would expect this dynamic to persist as more  investors have entered the CMBS market and existing players have expanded their  credit thresholds. In summary, excess spread  paired with market liquidity and a downward trend in spread  volatility all contribute to the potential attractiveness of CMBS versus comparable investment alternatives.

CMBS Investment Opportunities
Another benefit of the CMBS asset class is that it offers the potential for portfolio diversification, having exhibited historical correlations well below 1.0 vs. a variety of asset classes (EXHIBIT  1.11). Barclays Aggregate-based fixed income investors may find value in overweighting the sector given  the previously discussed excess spread  provided versus corporate bonds (CMBS currently comprises 2.0% of the Barclays U.S. Aggregate index)7. Additionally, a wide range of CMBS investment strategies are available offering yields  of 3.0% - 4.5%+8  in the CMBS 2.0 investment grade space, comparing favorably to the yield  of the CMBS component of the Barclays U.S. Aggregate which yielded 2.3% as of 31 January 2015.
For investors with existing commercial real estate exposure, CMBS can provide an attractive compliment to equity REITs and private mortgages. A public real estate strategy pairing CMBS with REITs offers an alternative risk/return option versus a stand-alone REIT exposure by introducing a more  conservative blended risk profile with potentially higher current income in a trade-off for reduced equity upside  potential. For private mortgage investors, a complimentary CMBS allocation can provide efficient and diversified real estate debt exposure in a liquid and flexible investment that currently offers excess spread  and superior regulatory capital efficiency.

Investment Options
We believe the following non-exhaustive list of CMBS investment options presents attractive risk-adjusted return opportunities at a variety of points along  the risk/return and duration spectrums. These options should be taken within the context of overall investment objectives, including risk tolerance, return targets, and potential asset- liability matching considerations.
High Quality/Short Duration
Legacy AMs – Issued as AAA-rated 10-year bonds with 20% subordination in 2005-2008. Many bonds carry  a National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) 1 rating and offer attractive relative value versus comparable shorter-duration corporates. Well  positioned within the CMBS structure, with adequate subordination to withstand most loss scenarios and protection from early  pay-downs provided by the large  super-senior class.
2.0 A1s – AAA/NAIC 1 ratings and 30% subordination. Moderate relative value in relation to other shorter, AAA fixed-income assets. These bonds typically carry  durations less than two-and-a-half years and are fully  paid  out  by loan amortization, helping eliminate balloon risk and limiting cash-flow volatility from potential loan extensions.
Investment Grade/Long Duration
2.0 A-/BBB-s – Recently issued investment grade-rated 10-year bonds with 7%-14% subordination and NAIC 1 ratings. Security selection is important as potential losses under  stressed scenarios may approach bond subordination levels, depending on the credit quality of the underlying loan collateral. Strong yield enhancement potential given the significant excess spread  offered by these classes compared with corporate bonds and commercial mortgages.
Opportunistic
Legacy AJ Bonds – Issued as AAA-rated 10-year bonds with 12% to 14% subordination in 2005-2008 that have subsequently been downgraded to below-investment-grade. Short  duration, higher-yielding/ higher-risk opportunity set. Security selection is paramount as ultimate loan losses may breach the AJ subordination levels of certain issuances. Pricing inefficiencies may offer opportunity through granular loan-level analysis.
2.0 BBs – Recently issued below-investment grade-rated 10-year bonds with 4% to 6% subordination. Selective high-yield opportunity set requiring granular loan-level analysis. Stressed scenarios breach BB subordination levels with timing of loss (term vs. balloon) becoming an especially important performance factor
2.0 Interest Only (IO) Securities
2.0 CMBS XAs/X1s. CMBS IO cash flows represent the difference between the weighted average coupon of the underlying mortgages and the weighted-average coupon of the securitized bonds in a given  issuance. This excess interest is stripped from the AAA bond classes, thus the bonds carry  AAA/NAIC 1 ratings. These bonds offer very  strong yields, shorter duration profiles, and a unique risk profile which helps diversify a broader CMBS portfolio.
Conclusion
The CMBS market has been benefiting from the tailwinds of a growing U.S. economy, strong commercial real estate fundamentals, and an accommodative interest rate environment. Strong relative value and diversification benefits in the context of a broader investment portfolio continue to enhance  the attractiveness of the sector. Each property type, including office, industrial, retail,  multi-family, and lodging is impacted by “distinct storylines,” creating diversification benefits within each CMBS investment. We think that these factors are conducive to positive long-term CMBS performance. Against this backdrop, we believe many investors, including institutional investors and comingled funds, may benefit from an allocation to CMBS.

Credit quality ratings on underlying securities of the fund are received from S&P, Moody’s and Fitch and converted to the equivalent S&P major rating category. This breakdown is provided by BlackRock and takes the median rating of the three agencies when all three agencies rate a security the lower of the two ratings if only two agencies rate a security and one rating if that is all that is provided. Unrated securities do not necessarily indicate low quality. Below investment-grade is represented by a rating of BB and below. Ratings and portfolio credit quality may change over time.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.


Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments.


Mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") and commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS") are subject to prepayment and extension risk and therefore react differently to changes in interest rates than other bonds. Small movements in interest rates may quickly and significantly reduce the value of certain mortgage-backed securities.


Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.


Index returns are for illustrative purposes only. Index performance returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Indexes are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index. Past performance does not guarantee future results.


After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown. The after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.


Certain sectors and markets perform exceptionally well based on current market conditions and iShares Funds can benefit from that performance. Achieving such exceptional returns involves the risk of volatility and investors should not expect that such results will be repeated.


Understanding Investments in the Mortgage Market: TBAs and Cash Collateral: TBA (To Be Announced) contracts are standardized contracts for future delivery, in which the exact mortgage pools to be delivered are not specified until a few days prior to settlement. These forward contracts typically represent the most liquid portion of the mortgage market. They are derived from new mortgage pools with specific delivery dates and coupons but without specific pool numbers and number of pools. These forward contracts are fully collateralized. The collateral may be invested in short term instruments. The extent of a portfolio's investment in such short term instruments would be proportionate to its investment in TBAs.


Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, a person must receive a copy of "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options." Copies of this document may be obtained from your broker, from any exchange on which options are traded or by contacting The Options Clearing Corporation, One North Wacker Dr., Suite 500, Chicago, IL 60606 (1-888-678-4667). The document contains information on options issued by The Options Clearing Corporation. The document discusses exchange traded options issued by The Options Clearing Corporation and is intended for educational purposes. No statement in the document should be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell a security or to provide investment advice. If you need further information, please feel free to call the Options Industry Council Helpline. They will be able to provide you with balanced options education and tools to assist you with your iShares options questions and trading. The Options Industry Council Helpline phone number is 1-888-Options (1-888-678-4667) and its website is www.888options.com.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
