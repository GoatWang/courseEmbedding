He grew up at his family home, Hickory Hill, in McLean, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C., and attended the Our Lady of Victory Catholic School in McLean through the eighth grade.[5] He transferred to Georgetown Preparatory School in North Bethesda, Maryland, also a suburb of Washington, and graduated in 1982. While in high school, he volunteered at a home for runaway youth.
Kennedy graduated from Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1986.[6]
In 1994, he graduated with a master of business administration degree from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.
Career[edit]
Kennedy is chairman of the Kennedy family investment firm Joseph P Kennedy Enterprises, Inc.[7] He is treasurer of the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation, he was on the Executive Committee for the Chicago Community Trust, and he has been a board member of the Catholic Theological Union, Interface, Inc. and Knoll Inc.[1][8] He is a member of the mutual fund board of trustees for Ariel Investments.[9]
Kennedy moved from Boston to Decatur to work for Archer Daniels Midland in the 80's, and has spent his life working around issues of hunger, whether as the chairman of the Greater Chicago Food Depository, or now helping to run the non-profit he and his wife founded, Top Box Foods.[10]
Kennedy was the president of Merchandise Mart Properties in Chicago, Illinois, from 2000 until 2012. The property was originally owned by the Kennedy family until it was sold to Vornado Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust. The Merchandise Mart, one of the properties of Merchandise Mart Properties, is the largest commercial building in the world, serving as both a luxury wholesale design center and one of the leading international business locations in Chicago. The Mart spans two city blocks and rises twenty-five stories for a total of 4.2 million square feet (390,000 square metres) Three million people come through the Mart each year to visit its retail shops, permanent showrooms, and office space as well as attend the numerous trade, consumer and community events hosted there.
Kennedy also served as Chairman of the board at the University of Illinois.[11]
Top Box Foods[edit]
In May 2012, Kennedy started the Chicago-based non-profit Top Box Foods. The organization was created as a way to get discounted groceries to families who live in areas that either lack grocery stores or have an abundance of fast food. Kennedy initially invested $150,000 to get Top Box started, and subsequently designed the organization to be self-sustaining.
Top Box as an organization purchases food, boxes it in various combinations and delivers it monthly to churches and organizations in mostly low-income neighborhoods. The food items in the box change from month to month and include a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, meats, and frozen meals, with box prices ranging from $19 to $39. The boxes can be ordered online or through the organizations where the boxes are delivered. These organizations, otherwise known as Top Box "host sites," range from small neighborhood churches with a few dozen families to some of the Chicago's largest, including Trinity United Church of Christ and Salem Baptist Church.
Personal life[edit]
Family[edit]
Kennedy met Sheila Sinclair-Berner (born December 4, 1962), an Illinois native, while attending Boston College. After graduating from college in 1986, Kennedy moved to Decatur, Illinois, and married in 1987.[12] The couple had four children, Katherine "Kate" Berner Kennedy (b.Oct 4 1990), Christopher George "Chris" Kennedy, Jr. (b.Jun 15 1992), Sarah Louise Kennedy (b. Sep 26 1994), Clare Rose Kennedy (b.Nov 3 1998), whom they are raising in the Chicago suburb of Kenilworth. His wife earned a law degree from Northwestern University and practiced at Sidley & Austin[citation needed] in Chicago before taking time off to take care of their children.
Political career[edit]




Kennedy attending Chicago's Pride Parade.


Kennedy's political activism began at an early age, and in 1979 and 1980 he worked on his uncle U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy's bid for the 1980 Democratic Party's nomination for U.S. President. He was also treasurer of the campaign committee for his brother Joseph's reelection to the U.S. House in 1988. Over the years he has organized numerous fundraising events in Chicago for his uncle Ted, his sister Kathleen, his brother Joseph and his cousin Mark Shriver.
The National Journal once quoted Kennedy as saying, "I have a lot to keep up with: a brother who might run for Congress, a sister and a brother considering races for governor, a cousin who might run for Congress, another in Congress, an uncle in the Senate and a cousin-in-law, Arnold [Schwarzennegger], who is thinking of running for governor."[13]
Beyond his family, Kennedy has served in a variety of capacities for numerous political campaigns, including hosting a fundraiser for Barack Obama in his bid for U.S. Senate.[citation needed]
In August 2009, after considering a run for the U.S. Senate,[14] as did many others, Kennedy decided not to run.[15] Also in August 2009, on the day after his uncle Ted's death on August 25, 2009, Kennedy was appointed to the University of Illinois board of trustees by Democratic Illinois Governor Pat Quinn.[16] On September 10, 2009, Kennedy was elected by the trustees as their chairman.[17]
Prior to February 8, 2017, when Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic Nomination for Illinois Governor in 2018,[18] he had never run for any elective office.[16]
Kennedy during his campaign for governor advocated for “a property tax system that can’t be abused by the wealthy and insiders” in a fundraising email.[19] House Speaker Mike Madigan owns a property tax law firm, and Kennedy retained the services of that firm.[20] Kennedy served as the president of MMPI (Merchandise Mart Properties, Inc.) from 2000 to 2011. Madigan's property tax law firm got MMPI more than $133,000 in property tax refunds, according to checks that the Cook County Treasurer's office sent out in 2009.[20] Kennedy criticized one of his fellow Democratic gubernatorial candidates, J.B. Pritzker, for getting a large property tax reduction on a Gold Coast mansion.[21] “It’s an inherently corruptible system and we ought to reject it,” Kennedy said to reporters in reference to Pritzker’s property taxes.[22] "The Cook County property tax appeals business is notorious for pricing political connections at a premium," wrote the Illinois Policy Institute.[23]
In June 2017, Kennedy was endorsed by Congressman Bobby Rush.[24]
Kennedy called for an open primary in the 2018 gubernatorial race, urging the Cook County Democratic party not to throw their weight behind any other candidate, instead allowing for voters to vet all the candidates in the race.[25]
Business and economic involvement[edit]
He is on the board of trustees of the mutual funds managed by Ariel Investments,[26] a Chicago-based investment-management firm.
From 1997-1999, Kennedy served as chairman of the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau, a sales-and-marketing organization promoting Chicago to the tourism and convention industries. Under Kennedy's chairmanship, the bureau retained and expanded Chicago's event-and-convention industry.[citation needed]
Since 2000, Kennedy has been a member of the City Club of Chicago, a group that brings together civic and cultural leaders to discuss and debate issues affecting the Chicago area.
Since 2005, he has been a member of the Commercial Club of Chicago, a group that brings together the city's business, educational, and cultural leaders on projects to improve central industries and create new economic opportunities.
Other civic involvement[edit]

Since 1996, he has been a member of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, a nonpartisan group that seeks to impact discourse on global issues through leadership, education, and policy.
Since 1996, Kennedy has been on the board of directors at The Irish Fellowship Club,[27] a Chicago-based group dedicated to preserving and promoting Irish heritage.
From 2006 until the Spring of 2013, he served on the board of directors of Catholic Theological Union, the largest Roman Catholic graduate school of theology and ministry in the U.S.[28]
Greater Chicago Food Depository is a nonprofit food distribution and training center providing food for hungry people while striving to end hunger throughout Cook County, Illinois. It also offers education programs providing the knowledge and tools needed to break the poverty cycle.
El Valor[29] is a nonprofit group seeking to enrich the local community by empowering the underserved, disenfranchised, and disabled while creating a sense of unity among all community members.
Heartland Alliance[30] is a human-rights-advocacy group providing housing, healthcare, economic security, and legal protection for low-income citizens.
Governor Quinn appointed Kennedy to the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois in September 2009. He served in that role until his gubernatorial appointment expired in January 2015.
He served as a Member of the Executive Committee of the Chicago Community Trust until January 2015.
He served as the Lund-Gill Chair in the Rosary College of Arts and Sciences at Dominican University (Illinois).[31]
He is the chairman of the board of Innovation Illinois, a progressive 501(c)(4) non-profit advocacy group formed in April 2015.

Residential development[edit]
As Chairman of Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises, Inc., Kennedy is responsible for the development of the Kennedy family real estate holdings in Chicago known as Wolf Point, Chicago. The Wolf Point development site represents a billion-dollar commitment to the downtown core, and the site is zoned for construction of a residential apartment building, a self-park garage, and two additional high-rise buildings.
Kennedy also is a partner in Sudbury Station LLC, a development entity proposing a 250-unit luxury rental housing development with a state mandated minimum affordable housing set aside in Sudbury, Massachusetts, designed to meet local housing needs for seniors and the working class community. Proposed on a 39-acre parcel zoned residential near the Historic District of Sudbury, the Village at Sudbury Station would satisfy the Massachusetts affordable housing mandate for Sudbury, would be located close to schools, parks, churches and public safety facilities, and would contribute significant additional tax revenue to the town.[32][33] The project has received widespread criticism from town officials and residents. Residents voted unamiously to hire a special counsel to stop the development, which violates over thirty local zoning ordinances.[34][35]

Madigan's property tax law firm got MMPI more than $133,000 in property tax refunds, according to checks that the Cook County Treasurer's office sent out in 2009.[20] Kennedy criticized one of his fellow Democratic gubernatorial candidates, J.B. Pritzker, for getting a large property tax reduction on a Gold Coast mansion.[21] “It’s an inherently corruptible system and we ought to reject it,” Kennedy said to reporters in reference to Pritzker’s property taxes.[22] "The Cook County property tax appeals business is notorious for pricing political connections at a premium," wrote the Illinois Policy Institute.[23]
In June 2017, Kennedy was endorsed by Congressman Bobby Rush.[24]
Kennedy called for an open primary in the 2018 gubernatorial race, urging the Cook County Democratic party not to throw their weight behind any other candidate, instead allowing for voters to vet all the candidates in the race.[25]
Business and economic involvement[edit]
He is on the board of trustees of the mutual funds managed by Ariel Investments,[26] a Chicago-based investment-management firm.
From 1997-1999, Kennedy served as chairman of the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau, a sales-and-marketing organization promoting Chicago to the tourism and convention industries. Under Kennedy's chairmanship, the bureau retained and expanded Chicago's event-and-convention industry.[citation needed]
Since 2000, Kennedy has been a member of the City Club of Chicago, a group that brings together civic and cultural leaders to discuss and debate issues affecting the Chicago area.
Since 2005, he has been a member of the Commercial Club of Chicago, a group that brings together the city's business, educational, and cultural leaders on projects to improve central industries and create new economic opportunities.
Other civic involvement[edit]

Since 1996, he has been a member of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, a nonpartisan group that seeks to impact discourse on global issues through leadership, education, and policy.
Since 1996, Kennedy has been on the board of directors at The Irish Fellowship Club,[27] a Chicago-based group dedicated to preserving and promoting Irish heritage.
From 2006 until the Spring of 2013, he served on the board of directors of Catholic Theological Union, the largest Roman Catholic graduate school of theology and ministry in the U.S.[28]
Greater Chicago Food Depository is a nonprofit food distribution and training center providing food for hungry people while striving to end hunger throughout Cook County, Illinois. It also offers education programs providing the knowledge and tools needed to break the poverty cycle.
El Valor[29] is a nonprofit group seeking to enrich the local community by empowering the underserved, disenfranchised, and disabled while creating a sense of unity among all community members.
Heartland Alliance[30] is a human-rights-advocacy group providing housing, healthcare, economic security, and legal protection for low-income citizens.
Governor Quinn appointed Kennedy to the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois in September 2009. He served in that role until his gubernatorial appointment expired in January 2015.
He served as a Member of the Executive Committee of the Chicago Community Trust until January 2015.
He served as the Lund-Gill Chair in the Rosary College of Arts and Sciences at Dominican University (Illinois).[31]
He is the chairman of the board of Innovation Illinois, a progressive 501(c)(4) non-profit advocacy group formed in April 2015.

Residential development[edit]
As Chairman of Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises, Inc., Kennedy is responsible for the development of the Kennedy family real estate holdings in Chicago known as Wolf Point, Chicago. The Wolf Point development site represents a billion-dollar commitment to the downtown core, and the site is zoned for construction of a residential apartment building, a self-park garage, and two additional high-rise buildings.
Kennedy also is a partner in Sudbury Station LLC, a development entity proposing a 250-unit luxury rental housing development with a state mandated minimum affordable housing set aside in Sudbury, Massachusetts, designed to meet local housing needs for seniors and the working class community. Proposed on a 39-acre parcel zoned residential near the Historic District of Sudbury, the Village at Sudbury Station would satisfy the Massachusetts affordable housing mandate for Sudbury, would be located close to schools, parks, churches and public safety facilities, and would contribute significant additional tax revenue to the town.[32][33] The project has received widespread criticism from town officials and residents. Residents voted unamiously to hire a special counsel to stop the development, which violates over thirty local zoning ordinances.[34][35]

Early life and education[edit]
Kennedy was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to Robert Francis Kennedy and Ethel (née Skakel) Kennedy, the eighth of their eleven children. He is one of four grandchildren of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy born during the administration of his uncle U.S. President John F. Kennedy. His siblings are:


Kathleen Hartington Kennedy (born 1951)
Joseph Patrick Kennedy II (born 1952)
Robert Francis Kennedy, Jr. (born 1954)
David Anthony Kennedy (1955–1984)
Mary Courtney Kennedy (born 1956)
Michael LeMoyne Kennedy (1958–1997)
Mary Kerry Kennedy (born 1959)
Matthew Maxwell Taylor Kennedy (born 1965)
Douglas Harriman Kennedy (born 1967)
Rory Elizabeth Katherine Kennedy (born 1968)


He grew up at his family home, Hickory Hill, in McLean, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C., and attended the Our Lady of Victory Catholic School in McLean through the eighth grade.[5] He transferred to Georgetown Preparatory School in North Bethesda, Maryland, also a suburb of Washington, and graduated in 1982. While in high school, he volunteered at a home for runaway youth.
Kennedy graduated from Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1986.[6]
In 1994, he graduated with a master of business administration degree from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.
Career[edit]
Kennedy is chairman of the Kennedy family investment firm Joseph P Kennedy Enterprises, Inc.[7] He is treasurer of the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation, he was on the Executive Committee for the Chicago Community Trust, and he has been a board member of the Catholic Theological Union, Interface, Inc. and Knoll Inc.[1][8] He is a member of the mutual fund board of trustees for Ariel Investments.[9]
Kennedy moved from Boston to Decatur to work for Archer Daniels Midland in the 80's, and has spent his life working around issues of hunger, whether as the chairman of the Greater Chicago Food Depository, or now helping to run the non-profit he and his wife founded, Top Box Foods.[10]
Kennedy was the president of Merchandise Mart Properties in Chicago, Illinois, from 2000 until 2012. The property was originally owned by the Kennedy family until it was sold to Vornado Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust. The Merchandise Mart, one of the properties of Merchandise Mart Properties, is the largest commercial building in the world, serving as both a luxury wholesale design center and one of the leading international business locations in Chicago. The Mart spans two city blocks and rises twenty-five stories for a total of 4.2 million square feet (390,000 square metres) Three million people come through the Mart each year to visit its retail shops, permanent showrooms, and office space as well as attend the numerous trade, consumer and community events hosted there.
Kennedy also served as Chairman of the board at the University of Illinois.[11]
Top Box Foods[edit]
In May 2012, Kennedy started the Chicago-based non-profit Top Box Foods. The organization was created as a way to get discounted groceries to families who live in areas that either lack grocery stores or have an abundance of fast food. Kennedy initially invested $150,000 to get Top Box started, and subsequently designed the organization to be self-sustaining.
Top Box as an organization purchases food, boxes it in various combinations and delivers it monthly to churches and organizations in mostly low-income neighborhoods. The food items in the box change from month to month and include a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, meats, and frozen meals, with box prices ranging from $19 to $39. The boxes can be ordered online or through the organizations where the boxes are delivered. These organizations, otherwise known as Top Box "host sites," range from small neighborhood churches with a few dozen families to some of the Chicago's largest, including Trinity United Church of Christ and Salem Baptist Church.
Personal life[edit]
Family[edit]
Kennedy met Sheila Sinclair-Berner (born December 4, 1962), an Illinois native, while attending Boston College. After graduating from college in 1986, Kennedy moved to Decatur, Illinois, and married in 1987.[12] The couple had four children, Katherine "Kate" Berner Kennedy (b.Oct 4 1990), Christopher George "Chris" Kennedy, Jr. (b.Jun 15 1992), Sarah Louise Kennedy (b. Sep 26 1994), Clare Rose Kennedy (b.Nov 3 1998), whom they are raising in the Chicago suburb of Kenilworth. His wife earned a law degree from Northwestern University and practiced at Sidley & Austin[citation needed] in Chicago before taking time off to take care of their children.
Political career[edit]




Kennedy attending Chicago's Pride Parade.


Kennedy's political activism began at an early age, and in 1979 and 1980 he worked on his uncle U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy's bid for the 1980 Democratic Party's nomination for U.S. President. He was also treasurer of the campaign committee for his brother Joseph's reelection to the U.S. House in 1988. Over the years he has organized numerous fundraising events in Chicago for his uncle Ted, his sister Kathleen, his brother Joseph and his cousin Mark Shriver.
The National Journal once quoted Kennedy as saying, "I have a lot to keep up with: a brother who might run for Congress, a sister and a brother considering races for governor, a cousin who might run for Congress, another in Congress, an uncle in the Senate and a cousin-in-law, Arnold [Schwarzennegger], who is thinking of running for governor."[13]
Beyond his family, Kennedy has served in a variety of capacities for numerous political campaigns, including hosting a fundraiser for Barack Obama in his bid for U.S. Senate.[citation needed]
In August 2009, after considering a run for the U.S. Senate,[14] as did many others, Kennedy decided not to run.[15] Also in August 2009, on the day after his uncle Ted's death on August 25, 2009, Kennedy was appointed to the University of Illinois board of trustees by Democratic Illinois Governor Pat Quinn.[16] On September 10, 2009, Kennedy was elected by the trustees as their chairman.[17]
Prior to February 8, 2017, when Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic Nomination for Illinois Governor in 2018,[18] he had never run for any elective office.[16]
Kennedy during his campaign for governor advocated for “a property tax system that can’t be abused by the wealthy and insiders” in a fundraising email.[19] House Speaker Mike Madigan owns a property tax law firm, and Kennedy retained the services of that firm.[20] Kennedy served as the president of MMPI (Merchandise Mart Properties, Inc.) from 2000 to 2011. Madigan's property tax law firm got MMPI more than $133,000 in property tax refunds, according to checks that the Cook County Treasurer's office sent out in 2009.[20] Kennedy criticized one of his fellow Democratic gubernatorial candidates, J.B. Pritzker, for getting a large property tax reduction on a Gold Coast mansion.[21] “It’s an inherently corruptible system and we ought to reject it,” Kennedy said to reporters in reference to Pritzker’s property taxes.[22] "The Cook County property tax appeals business is notorious for pricing political connections at a premium," wrote the Illinois Policy Institute.[23]
In June 2017, Kennedy was endorsed by Congressman Bobby Rush.[24]
Kennedy called for an open primary in the 2018 gubernatorial race, urging the Cook County Democratic party not to throw their weight behind any other candidate, instead allowing for voters to vet all the candidates in the race.[25]
Business and economic involvement[edit]
He is on the board of trustees of the mutual funds managed by Ariel Investments,[26] a Chicago-based investment-management firm.
From 1997-1999, Kennedy served as chairman of the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau, a sales-and-marketing organization promoting Chicago to the tourism and convention industries. Under Kennedy's chairmanship, the bureau retained and expanded Chicago's event-and-convention industry.[citation needed]
Since 2000, Kennedy has been a member of the City Club of Chicago, a group that brings together civic and cultural leaders to discuss and debate issues affecting the Chicago area.

Other civic involvement[edit]

Since 1996, he has been a member of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, a nonpartisan group that seeks to impact discourse on global issues through leadership, education, and policy.
Since 1996, Kennedy has been on the board of directors at The Irish Fellowship Club,[27] a Chicago-based group dedicated to preserving and promoting Irish heritage.
From 2006 until the Spring of 2013, he served on the board of directors of Catholic Theological Union, the largest Roman Catholic graduate school of theology and ministry in the U.S.[28]
Greater Chicago Food Depository is a nonprofit food distribution and training center providing food for hungry people while striving to end hunger throughout Cook County, Illinois. It also offers education programs providing the knowledge and tools needed to break the poverty cycle.
El Valor[29] is a nonprofit group seeking to enrich the local community by empowering the underserved, disenfranchised, and disabled while creating a sense of unity among all community members.

Governor Quinn appointed Kennedy to the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois in September 2009. He served in that role until his gubernatorial appointment expired in January 2015.
He served as a Member of the Executive Committee of the Chicago Community Trust until January 2015.
He served as the Lund-Gill Chair in the Rosary College of Arts and Sciences at Dominican University (Illinois).[31]
He is the chairman of the board of Innovation Illinois, a progressive 501(c)(4) non-profit advocacy group formed in April 2015.

Residential development[edit]
As Chairman of Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises, Inc., Kennedy is responsible for the development of the Kennedy family real estate holdings in Chicago known as Wolf Point, Chicago. The Wolf Point development site represents a billion-dollar commitment to the downtown core, and the site is zoned for construction of a residential apartment building, a self-park garage, and two additional high-rise buildings.
Kennedy also is a partner in Sudbury Station LLC, a development entity proposing a 250-unit luxury rental housing development with a state mandated minimum affordable housing set aside in Sudbury, Massachusetts, designed to meet local housing needs for seniors and the working class community. Proposed on a 39-acre parcel zoned residential near the Historic District of Sudbury, the Village at Sudbury Station would satisfy the Massachusetts affordable housing mandate for Sudbury, would be located close to schools, parks, churches and public safety facilities, and would contribute significant additional tax revenue to the town.[32][33] The project has received widespread criticism from town officials and residents. Residents voted unamiously to hire a special counsel to stop the development, which violates over thirty local zoning ordinances.[34][35]

Early life and education[edit]
Kennedy was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to Robert Francis Kennedy and Ethel (née Skakel) Kennedy, the eighth of their eleven children. He is one of four grandchildren of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy born during the administration of his uncle U.S. President John F. Kennedy. His siblings are:


Kathleen Hartington Kennedy (born 1951)
Joseph Patrick Kennedy II (born 1952)
Robert Francis Kennedy, Jr. (born 1954)
David Anthony Kennedy (1955–1984)
Mary Courtney Kennedy (born 1956)
Michael LeMoyne Kennedy (1958–1997)
Mary Kerry Kennedy (born 1959)
Matthew Maxwell Taylor Kennedy (born 1965)
Douglas Harriman Kennedy (born 1967)
Rory Elizabeth Katherine Kennedy (born 1968)


He grew up at his family home, Hickory Hill, in McLean, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C., and attended the Our Lady of Victory Catholic School in McLean through the eighth grade.[5] He transferred to Georgetown Preparatory School in North Bethesda, Maryland, also a suburb of Washington, and graduated in 1982. While in high school, he volunteered at a home for runaway youth.
Kennedy graduated from Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1986.[6]
In 1994, he graduated with a master of business administration degree from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.
Career[edit]
Kennedy is chairman of the Kennedy family investment firm Joseph P Kennedy Enterprises, Inc.[7] He is treasurer of the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation, he was on the Executive Committee for the Chicago Community Trust, and he has been a board member of the Catholic Theological Union, Interface, Inc. and Knoll Inc.[1][8] He is a member of the mutual fund board of trustees for Ariel Investments.[9]
Kennedy moved from Boston to Decatur to work for Archer Daniels Midland in the 80's, and has spent his life working around issues of hunger, whether as the chairman of the Greater Chicago Food Depository, or now helping to run the non-profit he and his wife founded, Top Box Foods.[10]
Kennedy was the president of Merchandise Mart Properties in Chicago, Illinois, from 2000 until 2012. The property was originally owned by the Kennedy family until it was sold to Vornado Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust. The Merchandise Mart, one of the properties of Merchandise Mart Properties, is the largest commercial building in the world, serving as both a luxury wholesale design center and one of the leading international business locations in Chicago. The Mart spans two city blocks and rises twenty-five stories for a total of 4.2 million square feet (390,000 square metres) Three million people come through the Mart each year to visit its retail shops, permanent showrooms, and office space as well as attend the numerous trade, consumer and community events hosted there.
Kennedy also served as Chairman of the board at the University of Illinois.[11]
Top Box Foods[edit]
In May 2012, Kennedy started the Chicago-based non-profit Top Box Foods. The organization was created as a way to get discounted groceries to families who live in areas that either lack grocery stores or have an abundance of fast food. Kennedy initially invested $150,000 to get Top Box started, and subsequently designed the organization to be self-sustaining.
Top Box as an organization purchases food, boxes it in various combinations and delivers it monthly to churches and organizations in mostly low-income neighborhoods. The food items in the box change from month to month and include a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, meats, and frozen meals, with box prices ranging from $19 to $39. The boxes can be ordered online or through the organizations where the boxes are delivered. These organizations, otherwise known as Top Box "host sites," range from small neighborhood churches with a few dozen families to some of the Chicago's largest, including Trinity United Church of Christ and Salem Baptist Church.
Personal life[edit]
Family[edit]
Kennedy met Sheila Sinclair-Berner (born December 4, 1962), an Illinois native, while attending Boston College. After graduating from college in 1986, Kennedy moved to Decatur, Illinois, and married in 1987.[12] The couple had four children, Katherine "Kate" Berner Kennedy (b.Oct 4 1990), Christopher George "Chris" Kennedy, Jr. (b.Jun 15 1992), Sarah Louise Kennedy (b. Sep 26 1994), Clare Rose Kennedy (b.Nov 3 1998), whom they are raising in the Chicago suburb of Kenilworth. His wife earned a law degree from Northwestern University and practiced at Sidley & Austin[citation needed] in Chicago before taking time off to take care of their children.
Political career[edit]




Kennedy attending Chicago's Pride Parade.


Kennedy's political activism began at an early age, and in 1979 and 1980 he worked on his uncle U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy's bid for the 1980 Democratic Party's nomination for U.S. President. He was also treasurer of the campaign committee for his brother Joseph's reelection to the U.S. House in 1988. Over the years he has organized numerous fundraising events in Chicago for his uncle Ted, his sister Kathleen, his brother Joseph and his cousin Mark Shriver.
The National Journal once quoted Kennedy as saying, "I have a lot to keep up with: a brother who might run for Congress, a sister and a brother considering races for governor, a cousin who might run for Congress, another in Congress, an uncle in the Senate and a cousin-in-law, Arnold [Schwarzennegger], who is thinking of running for governor."[13]
Beyond his family, Kennedy has served in a variety of capacities for numerous political campaigns, including hosting a fundraiser for Barack Obama in his bid for U.S. Senate.[citation needed]
In August 2009, after considering a run for the U.S. Senate,[14] as did many others, Kennedy decided not to run.[15] Also in August 2009, on the day after his uncle Ted's death on August 25, 2009, Kennedy was appointed to the University of Illinois board of trustees by Democratic Illinois Governor Pat Quinn.[16] On September 10, 2009, Kennedy was elected by the trustees as their chairman.[17]
Prior to February 8, 2017, when Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic Nomination for Illinois Governor in 2018,[18] he had never run for any elective office.[16]
Kennedy during his campaign for governor advocated for “a property tax system that can’t be abused by the wealthy and insiders” in a fundraising email.[19] House Speaker Mike Madigan owns a property tax law firm, and Kennedy retained the services of that firm.[20] Kennedy served as the president of MMPI (Merchandise Mart Properties, Inc.) from 2000 to 2011. Madigan's property tax law firm got MMPI more than $133,000 in property tax refunds, according to checks that the Cook County Treasurer's office sent out in 2009.[20] Kennedy criticized one of his fellow Democratic gubernatorial candidates, J.B. Pritzker, for getting a large property tax reduction on a Gold Coast mansion.[21] “It’s an inherently corruptible system and we ought to reject it,” Kennedy said to reporters in reference to Pritzker’s property taxes.[22] "The Cook County property tax appeals business is notorious for pricing political connections at a premium," wrote the Illinois Policy Institute.[23]
In June 2017, Kennedy was endorsed by Congressman Bobby Rush.[24]
Kennedy called for an open primary in the 2018 gubernatorial race, urging the Cook County Democratic party not to throw their weight behind any other candidate, instead allowing for voters to vet all the candidates in the race.[25]
Business and economic involvement[edit]
He is on the board of trustees of the mutual funds managed by Ariel Investments,[26] a Chicago-based investment-management firm.
From 1997-1999, Kennedy served as chairman of the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau, a sales-and-marketing organization promoting Chicago to the tourism and convention industries. Under Kennedy's chairmanship, the bureau retained and expanded Chicago's event-and-convention industry.[citation needed]
Since 2000, Kennedy has been a member of the City Club of Chicago, a group that brings together civic and cultural leaders to discuss and debate issues affecting the Chicago area.
Since 2005, he has been a member of the Commercial Club of Chicago, a group that brings together the city's business, educational, and cultural leaders on projects to improve central industries and create new economic opportunities.
Other civic involvement[edit]

Since 1996, he has been a member of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, a nonpartisan group that seeks to impact discourse on global issues through leadership, education, and policy.
Since 1996, Kennedy has been on the board of directors at The Irish Fellowship Club,[27] a Chicago-based group dedicated to preserving and promoting Irish heritage.
From 2006 until the Spring of 2013, he served on the board of directors of Catholic Theological Union, the largest Roman Catholic graduate school of theology and ministry in the U.S.[28]
Greater Chicago Food Depository is a nonprofit food distribution and training center providing food for hungry people while striving to end hunger throughout Cook County, Illinois. It also offers education programs providing the knowledge and tools needed to break the poverty cycle.
El Valor[29] is a nonprofit group seeking to enrich the local community by empowering the underserved, disenfranchised, and disabled while creating a sense of unity among all community members.
Heartland Alliance[30] is a human-rights-advocacy group providing housing, healthcare, economic security, and legal protection for low-income citizens.
Governor Quinn appointed Kennedy to the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois in September 2009. He served in that role until his gubernatorial appointment expired in January 2015.
He served as a Member of the Executive Committee of the Chicago Community Trust until January 2015.
He served as the Lund-Gill Chair in the Rosary College of Arts and Sciences at Dominican University (Illinois).[31]
He is the chairman of the board of Innovation Illinois, a progressive 501(c)(4) non-profit advocacy group formed in April 2015.

Residential development[edit]
As Chairman of Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises, Inc., Kennedy is responsible for the development of the Kennedy family real estate holdings in Chicago known as Wolf Point, Chicago. The Wolf Point development site represents a billion-dollar commitment to the downtown core, and the site is zoned for construction of a residential apartment building, a self-park garage, and two additional high-rise buildings.
Kennedy also is a partner in Sudbury Station LLC, a development entity proposing a 250-unit luxury rental housing development with a state mandated minimum affordable housing set aside in Sudbury, Massachusetts, designed to meet local housing needs for seniors and the working class community. Proposed on a 39-acre parcel zoned residential near the Historic District of Sudbury, the Village at Sudbury Station would satisfy the Massachusetts affordable housing mandate for Sudbury, would be located close to schools, parks, churches and public safety facilities, and would contribute significant additional tax revenue to the town.[32][33] The project has received widespread criticism from town officials and residents. Residents voted unamiously to hire a special counsel to stop the development, which violates over thirty local zoning ordinances.[34][35]

Early life and education[edit]
Kennedy was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to Robert Francis Kennedy and Ethel (née Skakel) Kennedy, the eighth of their eleven children. He is one of four grandchildren of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy born during the administration of his uncle U.S. President John F. Kennedy. His siblings are:


Kathleen Hartington Kennedy (born 1951)
Joseph Patrick Kennedy II (born 1952)
Robert Francis Kennedy, Jr. (born 1954)
David Anthony Kennedy (1955–1984)
Mary Courtney Kennedy (born 1956)
Michael LeMoyne Kennedy (1958–1997)
Mary Kerry Kennedy (born 1959)
Matthew Maxwell Taylor Kennedy (born 1965)
Douglas Harriman Kennedy (born 1967)
Rory Elizabeth Katherine Kennedy (born 1968)


He grew up at his family home, Hickory Hill, in McLean, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C., and attended the Our Lady of Victory Catholic School in McLean through the eighth grade.[5] He transferred to Georgetown Preparatory School in North Bethesda, Maryland, also a suburb of Washington, and graduated in 1982. While in high school, he volunteered at a home for runaway youth.
Kennedy graduated from Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1986.[6]
In 1994, he graduated with a master of business administration degree from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.
Career[edit]
Kennedy is chairman of the Kennedy family investment firm Joseph P Kennedy Enterprises, Inc.[7] He is treasurer of the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation, he was on the Executive Committee for the Chicago Community Trust, and he has been a board member of the Catholic Theological Union, Interface, Inc. and Knoll Inc.[1][8] He is a member of the mutual fund board of trustees for Ariel Investments.[9]
Kennedy moved from Boston to Decatur to work for Archer Daniels Midland in the 80's, and has spent his life working around issues of hunger, whether as the chairman of the Greater Chicago Food Depository, or now helping to run the non-profit he and his wife founded, Top Box Foods.[10]
Kennedy was the president of Merchandise Mart Properties in Chicago, Illinois, from 2000 until 2012. The property was originally owned by the Kennedy family until it was sold to Vornado Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust. The Merchandise Mart, one of the properties of Merchandise Mart Properties, is the largest commercial building in the world, serving as both a luxury wholesale design center and one of the leading international business locations in Chicago. The Mart spans two city blocks and rises twenty-five stories for a total of 4.2 million square feet (390,000 square metres) Three million people come through the Mart each year to visit its retail shops, permanent showrooms, and office space as well as attend the numerous trade, consumer and community events hosted there.
Kennedy also served as Chairman of the board at the University of Illinois.[11]
Top Box Foods[edit]
In May 2012, Kennedy started the Chicago-based non-profit Top Box Foods. The organization was created as a way to get discounted groceries to families who live in areas that either lack grocery stores or have an abundance of fast food. Kennedy initially invested $150,000 to get Top Box started, and subsequently designed the organization to be self-sustaining.
Top Box as an organization purchases food, boxes it in various combinations and delivers it monthly to churches and organizations in mostly low-income neighborhoods. The food items in the box change from month to month and include a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, meats, and frozen meals, with box prices ranging from $19 to $39. The boxes can be ordered online or through the organizations where the boxes are delivered. These organizations, otherwise known as Top Box "host sites," range from small neighborhood churches with a few dozen families to some of the Chicago's largest, including Trinity United Church of Christ and Salem Baptist Church.
Personal life[edit]
Family[edit]
Kennedy met Sheila Sinclair-Berner (born December 4, 1962), an Illinois native, while attending Boston College. After graduating from college in 1986, Kennedy moved to Decatur, Illinois, and married in 1987.[12] The couple had four children, Katherine "Kate" Berner Kennedy (b.Oct 4 1990), Christopher George "Chris" Kennedy, Jr. (b.Jun 15 1992), Sarah Louise Kennedy (b. Sep 26 1994), Clare Rose Kennedy (b.Nov 3 1998), whom they are raising in the Chicago suburb of Kenilworth. His wife earned a law degree from Northwestern University and practiced at Sidley & Austin[citation needed] in Chicago before taking time off to take care of their children.
Political career[edit]




Kennedy attending Chicago's Pride Parade.


Kennedy's political activism began at an early age, and in 1979 and 1980 he worked on his uncle U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy's bid for the 1980 Democratic Party's nomination for U.S. President. He was also treasurer of the campaign committee for his brother Joseph's reelection to the U.S. House in 1988. Over the years he has organized numerous fundraising events in Chicago for his uncle Ted, his sister Kathleen, his brother Joseph and his cousin Mark Shriver.
The National Journal once quoted Kennedy as saying, "I have a lot to keep up with: a brother who might run for Congress, a sister and a brother considering races for governor, a cousin who might run for Congress, another in Congress, an uncle in the Senate and a cousin-in-law, Arnold [Schwarzennegger], who is thinking of running for governor."[13]
Beyond his family, Kennedy has served in a variety of capacities for numerous political campaigns, including hosting a fundraiser for Barack Obama in his bid for U.S. Senate.[citation needed]
In August 2009, after considering a run for the U.S. Senate,[14] as did many others, Kennedy decided not to run.[15] Also in August 2009, on the day after his uncle Ted's death on August 25, 2009, Kennedy was appointed to the University of Illinois board of trustees by Democratic Illinois Governor Pat Quinn.[16] On September 10, 2009, Kennedy was elected by the trustees as their chairman.[17]
Prior to February 8, 2017, when Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic Nomination for Illinois Governor in 2018,[18] he had never run for any elective office.[16]
Kennedy during his campaign for governor advocated for “a property tax system that can’t be abused by the wealthy and insiders” in a fundraising email.[19] House Speaker Mike Madigan owns a property tax law firm, and Kennedy retained the services of that firm.[20] Kennedy served as the president of MMPI (Merchandise Mart Properties, Inc.) from 2000 to 2011. Madigan's property tax law firm got MMPI more than $133,000 in property tax refunds, according to checks that the Cook County Treasurer's office sent out in 2009.[20] Kennedy criticized one of his fellow Democratic gubernatorial candidates, J.B. Pritzker, for getting a large property tax reduction on a Gold Coast mansion.[21] “It’s an inherently corruptible system and we ought to reject it,” Kennedy said to reporters in reference to Pritzker’s property taxes.[22] "The Cook County property tax appeals business is notorious for pricing political connections at a premium," wrote the Illinois Policy Institute.[23]
In June 2017, Kennedy was endorsed by Congressman Bobby Rush.[24]
Kennedy called for an open primary in the 2018 gubernatorial race, urging the Cook County Democratic party not to throw their weight behind any other candidate, instead allowing for voters to vet all the candidates in the race.[25]
Business and economic involvement[edit]
He is on the board of trustees of the mutual funds managed by Ariel Investments,[26] a Chicago-based investment-management firm.
From 1997-1999, Kennedy served as chairman of the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau, a sales-and-marketing organization promoting Chicago to the tourism and convention industries. Under Kennedy's chairmanship, the bureau retained and expanded Chicago's event-and-convention industry.[citation needed]
Since 2000, Kennedy has been a member of the City Club of Chicago, a group that brings together civic and cultural leaders to discuss and debate issues affecting the Chicago area.
Since 2005, he has been a member of the Commercial Club of Chicago, a group that brings together the city's business, educational, and cultural leaders on projects to improve central industries and create new economic opportunities.
Other civic involvement[edit]

Since 1996, he has been a member of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, a nonpartisan group that seeks to impact discourse on global issues through leadership, education, and policy.
Since 1996, Kennedy has been on the board of directors at The Irish Fellowship Club,[27] a Chicago-based group dedicated to preserving and promoting Irish heritage.
From 2006 until the Spring of 2013, he served on the board of directors of Catholic Theological Union, the largest Roman Catholic graduate school of theology and ministry in the U.S.[28]
Greater Chicago Food Depository is a nonprofit food distribution and training center providing food for hungry people while striving to end hunger throughout Cook County, Illinois. It also offers education programs providing the knowledge and tools needed to break the poverty cycle.
El Valor[29] is a nonprofit group seeking to enrich the local community by empowering the underserved, disenfranchised, and disabled while creating a sense of unity among all community members.
Heartland Alliance[30] is a human-rights-advocacy group providing housing, healthcare, economic security, and legal protection for low-income citizens.
Governor Quinn appointed Kennedy to the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois in September 2009. He served in that role until his gubernatorial appointment expired in January 2015.
He served as a Member of the Executive Committee of the Chicago Community Trust until January 2015.
He served as the Lund-Gill Chair in the Rosary College of Arts and Sciences at Dominican University (Illinois).[31]
He is the chairman of the board of Innovation Illinois, a progressive 501(c)(4) non-profit advocacy group formed in April 2015.

Residential development[edit]
As Chairman of Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises, Inc., Kennedy is responsible for the development of the Kennedy family real estate holdings in Chicago known as Wolf Point, Chicago. The Wolf Point development site represents a billion-dollar commitment to the downtown core, and the site is zoned for construction of a residential apartment building, a self-park garage, and two additional high-rise buildings.
Kennedy also is a partner in Sudbury Station LLC, a development entity proposing a 250-unit luxury rental housing development with a state mandated minimum affordable housing set aside in Sudbury, Massachusetts, designed to meet local housing needs for seniors and the working class community. Proposed on a 39-acre parcel zoned residential near the Historic District of Sudbury, the Village at Sudbury Station would satisfy the Massachusetts affordable housing mandate for Sudbury, would be located close to schools, parks, churches and public safety facilities, and would contribute significant additional tax revenue to the town.[32][33] The project has received widespread criticism from town officials and residents. Residents voted unamiously to hire a special counsel to stop the development, which violates over thirty local zoning ordinances.[34][35]

Top Box Foods[edit]
In May 2012, Kennedy started the Chicago-based non-profit Top Box Foods.

Top Box as an organization purchases food, boxes it in various combinations and delivers it monthly to churches and organizations in mostly low-income neighborhoods. The food items in the box change from month to month and include a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, meats, and frozen meals, with box prices ranging from $19 to $39. The boxes can be ordered online or through the organizations where the boxes are delivered. These organizations, otherwise known as Top Box "host sites," range from small neighborhood churches with a few dozen families to some of the Chicago's largest, including Trinity United Church of Christ and Salem Baptist Church.

His wife earned a law degree from Northwestern University and practiced at Sidley & Austin[citation needed] in Chicago before taking time off to take care of their children.
Political career[edit]




Kennedy attending Chicago's Pride Parade.


Kennedy's political activism began at an early age, and in 1979 and 1980 he worked on his uncle U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy's bid for the 1980 Democratic Party's nomination for U.S. President. He was also treasurer of the campaign committee for his brother Joseph's reelection to the U.S. House in 1988. Over the years he has organized numerous fundraising events in Chicago for his uncle Ted, his sister Kathleen, his brother Joseph and his cousin Mark Shriver.
The National Journal once quoted Kennedy as saying, "I have a lot to keep up with: a brother who might run for Congress, a sister and a brother considering races for governor, a cousin who might run for Congress, another in Congress, an uncle in the Senate and a cousin-in-law, Arnold [Schwarzennegger], who is thinking of running for governor."[13]
Beyond his family, Kennedy has served in a variety of capacities for numerous political campaigns, including hosting a fundraiser for Barack Obama in his bid for U.S. Senate.[citation needed]
In August 2009, after considering a run for the U.S. Senate,[14] as did many others, Kennedy decided not to run.[15] Also in August 2009, on the day after his uncle Ted's death on August 25, 2009, Kennedy was appointed to the University of Illinois board of trustees by Democratic Illinois Governor Pat Quinn.[16] On September 10, 2009, Kennedy was elected by the trustees as their chairman.[17]
Prior to February 8, 2017, when Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic Nomination for Illinois Governor in 2018,[18] he had never run for any elective office.[16]
Kennedy during his campaign for governor advocated for “a property tax system that can’t be abused by the wealthy and insiders” in a fundraising email.[19] House Speaker Mike Madigan owns a property tax law firm, and Kennedy retained the services of that firm.[20] Kennedy served as the president of MMPI (Merchandise Mart Properties, Inc.) from 2000 to 2011. Madigan's property tax law firm got MMPI more than $133,000 in property tax refunds, according to checks that the Cook County Treasurer's office sent out in 2009.[20] Kennedy criticized one of his fellow Democratic gubernatorial candidates, J.B. Pritzker, for getting a large property tax reduction on a Gold Coast mansion.[21] “It’s an inherently corruptible system and we ought to reject it,” Kennedy said to reporters in reference to Pritzker’s property taxes.[22] "The Cook County property tax appeals business is notorious for pricing political connections at a premium," wrote the Illinois Policy Institute.[23]
In June 2017, Kennedy was endorsed by Congressman Bobby Rush.[24]
Kennedy called for an open primary in the 2018 gubernatorial race, urging the Cook County Democratic party not to throw their weight behind any other candidate, instead allowing for voters to vet all the candidates in the race.[25]
Business and economic involvement[edit]
He is on the board of trustees of the mutual funds managed by Ariel Investments,[26] a Chicago-based investment-management firm.
From 1997-1999, Kennedy served as chairman of the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau, a sales-and-marketing organization promoting Chicago to the tourism and convention industries. Under Kennedy's chairmanship, the bureau retained and expanded Chicago's event-and-convention industry.[citation needed]
Since 2000, Kennedy has been a member of the City Club of Chicago, a group that brings together civic and cultural leaders to discuss and debate issues affecting the Chicago area.
Since 2005, he has been a member of the Commercial Club of Chicago, a group that brings together the city's business, educational, and cultural leaders on projects to improve central industries and create new economic opportunities.
Other civic involvement[edit]

Since 1996, he has been a member of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, a nonpartisan group that seeks to impact discourse on global issues through leadership, education, and policy.
Since 1996, Kennedy has been on the board of directors at The Irish Fellowship Club,[27] a Chicago-based group dedicated to preserving and promoting Irish heritage.
From 2006 until the Spring of 2013, he served on the board of directors of Catholic Theological Union, the largest Roman Catholic graduate school of theology and ministry in the U.S.[28]
Greater Chicago Food Depository is a nonprofit food distribution and training center providing food for hungry people while striving to end hunger throughout Cook County, Illinois. It also offers education programs providing the knowledge and tools needed to break the poverty cycle.
El Valor[29] is a nonprofit group seeking to enrich the local community by empowering the underserved, disenfranchised, and disabled while creating a sense of unity among all community members.
Heartland Alliance[30] is a human-rights-advocacy group providing housing, healthcare, economic security, and legal protection for low-income citizens.
Governor Quinn appointed Kennedy to the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois in September 2009. He served in that role until his gubernatorial appointment expired in January 2015.
He served as a Member of the Executive Committee of the Chicago Community Trust until January 2015.
He served as the Lund-Gill Chair in the Rosary College of Arts and Sciences at Dominican University (Illinois).[31]
He is the chairman of the board of Innovation Illinois, a progressive 501(c)(4) non-profit advocacy group formed in April 2015.

Residential development[edit]
As Chairman of Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises, Inc., Kennedy is responsible for the development of the Kennedy family real estate holdings in Chicago known as Wolf Point, Chicago. The Wolf Point development site represents a billion-dollar commitment to the downtown core, and the site is zoned for construction of a residential apartment building, a self-park garage, and two additional high-rise buildings.
Kennedy also is a partner in Sudbury Station LLC, a development entity proposing a 250-unit luxury rental housing development with a state mandated minimum affordable housing set aside in Sudbury, Massachusetts, designed to meet local housing needs for seniors and the working class community. Proposed on a 39-acre parcel zoned residential near the Historic District of Sudbury, the Village at Sudbury Station would satisfy the Massachusetts affordable housing mandate for Sudbury, would be located close to schools, parks, churches and public safety facilities, and would contribute significant additional tax revenue to the town.[32][33] The project has received widespread criticism from town officials and residents. Residents voted unamiously to hire a special counsel to stop the development, which violates over thirty local zoning ordinances.[34][35]

Residential development[edit]
As Chairman of Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises, Inc., Kennedy is responsible for the development of the Kennedy family real estate holdings in Chicago known as Wolf Point, Chicago. The Wolf Point development site represents a billion-dollar commitment to the downtown core, and the site is zoned for construction of a residential apartment building, a self-park garage, and two additional high-rise buildings.
Kennedy also is a partner in Sudbury Station LLC, a development entity proposing a 250-unit luxury rental housing development with a state mandated minimum affordable housing set aside in Sudbury, Massachusetts, designed to meet local housing needs for seniors and the working class community. Proposed on a 39-acre parcel zoned residential near the Historic District of Sudbury, the Village at Sudbury Station would satisfy the Massachusetts affordable housing mandate for Sudbury, would be located close to schools, parks, churches and public safety facilities, and would contribute significant additional tax revenue to the town.[32][33] The project has received widespread criticism from town officials and residents. Residents voted unamiously to hire a special counsel to stop the development, which violates over thirty local zoning ordinances.[34][35]

Early life and education[edit]
Kennedy was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to Robert Francis Kennedy and Ethel (née Skakel) Kennedy, the eighth of their eleven children. He is one of four grandchildren of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy born during the administration of his uncle U.S. President John F. Kennedy. His siblings are:


Kathleen Hartington Kennedy (born 1951)
Joseph Patrick Kennedy II (born 1952)
Robert Francis Kennedy, Jr. (born 1954)
David Anthony Kennedy (1955–1984)
Mary Courtney Kennedy (born 1956)
Michael LeMoyne Kennedy (1958–1997)
Mary Kerry Kennedy (born 1959)
Matthew Maxwell Taylor Kennedy (born 1965)
Douglas Harriman Kennedy (born 1967)
Rory Elizabeth Katherine Kennedy (born 1968)


He grew up at his family home, Hickory Hill, in McLean, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C., and attended the Our Lady of Victory Catholic School in McLean through the eighth grade.[5] He transferred to Georgetown Preparatory School in North Bethesda, Maryland, also a suburb of Washington, and graduated in 1982. While in high school, he volunteered at a home for runaway youth.
Kennedy graduated from Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1986.[6]
In 1994, he graduated with a master of business administration degree from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.
Career[edit]
Kennedy is chairman of the Kennedy family investment firm Joseph P Kennedy Enterprises, Inc.[7] He is treasurer of the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation, he was on the Executive Committee for the Chicago Community Trust, and he has been a board member of the Catholic Theological Union, Interface, Inc. and Knoll Inc.[1][8] He is a member of the mutual fund board of trustees for Ariel Investments.[9]
Kennedy moved from Boston to Decatur to work for Archer Daniels Midland in the 80's, and has spent his life working around issues of hunger, whether as the chairman of the Greater Chicago Food Depository, or now helping to run the non-profit he and his wife founded, Top Box Foods.[10]
Kennedy was the president of Merchandise Mart Properties in Chicago, Illinois, from 2000 until 2012. The property was originally owned by the Kennedy family until it was sold to Vornado Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust. The Merchandise Mart, one of the properties of Merchandise Mart Properties, is the largest commercial building in the world, serving as both a luxury wholesale design center and one of the leading international business locations in Chicago. The Mart spans two city blocks and rises twenty-five stories for a total of 4.2 million square feet (390,000 square metres) Three million people come through the Mart each year to visit its retail shops, permanent showrooms, and office space as well as attend the numerous trade, consumer and community events hosted there.
Kennedy also served as Chairman of the board at the University of Illinois.[11]
Top Box Foods[edit]
In May 2012, Kennedy started the Chicago-based non-profit Top Box Foods. The organization was created as a way to get discounted groceries to families who live in areas that either lack grocery stores or have an abundance of fast food. Kennedy initially invested $150,000 to get Top Box started, and subsequently designed the organization to be self-sustaining.
Top Box as an organization purchases food, boxes it in various combinations and delivers it monthly to churches and organizations in mostly low-income neighborhoods. The food items in the box change from month to month and include a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, meats, and frozen meals, with box prices ranging from $19 to $39. The boxes can be ordered online or through the organizations where the boxes are delivered. These organizations, otherwise known as Top Box "host sites," range from small neighborhood churches with a few dozen families to some of the Chicago's largest, including Trinity United Church of Christ and Salem Baptist Church.
Personal life[edit]
Family[edit]
Kennedy met Sheila Sinclair-Berner (born December 4, 1962), an Illinois native, while attending Boston College. After graduating from college in 1986, Kennedy moved to Decatur, Illinois, and married in 1987.[12] The couple had four children, Katherine "Kate" Berner Kennedy (b.Oct 4 1990), Christopher George "Chris" Kennedy, Jr. (b.Jun 15 1992), Sarah Louise Kennedy (b. Sep 26 1994), Clare Rose Kennedy (b.Nov 3 1998), whom they are raising in the Chicago suburb of Kenilworth. His wife earned a law degree from Northwestern University and practiced at Sidley & Austin[citation needed] in Chicago before taking time off to take care of their children.
Political career[edit]




Kennedy attending Chicago's Pride Parade.


Kennedy's political activism began at an early age, and in 1979 and 1980 he worked on his uncle U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy's bid for the 1980 Democratic Party's nomination for U.S. President. He was also treasurer of the campaign committee for his brother Joseph's reelection to the U.S. House in 1988. Over the years he has organized numerous fundraising events in Chicago for his uncle Ted, his sister Kathleen, his brother Joseph and his cousin Mark Shriver.
The National Journal once quoted Kennedy as saying, "I have a lot to keep up with: a brother who might run for Congress, a sister and a brother considering races for governor, a cousin who might run for Congress, another in Congress, an uncle in the Senate and a cousin-in-law, Arnold [Schwarzennegger], who is thinking of running for governor."[13]
Beyond his family, Kennedy has served in a variety of capacities for numerous political campaigns, including hosting a fundraiser for Barack Obama in his bid for U.S. Senate.[citation needed]
In August 2009, after considering a run for the U.S. Senate,[14] as did many others, Kennedy decided not to run.[15] Also in August 2009, on the day after his uncle Ted's death on August 25, 2009, Kennedy was appointed to the University of Illinois board of trustees by Democratic Illinois Governor Pat Quinn.[16] On September 10, 2009, Kennedy was elected by the trustees as their chairman.[17]
Prior to February 8, 2017, when Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic Nomination for Illinois Governor in 2018,[18] he had never run for any elective office.[16]
Kennedy during his campaign for governor advocated for “a property tax system that can’t be abused by the wealthy and insiders” in a fundraising email.[19] House Speaker Mike Madigan owns a property tax law firm, and Kennedy retained the services of that firm.[20] Kennedy served as the president of MMPI (Merchandise Mart Properties, Inc.) from 2000 to 2011. Madigan's property tax law firm got MMPI more than $133,000 in property tax refunds, according to checks that the Cook County Treasurer's office sent out in 2009.[20] Kennedy criticized one of his fellow Democratic gubernatorial candidates, J.B. Pritzker, for getting a large property tax reduction on a Gold Coast mansion.[21] “It’s an inherently corruptible system and we ought to reject it,” Kennedy said to reporters in reference to Pritzker’s property taxes.[22] "The Cook County property tax appeals business is notorious for pricing political connections at a premium," wrote the Illinois Policy Institute.[23]
In June 2017, Kennedy was endorsed by Congressman Bobby Rush.[24]
Kennedy called for an open primary in the 2018 gubernatorial race, urging the Cook County Democratic party not to throw their weight behind any other candidate, instead allowing for voters to vet all the candidates in the race.[25]
Business and economic involvement[edit]
He is on the board of trustees of the mutual funds managed by Ariel Investments,[26] a Chicago-based investment-management firm.
From 1997-1999, Kennedy served as chairman of the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau, a sales-and-marketing organization promoting Chicago to the tourism and convention industries. Under Kennedy's chairmanship, the bureau retained and expanded Chicago's event-and-convention industry.[citation needed]
Since 2000, Kennedy has been a member of the City Club of Chicago, a group that brings together civic and cultural leaders to discuss and debate issues affecting the Chicago area.
Since 2005, he has been a member of the Commercial Club of Chicago, a group that brings together the city's business, educational, and cultural leaders on projects to improve central industries and create new economic opportunities.
Other civic involvement[edit]

Since 1996, he has been a member of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, a nonpartisan group that seeks to impact discourse on global issues through leadership, education, and policy.
Since 1996, Kennedy has been on the board of directors at The Irish Fellowship Club,[27] a Chicago-based group dedicated to preserving and promoting Irish heritage.
From 2006 until the Spring of 2013, he served on the board of directors of Catholic Theological Union, the largest Roman Catholic graduate school of theology and ministry in the U.S.[28]
Greater Chicago Food Depository is a nonprofit food distribution and training center providing food for hungry people while striving to end hunger throughout Cook County, Illinois. It also offers education programs providing the knowledge and tools needed to break the poverty cycle.
El Valor[29] is a nonprofit group seeking to enrich the local community by empowering the underserved, disenfranchised, and disabled while creating a sense of unity among all community members.
Heartland Alliance[30] is a human-rights-advocacy group providing housing, healthcare, economic security, and legal protection for low-income citizens.
Governor Quinn appointed Kennedy to the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois in September 2009. He served in that role until his gubernatorial appointment expired in January 2015.
He served as a Member of the Executive Committee of the Chicago Community Trust until January 2015.
He served as the Lund-Gill Chair in the Rosary College of Arts and Sciences at Dominican University (Illinois).[31]
He is the chairman of the board of Innovation Illinois, a progressive 501(c)(4) non-profit advocacy group formed in April 2015.

Residential development[edit]
As Chairman of Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises, Inc., Kennedy is responsible for the development of the Kennedy family real estate holdings in Chicago known as Wolf Point, Chicago. The Wolf Point development site represents a billion-dollar commitment to the downtown core, and the site is zoned for construction of a residential apartment building, a self-park garage, and two additional high-rise buildings.
Kennedy also is a partner in Sudbury Station LLC, a development entity proposing a 250-unit luxury rental housing development with a state mandated minimum affordable housing set aside in Sudbury, Massachusetts, designed to meet local housing needs for seniors and the working class community. Proposed on a 39-acre parcel zoned residential near the Historic District of Sudbury, the Village at Sudbury Station would satisfy the Massachusetts affordable housing mandate for Sudbury, would be located close to schools, parks, churches and public safety facilities, and would contribute significant additional tax revenue to the town.[32][33] The project has received widespread criticism from town officials and residents. Residents voted unamiously to hire a special counsel to stop the development, which violates over thirty local zoning ordinances.[34][35]

Early life and education[edit]
Kennedy was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to Robert Francis Kennedy and Ethel (née Skakel) Kennedy, the eighth of their eleven children. He is one of four grandchildren of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy born during the administration of his uncle U.S. President John F. Kennedy. His siblings are:


Kathleen Hartington Kennedy (born 1951)
Joseph Patrick Kennedy II (born 1952)
Robert Francis Kennedy, Jr. (born 1954)
David Anthony Kennedy (1955–1984)
Mary Courtney Kennedy (born 1956)
Michael LeMoyne Kennedy (1958–1997)
Mary Kerry Kennedy (born 1959)
Matthew Maxwell Taylor Kennedy (born 1965)
Douglas Harriman Kennedy (born 1967)
Rory Elizabeth Katherine Kennedy (born 1968)


He grew up at his family home, Hickory Hill, in McLean, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C., and attended the Our Lady of Victory Catholic School in McLean through the eighth grade.[5] He transferred to Georgetown Preparatory School in North Bethesda, Maryland, also a suburb of Washington, and graduated in 1982. While in high school, he volunteered at a home for runaway youth.
Kennedy graduated from Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1986.[6]
In 1994, he graduated with a master of business administration degree from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.
Career[edit]
Kennedy is chairman of the Kennedy family investment firm Joseph P Kennedy Enterprises, Inc.[7] He is treasurer of the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation, he was on the Executive Committee for the Chicago Community Trust, and he has been a board member of the Catholic Theological Union, Interface, Inc. and Knoll Inc.[1][8] He is a member of the mutual fund board of trustees for Ariel Investments.[9]
Kennedy moved from Boston to Decatur to work for Archer Daniels Midland in the 80's, and has spent his life working around issues of hunger, whether as the chairman of the Greater Chicago Food Depository, or now helping to run the non-profit he and his wife founded, Top Box Foods.[10]
Kennedy was the president of Merchandise Mart Properties in Chicago, Illinois, from 2000 until 2012. The property was originally owned by the Kennedy family until it was sold to Vornado Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust. The Merchandise Mart, one of the properties of Merchandise Mart Properties, is the largest commercial building in the world, serving as both a luxury wholesale design center and one of the leading international business locations in Chicago. The Mart spans two city blocks and rises twenty-five stories for a total of 4.2 million square feet (390,000 square metres) Three million people come through the Mart each year to visit its retail shops, permanent showrooms, and office space as well as attend the numerous trade, consumer and community events hosted there.
Kennedy also served as Chairman of the board at the University of Illinois.[11]
Top Box Foods[edit]
In May 2012, Kennedy started the Chicago-based non-profit Top Box Foods. The organization was created as a way to get discounted groceries to families who live in areas that either lack grocery stores or have an abundance of fast food. Kennedy initially invested $150,000 to get Top Box started, and subsequently designed the organization to be self-sustaining.
Top Box as an organization purchases food, boxes it in various combinations and delivers it monthly to churches and organizations in mostly low-income neighborhoods. The food items in the box change from month to month and include a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, meats, and frozen meals, with box prices ranging from $19 to $39. The boxes can be ordered online or through the organizations where the boxes are delivered. These organizations, otherwise known as Top Box "host sites," range from small neighborhood churches with a few dozen families to some of the Chicago's largest, including Trinity United Church of Christ and Salem Baptist Church.
Personal life[edit]
Family[edit]
Kennedy met Sheila Sinclair-Berner (born December 4, 1962), an Illinois native, while attending Boston College. After graduating from college in 1986, Kennedy moved to Decatur, Illinois, and married in 1987.[12] The couple had four children, Katherine "Kate" Berner Kennedy (b.Oct 4 1990), Christopher George "Chris" Kennedy, Jr. (b.Jun 15 1992), Sarah Louise Kennedy (b. Sep 26 1994), Clare Rose Kennedy (b.Nov 3 1998), whom they are raising in the Chicago suburb of Kenilworth. His wife earned a law degree from Northwestern University and practiced at Sidley & Austin[citation needed] in Chicago before taking time off to take care of their children.
Political career[edit]




Kennedy attending Chicago's Pride Parade.


Kennedy's political activism began at an early age, and in 1979 and 1980 he worked on his uncle U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy's bid for the 1980 Democratic Party's nomination for U.S. President. He was also treasurer of the campaign committee for his brother Joseph's reelection to the U.S. House in 1988. Over the years he has organized numerous fundraising events in Chicago for his uncle Ted, his sister Kathleen, his brother Joseph and his cousin Mark Shriver.
The National Journal once quoted Kennedy as saying, "I have a lot to keep up with: a brother who might run for Congress, a sister and a brother considering races for governor, a cousin who might run for Congress, another in Congress, an uncle in the Senate and a cousin-in-law, Arnold [Schwarzennegger], who is thinking of running for governor."[13]
Beyond his family, Kennedy has served in a variety of capacities for numerous political campaigns, including hosting a fundraiser for Barack Obama in his bid for U.S. Senate.[citation needed]
In August 2009, after considering a run for the U.S. Senate,[14] as did many others, Kennedy decided not to run.[15] Also in August 2009, on the day after his uncle Ted's death on August 25, 2009, Kennedy was appointed to the University of Illinois board of trustees by Democratic Illinois Governor Pat Quinn.[16] On September 10, 2009, Kennedy was elected by the trustees as their chairman.[17]
Prior to February 8, 2017, when Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic Nomination for Illinois Governor in 2018,[18] he had never run for any elective office.[16]
Kennedy during his campaign for governor advocated for “a property tax system that can’t be abused by the wealthy and insiders” in a fundraising email.[19] House Speaker Mike Madigan owns a property tax law firm, and Kennedy retained the services of that firm.[20] Kennedy served as the president of MMPI (Merchandise Mart Properties, Inc.) from 2000 to 2011. Madigan's property tax law firm got MMPI more than $133,000 in property tax refunds, according to checks that the Cook County Treasurer's office sent out in 2009.[20] Kennedy criticized one of his fellow Democratic gubernatorial candidates, J.B. Pritzker, for getting a large property tax reduction on a Gold Coast mansion.[21] “It’s an inherently corruptible system and we ought to reject it,” Kennedy said to reporters in reference to Pritzker’s property taxes.[22] "The Cook County property tax appeals business is notorious for pricing political connections at a premium," wrote the Illinois Policy Institute.[23]
In June 2017, Kennedy was endorsed by Congressman Bobby Rush.[24]
Kennedy called for an open primary in the 2018 gubernatorial race, urging the Cook County Democratic party not to throw their weight behind any other candidate, instead allowing for voters to vet all the candidates in the race.[25]
Business and economic involvement[edit]
He is on the board of trustees of the mutual funds managed by Ariel Investments,[26] a Chicago-based investment-management firm.
From 1997-1999, Kennedy served as chairman of the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau, a sales-and-marketing organization promoting Chicago to the tourism and convention industries. Under Kennedy's chairmanship, the bureau retained and expanded Chicago's event-and-convention industry.[citation needed]
Since 2000, Kennedy has been a member of the City Club of Chicago, a group that brings together civic and cultural leaders to discuss and debate issues affecting the Chicago area.
Since 2005, he has been a member of the Commercial Club of Chicago, a group that brings together the city's business, educational, and cultural leaders on projects to improve central industries and create new economic opportunities.
Other civic involvement[edit]

Since 1996, he has been a member of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, a nonpartisan group that seeks to impact discourse on global issues through leadership, education, and policy.
Since 1996, Kennedy has been on the board of directors at The Irish Fellowship Club,[27] a Chicago-based group dedicated to preserving and promoting Irish heritage.
From 2006 until the Spring of 2013, he served on the board of directors of Catholic Theological Union, the largest Roman Catholic graduate school of theology and ministry in the U.S.[28]
Greater Chicago Food Depository is a nonprofit food distribution and training center providing food for hungry people while striving to end hunger throughout Cook County, Illinois. It also offers education programs providing the knowledge and tools needed to break the poverty cycle.
El Valor[29] is a nonprofit group seeking to enrich the local community by empowering the underserved, disenfranchised, and disabled while creating a sense of unity among all community members.
Heartland Alliance[30] is a human-rights-advocacy group providing housing, healthcare, economic security, and legal protection for low-income citizens.
Governor Quinn appointed Kennedy to the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois in September 2009. He served in that role until his gubernatorial appointment expired in January 2015.
He served as a Member of the Executive Committee of the Chicago Community Trust until January 2015.
He served as the Lund-Gill Chair in the Rosary College of Arts and Sciences at Dominican University (Illinois).[31]
He is the chairman of the board of Innovation Illinois, a progressive 501(c)(4) non-profit advocacy group formed in April 2015.

Residential development[edit]
As Chairman of Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises, Inc., Kennedy is responsible for the development of the Kennedy family real estate holdings in Chicago known as Wolf Point, Chicago. The Wolf Point development site represents a billion-dollar commitment to the downtown core, and the site is zoned for construction of a residential apartment building, a self-park garage, and two additional high-rise buildings.
Kennedy also is a partner in Sudbury Station LLC, a development entity proposing a 250-unit luxury rental housing development with a state mandated minimum affordable housing set aside in Sudbury, Massachusetts, designed to meet local housing needs for seniors and the working class community. Proposed on a 39-acre parcel zoned residential near the Historic District of Sudbury, the Village at Sudbury Station would satisfy the Massachusetts affordable housing mandate for Sudbury, would be located close to schools, parks, churches and public safety facilities, and would contribute significant additional tax revenue to the town.[32][33] The project has received widespread criticism from town officials and residents. Residents voted unamiously to hire a special counsel to stop the development, which violates over thirty local zoning ordinances.[34][35]

Kennedy graduated from Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1986.[6]
In 1994, he graduated with a master of business administration degree from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.
Career[edit]
Kennedy is chairman of the Kennedy family investment firm Joseph P Kennedy Enterprises, Inc.[7] He is treasurer of the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation, he was on the Executive Committee for the Chicago Community Trust, and he has been a board member of the Catholic Theological Union, Interface, Inc. and Knoll Inc.[1][8] He is a member of the mutual fund board of trustees for Ariel Investments.[9]
Kennedy moved from Boston to Decatur to work for Archer Daniels Midland in the 80's, and has spent his life working around issues of hunger, whether as the chairman of the Greater Chicago Food Depository, or now helping to run the non-profit he and his wife founded, Top Box Foods.[10]
Kennedy was the president of Merchandise Mart Properties in Chicago, Illinois, from 2000 until 2012. The property was originally owned by the Kennedy family until it was sold to Vornado Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust. The Merchandise Mart, one of the properties of Merchandise Mart Properties, is the largest commercial building in the world, serving as both a luxury wholesale design center and one of the leading international business locations in Chicago. The Mart spans two city blocks and rises twenty-five stories for a total of 4.2 million square feet (390,000 square metres) Three million people come through the Mart each year to visit its retail shops, permanent showrooms, and office space as well as attend the numerous trade, consumer and community events hosted there.
Kennedy also served as Chairman of the board at the University of Illinois.[11]
Top Box Foods[edit]
In May 2012, Kennedy started the Chicago-based non-profit Top Box Foods. The organization was created as a way to get discounted groceries to families who live in areas that either lack grocery stores or have an abundance of fast food. Kennedy initially invested $150,000 to get Top Box started, and subsequently designed the organization to be self-sustaining.
Top Box as an organization purchases food, boxes it in various combinations and delivers it monthly to churches and organizations in mostly low-income neighborhoods. The food items in the box change from month to month and include a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, meats, and frozen meals, with box prices ranging from $19 to $39. The boxes can be ordered online or through the organizations where the boxes are delivered. These organizations, otherwise known as Top Box "host sites," range from small neighborhood churches with a few dozen families to some of the Chicago's largest, including Trinity United Church of Christ and Salem Baptist Church.
Personal life[edit]
Family[edit]
Kennedy met Sheila Sinclair-Berner (born December 4, 1962), an Illinois native, while attending Boston College. After graduating from college in 1986, Kennedy moved to Decatur, Illinois, and married in 1987.[12] The couple had four children, Katherine "Kate" Berner Kennedy (b.Oct 4 1990), Christopher George "Chris" Kennedy, Jr. (b.Jun 15 1992), Sarah Louise Kennedy (b. Sep 26 1994), Clare Rose Kennedy (b.Nov 3 1998), whom they are raising in the Chicago suburb of Kenilworth. His wife earned a law degree from Northwestern University and practiced at Sidley & Austin[citation needed] in Chicago before taking time off to take care of their children.
Political career[edit]




Kennedy attending Chicago's Pride Parade.


Kennedy's political activism began at an early age, and in 1979 and 1980 he worked on his uncle U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy's bid for the 1980 Democratic Party's nomination for U.S. President. He was also treasurer of the campaign committee for his brother Joseph's reelection to the U.S. House in 1988. Over the years he has organized numerous fundraising events in Chicago for his uncle Ted, his sister Kathleen, his brother Joseph and his cousin Mark Shriver.
The National Journal once quoted Kennedy as saying, "I have a lot to keep up with: a brother who might run for Congress, a sister and a brother considering races for governor, a cousin who might run for Congress, another in Congress, an uncle in the Senate and a cousin-in-law, Arnold [Schwarzennegger], who is thinking of running for governor."[13]
Beyond his family, Kennedy has served in a variety of capacities for numerous political campaigns, including hosting a fundraiser for Barack Obama in his bid for U.S. Senate.[citation needed]
In August 2009, after considering a run for the U.S. Senate,[14] as did many others, Kennedy decided not to run.[15] Also in August 2009, on the day after his uncle Ted's death on August 25, 2009, Kennedy was appointed to the University of Illinois board of trustees by Democratic Illinois Governor Pat Quinn.[16] On September 10, 2009, Kennedy was elected by the trustees as their chairman.[17]
Prior to February 8, 2017, when Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic Nomination for Illinois Governor in 2018,[18] he had never run for any elective office.[16]
Kennedy during his campaign for governor advocated for “a property tax system that can’t be abused by the wealthy and insiders” in a fundraising email.[19] House Speaker Mike Madigan owns a property tax law firm, and Kennedy retained the services of that firm.[20] Kennedy served as the president of MMPI (Merchandise Mart Properties, Inc.) from 2000 to 2011. Madigan's property tax law firm got MMPI more than $133,000 in property tax refunds, according to checks that the Cook County Treasurer's office sent out in 2009.[20] Kennedy criticized one of his fellow Democratic gubernatorial candidates, J.B. Pritzker, for getting a large property tax reduction on a Gold Coast mansion.[21] “It’s an inherently corruptible system and we ought to reject it,” Kennedy said to reporters in reference to Pritzker’s property taxes.[22] "The Cook County property tax appeals business is notorious for pricing political connections at a premium," wrote the Illinois Policy Institute.[23]
In June 2017, Kennedy was endorsed by Congressman Bobby Rush.[24]
Kennedy called for an open primary in the 2018 gubernatorial race, urging the Cook County Democratic party not to throw their weight behind any other candidate, instead allowing for voters to vet all the candidates in the race.[25]
Business and economic involvement[edit]
He is on the board of trustees of the mutual funds managed by Ariel Investments,[26] a Chicago-based investment-management firm.
From 1997-1999, Kennedy served as chairman of the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau, a sales-and-marketing organization promoting Chicago to the tourism and convention industries. Under Kennedy's chairmanship, the bureau retained and expanded Chicago's event-and-convention industry.[citation needed]
Since 2000, Kennedy has been a member of the City Club of Chicago, a group that brings together civic and cultural leaders to discuss and debate issues affecting the Chicago area.
Since 2005, he has been a member of the Commercial Club of Chicago, a group that brings together the city's business, educational, and cultural leaders on projects to improve central industries and create new economic opportunities.
Other civic involvement[edit]

Since 1996, he has been a member of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, a nonpartisan group that seeks to impact discourse on global issues through leadership, education, and policy.
Since 1996, Kennedy has been on the board of directors at The Irish Fellowship Club,[27] a Chicago-based group dedicated to preserving and promoting Irish heritage.
From 2006 until the Spring of 2013, he served on the board of directors of Catholic Theological Union, the largest Roman Catholic graduate school of theology and ministry in the U.S.[28]
Greater Chicago Food Depository is a nonprofit food distribution and training center providing food for hungry people while striving to end hunger throughout Cook County, Illinois. It also offers education programs providing the knowledge and tools needed to break the poverty cycle.
El Valor[29] is a nonprofit group seeking to enrich the local community by empowering the underserved, disenfranchised, and disabled while creating a sense of unity among all community members.
Heartland Alliance[30] is a human-rights-advocacy group providing housing, healthcare, economic security, and legal protection for low-income citizens.
Governor Quinn appointed Kennedy to the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois in September 2009. He served in that role until his gubernatorial appointment expired in January 2015.
He served as a Member of the Executive Committee of the Chicago Community Trust until January 2015.
He served as the Lund-Gill Chair in the Rosary College of Arts and Sciences at Dominican University (Illinois).[31]
He is the chairman of the board of Innovation Illinois, a progressive 501(c)(4) non-profit advocacy group formed in April 2015.

Residential development[edit]
As Chairman of Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises, Inc., Kennedy is responsible for the development of the Kennedy family real estate holdings in Chicago known as Wolf Point, Chicago. The Wolf Point development site represents a billion-dollar commitment to the downtown core, and the site is zoned for construction of a residential apartment building, a self-park garage, and two additional high-rise buildings.
Kennedy also is a partner in Sudbury Station LLC, a development entity proposing a 250-unit luxury rental housing development with a state mandated minimum affordable housing set aside in Sudbury, Massachusetts, designed to meet local housing needs for seniors and the working class community. Proposed on a 39-acre parcel zoned residential near the Historic District of Sudbury, the Village at Sudbury Station would satisfy the Massachusetts affordable housing mandate for Sudbury, would be located close to schools, parks, churches and public safety facilities, and would contribute significant additional tax revenue to the town.[32][33] The project has received widespread criticism from town officials and residents. Residents voted unamiously to hire a special counsel to stop the development, which violates over thirty local zoning ordinances.[34][35]

Pritzker, for getting a large property tax reduction on a Gold Coast mansion.[20] “It’s an inherently corruptible system and we ought to reject it,” Kennedy said to reporters in reference to Pritzker’s property taxes.[21] "The Cook County property tax appeals business is notorious for pricing political connections at a premium," wrote the Illinois Policy Institute.[22]In June 2017, Kennedy was endorsed by Congressman Bobby Rush.[23]Kennedy called for an open primary in the 2018 gubernatorial race, urging the Cook County Democratic party not to throw their weight behind any other candidate, instead allowing for voters to vet all the candidates in the race.[24]Business and economic involvementHe is on the board of trustees of the mutual funds managed by Ariel Investments,[25] a Chicago-based investment-management firm.Since 1996, he has been a member of the Economic Club of Chicago,[26] a group established in the 1920s with the goal of aiding "the creation and expression of an enlightened public opinion on the important economic and social questions of the day".Since 1997, Kennedy has also been a member of the Executives Club of Chicago,[27] which brings world leaders and practices to the local business community to establish productive relationships and explore the issues facing the business world in today's business environment.From 1997-1999, Kennedy served as chairman of the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau, a sales-and-marketing organization promoting Chicago to the tourism and convention industries. Under Kennedy's chairmanship, the bureau retained and expanded Chicago's event-and-convention industry.[citation needed]Since 2000, Kennedy has been a member of the City Club of Chicago, a group that brings together civic and cultural leaders to discuss and debate issues affecting the Chicago area.Since 2005, he has been a member of the Commercial Club of Chicago, a group that brings together the city's business, educational, and cultural leaders on projects to improve central industries and create new economic opportunities.Environmental leadershipGreen building practicesUnder Kennedy's leadership of the Mart, it was the largest building in the world to be awarded LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Certification in 2007[28] from the United States Green Building Council (USGBC). The Mart has long been implementing sustainable practices. The Mart Center began operating a thermal storage facility in 1986, capable of building 2,000,000 pounds (910,000 kg) of ice per night, cooling 71 buildings in the surrounding neighborhood, and saving $200,000 in electricity costs in the first year.[citation needed]In 1990, the Mart Center began using Green Seal-approved green cleaning products and the next year implemented a recycling program, which today includes all forms of paper products, glass, light bulbs, batteries, aluminum and construction materials. In 1996, the Mart Center became one of the first major property owners in downtown Chicago to enter into an agreement with the district cooling system now known as Thermal Chicago, thus contributing to the national effort to reduce the discharge of ozone-damaging CFCs.In 2006, MMPI joined Clean Air Counts, a voluntary initiative to reduce smog forming pollutants and energy consumption in the greater Chicago area. Part of the campaign strategies included utilizing only low VOC cleaning products, paints and building materials, as well as energy efficient lighting and alternative workplace transportation options. To date, the Mart Center has reduced pollution by 264,018 pounds (119,757 kg), the largest reduction by a commercial building.[citation needed]That same year, the Mart Center recycling program saved over 13,000 trees and recycled nearly 11 million pounds of waste, while water conservation efforts saved 5.5 million US gallons (21,000 m3) of water. More than eight percent of the estimated 10,000 people working at the Mart walk, bike or take public transportation; to encourage greener methods of transportation, the Mart expanded bicycle storage capacity to more than 200. In 2009, MMPI converted all stationery to a one hundred percent post-consumer recycled product.[citation needed]The Mart has nine LEED-certified showrooms, with five others on their way to LEED certification.Kennedy serves on Mayor Emanuel's Green Ribbon Committee and is Co-Chair for the Cook County Sustainability Advisory Council.Green alliancesMMPI has worked closely with:Delta InstituteUnited States Green Building Council (USGBC)Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (IDCEO)Clinton Climate Initiative (CCI), a part of the Clinton FoundationClean Air Counts[29]Friends of the Chicago River[30]Citizens Energy CorporationInterface, Inc.HealthcareThe Joseph P.

It also offers education programs providing the knowledge and tools needed to break the poverty cycle.El Valor[35] is a nonprofit group seeking to enrich the local community by empowering the underserved, disenfranchised, and disabled while creating a sense of unity among all community members.Heartland Alliance[36] is a human-rights-advocacy group providing housing, healthcare, economic security, and legal protection for low-income citizens.Governor Quinn appointed Kennedy to the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois in September 2009. He served in that role until his gubernatorial appointment expired in January 2015.He served as a Member of the Executive Committee of the Chicago Community Trust until January 2015.He served as the Lund-Gill Chair in the Rosary College of Arts and Sciences at Dominican University (Illinois).[37]He is the chairman of the board of Innovation Illinois, a progressive 501(c)(4) non-profit advocacy group formed in April 2015.Bill AyersOn September 23, 2010, Bill Ayers was unanimously denied emeritus status at the University of Illinois at Chicago after board chair Kennedy gave a speech[38][39] protesting it, with the quote "I intend to vote against conferring the honorific title of our university to a man whose body of work includes a book dedicated in part to the man who murdered my father, Robert F. Kennedy."Residential developmentAs Chairman of Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises, Inc., Kennedy is responsible for the development of the Kennedy family real estate holdings in Chicago known as Wolf Point, Chicago. The Wolf Point development site represents a billion-dollar commitment to the downtown core, and the site is zoned for construction of a residential apartment building, a self-park garage, and two additional high-rise buildings.Kennedy also is a partner in Sudbury Station LLC, a development entity proposing a 250-unit luxury rental housing development with a state mandated minimum affordable housing set aside in Sudbury, Massachusetts, designed to meet local housing needs for seniors and the working class community. Proposed on a 39-acre parcel zoned residential near the Historic District of Sudbury, the Village at Sudbury Station would satisfy the Massachusetts affordable housing mandate for Sudbury, would be located close to schools, parks, churches and public safety facilities, and would contribute significant additional tax revenue to the town.[40][41] The project has received widespread criticism from town officials and residents. Residents voted unamiously to hire a special counsel to stop the development, which violates over thirty local zoning ordinances.[42][43]See alsoKennedy CurseKennedy familyKennedy family treeReferencesSpecific^ a b http://www.arielinvestments.com/content/view/137/1065/^ "Christopher G.

Can a Relationship Help to Battle Addiction?
Yahoo News - about 1 month

 Could the key to help battle addiction be a healthy relationship?  The Doctors are joined by author and activist Christopher Kennedy Lawford, who wrote "When Your Partner Has an Addiction: How Compassion Can Transform Your Relationship (and Heal You Both in the Process)," to speak about how an interpersonal relationship can help people struggling with addiction.  Christopher, who is a nephew of President John F. Kennedy, has fought his own battles with addiction, says that addiction can flourish in isolation and people who work on their struggles with a loved one often times have a better outcome than those who go at it alone.

University Of Illinois At Chicago Vying To Be Future Site Of Barack Obama's Presidential Library
Huffington Post - over 3 years

The University of Illinois at Chicago has thrown its hat into the ring of institutions competing to house Barack Obama's future presidential library and museum.   UIC announced its plan to bid for the library Sunday with a university spokesman saying the school is exploring "at least five sites" on its Near West Side campus, the Tribune reports.  
"Our candidacy follows the recommendation of a task force of deans, administrators and outside advisers who agreed that UIC's diversity, research, outreach and central location make it uniquely appropriate for the library and museum honoring President Obama's legacy," UIC Chancellor Paula Allen-Meares told the Tribune.  
Among UIC's Chicago-based competition is the University of Chicago (where the president was a lecturer at its law school for more than a decade); Chicago State University; and even the site of the old Michael Reese Hospital in Bronzeville.   
As the Associated Press notes, Obama has no formal ties to UIC or Chicago State while

JFK's Nephew: Fidel Castro Was 'An Amazing Guy'
Huffington Post - over 4 years


         Christopher Kennedy Lawford, the nephew of the late former President John F. Kennedy, on Thursday described an encounter he had with Cuban dictator Fidel Castro in 2001 as "amazing." 

 Speaking with HuffPost Live host Jacob Soboroff, Lawford described the time that year when he sat next to Castro at a screening of the 2000 docudrama "Thirteen Days", which documents the Kennedy administration's handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. 

 In 2005, Lawford told CNN's Larry King that Castro got up at the end of the film and said it was "great," but that it had ignored Cuba's perspective on the situation.  

 This isn't the first time Lawford has mentioned his feelings about his meeting with Castro. As The New York Times previously noted, Lawford "proudly describes" watching the film with Castro in his memoir "Symptoms of Withdrawal: A Memoir of Snapshots and Redemption." 

 Lawford went on to give his take on Raul Castro's leadership and America's current relationship with C

Kerry Kennedy: Doctors Say Seizure Caused Accident
Bronxville-Eastchester Patch - about 5 years

 Kerry Kennedy says that a seizure is to blame for her North Castle car accident on Friday, based on findings from doctors. 
 Speaking out for the first time since she was arrested Friday near Interstate 684 after hitting a tractor trailer with her car, Kennedy talked to reporters after her Tuesday arraignment at North Castle town court on her driving while ability impaired charge; she pleaded not guilty. Kennedy explained that she had neurological testing done after her arrest. 
 “Determined to understand my medical condition, I underwent a full battery of neurological testing at Mount Sinai Medical Center," she said outside of the court building, located in Armonk. 
 Based on an MRI taken, there is "an area of hyper density" due to a past head injury that she suffered. 
 “A comprehensive battery of neurological function tests showed symptoms consistent with the right side of the brain injury," she said." 
 This was just one sign that a seizure may have been the cause.

Wolf Point proposal doesn't live up to promise of its site; Kennedy family's $1 billion development, designed by Cesar Pelli, needs substantial reworking
Chicago Times - about 5 years

 From today's print edition   Cities rarely get opportunities for architectural greatness like the one Chicago now has at Wolf Point. This historic plot at the meeting of theChicago River'sbranches — once home to pioneer taverns and trading posts, in recent decades an eyesore surface parking lot — is as prominent as they come. It deserves the finest architecture and public spaces. Nothing less will do.   The $1 billion plan for Wolf Point unveiled at a community meeting Tuesday by representatives of the Kennedy family and three financial partners is not there yet. It needs substantial improvement before the developers and their architects, led by Cesar Pelli of the New Haven, Conn., firm Pelli Clarke Pelli, should be granted the zoning change they covet.   The problems range from a traffic study that appears overly friendly to the developers who paid for it to building designs that are, at present, underdetailed and uninspired. Questions about how the towers will add to — or detract fro

Kennedys and Pelli's firm unveil plans for three-tower riverfront complex
Chicago Times - about 5 years

 Touting what would be downtown Chicago’s largest new real estate development since the 2008 financial crisis, representatives of the Kennedy family and three financial partners on Tuesday provided the first glimpse of a proposed three-tower office and apartment complex on a historic but long-underutilized site along the Chicago River.   The project, whose cost is pegged at more than $1 billion, calls for a slope-roofed office building of 925 feet, which would be Chicago’s eighth-tallest structure. Another office building and an apartment high-rise would bring the project’s combined square footage to nearly 3 million square feet, more than the biggest skyscraper of the boom years, the 2.6-million-square foot Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower.   The plans, made public at a community meeting called by Ald. Brendan Reilly, 42nd, and attended by more than 300 people, are for the triangular Wolf Point parcel to the southwest of the Merchandise Mart. The Kennedys sold the Merchandise Mart

Wolf Point plan deserves scrutiny; Kennedy family and architect Pelli plan complex that includes 900-foot skyscraper
Chicago Times - about 5 years

 Is it finally Wolf Point’s time?   Exactly 180 years ago, as depicted in an old postcard, pioneers patronized primitive taverns and inns at a patch of land alongside the confluence of the Chicago River’s north and south branches. Native Americans paddled canoes down the river.   Now, after years of failed proposals for the prominent site, the Kennedy family is floating plans for a three-tower complex whose tallest skyscraper would rise 900 feet. That would make it the city’s eighth tallest building--no Willis Tower, but nothing to sneeze at.   No drawings are available. We likely won’t see any until a May 29 community meeting called by Ald. Brendan Reilly, 42nd.   Yet the public has every reason to start analyzing the broad outlines of the development now. The fate of one of the choicest parcels in town hangs in the balance. And the issue is whether the design by New Haven, Conn., architect Cesar Pelli will rise to the level of greatness demanded by the site — or whether the Chicagoans

Early life and education[edit]
Kennedy was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to Robert Francis Kennedy and Ethel (née Skakel) Kennedy, the eighth of their eleven children. He is one of four grandchildren of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy born during the administration of his uncle U.S. President John F. Kennedy. His siblings are:


Kathleen Hartington Kennedy (born 1951)
Joseph Patrick Kennedy II (born 1952)
Robert Francis Kennedy, Jr. (born 1954)
David Anthony Kennedy (1955–1984)
Mary Courtney Kennedy (born 1956)
Michael LeMoyne Kennedy (1958–1997)
Mary Kerry Kennedy (born 1959)
Matthew Maxwell Taylor Kennedy (born 1965)
Douglas Harriman Kennedy (born 1967)
Rory Elizabeth Katherine Kennedy (born 1968)


He grew up at his family home, Hickory Hill, in McLean, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C., and attended the Our Lady of Victory Catholic School in McLean through the eighth grade.[5] He transferred to Georgetown Preparatory School in North Bethesda, Maryland, also a suburb of Washington, and graduated in 1982. While in high school, he volunteered at a home for runaway youth.
Kennedy graduated from Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1986.[6]
In 1994, he graduated with a master of business administration degree from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.
Career[edit]
Kennedy is chairman of the Kennedy family investment firm Joseph P Kennedy Enterprises, Inc.[7] He is treasurer of the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation, he was on the Executive Committee for the Chicago Community Trust, and he has been a board member of the Catholic Theological Union, Interface, Inc. and Knoll Inc.[1][8] He is a member of the mutual fund board of trustees for Ariel Investments.[9]
Kennedy moved from Boston to Decatur to work for Archer Daniels Midland in the 80's, and has spent his life working around issues of hunger, whether as the chairman of the Greater Chicago Food Depository, or now helping to run the non-profit he and his wife founded, Top Box Foods.[10]
Kennedy was the president of Merchandise Mart Properties in Chicago, Illinois, from 2000 until 2012. The property was originally owned by the Kennedy family until it was sold to Vornado Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust. The Merchandise Mart, one of the properties of Merchandise Mart Properties, is the largest commercial building in the world, serving as both a luxury wholesale design center and one of the leading international business locations in Chicago. The Mart spans two city blocks and rises twenty-five stories for a total of 4.2 million square feet (390,000 square metres) Three million people come through the Mart each year to visit its retail shops, permanent showrooms, and office space as well as attend the numerous trade, consumer and community events hosted there.
Kennedy also served as Chairman of the board at the University of Illinois.[11]
Top Box Foods[edit]
In May 2012, Kennedy started the Chicago-based non-profit Top Box Foods. The organization was created as a way to get discounted groceries to families who live in areas that either lack grocery stores or have an abundance of fast food. Kennedy initially invested $150,000 to get Top Box started, and subsequently designed the organization to be self-sustaining.
Top Box as an organization purchases food, boxes it in various combinations and delivers it monthly to churches and organizations in mostly low-income neighborhoods. The food items in the box change from month to month and include a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, meats, and frozen meals, with box prices ranging from $19 to $39. The boxes can be ordered online or through the organizations where the boxes are delivered. These organizations, otherwise known as Top Box "host sites," range from small neighborhood churches with a few dozen families to some of the Chicago's largest, including Trinity United Church of Christ and Salem Baptist Church.
Personal life[edit]
Family[edit]
Kennedy met Sheila Sinclair-Berner (born December 4, 1962), an Illinois native, while attending Boston College. After graduating from college in 1986, Kennedy moved to Decatur, Illinois, and married in 1987.[12] The couple had four children, Katherine "Kate" Berner Kennedy (b.Oct 4 1990), Christopher George "Chris" Kennedy, Jr. (b.Jun 15 1992), Sarah Louise Kennedy (b. Sep 26 1994), Clare Rose Kennedy (b.Nov 3 1998), whom they are raising in the Chicago suburb of Kenilworth. His wife earned a law degree from Northwestern University and practiced at Sidley & Austin[citation needed] in Chicago before taking time off to take care of their children.
Political career[edit]




Kennedy attending Chicago's Pride Parade.


Kennedy's political activism began at an early age, and in 1979 and 1980 he worked on his uncle U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy's bid for the 1980 Democratic Party's nomination for U.S. President. He was also treasurer of the campaign committee for his brother Joseph's reelection to the U.S. House in 1988. Over the years he has organized numerous fundraising events in Chicago for his uncle Ted, his sister Kathleen, his brother Joseph and his cousin Mark Shriver.
The National Journal once quoted Kennedy as saying, "I have a lot to keep up with: a brother who might run for Congress, a sister and a brother considering races for governor, a cousin who might run for Congress, another in Congress, an uncle in the Senate and a cousin-in-law, Arnold [Schwarzennegger], who is thinking of running for governor."[13]
Beyond his family, Kennedy has served in a variety of capacities for numerous political campaigns, including hosting a fundraiser for Barack Obama in his bid for U.S. Senate.[citation needed]
In August 2009, after considering a run for the U.S. Senate,[14] as did many others, Kennedy decided not to run.[15] Also in August 2009, on the day after his uncle Ted's death on August 25, 2009, Kennedy was appointed to the University of Illinois board of trustees by Democratic Illinois Governor Pat Quinn.[16] On September 10, 2009, Kennedy was elected by the trustees as their chairman.[17]
Prior to February 8, 2017, when Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic Nomination for Illinois Governor in 2018,[18] he had never run for any elective office.[16]
Kennedy during his campaign for governor advocated for “a property tax system that can’t be abused by the wealthy and insiders” in a fundraising email.[19] House Speaker Mike Madigan owns a property tax law firm, and Kennedy retained the services of that firm.[20] Kennedy served as the president of MMPI (Merchandise Mart Properties, Inc.) from 2000 to 2011. Madigan's property tax law firm got MMPI more than $133,000 in property tax refunds, according to checks that the Cook County Treasurer's office sent out in 2009.[20] Kennedy criticized one of his fellow Democratic gubernatorial candidates, J.B. Pritzker, for getting a large property tax reduction on a Gold Coast mansion.[21] “It’s an inherently corruptible system and we ought to reject it,” Kennedy said to reporters in reference to Pritzker’s property taxes.[22] "The Cook County property tax appeals business is notorious for pricing political connections at a premium," wrote the Illinois Policy Institute.[23]
In June 2017, Kennedy was endorsed by Congressman Bobby Rush.[24]
Kennedy called for an open primary in the 2018 gubernatorial race, urging the Cook County Democratic party not to throw their weight behind any other candidate, instead allowing for voters to vet all the candidates in the race.[25]
Business and economic involvement[edit]
He is on the board of trustees of the mutual funds managed by Ariel Investments,[26] a Chicago-based investment-management firm.
From 1997-1999, Kennedy served as chairman of the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau, a sales-and-marketing organization promoting Chicago to the tourism and convention industries. Under Kennedy's chairmanship, the bureau retained and expanded Chicago's event-and-convention industry.[citation needed]
Since 2000, Kennedy has been a member of the City Club of Chicago, a group that brings together civic and cultural leaders to discuss and debate issues affecting the Chicago area.
Since 2005, he has been a member of the Commercial Club of Chicago, a group that brings together the city's business, educational, and cultural leaders on projects to improve central industries and create new economic opportunities.
Other civic involvement[edit]

Since 1996, he has been a member of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, a nonpartisan group that seeks to impact discourse on global issues through leadership, education, and policy.
Since 1996, Kennedy has been on the board of directors at The Irish Fellowship Club,[27] a Chicago-based group dedicated to preserving and promoting Irish heritage.
From 2006 until the Spring of 2013, he served on the board of directors of Catholic Theological Union, the largest Roman Catholic graduate school of theology and ministry in the U.S.[28]
Greater Chicago Food Depository is a nonprofit food distribution and training center providing food for hungry people while striving to end hunger throughout Cook County, Illinois. It also offers education programs providing the knowledge and tools needed to break the poverty cycle.
El Valor[29] is a nonprofit group seeking to enrich the local community by empowering the underserved, disenfranchised, and disabled while creating a sense of unity among all community members.
Heartland Alliance[30] is a human-rights-advocacy group providing housing, healthcare, economic security, and legal protection for low-income citizens.
Governor Quinn appointed Kennedy to the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois in September 2009. He served in that role until his gubernatorial appointment expired in January 2015.
He served as a Member of the Executive Committee of the Chicago Community Trust until January 2015.
He served as the Lund-Gill Chair in the Rosary College of Arts and Sciences at Dominican University (Illinois).[31]
He is the chairman of the board of Innovation Illinois, a progressive 501(c)(4) non-profit advocacy group formed in April 2015.

Residential development[edit]
As Chairman of Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises, Inc., Kennedy is responsible for the development of the Kennedy family real estate holdings in Chicago known as Wolf Point, Chicago. The Wolf Point development site represents a billion-dollar commitment to the downtown core, and the site is zoned for construction of a residential apartment building, a self-park garage, and two additional high-rise buildings.
Kennedy also is a partner in Sudbury Station LLC, a development entity proposing a 250-unit luxury rental housing development with a state mandated minimum affordable housing set aside in Sudbury, Massachusetts, designed to meet local housing needs for seniors and the working class community. Proposed on a 39-acre parcel zoned residential near the Historic District of Sudbury, the Village at Sudbury Station would satisfy the Massachusetts affordable housing mandate for Sudbury, would be located close to schools, parks, churches and public safety facilities, and would contribute significant additional tax revenue to the town.[32][33] The project has received widespread criticism from town officials and residents. Residents voted unamiously to hire a special counsel to stop the development, which violates over thirty local zoning ordinances.[34][35]

Early life and education[edit]
Kennedy was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to Robert Francis Kennedy and Ethel (née Skakel) Kennedy, the eighth of their eleven children. He is one of four grandchildren of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy born during the administration of his uncle U.S. President John F. Kennedy. His siblings are:


Kathleen Hartington Kennedy (born 1951)
Joseph Patrick Kennedy II (born 1952)
Robert Francis Kennedy, Jr. (born 1954)
David Anthony Kennedy (1955–1984)
Mary Courtney Kennedy (born 1956)
Michael LeMoyne Kennedy (1958–1997)
Mary Kerry Kennedy (born 1959)
Matthew Maxwell Taylor Kennedy (born 1965)
Douglas Harriman Kennedy (born 1967)
Rory Elizabeth Katherine Kennedy (born 1968)


He grew up at his family home, Hickory Hill, in McLean, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C., and attended the Our Lady of Victory Catholic School in McLean through the eighth grade.[5] He transferred to Georgetown Preparatory School in North Bethesda, Maryland, also a suburb of Washington, and graduated in 1982. While in high school, he volunteered at a home for runaway youth.
Kennedy graduated from Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1986.[6]
In 1994, he graduated with a master of business administration degree from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.
Career[edit]
Kennedy is chairman of the Kennedy family investment firm Joseph P Kennedy Enterprises, Inc.[7] He is treasurer of the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation, he was on the Executive Committee for the Chicago Community Trust, and he has been a board member of the Catholic Theological Union, Interface, Inc. and Knoll Inc.[1][8] He is a member of the mutual fund board of trustees for Ariel Investments.[9]
Kennedy moved from Boston to Decatur to work for Archer Daniels Midland in the 80's, and has spent his life working around issues of hunger, whether as the chairman of the Greater Chicago Food Depository, or now helping to run the non-profit he and his wife founded, Top Box Foods.[10]
Kennedy was the president of Merchandise Mart Properties in Chicago, Illinois, from 2000 until 2012. The property was originally owned by the Kennedy family until it was sold to Vornado Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust. The Merchandise Mart, one of the properties of Merchandise Mart Properties, is the largest commercial building in the world, serving as both a luxury wholesale design center and one of the leading international business locations in Chicago. The Mart spans two city blocks and rises twenty-five stories for a total of 4.2 million square feet (390,000 square metres) Three million people come through the Mart each year to visit its retail shops, permanent showrooms, and office space as well as attend the numerous trade, consumer and community events hosted there.
Kennedy also served as Chairman of the board at the University of Illinois.[11]
Top Box Foods[edit]
In May 2012, Kennedy started the Chicago-based non-profit Top Box Foods. The organization was created as a way to get discounted groceries to families who live in areas that either lack grocery stores or have an abundance of fast food. Kennedy initially invested $150,000 to get Top Box started, and subsequently designed the organization to be self-sustaining.
Top Box as an organization purchases food, boxes it in various combinations and delivers it monthly to churches and organizations in mostly low-income neighborhoods. The food items in the box change from month to month and include a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, meats, and frozen meals, with box prices ranging from $19 to $39. The boxes can be ordered online or through the organizations where the boxes are delivered. These organizations, otherwise known as Top Box "host sites," range from small neighborhood churches with a few dozen families to some of the Chicago's largest, including Trinity United Church of Christ and Salem Baptist Church.
Personal life[edit]
Family[edit]
Kennedy met Sheila Sinclair-Berner (born December 4, 1962), an Illinois native, while attending Boston College. After graduating from college in 1986, Kennedy moved to Decatur, Illinois, and married in 1987.[12] The couple had four children, Katherine "Kate" Berner Kennedy (b.Oct 4 1990), Christopher George "Chris" Kennedy, Jr. (b.Jun 15 1992), Sarah Louise Kennedy (b. Sep 26 1994), Clare Rose Kennedy (b.Nov 3 1998), whom they are raising in the Chicago suburb of Kenilworth. His wife earned a law degree from Northwestern University and practiced at Sidley & Austin[citation needed] in Chicago before taking time off to take care of their children.
Political career[edit]




Kennedy attending Chicago's Pride Parade.


Kennedy's political activism began at an early age, and in 1979 and 1980 he worked on his uncle U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy's bid for the 1980 Democratic Party's nomination for U.S. President. He was also treasurer of the campaign committee for his brother Joseph's reelection to the U.S. House in 1988. Over the years he has organized numerous fundraising events in Chicago for his uncle Ted, his sister Kathleen, his brother Joseph and his cousin Mark Shriver.
The National Journal once quoted Kennedy as saying, "I have a lot to keep up with: a brother who might run for Congress, a sister and a brother considering races for governor, a cousin who might run for Congress, another in Congress, an uncle in the Senate and a cousin-in-law, Arnold [Schwarzennegger], who is thinking of running for governor."[13]
Beyond his family, Kennedy has served in a variety of capacities for numerous political campaigns, including hosting a fundraiser for Barack Obama in his bid for U.S. Senate.[citation needed]
In August 2009, after considering a run for the U.S. Senate,[14] as did many others, Kennedy decided not to run.[15] Also in August 2009, on the day after his uncle Ted's death on August 25, 2009, Kennedy was appointed to the University of Illinois board of trustees by Democratic Illinois Governor Pat Quinn.[16] On September 10, 2009, Kennedy was elected by the trustees as their chairman.[17]
Prior to February 8, 2017, when Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic Nomination for Illinois Governor in 2018,[18] he had never run for any elective office.[16]
Kennedy during his campaign for governor advocated for “a property tax system that can’t be abused by the wealthy and insiders” in a fundraising email.[19] House Speaker Mike Madigan owns a property tax law firm, and Kennedy retained the services of that firm.[20] Kennedy served as the president of MMPI (Merchandise Mart Properties, Inc.) from 2000 to 2011. Madigan's property tax law firm got MMPI more than $133,000 in property tax refunds, according to checks that the Cook County Treasurer's office sent out in 2009.[20] Kennedy criticized one of his fellow Democratic gubernatorial candidates, J.B. Pritzker, for getting a large property tax reduction on a Gold Coast mansion.[21] “It’s an inherently corruptible system and we ought to reject it,” Kennedy said to reporters in reference to Pritzker’s property taxes.[22] "The Cook County property tax appeals business is notorious for pricing political connections at a premium," wrote the Illinois Policy Institute.[23]
In June 2017, Kennedy was endorsed by Congressman Bobby Rush.[24]
Kennedy called for an open primary in the 2018 gubernatorial race, urging the Cook County Democratic party not to throw their weight behind any other candidate, instead allowing for voters to vet all the candidates in the race.[25]
Business and economic involvement[edit]
He is on the board of trustees of the mutual funds managed by Ariel Investments,[26] a Chicago-based investment-management firm.
From 1997-1999, Kennedy served as chairman of the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau, a sales-and-marketing organization promoting Chicago to the tourism and convention industries. Under Kennedy's chairmanship, the bureau retained and expanded Chicago's event-and-convention industry.[citation needed]
Since 2000, Kennedy has been a member of the City Club of Chicago, a group that brings together civic and cultural leaders to discuss and debate issues affecting the Chicago area.
Since 2005, he has been a member of the Commercial Club of Chicago, a group that brings together the city's business, educational, and cultural leaders on projects to improve central industries and create new economic opportunities.
Other civic involvement[edit]

Since 1996, he has been a member of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, a nonpartisan group that seeks to impact discourse on global issues through leadership, education, and policy.
Since 1996, Kennedy has been on the board of directors at The Irish Fellowship Club,[27] a Chicago-based group dedicated to preserving and promoting Irish heritage.
From 2006 until the Spring of 2013, he served on the board of directors of Catholic Theological Union, the largest Roman Catholic graduate school of theology and ministry in the U.S.[28]
Greater Chicago Food Depository is a nonprofit food distribution and training center providing food for hungry people while striving to end hunger throughout Cook County, Illinois. It also offers education programs providing the knowledge and tools needed to break the poverty cycle.
El Valor[29] is a nonprofit group seeking to enrich the local community by empowering the underserved, disenfranchised, and disabled while creating a sense of unity among all community members.
Heartland Alliance[30] is a human-rights-advocacy group providing housing, healthcare, economic security, and legal protection for low-income citizens.
Governor Quinn appointed Kennedy to the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois in September 2009. He served in that role until his gubernatorial appointment expired in January 2015.
He served as a Member of the Executive Committee of the Chicago Community Trust until January 2015.
He served as the Lund-Gill Chair in the Rosary College of Arts and Sciences at Dominican University (Illinois).[31]
He is the chairman of the board of Innovation Illinois, a progressive 501(c)(4) non-profit advocacy group formed in April 2015.

Residential development[edit]
As Chairman of Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises, Inc., Kennedy is responsible for the development of the Kennedy family real estate holdings in Chicago known as Wolf Point, Chicago. The Wolf Point development site represents a billion-dollar commitment to the downtown core, and the site is zoned for construction of a residential apartment building, a self-park garage, and two additional high-rise buildings.
Kennedy also is a partner in Sudbury Station LLC, a development entity proposing a 250-unit luxury rental housing development with a state mandated minimum affordable housing set aside in Sudbury, Massachusetts, designed to meet local housing needs for seniors and the working class community. Proposed on a 39-acre parcel zoned residential near the Historic District of Sudbury, the Village at Sudbury Station would satisfy the Massachusetts affordable housing mandate for Sudbury, would be located close to schools, parks, churches and public safety facilities, and would contribute significant additional tax revenue to the town.[32][33] The project has received widespread criticism from town officials and residents. Residents voted unamiously to hire a special counsel to stop the development, which violates over thirty local zoning ordinances.[34][35]

Early life and education[edit]
Kennedy was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to Robert Francis Kennedy and Ethel (née Skakel) Kennedy, the eighth of their eleven children. He is one of four grandchildren of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy born during the administration of his uncle U.S. President John F. Kennedy. His siblings are:


Kathleen Hartington Kennedy (born 1951)
Joseph Patrick Kennedy II (born 1952)
Robert Francis Kennedy, Jr. (born 1954)
David Anthony Kennedy (1955–1984)
Mary Courtney Kennedy (born 1956)
Michael LeMoyne Kennedy (1958–1997)
Mary Kerry Kennedy (born 1959)
Matthew Maxwell Taylor Kennedy (born 1965)
Douglas Harriman Kennedy (born 1967)
Rory Elizabeth Katherine Kennedy (born 1968)


He grew up at his family home, Hickory Hill, in McLean, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C., and attended the Our Lady of Victory Catholic School in McLean through the eighth grade.[5] He transferred to Georgetown Preparatory School in North Bethesda, Maryland, also a suburb of Washington, and graduated in 1982. While in high school, he volunteered at a home for runaway youth.
Kennedy graduated from Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1986.[6]
In 1994, he graduated with a master of business administration degree from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.
Career[edit]
Kennedy is chairman of the Kennedy family investment firm Joseph P Kennedy Enterprises, Inc.[7] He is treasurer of the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation, he was on the Executive Committee for the Chicago Community Trust, and he has been a board member of the Catholic Theological Union, Interface, Inc. and Knoll Inc.[1][8] He is a member of the mutual fund board of trustees for Ariel Investments.[9]
Kennedy moved from Boston to Decatur to work for Archer Daniels Midland in the 80's, and has spent his life working around issues of hunger, whether as the chairman of the Greater Chicago Food Depository, or now helping to run the non-profit he and his wife founded, Top Box Foods.[10]
Kennedy was the president of Merchandise Mart Properties in Chicago, Illinois, from 2000 until 2012. The property was originally owned by the Kennedy family until it was sold to Vornado Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust. The Merchandise Mart, one of the properties of Merchandise Mart Properties, is the largest commercial building in the world, serving as both a luxury wholesale design center and one of the leading international business locations in Chicago. The Mart spans two city blocks and rises twenty-five stories for a total of 4.2 million square feet (390,000 square metres) Three million people come through the Mart each year to visit its retail shops, permanent showrooms, and office space as well as attend the numerous trade, consumer and community events hosted there.
Kennedy also served as Chairman of the board at the University of Illinois.[11]
Top Box Foods[edit]
In May 2012, Kennedy started the Chicago-based non-profit Top Box Foods. The organization was created as a way to get discounted groceries to families who live in areas that either lack grocery stores or have an abundance of fast food. Kennedy initially invested $150,000 to get Top Box started, and subsequently designed the organization to be self-sustaining.
Top Box as an organization purchases food, boxes it in various combinations and delivers it monthly to churches and organizations in mostly low-income neighborhoods. The food items in the box change from month to month and include a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, meats, and frozen meals, with box prices ranging from $19 to $39. The boxes can be ordered online or through the organizations where the boxes are delivered. These organizations, otherwise known as Top Box "host sites," range from small neighborhood churches with a few dozen families to some of the Chicago's largest, including Trinity United Church of Christ and Salem Baptist Church.
Personal life[edit]
Family[edit]
Kennedy met Sheila Sinclair-Berner (born December 4, 1962), an Illinois native, while attending Boston College. After graduating from college in 1986, Kennedy moved to Decatur, Illinois, and married in 1987.[12] The couple had four children, Katherine "Kate" Berner Kennedy (b.Oct 4 1990), Christopher George "Chris" Kennedy, Jr. (b.Jun 15 1992), Sarah Louise Kennedy (b. Sep 26 1994), Clare Rose Kennedy (b.Nov 3 1998), whom they are raising in the Chicago suburb of Kenilworth. His wife earned a law degree from Northwestern University and practiced at Sidley & Austin[citation needed] in Chicago before taking time off to take care of their children.
Political career[edit]




Kennedy attending Chicago's Pride Parade.


Kennedy's political activism began at an early age, and in 1979 and 1980 he worked on his uncle U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy's bid for the 1980 Democratic Party's nomination for U.S. President. He was also treasurer of the campaign committee for his brother Joseph's reelection to the U.S. House in 1988. Over the years he has organized numerous fundraising events in Chicago for his uncle Ted, his sister Kathleen, his brother Joseph and his cousin Mark Shriver.
The National Journal once quoted Kennedy as saying, "I have a lot to keep up with: a brother who might run for Congress, a sister and a brother considering races for governor, a cousin who might run for Congress, another in Congress, an uncle in the Senate and a cousin-in-law, Arnold [Schwarzennegger], who is thinking of running for governor."[13]
Beyond his family, Kennedy has served in a variety of capacities for numerous political campaigns, including hosting a fundraiser for Barack Obama in his bid for U.S. Senate.[citation needed]
In August 2009, after considering a run for the U.S. Senate,[14] as did many others, Kennedy decided not to run.[15] Also in August 2009, on the day after his uncle Ted's death on August 25, 2009, Kennedy was appointed to the University of Illinois board of trustees by Democratic Illinois Governor Pat Quinn.[16] On September 10, 2009, Kennedy was elected by the trustees as their chairman.[17]
Prior to February 8, 2017, when Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic Nomination for Illinois Governor in 2018,[18] he had never run for any elective office.[16]
Kennedy during his campaign for governor advocated for “a property tax system that can’t be abused by the wealthy and insiders” in a fundraising email.[19] House Speaker Mike Madigan owns a property tax law firm, and Kennedy retained the services of that firm.[20] Kennedy served as the president of MMPI (Merchandise Mart Properties, Inc.) from 2000 to 2011. Madigan's property tax law firm got MMPI more than $133,000 in property tax refunds, according to checks that the Cook County Treasurer's office sent out in 2009.[20] Kennedy criticized one of his fellow Democratic gubernatorial candidates, J.B. Pritzker, for getting a large property tax reduction on a Gold Coast mansion.[21] “It’s an inherently corruptible system and we ought to reject it,” Kennedy said to reporters in reference to Pritzker’s property taxes.[22] "The Cook County property tax appeals business is notorious for pricing political connections at a premium," wrote the Illinois Policy Institute.[23]
In June 2017, Kennedy was endorsed by Congressman Bobby Rush.[24]
Kennedy called for an open primary in the 2018 gubernatorial race, urging the Cook County Democratic party not to throw their weight behind any other candidate, instead allowing for voters to vet all the candidates in the race.[25]
Business and economic involvement[edit]
He is on the board of trustees of the mutual funds managed by Ariel Investments,[26] a Chicago-based investment-management firm.
From 1997-1999, Kennedy served as chairman of the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau, a sales-and-marketing organization promoting Chicago to the tourism and convention industries. Under Kennedy's chairmanship, the bureau retained and expanded Chicago's event-and-convention industry.[citation needed]
Since 2000, Kennedy has been a member of the City Club of Chicago, a group that brings together civic and cultural leaders to discuss and debate issues affecting the Chicago area.
Since 2005, he has been a member of the Commercial Club of Chicago, a group that brings together the city's business, educational, and cultural leaders on projects to improve central industries and create new economic opportunities.
Other civic involvement[edit]

Since 1996, he has been a member of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, a nonpartisan group that seeks to impact discourse on global issues through leadership, education, and policy.
Since 1996, Kennedy has been on the board of directors at The Irish Fellowship Club,[27] a Chicago-based group dedicated to preserving and promoting Irish heritage.
From 2006 until the Spring of 2013, he served on the board of directors of Catholic Theological Union, the largest Roman Catholic graduate school of theology and ministry in the U.S.[28]
Greater Chicago Food Depository is a nonprofit food distribution and training center providing food for hungry people while striving to end hunger throughout Cook County, Illinois. It also offers education programs providing the knowledge and tools needed to break the poverty cycle.
El Valor[29] is a nonprofit group seeking to enrich the local community by empowering the underserved, disenfranchised, and disabled while creating a sense of unity among all community members.
Heartland Alliance[30] is a human-rights-advocacy group providing housing, healthcare, economic security, and legal protection for low-income citizens.
Governor Quinn appointed Kennedy to the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois in September 2009. He served in that role until his gubernatorial appointment expired in January 2015.
He served as a Member of the Executive Committee of the Chicago Community Trust until January 2015.
He served as the Lund-Gill Chair in the Rosary College of Arts and Sciences at Dominican University (Illinois).[31]
He is the chairman of the board of Innovation Illinois, a progressive 501(c)(4) non-profit advocacy group formed in April 2015.

Residential development[edit]
As Chairman of Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises, Inc., Kennedy is responsible for the development of the Kennedy family real estate holdings in Chicago known as Wolf Point, Chicago. The Wolf Point development site represents a billion-dollar commitment to the downtown core, and the site is zoned for construction of a residential apartment building, a self-park garage, and two additional high-rise buildings.
Kennedy also is a partner in Sudbury Station LLC, a development entity proposing a 250-unit luxury rental housing development with a state mandated minimum affordable housing set aside in Sudbury, Massachusetts, designed to meet local housing needs for seniors and the working class community. Proposed on a 39-acre parcel zoned residential near the Historic District of Sudbury, the Village at Sudbury Station would satisfy the Massachusetts affordable housing mandate for Sudbury, would be located close to schools, parks, churches and public safety facilities, and would contribute significant additional tax revenue to the town.[32][33] The project has received widespread criticism from town officials and residents. Residents voted unamiously to hire a special counsel to stop the development, which violates over thirty local zoning ordinances.[34][35]

Kennedy moved from Boston to Decatur to work for Archer Daniels Midland in the 80's, and has spent his life working around issues of hunger, whether as the chairman of the Greater Chicago Food Depository, or now helping to run the non-profit he and his wife founded, Top Box Foods.[10]
Kennedy was the president of Merchandise Mart Properties in Chicago, Illinois, from 2000 until 2012. The property was originally owned by the Kennedy family until it was sold to Vornado Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust. The Merchandise Mart, one of the properties of Merchandise Mart Properties, is the largest commercial building in the world, serving as both a luxury wholesale design center and one of the leading international business locations in Chicago. The Mart spans two city blocks and rises twenty-five stories for a total of 4.2 million square feet (390,000 square metres) Three million people come through the Mart each year to visit its retail shops, permanent showrooms, and office space as well as attend the numerous trade, consumer and community events hosted there.
Kennedy also served as Chairman of the board at the University of Illinois.[11]
Top Box Foods[edit]
In May 2012, Kennedy started the Chicago-based non-profit Top Box Foods. The organization was created as a way to get discounted groceries to families who live in areas that either lack grocery stores or have an abundance of fast food. Kennedy initially invested $150,000 to get Top Box started, and subsequently designed the organization to be self-sustaining.
Top Box as an organization purchases food, boxes it in various combinations and delivers it monthly to churches and organizations in mostly low-income neighborhoods. The food items in the box change from month to month and include a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, meats, and frozen meals, with box prices ranging from $19 to $39. The boxes can be ordered online or through the organizations where the boxes are delivered. These organizations, otherwise known as Top Box "host sites," range from small neighborhood churches with a few dozen families to some of the Chicago's largest, including Trinity United Church of Christ and Salem Baptist Church.
Personal life[edit]
Family[edit]
Kennedy met Sheila Sinclair-Berner (born December 4, 1962), an Illinois native, while attending Boston College. After graduating from college in 1986, Kennedy moved to Decatur, Illinois, and married in 1987.[12] The couple had four children, Katherine "Kate" Berner Kennedy (b.Oct 4 1990), Christopher George "Chris" Kennedy, Jr. (b.Jun 15 1992), Sarah Louise Kennedy (b. Sep 26 1994), Clare Rose Kennedy (b.Nov 3 1998), whom they are raising in the Chicago suburb of Kenilworth. His wife earned a law degree from Northwestern University and practiced at Sidley & Austin[citation needed] in Chicago before taking time off to take care of their children.
Political career[edit]




Kennedy attending Chicago's Pride Parade.


Kennedy's political activism began at an early age, and in 1979 and 1980 he worked on his uncle U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy's bid for the 1980 Democratic Party's nomination for U.S. President. He was also treasurer of the campaign committee for his brother Joseph's reelection to the U.S. House in 1988. Over the years he has organized numerous fundraising events in Chicago for his uncle Ted, his sister Kathleen, his brother Joseph and his cousin Mark Shriver.
The National Journal once quoted Kennedy as saying, "I have a lot to keep up with: a brother who might run for Congress, a sister and a brother considering races for governor, a cousin who might run for Congress, another in Congress, an uncle in the Senate and a cousin-in-law, Arnold [Schwarzennegger], who is thinking of running for governor."[13]
Beyond his family, Kennedy has served in a variety of capacities for numerous political campaigns, including hosting a fundraiser for Barack Obama in his bid for U.S. Senate.[citation needed]
In August 2009, after considering a run for the U.S. Senate,[14] as did many others, Kennedy decided not to run.[15] Also in August 2009, on the day after his uncle Ted's death on August 25, 2009, Kennedy was appointed to the University of Illinois board of trustees by Democratic Illinois Governor Pat Quinn.[16] On September 10, 2009, Kennedy was elected by the trustees as their chairman.[17]
Prior to February 8, 2017, when Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic Nomination for Illinois Governor in 2018,[18] he had never run for any elective office.[16]
Kennedy during his campaign for governor advocated for “a property tax system that can’t be abused by the wealthy and insiders” in a fundraising email.[19] House Speaker Mike Madigan owns a property tax law firm, and Kennedy retained the services of that firm.[20] Kennedy served as the president of MMPI (Merchandise Mart Properties, Inc.) from 2000 to 2011. Madigan's property tax law firm got MMPI more than $133,000 in property tax refunds, according to checks that the Cook County Treasurer's office sent out in 2009.[20] Kennedy criticized one of his fellow Democratic gubernatorial candidates, J.B. Pritzker, for getting a large property tax reduction on a Gold Coast mansion.[21] “It’s an inherently corruptible system and we ought to reject it,” Kennedy said to reporters in reference to Pritzker’s property taxes.[22] "The Cook County property tax appeals business is notorious for pricing political connections at a premium," wrote the Illinois Policy Institute.[23]
In June 2017, Kennedy was endorsed by Congressman Bobby Rush.[24]
Kennedy called for an open primary in the 2018 gubernatorial race, urging the Cook County Democratic party not to throw their weight behind any other candidate, instead allowing for voters to vet all the candidates in the race.[25]
Business and economic involvement[edit]
He is on the board of trustees of the mutual funds managed by Ariel Investments,[26] a Chicago-based investment-management firm.
From 1997-1999, Kennedy served as chairman of the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau, a sales-and-marketing organization promoting Chicago to the tourism and convention industries. Under Kennedy's chairmanship, the bureau retained and expanded Chicago's event-and-convention industry.[citation needed]
Since 2000, Kennedy has been a member of the City Club of Chicago, a group that brings together civic and cultural leaders to discuss and debate issues affecting the Chicago area.
Since 2005, he has been a member of the Commercial Club of Chicago, a group that brings together the city's business, educational, and cultural leaders on projects to improve central industries and create new economic opportunities.
Other civic involvement[edit]

Since 1996, he has been a member of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, a nonpartisan group that seeks to impact discourse on global issues through leadership, education, and policy.
Since 1996, Kennedy has been on the board of directors at The Irish Fellowship Club,[27] a Chicago-based group dedicated to preserving and promoting Irish heritage.
From 2006 until the Spring of 2013, he served on the board of directors of Catholic Theological Union, the largest Roman Catholic graduate school of theology and ministry in the U.S.[28]
Greater Chicago Food Depository is a nonprofit food distribution and training center providing food for hungry people while striving to end hunger throughout Cook County, Illinois. It also offers education programs providing the knowledge and tools needed to break the poverty cycle.
El Valor[29] is a nonprofit group seeking to enrich the local community by empowering the underserved, disenfranchised, and disabled while creating a sense of unity among all community members.
Heartland Alliance[30] is a human-rights-advocacy group providing housing, healthcare, economic security, and legal protection for low-income citizens.
Governor Quinn appointed Kennedy to the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois in September 2009. He served in that role until his gubernatorial appointment expired in January 2015.
He served as a Member of the Executive Committee of the Chicago Community Trust until January 2015.
He served as the Lund-Gill Chair in the Rosary College of Arts and Sciences at Dominican University (Illinois).[31]
He is the chairman of the board of Innovation Illinois, a progressive 501(c)(4) non-profit advocacy group formed in April 2015.

Residential development[edit]
As Chairman of Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises, Inc., Kennedy is responsible for the development of the Kennedy family real estate holdings in Chicago known as Wolf Point, Chicago. The Wolf Point development site represents a billion-dollar commitment to the downtown core, and the site is zoned for construction of a residential apartment building, a self-park garage, and two additional high-rise buildings.
Kennedy also is a partner in Sudbury Station LLC, a development entity proposing a 250-unit luxury rental housing development with a state mandated minimum affordable housing set aside in Sudbury, Massachusetts, designed to meet local housing needs for seniors and the working class community. Proposed on a 39-acre parcel zoned residential near the Historic District of Sudbury, the Village at Sudbury Station would satisfy the Massachusetts affordable housing mandate for Sudbury, would be located close to schools, parks, churches and public safety facilities, and would contribute significant additional tax revenue to the town.[32][33] The project has received widespread criticism from town officials and residents. Residents voted unamiously to hire a special counsel to stop the development, which violates over thirty local zoning ordinances.[34][35]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
