Presenter 



















Starting with ClariCare’s innovative transcription database, Presenter pulls case presentations from the PMS and maps to educational content.  Presenter also ties to financial information, so complex and phased treatment plans are easy to understand.  All of this made available in the office in our elegant chairside app, and at home through a remote portal for ease of access whenever a patient wants that access.





Bridge the Patient Engagement Gap
ClariCare’s Presenter is a revolutionary case presentation app, giving your staff tools to comprehensively diagnose and engage with patients – while providing patients with clinical and financial transparency.  Case Presentation is often difficult to explain, potentially costly, and involve extended appointments that induce anxiety in even the most confident patients.
COMING SOON!





Personalized and Targeted
Ensure your patients get the most appropriate care by fully informing them about their conditions with a consistent and professional approach.   Our bet is a more educated, informed patient is more likely to get the work done – which boosts your top line revenues and keeps your patients compliant with their care plan.





Boost Case Acceptance
By presenting information across various media formats – 3D dentitions, videos, slides (in the office and remotely) – patients can review the information in ways most comfortable to them and their decision-making style. Presenter also allows for consistency in presentation, removing the burden and perception of selling from you and your team to focus on patient care and satisfaction.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
