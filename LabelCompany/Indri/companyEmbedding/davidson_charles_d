Charles D. Davidson

President, CEO, Chairman 
Noble Energy Inc.
BSChE ’72

 For his outstanding accomplishments and leadership in the oil and gas industry,
    the College of Engineering is proud to present the Distinguished Engineering
    Alumnus Award to Charles D. Davidson.
Noble Aspirations
“I knew I wanted to become a chemical engineer in about the eighth grade,” Charles
   Davidson says. “I was attracted to the science of it, but also the engineering
   aspect. Ever since I was a small child, I was either taking something apart
or putting something together.”
 Since that time, Davidson has put together deals that unite his love of science
   with the art of business.
“My whole career has been gas,” Davidson jokes, but what is no
   joke is his track record of moving the business of energy production in new
and innovative ways.
 Davidson has spent over 30 years in the oil and gas business. From 1972 to
   1993, he worked in a number of top executive positions for Atlantic Richfield
   Co. (ARCO). In 1994 he was part of the team that formed Vastar Resources Inc.,
   a company that branched out from ARCO into one of the largest independent
   oil and gas exploration and production companies in the lower 48 states. During
   his time with 
   Vastar, the company was active in more than 100 producing fields, which included
   deep-water exploration off the Gulf of Mexico. Following the merger of ARCO
   (and Vastar) with BP in 2000, Davidson assumed the position of CEO and chairman
   of the board for Noble Energy, a company that has been engaged with the exploration,
production and marketing of oil and gas since 1932.
 Noble Energy is an international player, with operations in locations including
   Argentina, China, Equatorial Guinea, the Mediterranean Sea, the North Sea
   and Ecuador. Under Davidson’s lead, the company doubled its income in
2004 and expanded its operations.
“I guess I’ve always approached business as an opportunity to
   learn new things,” Davidson says, “to help develop organizations
   and people while looking at things from a fairly broad perspective—I
   was always open to trying new things, and so I got an opportunity to do new
things.”
 Stranded Gas
 Davidson’s mother, Hazel Marguerite Terrell, graduated from Purdue in
   1925, and he followed in her footsteps, graduating from Purdue with a bachelor’s
   degree in chemical engineering in 1972. He then traveled to the Lone Star
   State, where he received a master’s degree in management from the University
of Texas at Dallas in 1980.
“The engineering background helps one to understand the technical complexity
   of the projects—what we are physically trying to do,” Davidson
   says. “Then you combine that with management training, which helps one
   understand the business side of it. I enjoyed project management,” Davidson
   says, “and that began to move me away from doing specific engineering
work to projects involving management and working with people.”
 Davidson’s recent forte has been finding reserves of “stranded
   gas”—gas that is too remote or that is extracted in conjunction
   with oil and then not used—and turning these unexploited resources into
   viable assets. His company’s commercial conquests have included a methanol
   plant in Africa, an electrical power plant in Ecuador run by natural gas,
   and the discovery of a gas field in Israel that now provides power to an Israeli
electrical company.
“We have found places in the world where there is no ready market for
   natural gas,” Davidson says, “and we’ve found ways of developing
these markets.”
 At the heart of his management theory, however, is the human touch. “I’ve
   always enjoyed working with people and helping other people in the organization
realize their potential,” Davidson says.
 Serving His Community
 In addition to his success in the business world, Davidson serves on a number
   of industry, academic, and community service organizations. He has memberships
   in the Society of Petroleum Engineers and the American Institute of Chemical
   Engineers, and he is currently serving as chairman of the Independent Petroleum
   Association of America’s Offshore Committee, among others. He also serves
   on the University of Texas at Dallas Advisory Board, and he works with several
   Houston, Texas, community organizations, including the Boy Scouts of America,
   the Society for the Performing Arts, and Spindletop International, an oil
   industry youth charity. In 2002, the University of Texas at Dallas’s
School of Management named Davidson and his wife, Nancy, Distinguished Alumni.
“In my view, we truly believe that alumni are there to continue to support
   our schools long after we leave,” Davidson says. “We all recognize
   that we only pay for a fraction of our education, and without alumni help
I would not have encountered the quality of education I received at Purdue.”
 A Special Congratulations
“I would like to offer my congratulations to the other DEAs that are
      being recognized,” Davidson says. “I am very proud to be a part
   of this esteemed group, and I’m humbled by the honor.”
