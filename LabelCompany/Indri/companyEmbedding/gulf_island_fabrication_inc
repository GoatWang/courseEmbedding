"Gulf Island Fabrication brings world-class, industry-leading experience to the job, and we're thrilled to add them as a partner," said Deepwater Wind CEO Jeffrey Grybowski about the jackets for the first U.S. offshore wind farm, fabricated by Gulf Island Fabrication's LA facility.







In early 2017, Gulf Island Shipyards completed this 300 foot technologically advanced offshore support vessel and is expecting to deliver two 400 foot class multi-purpose service vessels in 2018.  Gulf Island has a long history of delivering quality vessels to the marine service industry including the largest lift boats servicing the Gulf of Mexico.







Gulf Island Fabrication has delivered several of the largest offshore jackets in the world, the most recent achieving completion in 2015. The jacket is the largest fabricated in 21 years, weighing in at 30,000 tons and measuring 1,250 feet in length.







By adding major ship conversions to its already strong new construction and repair capabilities, Gulf Island Fabrication has emerged as the go-to destination for marine fabrication services.







Gulf Island Fabrication and its subsidiaries have fabricated and delivered five (5) deep water hulls with the latest being the first classic spar built in the U.S. This spar weighed in at 12,000 tons and measured 603 feet in length.







Year after year, Dolphin Services continues to be a leader in offshore services and onshore infrastucture projects. As the demands of industry have grown, so have our product and service capabilities.
















































Safety
Gulf Island Fabrication is continually investing in employee training and current technology to maintain the highest quality and safety standards in the industry.





Integrity
The success of an organization is built on the trust of customers, employees and the general public. Year after year, Gulf Island Fabrication continues to operate in a fair and ethical manner.





Quality
We've built our reputation by delivering product and service excellence to clients around the globe. We have the experience, facilities and record of achievement to build your next project.

					Full Description



Gulf Island Fabrication, Inc. (Gulf Island), incorporated on April 27, 1989, is a holding company. The Company, along with its subsidiaries, is a fabricator of steel platforms and other specialized structures for customers in the offshore oil and gas industry. The Company also performs onshore and offshore construction and fabrication services for customers in the marine industry. The Company's primary activity is the fabrication of offshore drilling and production platforms and other steel structures for customers in the oil and gas and marine industries, including jackets and deck sections of fixed production platforms, hull, tendon, and/or deck sections of floating production platforms, such as tension leg platforms (TLPs); Spars; floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) and Minimum Deepwater Operating Concept (MinDoc), piles, wellhead protectors, subsea templates, and various production, compressor, and utility modules. The Company conducts its operations through its subsidiaries, which include Gulf Island, L.L.C.; Gulf Marine Fabricators, L.P.; Gulf Island Marine Fabricators, L.L.C.; Gulf Island Shipyards, L.L.C.; Dolphin Services, L.L.C.; and Dolphin Steel Sales, L.L.C.The Company's common type of fixed platform consists of a jacket (a tubular steel, braced structure extending from the mud line on the seabed to a point above the water surface), which supports the deck structure located above the level of storm waves and is secured with tubular pilings driven deep into the seabed. The deck structure is designed to accommodate multiple functions, including drilling, production, separating, gathering, piping, compression, well support, and crew quartering. The Company's Decks are built either as single structures or in sections and are installed on location on fixed and floating platforms by construction contractors. The composition and quantity of petroleum in the well stream generally determine the size and configuration of the production deck on a processing platform. Deck equipment includes crude oil pumps, oil and gas separators, and gas compressors. The TLPs consist of a deck that sits atop one or more column-shaped hulls, which are positioned on site with vertical tendons running from the hulls to the seabed. The Company fabricates subsea templates used in connection with TLPs. Subsea templates are structures installed on the seabed before development drilling begins.The Company provides interconnect piping services on offshore platforms and inshore steel structures. The Company also contracts with oil and gas companies that have platforms and other structures located in the inland lakes and bays throughout the southeast for various on-site construction and maintenance activities. In addition, it fabricate pressure vessels and large and small packaged skid units and provide various municipal and drainage projects, such as pump stations, levee reinforcement, bulkheads and other levee and drainage projects, to state and local governments. The Company manufactures and repairs various steel marine vessels in the United States, including offshore supply vessels; anchor handling vessels; and lift boats to support the construction and ongoing operation of offshore oil and gas production platforms; tug boats and towboats for towing and pushing barges that support transportation of various types of products and materials; mooring and positioning, dredging assistance, tanker escort, port management, shipping, piloting, coastal flood protection barge gates, inland and offshore barges, and fire-fighting and salvage vessels. The Company also constructs dry docks to lift marine vessels out of the water. Its marine repair activities include steel repair, blasting and painting services, electrical systems repair, machinery and piping system repairs, and propeller, shaft, and rudder reconditioning.Louisiana OperationsThe Company's main fabrication yard is located on the east bank of the Houma Navigation Canal in Houma, Louisiana, approximately 30 miles from the Gulf of Mexico.

The main yard also has approximately 2,800 linear feet of water frontage, which includes approximately 1,500 feet of steel bulkheads that permit load out of heavy structures.Gulf Island's west yard is located across the Houma Navigation Canal from the main yard on approximately 437 acres, and 130 acres of which are developed for fabrication and over 300 acres of which are unimproved land that could be used for expansion.

The 45-foot deep Corpus Christi Ship Channel provides direct and unrestricted access to the Gulf of Mexico, which allows for fabrication or assembly of jacket or other structure in use for the development and production of oil and gas in the Gulf of Mexico.

Gulf Island Fabrication is an American manufacturer of specialized structures and marine vessels used in the energy sector. The company builds offshore oil and gas platforms, ships and also foundations for offshore wind turbines.[1] It also provides maintenance and marine repair services in-shop and out in the field. The company has built some of the largest offshore platforms in the world.[1]
The company's headquarters are located in Houston, Texas and its seven building yards are in Louisiana and Texas. Gulf Island Fabrication and Bechtel are partners.[2] The company was founded by Alden “Doc” Laborde, a World War II Navy commander who later worked the offshore oil and gas industry. In 1985, the company took over a bankrupt rival named Delta Fabrication. The company became publicly listed in 1997. The company offered 2,000,000 shares at $15 per share. With a total offer amount of $30 million.[3] The company had diversified revenue to build ships and expanded by taking over LeeVac Shipyards in the beginning of 2016.[4] The acquisition provided about $112 million incremental contract backlog during the industry downturn.[5]
