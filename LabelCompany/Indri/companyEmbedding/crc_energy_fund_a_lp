CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme

CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme: how it works and advice on managing the CRC as a business opportunity.              
















The CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme (also referred to as the ‘CRC scheme’ or ‘CRC’) is a mandatory carbon emissions reporting and pricing scheme to cover large public and private sector organisations in the UK (excluding state funded schools in England from April 2013), that use more than 6,000MWh per year of electricity and have at least one half-hourly meter settled on the half-hourly electricity market.
The scheme is managed, on behalf of the UK Government's Department of Energy & Climate Change (DECC), by the Environment Agency (in England), by Natural Resources Wales (in Wales), by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (in Scotland), and by the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (in Northern Ireland).  
The scheme is divided into a number of phases, with each phase lasting five years. Currently, the scheme is in its second phase running from April 2014 to March 2019.
The UK government announced in 2016 that the CRC energy efficiency scheme will be abolished following the 2018-19 compliance year.   




How it works
The CRC comprises three primary elements:
1. Emissions reporting requirement
Participants in the CRC need to measure and report their electricity and gas supplies annually, via the online CRC registry following a specific set of measurement rules. The CRC registry then calculates CRC emissions in tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the data submitted for each participant.
The CRC scheme applies to emissions not already covered by Climate Change Agreements (CCAs) and the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).
In addition to reporting their electricity and gas supplies, organisations are required to answer a set of corporate responsibility questions and keep evidence with records of their supplies as well as other relevant information.  
2. A carbon price
The scheme requires participants to buy allowances for every tonne of carbon they emit (relating to electricity and gas), as reported under the scheme.
Participants are required to buy allowances from the Government or, if available, from the secondary market each year to cover their reported emissions. This means that organisations that decrease their emissions can lower their costs under the CRC. A failure to surrender sufficient allowances will result in a financial penalty.
During phase 2 (which started in April 2014), there are two sales of allowances for each compliance year. The first sale at the start of a compliance year is based on predicted emissions at a lower price. The second is a "buy to comply" sale after the end of the compliance year at an expected higher price.
The price of the allowances for the 2014-15 compliance year was set at £15.60 per tonne of CO2 for the forecast sale and £16.40 per tonne of CO2 at the “buy to comply” sale. All future allowance prices will be published on the UK government CRC web pages.
3. Publishing of information on participants' energy use and emissions
The energy use and emissions of all participants are published for each compliance year as part of the Annual Report Publication (ARP), which will also report emissions from previous years for all participants.
Background to the scheme
The sectors targeted by the Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency scheme generate over 10% of UK CO2 emissions, around 55 MtCO2. The CRC Energy Efficiency scheme aims to reduce non-traded carbon emissions by 17 million tonnes by 2027. It supports the UK Government's objective to achieve an 80% reduction in UK carbon emissions by 2050.
The CRC Energy Efficiency scheme, which was called the Carbon Reduction Commitment at the time, was announced by the UK Government in the Energy White Paper (May 2007). The need for an incentive in this sector was originally highlighted by the Carbon Trust, in our report The UK Climate Change Programme: Potential evolution for business and the public sector.
What does it mean for your organisation?
Improving your energy efficiency will save you money and improve your organisation's reputation. The CRC further strengthens the business case for doing this.
Position your organisation for maximum savings
There is a clear financial incentive to perform well in the CRC. You will reduce the number of emissions allowances you need to buy if you cut emissions, putting you at a cost advantage to competitors that have not cut emissions.
Find out how our technical advice and certification services can help your organisation perform well in the CRC and meet mandatory carbon reporting requirements.
An opportunity to enhance your business reputation
As well as the financial benefits of achieving emissions reductions, you will also be better positioned to reap the reputational benefits associated with these reductions. The Carbon Trust can help you to do this, including through the Carbon Trust Standard.

Underlying Securities information represented above is as of 07/26/2017 but will vary with future fluctuations in the market.












Risk ConsiderationsEquity Risk. An investment in a portfolio containing common stocks is subject to certain risks, such as an economic recession and the possible deterioration of either the financial condition of the issuers of the equity securities or the general condition of the stock market.Small-Cap and Mid-Cap Risk. An investment in a portfolio containing small-cap and mid-cap companies is subject to additional risks, as the share prices of small-cap companies and certain mid-cap companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies due to several factors, including limited trading volumes, products, financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.Volatility Risk. The value of the securities held by the trust may be subject to steep declines or increased volatility due to changes in performance or perception of the issuers.
All data used for the sector and style classification comparisons is from 
Bloomberg Finance L.P, which we believe to be reliable, but do not take responsibility 
for its accuracy.

The style and capitalization characteristics used to describe the stocks are designed to help you 
understand how they fit into your overall investment plan.  Due to changes in the value of the stocks 
the characteristics may vary over time.  In general, growth stocks have high relative price-to-book 
ratios while value stocks have low relative price-to-book ratios.  In determining market capitalization 
characteristics, we analyze the market capitalizations of the 3,000 largest stocks in the U.S. (excluding 
foreign securities, ADRs, limited partnerships and regulated investment companies) on a monthly basis. 
Companies with market capitalizations among the largest 10% are considered Large-Cap securities, the next 
20% are considered Mid-Cap securities and the remaining securities are considered Small-Cap securities.

You should carefully consider the trust's investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses before investing. Contact your financial advisor or call First Trust Portfolios, L.P. at 1.800.621.1675 to request a prospectus, which contains this and other information about the trust. Read it carefully before you invest.

This product information does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy securities in any state to any person to whom it is not lawful to make such an offer.  Sales of any of these securities must include prospectus delivery and the services of a retail broker/dealer duly licensed in the appropriate states.
Not FDIC Insured, Not Bank Guaranteed and May Lose Value.
