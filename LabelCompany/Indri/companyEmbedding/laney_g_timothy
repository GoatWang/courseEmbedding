Our Beliefs
 
Common sense has never been common. If it were, the world would be a different place.
Things would run smoothly and on time. People would do what they say and say what they do. Everything would be fair, without all the small type.
And banks would only sell you what you need. When your banker looked at you they wouldn't just see a number, they'd see a dad or a mom or a graduate or a business owner. They'd understand the complexities of people's lives and offer simple solutions.
That's why we bank with common sense and we invite you to do the same.
That means straight talk, personal attention, and sensible, clear decisions from real people. No jibber jabber, no smoke and mirrors and no passing the buck. And no making you talk to a machine when what you need is a person.
If that makes sense to you, then you might be right for us.
And we might be right for you.
Where Common Sense Lives.

Our Community Service
 
We've been told time again that getting the fundamentals right is the best way we can help the community. But we're not satisfied with that answer. We'd like to help in other ways too. That's why as a bank and as individuals, we put aside some time and money to help out. Here are a few things we do.
We help people understand money.
It's just common sense that people who understand what they're signing make better decisions, so we dedicate a portion of our time to providing financial education to our clients and the public. We also support institutions and other efforts in the community to improve people's understanding of financial products and how they work.
We help people find work.
If you want to work, we think you should be able to work. So we are dedicated to helping those who want to work get the jobs they are looking for. Not only do we hire a diverse range of local people ourselves, but we also volunteer for and support organizations that help people get back on their feet and move forward with their plans.
We help people find quality housing.
Without affordable housing, it's hard for people to get back on their feet and find the jobs they're looking for. That's why, in addition to providing financing for individual homes and developments, we also support organizations that provide quality low-income housing.
