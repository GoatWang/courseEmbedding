                                            MADISON/MIDDLETON- Joyce Ann (Weir) Leadley died on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 in Middleton, WI.  The daughter of Walter A. and Mary A. (White) Weir, Joyce was born on January 11, 1925 in Waukesha, Wisconsin.  

After graduating from Waukesha High School, she attended Miss Brown's Business School in Milwaukee.  She was employed at the Columbian Art Works prior to her marriage to Warren D. Leadley on June 14, 1947.

The Leadley's moved from Waukesha to Madison in 1964 where Joyce was employed by Abstract & Title Associates until 1969 when she transferred to the Madison Police Dept. (detective bureau).  She retired in 1987 and spent the next 20 years as a volunteer at Methodist (later Meriter Hospital) as well as caring for her husband.  

Joyce was a life member of the Friends of Meriter as well as a life member of UMW (United Methodist Women).  

Joyce is survived by her daughters Beth Frank Reed (Greg Reed) and Jacque Leadley, 6 grandchildren, 12 great-grandchildren, sister Rachel Elger (Rev. Ben), and many nieces and nephews.  She was preceded in death by her husband Warren, parents, and brother Paul, and infant brother David.  

A visitation will be from 1:00-1:30 PM on Monday, April 3, 2017 at Prairie Home Cemetery, 605 South Prairie Ave., Waukesha, WI 53186 with a service beginning at 1:30 PM.  Joyce will be brought to her final place of rest following services.     

The family would like to express their gratitude to Brookdale Senior Living Center-Middleton and Agrace HospiceCare for care and compassion for Joyce.
