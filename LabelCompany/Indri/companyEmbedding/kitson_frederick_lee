 Educational Background



Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering 


University of Delaware

                  The University of Delaware (UD) is a state-assisted, privately governed institution that was founded in 1743. It offers 3 associate programs, 147 bachelor’s programs, 119 master's programs, 54 doctoral programs, and 15 dual graduate programs through seven colleges and in collaboration with more than 70 research centers. UD's student body encompasses more than 17,000 undergraduates, more than 3,600 graduate students and nearly 800 students in professional and continuing studies from across the country and around the globe. The University received its charter from the State of Delaware in 1833 and was designated one of the nation’s historic Land Grant colleges in 1867. Today, UD is a Land Grant, Sea Grant and Space Grant institution. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching classifies UD as a research university with very high research activity—a designation accorded less than 3 percent of U.S. colleges and universities. UD ranks among the nation’s top 100 universities in federal R&D support for science and engineering.                




Master's in Electrical Engineering 


Georgia Institute of Technology

                  The Georgia Institute of Technology is a public research university in Atlanta, Georgia, in the United States. It is a part of the University System of Georgia and has satellite campuses in Savannah, Georgia; Metz, France; Athlone, Ireland; Shanghai, China; and Singapore.

The educational institution was founded in 1885 as the Georgia School of Technology as part of Reconstruction plans to build an industrial economy in the post-Civil War Southern United States. Initially, it offered only a degree in mechanical engineering. By 1901, its curriculum had expanded to include electrical, civil, and chemical engineering. In 1948, the school changed its name to reflect its evolution from a trade school to a larger and more capable technical institute and research university.

Today, Georgia Tech is organized into six colleges and contains about 31 departments/units, with emphasis on science and technology. It is well recognized for its degree programs in engineering, computing, business administration, the sciences, architecture, and liberal arts.                




Doctorate in Electrical & Computer Engineering 


University of Colorado at Boulder - College of Engineering and Applied Sciences






 


Stanford University - Stanford Graduate School of Business

                                    Prior                


Motorola Mobility LLC


                  Motorola Mobility is an American telecommunications equipment corporation headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. Motorola Mobility was formerly known as the Mobile Devices division of Motorola until it was spun off as a separate entity in January 2011. Motorola Mobility consists of the Mobile Devices business which produces smartphones and the Home business which produces set-top boxes, end-to-end video solutions, and cable modems. On January 4, 2011, Motorola's mobile device and set-top box division was spun off into a separate company as Motorola Mobility, while the remainder of the company was renamed Motorola Solutions. Shortly after the split, Google, the lead developer of Android itself, announced in August 2011 that it would acquire Motorola Mobility for US$12.5 billion, subject to regulatory approval. Google's intent for the purchase was to acquire the company's portfolio of patents so it could adequately protect other Android vendors from lawsuits. The deal closed in May 2012, after which it also sold its set-top box business to Arris Group. In late 2013, Motorola notably launched two new smartphones, the Moto X and Moto G, and unveiled Project Ara, a concept for a modular smartphone.

He was a son of the late Harold and Margaret (Holder) Kitson.
A 1944 graduate of Springfield High School, Erdenheim, Montgomery County, he enlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserve at age 17 serving on active duty in the Pacific before being discharged in 1946.
He graduated from Lehigh University earning a Bachelor of Science degree in industrial engineering and worked at Air Products and Chemicals for 26 years until retiring in 1983.
He started a safety consulting business which included overseas travel, before retiring for the second time in 1998.
During his career, he served on an Industry Association Committee (Compressed Gas Association) and on a National Fire Protection Association Committee, serving six years as chairman.
An avid fisherman and golfer, he would say “his life was as good as it gets”.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by son F. Lee and wife, Dawn, of New Tripoli; daughters Margaret (Peg) Knowles of Winter Garden, Fla., Susan Haas and husband, Tim, of Maxatawny, and Gail H. Kitson of Allentown; stepsons Donald Fritzinger and wife, Amy, of Breinigsville, James Fritzinger and wife, Anne, of Waynesboro and Richard Fritzinger and wife, Sandra, of New Tripoli; grandchildren Angela Breidinger, Heather Klotz, Erik Knowles, Jane Vieira, Hillary Zoccola, Benjamin Haas, Carrie Santoro, Nathaniel Haas, Christian Fenstermacher and Andrew Kitson; step-grandsons Michael and Mark Fritzinger; 14 great-grandchildren; and three step-great-grandchildren.
He was predeceased by brothers Harold, Peter and Edward (Ted) Kitson.
Private services will be at Keller Funeral Homes Inc., 1018 Church St., Fogelsville.
Interment will be private with military honors presented by the American Legion, Topton.
Condolences may be offered to the family at kellerfuneralhomes.com.
In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the American Heart Association, LV-NE Division, 968 Postal Road, Suite 110, Allentown, PA 18109.

A must for every man’s arsenal: a few reliable pairs of jeans that have a classic look with a modern flair and a great fit. Lee jeans for men provide high-quality pants for anyone looking to add denim durability and unbeatable style to their everyday look. Keep loose and stay comfortable with the freeing forms of relaxed or bootcut jeans. More of a traditionalist? Stick with what you know and look great in a pair of straight or slim fit pants. Take advantage of extra pocket space with a trusty set of carpenter jeans. Too hot for long pants? Get the same quality you’re used to with a bit less length. From cargo shorts to flat-front shorts—and denim to khaki, Lee shorts give you an attractive summer style and a great way to stay cool. Whether you’re shopping for weekday work attire or weekend casual, our Lee jeans and pants will give you a classic look for a lot less.
