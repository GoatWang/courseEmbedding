The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

About Risks: An imbalance in supply and demand in the income market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. Fund performance is sensitive to stock market volatility. A Fund’s ability to utilize various tax-managed techniques may be curtailed or eliminated in the future by tax legislation or regulation. No Fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a Fund. The funds may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review a Fund prospectus for a complete description.

2 As of the close of business on January 15, 2013, this Fund has discontinued sale of its shares, with the exception of existing shareholders, qualified retirement plans and certain fee-based programs. See prospectus for additional details.

3These shares are not available for new investments.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

About Risks: An imbalance in supply and demand in the income market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. Fund performance is sensitive to stock market volatility. A Fund’s ability to utilize various tax-managed techniques may be curtailed or eliminated in the future by tax legislation or regulation. No Fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a Fund. The funds may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review a Fund prospectus for a complete description.

Eaton Vance



Public
Banking - Financial Services
1,000 - 2,500 Employees
Headquartered in Boston, MA
61 Active Jobs






Established and Focused

Originating in Boston in 1924, Eaton Vance is one of the oldest investment management firms in America and provides professional investment advice to individuals, trusts, charitable organizations and institutions. Throughout our 80 year history, the delivery of investment advisory services has been the primary business focus.

Comprehensive Wealth Manager

Since its founding, Eaton Vance has gained insight into all aspects of the wealth management cycle - the creation and growth of wealth, the protection and preservation of its value, and the ultimate distribution of wealth. Today, we make our wealth management expertise available to a wide range of individual and institutional investors through a variety of products and services designed to meet specific needs.


Public Company With Business Continuity

The common stock of EVIC's parent company, Eaton Vance Corp., is publicly traded and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, trading under the symbol EV. Senior corporate management and investment management professionals are substantial owners of the company’s voting and non-voting common stock.

Broad Asset Management Capabilities

Eaton Vance offers broad asset management capabilities with a well-balanced product line and leadership positions in major markets.

Stable, Highly Motivated and Capable Team

Eaton Vance’s team of over 90 investment management professionals, including portfolio managers, analysts, and traders, averages 15 years experience. A staff of over 200 support personnel assists our professionals in meeting the communication and service needs of our clients.

Eaton Vance’s senior management team has, generally, advanced through the company ranks and has been in place for many years. Most current employees are shareholders and employee turnover is low.

Disciplined Pursuit of Consistent Performance

Throughout its history, Eaton Vance has followed time-tested principles of investing that emphasize risk management and the pursuit of consistent long-term returns. Proprietary, fundamental research is the basis of our approach to security selection.

Client Focused

Eaton Vance emphasizes close working relationships with clients, highly customized investment management and outstanding service. Fundamental principles include an unwavering commitment to meet investment goals prudently; communication with clients as often as needed, compliance with privacy requirements; and a commitment to use all available resources and experience in providing investment advice.

Strong Record of Investment Returns

Eaton Vance has achieved a strong record of investment returns, with an above average long-term performance record relative to appropriate benchmarks.






Investment Management

Eaton Vance Investment Counsel (EVIC) follows accepted, time-tested investment principles that emphasize avoidance of unnecessary risk and the pursuit of above average long-term returns. Proprietary, fundamental research is the basis of our approach to security selection. We construct fixed-income, equity and balanced portfolios one security at a time, after intensive analysis of risk/reward characteristics and potential for above average long-term performance. We believe that effective risk management is key to strong investment performance. We seek to manage risk through rigorous research and analysis by building highly-diversified portfolios, and by adhering to our established investment disciplines. We seek to deliver long-term returns for our private clients by following a quality-oriented, buy-and-hold investment philosophy. Valuations and buy/sell decisions are governed by equity and fixed income disciplines that encourage patience with successful investments and ensure diligence in pruning under performing securities when necessary. We rely on the individual and collective strengths of our seasoned investment counselors and analysts.

We are particularly noted for our expertise in the management of taxable accounts for after-tax returns. Taxation of realized capital gains has a significant adverse effect on the potential compounding power of equity investing. Many professional money managers ignore taxes and manage all of their accounts similarly to simplify administrative requirements and to reduce performance dispersion among accounts for marketing purposes. We believe that individual investment objectives can be met only by client-specific solutions and knowledge of each client’s time horizon and cost basis to optimize after-tax returns.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/type.object.type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
