 Career History



Director of Research

                                    Current                


Endeavour Capital Advisors, Inc.


                  Endeavor Capital Advisors employs three primary strategies. Endeavour Capital Partners LP and Endeavour Capital Offshore Fund Ltd. seek long-term capital appreciation returns above relevant market indices through a portfolio consisting primarily of long and short equity positions of companies in the financial sector. Endeavour may also invest in bonds and other debt securities or in securities of companies outside the financial sector. Generally, long positions are characterized by conservative business models with sustainable or improving earnings at compelling valuations, turnaround situations or trading positions with an identifiable catalyst. Short positions typically include companies with deteriorating fundamentals or trading positions where industry growth is decelerating and/or product pricing is declining.Endeavour Regional Bank Opportunities Fund LP and Endeavour Regional Bank Opportunities Fund II LP invests in well-capitalized regional banks with strong management teams and manageable credit risk that are actively seeking to grow their businesses. This strategy targets small- and mid-cap banks and invests primarily in long and short positions in publicly-traded common stocks. Investments may also include publicly traded or privately negotiated (or restricted) common stocks, preferred stocks, stock warrants and rights, corporate debt, bonds, notes or other debentures or debt participations, convertible securities, options, swaps and other derivative instruments.Endeavour also manages an account that invests primarily in equity-related securities that are included in the financial sector component of the MSCI North American Index.
