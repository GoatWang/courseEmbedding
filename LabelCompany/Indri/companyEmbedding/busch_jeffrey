MICHELOB ULTRA LIME
Michelob ULTRA Lime Cactus has an exotic fruity aroma with a clean citrus finish. Drink Michelob ULTRA Fruit Lime Cactus with bold ethnic fare such as a spicy chorizo-based dish or carne asada tacos because the beer balances the dishes’ heat and brings out the subtle black pepper smokiness. It also pairs well with seafood.

KIRIN ICHIBAN
Kirin Ichiban is made with a luxurious single wort (or first press) brewing process which extracts only the purest, most flavorful portion of the finest ingredients.  When combined with its new all malt formula, the result is a distinctively smooth, clean, and full-bodied beer—yet with none of the bitter aftertaste one would expect from a beer with this much flavor.

BUD LIGHT MANG-O-RITA
Perfectly hinted with mango and sweetness. I wanted to take a vacation to the tropics right then just so I could enjoy this drink on the beach. Refreshing, light, doesn’t taste anything like alcohol, and any way you serve it, you’ll love it. For those drinkers who love fruity yet non-alcoholic-tasting alcoholic drinks, this is for you. Tropical and perfectly carbonated mango drink for summer.

KIRIN LIGHT
Kirin Light displays all the character and finesse expected from a beer with Kirin on the label, but with far few calories than most beer lovers ever dreamed.  This attractive golden colored brew presents an enticing hop aroma and a surprisingly smooth, full-bodied taste considering there are only 95 calories

NATURAL ICE
Natural Ice is brewed with a blend of premium American-grown and imported hops and a combination of malt and corn that lends Natural Ice its delicate sweetness. It then undergoes Anheuser-Busch’s exclusive ice-brewing process, which takes the beer to a temperature below freezing and leads to the formation of ice crystals which create its signature rich and smooth taste.
 
Characterized by its robust body, delicate sweetness and smooth, rich taste.
 
The introduction of Natural Ice provided the company with two brands in the value priced ice beer category (Busch Ice was also introduced in 1995).

The History of Busch Beer



Busch beer has a long and illustrious history rooted in
  tradition, exceptional ingredients, and crisp, refreshing taste. It
  started as Busch Bavarian Beer, made a comeback as the first beer
  introduced by Anheuser-Busch after prohibition, and to this day it’s
  the only beer that proudly displays our founder’s name.
