Aaron Anderson – Navajo
Aaron Anderson is the third generation of silversmiths using the sand cast and tufa casting method of silver work. He learned the art from his stepfather Wilfred Henry and his mother, Evelyn Anderson, observing their work and helping as a child. Today he carves at the well known Manuelito studio along side famous tufa casting artists Philander and Darryl Dean Begay. He is known for his one of a kind designs that blend contemporary style with traditional ideas. He often uses raised inlay to an eye dazzling effect as well as gem grade turquoise and coral. He often gives the carved tufa stone to his collectors when he sells a piece, emphasizing the fact that it is one of a kind. Aaron has won many blue ribbons at every show he enters, including eight best in casting at the famed Gallup Intertribal Ceremonial. Today he shows at the Indigenous fine art market in Santa Fe and the Native Jewelers Society.

Aaron Anderson Rare High Grade Morenci Turquoise Tufa Cast Belt Buckle

Sold

This beautiful belt buckle is an excellent example of how the jeweler creates a piece by carving an image in tufa stone. This technique requires tremendous skill thinking in three dimensions. Aaron includes the tufa stone carving itself with the finished sterling silver buckle. The buckle perfectly mirrors the carving. He has created the design taken from an old historic design used on bridles and old concho belts that stands out against a deeply textured and oxidized background. A small piece of high grade natural Morenci turquoise highlights the top of the buckle for effect.

Description


Additional information



Description
In 1863, Aaron Anderson joined the Union Navy at the age of 53.  He was serving as an oarsman on a small boat that was sent to attack Confederate forces on Mattox Creek, Virginia.  Anderson and the other crew members found themselves under attack from 400 Confederate soldiers.  The ammunition from the Confederates was so powerful it destroyed almost all the oars and only musket on board.  Anderson and the few other oarsmen managed to maneuver the boat to safety under this intense fire. His citation is below.  Please note that his last name was misspelled in the citation.
Medal of Honor Citation
“The President of the United States of America, in the name of Congress, takes pleasure in presenting the Medal of Honor to Landsman Aaron Sanderson, United States Navy, for extraordinary heroism in action while serving on board the U.S.S. Wyandank during a boat expedition up Mattox Creek, Virginia, 17 March 1865.  Participating with a boat crew in the clearing of Mattox Creek, Landsman Anderson carried out his duties courageously in the face of a devastating fire which cut away half the oars, pierced the launch in many places and cut the barrel off a musket being fired at the enemy.ˮ
This Aaron Anderson mug is part of our Medal of Honor Series and our Civil War Series profiling participants in the War Between the States.  Thousands of Confederate and Union soldiers fought in battles such as Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Vicksburg, Chattanooga, Cold Harbor and Petersburg.  We honor their sacrifices by telling their stories.
The content on the mugs is crafted for a stunning visual experience and to inspire an interest to learn more about history.  Robert Compton, who developed HistoryMugs, colorized the hundred-year-old photographs in order to bring the individuals back to life.  Biography and images are designed and printed in Bristol, Vermont, USA.

11 oz. mug:  3.75” H x 3” D
15 oz. mug:  4.5″ H x 3.25″ D
Mugs are premium hard coated ceramic, which are food and microwave safe.
To preserve photographic quality we recommend hand washing.
Mugs are usually shipped within 3-5 days.
Shipping charges drop dramatically on orders of 8 or more.

ITEM#: 12955442
What's Up Everybody? Thank you for visiting my webpage and supporting my debut album, 'Broken Avenue.' I have many people to think for the success of my album. First of all, to my producer, Christopher 'C-Ray' Roberts on putting everything together. He truly is the greatest musician I have ever met, and one of the great musical minds of the midwest. Secondly, I thank my parents, for supporting me every step of the way in making the album. I add special thanks to Brandon 'BC' Currie, James 'TAZ' Conley, Bree Bragg, and Jaecyn Bayne on helping out with a few of my tracks. Thanks to you guys for making this all possible, the album is what it is because of you. I would like to send a special shoutout to Christopher Kenneth Smith, who was my longtime musical inspiration who passed away in October of 2008. You will truly be missed. Big time props to Dre for putting in a good word on the album, and supporting the album through it all. Once again, thanks to everyone who made this possible, and God bless everyone! Buy the album, play the songs, and turn up the volume!
