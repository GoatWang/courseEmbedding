Management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial

financial statements and provides additional information on the Company's
businesses, current developments, financial condition, cash flows and results of
operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our
unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this "Quarterly Report") and with our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016.



Forward-Looking Statements



Except for the historical information contained herein, this Quarterly Report
contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and
uncertainties, including, among other things, statements concerning: our
business strategy; liquidity and capital expenditures; future sources of
revenues and anticipated costs and expenses; and trends in industry activity
generally. Such forward-looking statements include, among others, those
statements including the words such
as "may," "will," "should," "expect," "plan," "could," "anticipate," "intend," "believe," "estimate," "predict,"
"potential," "goal," or similar language or by discussions of our outlook,
plans, goals, strategy or intentions.


Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the
forward-looking statements. These statements are only predictions and involve
known and unknown risks, and uncertainties, that may cause our actual results,
levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from
any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or
implied by such forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the
expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are based on
reasonable assumptions, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity,
performance or achievements.


The forward-looking statements we make in this Quarterly Report are based on

only as of the date of this report. We assume no obligation to update any of

                                    BUSINESS

 The Business


Since its incorporation, the Company has developed its business plan, appointed
officers and directors, engaged initial project consultants and entered into
negotiations and contracts for related and ancillary business. The Company is in
the process of developing proposals for high-speed rail service.



The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware and merged with Ameri
Metro 2010 on June 12, 2012.  References to the financial condition and
performance of the Company below in this section "Management's Discussions and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation" are to financial
statements of the Company.



The Company, and its wholly owned subsidiary Global Transportation and
Infrastructure, Inc., plan to use Private Public Partnerships ("PPP") for
funding of infrastructure projects and transportation projects. The Company is a
conduit to provide general contracting services for infrastructure projects and
transportation projects. As a conduit we identify infrastructure projects for
both private and public end users. The Company will bring together private and
public entities, the end users, including the affiliate entities to organize the
revenue bond offering, which will be the private debt vehicle to build the
infrastructure project for the end user. The Companies ultimate role is
providing general contracting services and construction management services for
the private and public entities.


As the U.S. and World populations are rapidly increasing and global
infrastructure is being surpassed in its ability to safely and adequately
provide the effective transportation for sustainable economics, infrastructure
is becoming inadequate and dilapidated. Governing authorities' ability to keep
up with preventative maintenance and replacement lacks funding. Studies have
consistently shown that the development of infrastructure permeates economic
growth. Lack of funding due to global financial crises have sent governments
into restructuring their budgets and bail outs have further reduced the
possibility for governmental funding.  The Company's management team has
recognized the need for a solution to curb the financial burden on the
governments and taxpayer alike.  The Company plans to make use of Private Public
Partnerships for these type of projects.


Due to scale and complexity of infrastructure finance much thought has been
given by the Company to overall financial requirements, and the functionality of
financial structure of the Company's operations.  The Company's Founder, Shah
Mathias, has organized and established three nonprofit corporations and was an
independent consultant of a forth nonprofit (ATFI) for the purpose of
facilitating the development of the transportation systems

Alabama Toll Facilities Inc., High-Speed Rail Facilities, Inc., High-Speed Rail
Facilities Provider, Inc. and Global Infrastructure Finance & Development
Authority take a comprehensive, intermodal approach to resolving the nation's
transportation crisis, and they propose doing so without the necessity of
increasing taxes at any level, or in any manner. In short, they replace pubic
financing with private funding.


High-Speed Rail Facilities, Inc., High-Speed Rail Facilities Provider, Inc. and
Global Infrastructure Finance & Development Authority are prepared to assume a
much larger role with the Company. Having brought together the necessary
technical and industrial components to begin work immediately, the Company need
not engage in costly, time-consuming pilot programs. Our team of experts is
prepared to move expeditiously forward on the widest variety of fronts, from
site selection, to trainset construction, to building cooperative ventures with
ancillary components of the transportation and accommodation industries
nationwide. The Company takes an intermodal approach to providing seamless
service with a scale of economy. Specifically, the Company's paradigm
anticipates a fundamental change in the manner in which passenger rail service
will be provided. The high-speed rail plan will utilize existing rail
rights-of-way to connect several metropolitan areas and states serving expanding
populations. The major elements of the plan would include:



·
Use of existing rail rights-of-way to connect rural, small urban and major
metropolitan areas;
·
Operation of a "hub-and-spoke" passenger rail system providing service to and
through one or more major hubs to locations throughout the United States;
·
Introduction of modern rail equipment operating at speeds exceeding 250 mph;
·
Provision of multi-modal connections to improve system access;
·
Improvement in reliability and on-time performance;
·
Development or expansion of a feeder bus system linking outlying areas to
railroad stations;



                                       16



·

Acquiring new train equipment including train sets, including spares;
·
Communications Systems, and grade-crossing improvements;


These three entities play a vital role in financing. The non-profits statues
provide a vehicle to issue bonds and help secure infrastructure projects. The
non-profit entities have the discretion to turn over the infrastructure projects
to the state or the governing body having jurisdiction after it has successfully
developed and paid for the projects.  However, in order to support the
functionality of financial structure and manage the development of specific
projects, sixteen for profit entities have been developed under the Company's
umbrella, The Company will interface with each entity in three separate stages:
Stage 1 interface - as consultant for fee, Stage 2 interface - as provider for
construction services for fee and Stage 3 interface - as a 25% shareholder (post
construction operations revenue). The below entities have no operations, no
assets, and no revenues recognized as of April 30, 2017, and a substantial
amount of capital needs to be raised for potential future projects that the
Company and these entities hope to develop. The sixteen for profit entities
are:

The following discussion outlines the steps that the Company anticipates that
will occur in regard to the adoption and implementation of Trade and
Transportation and a high-speed rail system by a regional or local municipality.
 To date, the Company has not developed any rail systems.
The Company plans that it will prepare the feasibility and Investment Grade
studies and locate contractors and manufacturers to complete work and provide
cost estimates. Trade and Transportation corridors use technology well known to
US contractors, however, because high-speed rail travel is already in-place in
much of Europe and Asia, the Company anticipates working with European companies
to furnish the high-speed equipment, such as locomotives and passenger cars.



The Company will put proposed contracts together with the supporting feasibility
study, appraisals, cost/benefit analysis, TEMS study, transportation history and
other data to create a complete regional project proposal.  The Company will
then present such project proposals to the municipalities (state or local) as a
complete and finished project. The local or regional municipality will then
independently analyze and discuss the Company's proposal.  If accepted, the
Company anticipates that, upon approval, the local municipality will effectuate
a bond offering for the funding of the different projects.  The Company
anticipates that the projects will be financed by bonds or indentures offered by
sponsored or affiliated non-profit organizations of the applicable local or
municipal government or agency.  Such non-profit entities may also be affiliates
or companies related to the Company.


Once a proposed Trade and Transportation or high-speed rail project is accepted
and a financing bond issue is effected by the municipality, the Company will act
as the project manager and oversee the entire project including not only the
development of the project but its continued operations as well. The Company
will also serve as the main central point for coordination of and between the
municipalities, contractors, and operators of the project and once established,
the rail system.

Hi Speed Rail Facilities, Inc.


In 2010, the Company entered into an agreement with HSRF (one of the Company's
related nonprofit companies) The Company per agreement will be responsible for
construction of projects while the nonprofit will be responsible for financing
construction and operation of various high speed rail and related projects
across the United States. HSRF is designed to focus on the building of train
tracks and stations.  Pursuant to the agreement between the Company and HSRF,
the Company will act as the agent and representative of HSRF to perform all
required tasks and actions to develop and construct such projects. The Company
anticipates that having this agreement in place and by having HSRF already
organized will expedite the process of commencing a project once the Company
designs and develops and secures or raises funds to commence a project upon
approval of this registration Statement.



Hi Speed Rail Facilities Provider, Inc.


In 2010, the Company entered into a written agreement with HSRFP (one of the
Company's related nonprofit companies). The Company per agreement will be
responsible for construction of projects while the nonprofit will be responsible
for financing construction and operation of various high speed rail and related
projects across the United States. Pursuant to such agreement between the
Company and HSRFP, the Company was appointed as the agent and representative of
HSRFP to perform all required tasks and actions to develop and construct such
projects. HSRFP was organized to provide a vehicle to issue bonds and help
secure infrastructure projects for the Company, focusing on facilities ancillary
to the high speed rail, such as rail yards, rail assembly plants maintenance
facilities. The Company anticipates that having this agreement in place and by
having HSRF already organized will expedite the process of commencing a project
once the Company secures approval of this registration Statement.



ING Investment Management
Each of the nonprofits has entered into an investment management agreement with
ING Investment Management to manage any funds raised in bond offerings and to
provide its investment advisory services.  This non-binding agreement would only
take effect upon the raising of revenue bonds, which to date has not occurred.
 ING Investment Management would serve to invest, reinvest and supervise the
management of any such funds raised, for any project in the future, while such
funds were held in an investment account and until use for the intended funds
are needed for project purposes. The Company has not yet commenced raising
funds
through any bond offerings.


Supporting Information

To support the Company's business plan, the United States Census Bureau predicts
that the American population will reach 420 million by 2050, a trend that will
overwhelm our nation's transportation infrastructure.


Current estimates suggest that overall freight demand will double over the next
40 years from 15 billion tons today to 30 billion tons. The number of trucks on
the road is also expected to double. Already under unsustainable strain, the
nation's freight transportation infrastructure and highways will face even
greater challenges as the total volume of freight increases.


Extensive infrastructure expansion, such as new ports, trade corridors and
high-speed rail (HSR), is critical if rail and road transportation is to help
mitigate problems associated with rising fuel costs, crowded highways, and
greenhouse gas emissions. Population growth and development in the U.S. have
made our nation increasingly reliant on rail and highway infrastructure to
transport people and freight.

Clearly, a strong, efficient freight transportation system is vital to the
nation's economy. Our already-strained and outdated railways must be upgraded to
handle the projected increases in freight shipping to relieve congestion on our
highways. New trade corridors are needed to support the changes in marine
shipping that will need new ports and infrastructure. Equally, new high speed
rail routes are needed to increase connectivity between US cities and support
the emerging new economy, and reduce auto emissions.



                                       21



Company Focus

The Company recognizes the $57 Trillion Dollar Infrastructure Market as
identified in McKinsey's report, the need and demand for alternative
transportation such as, high speed rail, sea ports, intermodal ports and toll
roads. The Boeing reports and Society of Civil Engineers reports identify the
need for more efficient port operations and infrastructure projects to be
completed to satisfy the demands and growth of the United States. It is
increasingly important as the United States adopts policies to attempt to reduce
its dependency on fossil fuels and to improve its infrastructure and
transportation systems for global competiveness. The Company's intention is to
profit from such opportunities and has structured itself to be the leading
provider of such services in the United States and globally.


The Company is focusing on the following means to create efficient freight
transportation:


?


Increase port capacity to increase our nation's ability to distribute goods,
making us more competitive in the global economy.


?


Develop larger, rail-served, inland distribution centers that will encourage
more efficient movement of goods and create more capacity at ports.


?


Permit increased volume and speed of inland heavy freight, allowing inland
distribution points to expand into larger, national service hubs and promote
economic growth.


?


Develop profitable high speed rail for the fast movement of people and goods.


Management believes that development of the Trade and Transport Corridors and
High Speed Rail Corridors will result in significant franchise operations.
These
include -


Ø

Fuel: The Company will franchise fuel and energy for vehicles moving in the
corridors it develops.
Ø


Corridor Centers for Food/Restaurants/Hotels: Food/restaurants and hotels at
major intersections and terminal areas associated with its Trade, Toll and
Rail
corridors.

Ø

Logistic Technology Applications: The Company will develop advanced High Speed
operations for Truck and Rail freight and passenger operations. High Speed Truck
Lanes, truck trains and automatic truck operations will be included in the
Company's Toll Roads. High Speed Rail Freight and Passenger operations with
train speeds exceeding 250 mph will be developed.


Ø
Pipelines: Pipeline operations will be developed where appropriate to facilitate
crude oil movements to coastal refineries from inland oil fields and facilities.
Ø
Cable: Cable will be laid along the Company corridors to increase capacity for
phone line operators.


Ø


Parking: Parking facilities will be developed at critical network locations and
at network nodes.


Ø


Advertising: Advertising facilities will be developed as appropriate along the
project corridors and key locations at Terminals and Facilities.



                                       22



Ø

Franchise Zones: The Company has developed a nationwide franchise Zone System
that it will use with both projects and products. The franchise zone system
allows the Company to recognize regional differences in pricing and franchising
its market products.

Entry of the Company into the Market



The Company anticipates that it can offer a comprehensive, innovative approach
to resolving the nation's transportation crisis. And it proposes doing so
without the necessity of the government increasing taxes at any level, or in any
manner. In short, the Company suggests replacing public financing with private
funding.


The primary competitive barrier most companies face in attempting to impact the
nation's infrastructure crisis is that they approach the overall problem in
disparate segments. For example, one provider proposes building railroad cars,
while another proposes laying tracks. A third is interested in depots, while a
fourth focuses on accommodations. None bring a comprehensive plan for
full-funding to the mix. On the other hand, the Company takes an intermodal
approach to providing seamless service with a scale of economy. For example the
high-speed rail plan will utilize existing rail rights-of-way to connect several
metropolitan areas and states serving expanding populations.




                                       23



The Company through related parties also foresees pursuing joint ventures with
other industries related to the transportation industry. For example, HSR
Technologies it is currently finalizing an arrangement with a major manufacturer
of certain materials used in the construction of highways and other
transportation systems. The discussions contemplate a two-fold transaction by
which the Company would initially buy the manufacturing plant and then
subsequently purchase the remaining non-cash assets of the Company.



Competition
The Company may face significant competition from other companies that may be
developing competing transportation systems.  The Company will, however, face
competition in the allocation of monetary resources from governmental agencies,
at the local, regional, state and federal levels. The Company believes that
government agencies will strongly endorse its proposed plan for high-speed
regional rail systems, but believes that, given the economic environment, there
may be few or no funds available for such development.


Nevertheless, as an example, traditionally significant competition generally
exists in the industry, from government agencies and entities. Due to the
federal budgetary constraints, henceforth any completion would come from private
or public entities. On the heels of the Department of Transportation's recent
request for high-speed rail proposals, its Federal Railroad Administration
received 132 applications from 32 states totaling $8.8 billion. That was more
than three times the $2.4 billion available. During the first round of awards in
the fall of 2009, applicants submitted more than $55 billion in project
proposals. That was nearly six times the initial $8 billion available from the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Unfortunately, due to federal budgetary
setbacks, as of early 2017, very little of this has come to fruition.



Trading Market
While there currently is no market for the shares, the Company as obtained the
trading symbol "ARMT" from FINRA.
Employees



In addition to the Chief Executive Officer, the Company has been accruing
salaries for employees and twenty six other persons who are working on behalf of
the Company to assist in the development of its initial high-speed rail project.
None of the twenty six people currently receive salaries or other compensation.
The Company has also issued stock to individuals, for their consulting and
professional services. At the time the Company launches its planned IPO, the
Company will pay the accrued salaries to the employees.



Subsidiaries
The Company has one subsidiary, Global Transportation & Infrastructure Inc.
("GTI") incorporated in the state of Delaware. GTI is a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company.  The Company owns 25% of each of the companies listed in the
section "Related Companies".

Related Party Transactions
At April 30, 2017, the Company is indebted to three directors of the Company for
$1,050 (July 31, 2016 - $1,050) for expenditures incurred on behalf of the
Company.  The amount is unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand.


As of April 30, 2017, $1,059,181 (July 31, 2016 - $960,907) is due to the
majority shareholder, of which $509,486 is unsecured, non-interest bearing and
due on demand, and $7,600 is past due with an interest rate of 2% per annum, On
March 17, 2017, the majority shareholder consolidated six loans and the
consolidated loan of $542,095 is due on October 31, 2018 and bears interest at
3.50% per annum.  At April 30, 2017, accrued interest on these loans is $28,896
(July 31, 2016 - $14,068).


Going Concern


The Company has negative working capital, has incurred losses since inception,
and has not yet received significant revenues from sales of products or
services. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any
adjustment that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a
going concern.


The ability of Ameri Metro to continue as a going concern is dependent on the
Company generating cash from the sale of its common stock and/or obtaining debt
financing and attaining future profitable operations. Management's plans include
selling its equity securities and obtaining debt financing to fund its capital
requirement and on-going operations; however, there can be no assurance the
Company will be successful in these efforts.  The Company has recently had
meetings with certain groups and municipalities regarding proposed
transportation infrastructure projects, and it has also met with potential
investors for these projects; in addition, it recently filed a stock
registration statement (Form S-1) so stock can be issued to raise $60,000,000 of
funding (the registration statement has not yet gone effective).



Critical Accounting Policies



The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  The preparation
of these financial statements requires making estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and
related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  The estimates are
based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.



The Company believes that the following critical accounting policies, among
others, affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the
preparation of its financial statements:




                                       26



Use of Estimates


The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Share-based payments



The Company accounts for employee stock-based compensation in accordance with
the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation which
requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair
values.  The fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly to
compensation expense and credited to additional paid-in capital over the period
during which services are rendered.


The Company follows ASC Topic 505-50, formerly EITF 96-18, Accounting for Equity
Instruments that are Issued to Other than Employees for Acquiring, or in
Conjunction with Selling Goods and Services, for stock options and warrants
issued to consultants and other non-employees. In accordance with ASC Topic
505-50, these stock options and warrants issued as compensation for services
provided to the Company are accounted for based upon the fair value of the
services provided or the estimated fair market value of the

option or warrant, whichever can be more clearly determined. The fair value of
the equity instrument is charged directly to compensation expense and additional
paid-in capital over the period during which services are rendered.



Recent Accounting Pronouncements
For the three month period ended April 30, 2017, there were no accounting
standards or interpretations issued that are expected to have a material impact
on our financial position, operations or cash flows.© Edgar Online, source Glimpses

financing, use of working capital, plans for future products,
services and distribution channels, anticipated growth strategies,
planned capital raises, ability to attract distributors and
customers, sources of net revenue, anticipated trends and
challenges in our business and the markets in which we operate, the
impact of economic and industry conditions on our customers and our
business, customer demand, our competitive position, the outcome of
any litigation against us, critical accounting policies and the
impact of recent accounting pronouncements. Additional

ITEM 1.
 BUSINESS

 

Since its
incorporation, the Company has developed its business plan,
appointed officers and directors, engaged initial project
consultants and entered into negotiations and contracts for related
and ancillary business. The Company is in the process of developing
proposals for high-speed rail service related transportation and
infrastructure projects.

 

On June 12,
2012, Ameri Metro, Inc. ("Ameri Metro 2010") merged with Yellowwood
Acquisition Corporation, a public reporting company. As part of the
merger, Yellowwood Acquisition Corporation, the surviving entity,
changed its name to Ameri Metro, Inc. and changed its fiscal year
end to July 31.  Yellowwood had no ongoing business or
operations and was established for the purpose of completing
mergers and acquisitions with a target company, such as the former
Ameri Metro 2010.  

 

The
Business

 

The Company, is
focused on development of transportation facilities, including but
not limited to high-speed rail for passenger and freight
transportation and related and ancillary transportation businesses,
inland ports, sea ports, airports, and toll roads. The Company
intends to secure manufacturing and technologies together with
ancillary land development projects, sale of goods and services to
government, civilian and commercial end users. 

The Company
anticipates that it will, directly or through subsidiaries or
affiliates, develop plans, and then coordinate and supervise the
financing, construction and development of such transportation
projects by bringing together the resources, plans, financing,
approvals and technology needed to implement such transportation
systems.

The Company has
not yet commenced its revenue producing operations; however, it has
been meeting with and making presentations to parties associated
with projects it intends to develop, including parties in the
United States related to a sea port and a rail project. The Company
believes that the need, demand and usage of alternative
transportation such as high speed rail, ports and toll roads are
increasingly important as the United States adopts policies to
attempt to reduce its dependency on fossil fuels and to improve its
infrastructure and transportation systems. The Company intends to
develop and prepare the designs and concepts for feasible and
profitable regional transportation and infrastructure related
projects utilizing existing and new infrastructure. The Company
will prepare the complete project package including appraisals and
estimates and will obtain contracts for the development of the
facilities and infrastructure and purchase of the equipment. The
Company will present the complete project, working as project
supervisor and coordinator, to municipalities and regional
government agencies. 

Funding for
individual projects of the Company will occur from bond offerings,
as organized through various nonprofit entities, High Speed Rail
Facilities Inc., High Speed Rail Facilities Provider Inc., Alabama
Toll Facilities Inc., Global Infrastructure Development &
Finance Authority Inc. and organizations sponsored or affiliated
with municipal and government agencies as well as from issuances of
stock and debt-financing.  Certain of these nonprofit entities
or organizations may themselves be affiliated with, or related to,
the Company and assist, or work in conjunction with, the Company in
securing contracts and funds to develop projects.  

Through its
subsidiary, GTI, the Company is also involved in the planning of
the future development of a new toll road in the southeast United
States. The Company through assignment of rights from Penndel Land
Company, to finance, develop and construction a 357 mile toll road
in the State of Alabama as outlined in Alabama House Joint
Resolution H. J. R. 459 & H. J. R. 456. The Company
acquired from Penndel Land Company (majority owned by the former
CEO of ARMT) the contract rights to a construction agreement with
the ATFI, a non-profit company supported by the State of Alabama to
act as the exclusive entity as set forth in H.J.R 459 and H.J.R.
456 project developer for such a toll road an on which the former
CEO of ARMT served as one of its four directors. When the Company
secures financing, ATFI will effect a bond offering to purchase the
land on which the toll road is to be located.

Business
Plan

 

The Company
will facilitate the development of transportation facilities,
including but not limited to high-speed rail for passenger and
freight transportation and related and ancillary transportation
businesses, inland ports, sea ports, airports, and toll roads. The
Company intends to secure manufacturing and technologies together
with ancillary land development projects, sale of goods and
services to government, civilian and commercial end users. 
The high-speed rail plan to be presented by the Company will likely
utilize existing rail rights-of-way to connect several metropolitan
areas and states serving expanding populations.

 

Funding for
individual projects of the Company will occur from bond offerings
organized through various nonprofit entities, High Speed Rail
Facilities Inc., High Speed Rail Facilities Provider Inc., Alabama
Toll Facilities Inc., Global Infrastructure Development &
Finance Authority Inc. and organizations sponsored or affiliated
with municipal and government agencies as well as from issuances of
stock and debt-financing.  Certain of these nonprofit entities
or organizations may themselves be affiliated with, or related to,
the Company and assist, or work in conjunction with, the Company in
securing contracts and funds to develop projects.  The major
elements of the plan would include:

 

High Speed
Rail

·

Introduction of
modern rail equipment operating at speeds up to 250 mph

·

Use of existing
rail rights-of-way to connect rural, small urban and major
metropolitan areas

·

Track
improvement, including replacement and upgrades, additional
sidings, signal and communications systems, and grade-crossing
improvements

·

Construction or
improvement of railroad grade crossings and passenger
stations

·

Acquiring new
train equipment including train sets and spares

 

 

Supporting
Ancillary Development

·

Development or
expansion of a feeder bus system linking outlying areas to railroad
stations

·

Operation of a
"hub-and-spoke" passenger rail system providing service to and
through one or more major hubs to locations throughout the United
States

·

Provision of
multi-modal connections to improve system access, hotels, retail,
parking garages, sorting facilities / distribution
facilities

 

Supporting
Transportation Systems

·

Ancillary
development opportunities, airports, inland ports, sea ports, toll
roads and technology parks

 

The following
discussion outlines the steps as the Company anticipates that will
occur in regard to the adoption and implementation of a high-speed
rail system by a regional or local municipality.  To date, the
Company has not developed any rail systems. 

The Company
plans that it will prepare the feasibility study and locate
contractors and manufacturers to complete and work and provide cost
estimates. Because highspeed rail travel is already inplace in much
of Europe and Asia, the




7

  

Company
anticipates working with European companies to furnish the
highspeed equipment, such as locomotives and passenger
cars.

The Company
will put proposed contracts together with the supporting
feasibility study, appraisals, cost/benefit analysis, TEMS study,
transportation history and other data to create a complete regional
project proposal.  The Company will then present such project
proposals to the municipalities (state or local) as a complete and
finished project. The local or regional municipality will then
independently analyze and discuss the Company's proposal.  If
accepted, the Company anticipates that, upon approval, the local
municipality will effectuate a bond offering for the funding of the
high-speed rail project.  The Company anticipates that the
projects will be financed by bonds or indentures offered by
sponsored or affiliated non-profit organizations of the applicable
local or municipal government or agency.  Such non-profit
entities may also be affiliates or companies related to the
Company.

Once a proposed
high-speed rail project is accepted and a financing bond issue is
effected by the municipality, the Company will act as the project
manager and oversee the entire project including not only the
development of the project but its continued operations as well.
The Company will also serve as the main central point for
coordination of and between the municipalities, contractors, and
operators of the project and, once established, the rail
system.

Hi Speed
Rail Facilities, Inc.

In 2010, the
Company entered into an agreement with HSRF (one of the Company's
related nonprofit companies) for the purpose of construction of
projects consisting of the financing, construction and operation of
high speed rail and related projects across the United States. HSRF
is designed to focus on the building of train tracks and stations.
 Pursuant to the agreement between the Company and HSRF, the
Company will act as the agent and representative of HSRF to perform
all required tasks and actions to develop and construct such
projects. The Company anticipates that having this agreement in
place and by having HSRF already organized will expedite the
process of commencing a project once the Company designs and
develops and secures or raises funds to commence a
project.

Hi Speed
Rail Facilities Provider, Inc.

In 2010, the
Company entered into a written agreement with HSRFP (one of the
Company's related nonprofit companies) for the purpose of
construction of projects consisting of the financing, construction
and operation of various high speed rail and related projects
across the United States. Pursuant to such agreement between the
Company and HSRFP, the Company was appointed as the agent and
representative of HSRFP to perform all required tasks and actions
to develop and construct such projects. HSRFP was organized to
provide a vehicle to issue bonds and help secure infrastructure
projects for the Company focusing on facilities ancillary to the
high speed rail such as rail yards rail, rail assembly plants
maintenance facilities. The Company anticipates that having this
agreement in place and by having HSRF already organized will
expedite the process of commencing a project once the Company
secures or raises funds to commence a project.

Master Trust
Indenture Agreement

On December 1,
2010, HSRF entered into a Master Trust Indenture agreement
providing that HSRF serve as trustee for a bond offering of
$15,000,000,000 of HSRF Revenue Bonds Series 2010. In April 2012
this Indenture was amended to reflect a Master Indenture of
$20,000,000,000. The Company will act as developer for the project
financed by the Hi Speed Indenture. The Master Trust Indenture
provides the basic terms and conditions of any bond issuance such
as use of an escrow agent, rights of bond holders, sale of bonds,
etc.   

ING
Investment Management

Each of the
nonprofits has entered into an investment management agreement with
ING Investment Management to manage any funds raised in bond
offerings and to provide its investment advisory services.
 This non-binding agreement would only take effect upon the
raising of revenues bonds.  ING Investment Management would
serve to invest, reinvest and supervise the management of any such
funds while such funds were held in an investment account and until
use for the intended purposes.

Alabama Toll
Road 

The Company is
working to develop a project to build a toll road in the State of
Alabama, but still needs funding for this project.  Ameri
Metro in 2010 was developing this project at the time of the merger
with Yellowood.  The planned toll road is designated as a 352
mile 4-lane road designed to be built from Orange Beach, Alabama to
the Tennessee state line with the intent of connecting various
rural sections of Alabama to Tennessee and more urban
areas. The toll road that would connect various rural sections
of Alabama to Tennessee and with its more urban areas.

 

As its first
step, Alabama Toll Facilities, Inc. (ATFI) was created and obtained
status as a nonprofit corporation pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of
the Internal Revenue Code.  As a nonprofit corporation, ATFI
is allowed to make bond offerings in order to finance the cost of
acquisition and construction and equipping of the toll road
project.  Mr. Shah Mathias (the founder of the Company) was
one of the directors of ATFI and has subsequently resigned his
position.

 

In 2007, the
toll road project was presented to the Alabama legislature which on
June 7, 2007, adopted Act no. 2007-506 entitled "Expressing Support
for the Alabama Toll Road Project".  This Act stated that it
recognized the need to utilize other financial resources to meet
the needs of that highways and other infrastructure items such as
that offered by ATFI. The Act urged approval of the bonds offered
by ATFI as special revenue bonds with the project eventually
vesting to the state upon retirement of the bonds.  The Act
further supports designating ATFI as the exclusive entity for
creation and development of the toll road project.

 

As a second
step, on September 23, 2009, Penndel Land Company (
“
Penndel
”
), a company
wholly owned by Shah Mathias entered into an agreement with ATFI by
which Penndel was appointed as the agent and representative of ATFI
to perform all required tasks and actions to develop and construct
the toll road.  

 

Thirdly, on
December 1, 2010, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary,
Global Transportation & Infrastructure, Inc. ("GTI") in the
state of Delaware to provide development and construction services
for the Alabama highway project and to include securing financing
for the design, planning, engineering and related costs of
construction.

 

In December
2010, Penndel assigned its agreements with ATFI to GTI. As such the
Company, through its subsidiary, GTI, has the development rights
for such toll road. Under the terms of the agreement, GTI will
provide development and construction services. GTI will also act as
an agent and representative to take actions necessary to secure the
first and future phases of the financing applicable to the design,
planning, engineering and related soft and hard costs of the
construction of a toll road in the state of Alabama and related
activities.

Alabama
Indenture Agreement

On December 1,
2010, ATFI entered into a Master Trust Indenture agreement with as
HSRF Trustee, which has agreed to serve as the trustee for the bond
offering of up to $7,000,000,000 of ATFI Revenue Bonds once it
determines to effect such an offering if ever. The Alabama
Indenture indicates that the developer for the project will be GTI.
 In April 2012 the Alabama Indenture was amended to reflect a
Master Indenture of $20,000,000,000.  The Master Agreement
provides the basic terms and conditions of any bond issuance such
as use of an escrow agent, rights of bond holders, sale of bonds,
etc. At the time that any bonds are to be issued, the Company will
engage an asset manager and trustee for the indenture.
 

Damar Truck
Deck

The Company
also plans to develop projects as opportunities are presented
related or ancillary to the transportation or
transportation-related fields. The Company entered into a contract
for the acquisition of the patents, rights, titles, and business of
Damar Corporation LLC, the inventor, developer and manufacturer of
Damar Truck Deck. (See www.damartruckdeck.com). The Damar
Corporation was incorporated in 2007 to develop, manufacture and
market the truck deck component invented and developed by its
owner. The Damar Corporation has filed a patent application
covering its truck deck system. The Damar Truck Deck is a flexible
truck deck storage and organization system that with an integrated
frame allowing the cargo deck to be used as a hauling surface. The
system has many configurations to fit a wide variety of uses
(hunting, construction, moving, hauling, etc.) in various truck
deck sizes. The Damar Truck Deck primarily consists of lockable
repositionable storage units.




9

 

  

The Company
cannot effect this agreement until its raises the funds necessary
to the acquisition of such assets as listed in the
agreement.

 

In October
2014, HSR Technology, Inc. as the equitable owner of four tax
parcels located within West Manchester Township, York, PA filed a
request for landowner curative amendment with the local township,
with the intent of constructing facilities on the properties for
the fabrication, assembly and welding of steel, aluminum and
stainless steel assemblies with no foundry or casting operations.
The use will include the fabrication and assembly of composite
rebar, composite rail, bed liners and rail car assemblies received
pre-prepared. The rail access is critical to the procurement of the
land, as the products manufactured on site will be directly related
to the company purpose of creating global economic development and
promoting trade by bringing people together through innovative
ideas and advanced technology.  HSR Technology, Inc. proposes
the initial construction of a transfer and storage building with a
rail siding into the building. Manufacturing and assembly buildings
would be added in stages, eventually employing up to 2,800
workers.

Port Trajan
Project

The Port Trajan
5 project is a transportation project located in the Antrim
Township, Greencastle, Pennsylvania on the Interstate 81 corridor
and the railroad "Crescent Corridor", a 2,500 mile network of rail
and terminals.  Norfolk Southern is operating a rail-truck
facility in this corridor and the State of Pennsylvania has
provided funding toward the development of additional facilities
along this corridor.  The Company envisions the development of
the land next to such corridor, which it has termed the Port Trajan
Project.  The Company anticipates that it will construct a
distribution center consisting of a terminal and a rail line
between the main rail tracks to the highway for the transition of
shipping containers from the rail line to waiting trucks.  The
distribution center will provide the facility for repackaging the
shipments into containers or other shipments destined for final
destination by truck.  

The Company
anticipates that such project will be completed in phases the first
of which is the purchase of an initial 345 acres at $350,000 per
acre.  The purchase price will include all on-site horizontal
improvements.  Off-site improvements will be acquired at an
additional $20,000,000. The land is currently owned by a related
company and the Company has entered into a letter of intent for its
purchase.

On January 9,
2013, the Company signed a letter of intent with a related party to
purchase land for a potential future project.  The Company was
unable to meet the deposit requirements of this contract, and so in
November 2013 the deposit requirements were amended to require a
cash deposit of $1,000, which has been paid, to hold the purchase
option open for the Company until institutional funding is
acquired.  Future plans are to issue in excess of 10,000,000
shares of common stock to aid in funding the land purchase.
 

On January 13,
2013 the Company entered into a Letter of Intent with a related
party, to contract for services for the build out of the Port
Trajan 5 Terminals.

On February 19,
2014, the Company entered into a Master Agreement for Production
Services with Platinum Media whereby Platinum Media will provide
the Company with all of its media development needs for a 5 year
term.  The agreement states that the fees charged to the
Company will be no less than $12,000,000 per year, once we have
received funding and begun executing on our business plan and
Platinum Media has begun providing substantial services to ARMT.
 At July 31, 2016, the Company has not incurred fees to by
Platinum Media.

 

The
Market

 

The Company
believes that the United States suffers from an overburdened
transportation infrastructure and that a fundamental overhaul of
the dilapidated national transportation structure is needed
according to Society of Civil Engineering reports (
http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/ ). The Company anticipates
that it will be able to assist in this “ fundamental overhaul
”
by providing
both the hands-on expertise and investment resources to establish
an intermodal grid comprised of transportation and support services
extending to urban and outlying areas alike.

 

The
infrastructure experts believe that there is a compelling need to
revitalize America ’ s transportation
infrastructure. As all levels of government are facing increasing
economic crisis, the Company anticipates that such revitalization
will be the result of public-private partnerships and alliances to
create the basis for developing such an infrastructure.
Organizations,




10

  

such as the
Company, are accordingly poised to play a significant role in the
redevelopment and improvement of the nation ’ s transportation
infrastructure.

 

The 2009 David
R. Goode National Transportation Policy Conference held at the
Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia,
outlined the compelling need to revitalize America
’
s
transportation infrastructure and recommended that
“
Public private
partnerships need to emerge from the laboratory of pilot programs
to play a much larger role as a core element of America
’
s transport
investment strategy. ” Organizations, such as the
Company, are accordingly poised to play a significant role in the
redevelopment and improvement of the nation ’ s transportation
infrastructure. The same transportation conference also noted
that, “ Lacking a coherent vision
for our transportation future and chronically short of resources,
we defer new investments, fail to plan, and allow existing systems
to fall into disrepair. This shortsightedness and under
investment — at the planning level and
on our nation ’ s roads, rails, airports
and waterways — costs the country dearly.
It compromises our productivity and ability to compete
internationally; transportation users pay for the system
’
s
inefficiencies in lost time, money and safety. Rural areas are cut
off from economic opportunities and even urbanites suffer from
inadequate public transportation options. Meanwhile,
transportation-related pollution exacts a heavy toll on our
environment and public health. ”

 

Furthermore,
the conference report was equally insistent on the need for private
sector funding. In “ Recommendation 8:
Connecting the Dots, ” the co-chairs wrote:
“
Resolving the
controversy over private equity contributions to the transport
system is essential to meet the nation ’ s pressing transportation
challenges, as is recognizing the appropriate role of
public-private partnerships (PPPs) in taking on those
challenges. ” They added,
“
PPPs need to
emerge from the laboratory of pilot programs to play a much larger
role as a core element of America ’ s transport investment
strategy. ”

 

To resolve this
crisis will require a massive infusion of capital. The National
Surface Transportation Infrastructure Financing Commission, in its
2009 report Paying Our Way estimates the total shortfall between
what is required and what is available, at all levels of
government, just for maintaining the current system range from $134
billion to $194 billion per year for the period 2008 to 2035. If
the goal is to improve existing transportation systems, the
shortfall is even larger: $189 – $262 billion per year over
the same time period.

 

The main
problem is that the funds to either maintain or improve existing
transportation systems are simply not available from traditional
sources. Taxpayers at all levels of government are loath to support
any tax increases for infrastructure projects. New transportation
systems are frequently discussed at all levels of government but
the public funding for implementing such plans is usually
non-existent.

 

The Company has
met recently with Appalachian Regional Commission. Their region
consists of 420 counties in 13 states, serving more than 25 million
people. Political pressure is increasing to find alternate
transportation systems as the price of gas and environmental risk
of drilling and using petroleum products rises. Highway maintenance
is increasingly expensive as the price of materials and labor
increases.  Highway congestion is an increasing urban problem.
The Company presented a project as a total package thereby
providing the municipalities with the complete overview and
relieving it of the time and costs involved in studying the
proposal, seeking pricing information and projecting results. In
addition, the Company believes that it may be able to effect
economies of scale by purchasing new and renovating existing
equipment and facilities on an integrated regional basis rather
than in fractured individual areas or small municipalities.
 The project also creates many jobs in the areas that the
facilities are located in.

The Non-Profit
High speed Rail Facilities Inc., has been identified in House
Resolution 948 of the 2016 Georgia Legislative Session. High speed
rail will connect freight and passenger services from Georgia to
Alabama and throughout Georgia.

The Company has
met recently with Port of Freeport and Brazoria-Fort Bend Rail
District, , to expand the port operations along with passenger and
freight rail. "Forecasts from the Texas Comptroller of Public
Accounts predict that the U.S. and Texas economies will rebound
from the current recession (in terms of GSP and GDP), and grow at
2.6 percent and 3.37 percent, respectively, on average, per year
between 2010 and 2035.  An efficient and well-maintained
transportation system is vital to the state
‘
s ability
to remain economically competitive at home and
abroad."

strategy.

 

The Company is
facing solid growth for next 20 years or more. According to
“
McKinsey Global
Institute- The McKinsey Infrastructure Practice Report- January
2013; confirms that $57 to $67 trillion dollars of investment is
needed for infrastructure from 2013 to 2030. Due to robust
infrastructure market and a tremendous back log of infrastructure
projects on hand, along with anticipated projects identified by the
Company ’ s infrastructure projects
consultants, TEMS, Inc., management believed that market conditions
warranted that the Company reconsider its capital structure and in
September 2014 we amended our Certificate of Incorporation to
increase our authorized shares. Market conditions were further
supported by “ The Boeing Current Market
Outlook 2012-2013 report ” which shows an 80 % growth
over next 20 years for cargo fleet.

 

Entry of the
Company into the Market

 

The Company
anticipates that it can offer a comprehensive, innovative approach
to resolving the nation ’ s transportation crisis.
And it proposes doing so without the necessity of the government
increasing taxes at any level, or in any manner. In short, the
Company suggests replacing public financing with private
funding.

 

The primary
competitive barrier most companies face in attempting to impact the
nation ’ s infrastructure crisis is
that they approach the overall problem in disparate segments. For
example, one provider proposes building railroad cars, while
another proposes laying tracks. A third is interested in depots,
while a fourth focuses on accommodations. None bring a
comprehensive plan for full-funding to the mix. On the other hand,
the Company takes an intermodal approach to providing seamless
service with a scale of economy. For example the high-speed rail
plan will utilize existing rail rights-of-way to connect several
metropolitan areas and states serving expanding
populations.

 

The Company
through related parties also foresees pursuing joint ventures with
other industries related to the transportation industry. For
example, HSR Technologies it is currently finalizing an arrangement
with a major manufacturer of certain materials used in the
construction of highways and other transportation systems. The
discussions contemplate a two-fold transaction by which the Company
would initially buy the manufacturing plant and then subsequently
purchase the remaining non-cash assets of the company.

Competition


 


The Company may
face significant competition from other companies that may be
developing competing transportation systems.  The Company
will, however, face competition in the allocation of monetary
resources from governmental agencies, at the local, regional, state
and federal levels. The Company believes that government agencies
will strongly endorse its proposed plan for high-speed regional
rail systems, but believes that, given the economic environment,
there may be few or no funds available for such
development.

 

Nevertheless,
as an example, traditionally significant competition generally
exists in the industry, from government agencies and entities. Due
to the federal budgetary constraints, henceforth any completion
would come from private or public entities. On the heels of the
Department of Transportation ’ s recent request for
high-speed rail proposals, its Federal Railroad Administration
received 132 applications from 32 states totaling $8.8 billion.
That was more than three times the $2.4 billion available. During
the first round of awards in the fall of 2009, applicants submitted
more than $55 billion in project proposals. That was nearly six
times the initial $8 billion available from the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act. Unfortunately, due to federal budgetary
setbacks, as of 2016, very little of this has come to
fruition.

accrued. The Company has also issued stock to employees for their
consulting and professional services. At the time the Company
launches its planned IPO, the Company will pay these
employees.

The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Shares.


The Company may face significant competition from other companies that may be
developing high speed rail passenger and freight transportation systems.  As
this industry is not well developed in the United States to date, such
competition that may exist is primarily in the development and planning stages.
The Company will, however, face competition in the allocation of monetary
resources from governmental agencies, at the local, regional, state and federal
levels. The Company believes that government agencies will strongly endorse its
proposed plan for high-speed regional rail systems, but believes that, given 
the economic environment, there may be few or no funds available for such 
development. 

Nevertheless, it appears that significant competition generally exists in the
industry, from private organizations or government agencies and entities. On the
heels of the Department of Transportation’s recent request for high-speed rail
proposals, its Federal Railroad Administration received 132 applications from 32
states totaling $8.8 billion. That was more than three times the $2.4 billion
available. During the first round of awards in the fall of 2009, applicants
submitted more than $55 billion in project proposals. That was nearly six times
the initial $8 billion available from the American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act. So overwhelming has the response been that Transportation Secretary LaHood
observed at the time, that, “Demand for high-speed rail dollars is intense and
it demonstrates just how important this historic initiative is. States
understand that high-speed rail represents a unique opportunity to create jobs,
revitalize our manufacturing base, spur economic development and provide people
with an environmentally friendly transportation option.”


Company Description
The Company intends to focus on high-speed rail for passenger and freight
transportation and related and ancillary transportation businesses. The Company
anticipates that it will provide various services for high-speed rail throughout
the United States. The Company intends to secure manufacturing


 and technologies
together with ancillary land development projects, sale of goods and services to
government, civilian and commercial end users.

The Company anticipates that it will, directly or through subsidiaries, develop
plans, and then coordinate and supervise the financing, construction and
development of such transportation projects by bringing together the resources,
plans, financing, approvals and technology needed to implement such
transportation systems.

The Company has no revenue producing operations to date. The Company intends to
develop numerous projects as opportunities are presented primarily in the
transportation or transportation-related fields. The Company believes that the
need, demand and usage of alternative transportation such as high speed rail are
increasingly important as the United States adopts policies to attempt to 
reduce its dependency on fossil fuels, particularly the automobile. The Company
intends to develop and prepare the designs and concepts for feasible and 
profitable regional high-speed rail projects utilizing existing and new 
railbeds, stations, and equipment. The Company will prepare the complete 
project package including appraisals and estimates and will obtain contracts 
for the development of the railbeds and purchase of the equipment. The Company 
will present the complete project, working as project supervisor and 
coordinator, to municipalities and regional government agencies. In addition to
high speed rail projects, the Company will also develop other selected 
transportation-related projects that promote efficient and improved 
transportation structures or plans. 

Funding for individual projects of the Company will occur from bond offerings
organized through various non-profit entities and organizations sponsored or
affiliated with municipal and government agencies.  Certain of these non-profit
entities or organizations may themselves be affiliated with, or related to, the
Company and assist, or work in conjunction with, the Company in securing
contracts and funds to develop projects.

Through its subsidiary, GTI, the Company is also involved in the development of
a new toll road in the State of Alabama.  The Company acquired from Penndel Land
Company (a company majority owned by the president of the Ameri Metro) the
contract rights to a construction agreement with the Alabama Toll Facilities,
Inc. ("ATFI", a non-profit company designated by the State of Alabama to act as
the project developer for such a toll road and on which the president of Ameri
Metro served as one of its four directors).  As such the Company has the
development rights for such toll road.  The Company will need to secure the
financing for the design, planning, engineering and related costs for the
construction of the toll road.  As the Company is able to secure such financing,
ATFI will effect a bond offering to purchase the land on which the toll road is
to be located.

	As has been previously reported, Public Service Company of New Mexico (“PNM”), a wholly owned subsidiary of PNM Resources, Inc., leases interests in Units 1 and 2 of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station (“PVNGS”) under arrangements entered into in 1985 and 1986 that are accounted for as operating leases. There are currently eight separate lease agreements with eight different trusts whose beneficial owners are four different institutional investors. Four of those leases, which relate to interests in PVNGS Unit 1 (the “Unit 1 Leases”), expire on January 15, 2015, and four of those leases, which relate to interests in PVNGS Unit 2 (the “Unit 2 Leases”), expire on January 15, 2016.









	Under the terms of each of the leases, PNM has an option to purchase the leased assets at fair market value at the end of the leases, but does not have a fixed price purchase option. In addition, PNM has options to renew the leases at fixed rates set forth in each of the leases for two years beyond the termination of the original lease terms. The option periods on certain leases may be further extended for up to an additional six years (the “Maximum Option Period”) if the appraised remaining useful lives and fair value of the leased assets are greater than parameters set forth in the leases. If PNM elects to extend the leases, it will have the option to purchase the leased assets at fair market value at the end of the extended lease terms.









	Each lease provides that no later than three years prior to the expiration of the lease, PNM must give notice to the lessor if it wishes to “retain” the leased assets (but without specifying whether it would purchase the leased assets or extend the lease) or “return” the leased assets to the lessor. Furthermore, each lease provides that, if PNM gives notice to “retain” the leased assets, PNM must give notice as to which of the purchase or renewal options it will exercise no later than two years prior to the expiration of the lease. The elections PNM makes under each of the leases are independent of the elections made under the other leases.









	On January 6, 2012, in accordance with the notice provisions, PNM notified each of the lessors of the Unit 1 Leases that it would “retain” the assets leased under that lease upon expiration of the basic lease term on January 15, 2015 and provide notice by January 15, 2013, of which of the options it would exercise, that is, whether on January 15, 2015 it will extend the lease or purchase the leased assets. On January 9, 2013, in accordance with the notice provisions, PNM notified each of the lessors of the Unit 1 Leases that it will extend each Unit 1 Lease for the Maximum Option Period.









	On January 9, 2013, in accordance with the notice provisions, PNM notified each of the lessors of the Unit 2 Leases that PNM will “retain” the assets leased under that lease upon the expiration of the basic lease term on January 15, 2016. PNM will be required to specify by notice to each of the lessors by January 15, 2014, which of the alternatives it will select, that is, whether on January 15, 2016 it will extend each Unit 2 Lease or purchase the leased assets. One of the Unit 2 Leases is subject to the Maximum Option Period lease extension provision, while the other three Unit 2 Leases do not contain that provision.









	The following table provides a summary of certain aspects of the Unit 1 Leases and Unit 2 Leases described above.
