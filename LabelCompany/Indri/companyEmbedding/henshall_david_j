Fort Lauderdale-based Citrix Systems (CTXS  -  Free Report)	 named David J. Henshall as its new president and chief executive officer (CEO) with immediate effect. He has also becomes a board member at Citrix.Prior to his elevation to the top post, Henshall had served as Citrix’s chief financial officer and chief operating officer for over a decade. Henshall has succeeded Kirill Tatarinov as the CEO. In fact, Tatarinov’s decision to step down was based on a mutual agreement.Notably, Mark M. Coyle was appointed as chief financial officer (on an interim basis) in place of Henshall as part of the other managerial changes. Also, an Operations and Capital committee has been formed with an aim to drive long-term growth and profitability.The committee will have Citrix’s Executive Chairman, Robert Calderoni at its helm. Other members are Henshall and directors of the company- Jesse Cohn and Peter J. Sacripanti.Lack of Stability at the Top The appointment of Henshall implies that Citrix has had four CEOs in less than two years. The frequent changes at the helm did not find favor with investors. Consequently, the stock declined in after-market trading on Jul 10.Notably, Citrix’s shares have underperformed the Zacks categorized Computer-Software industry in the last one year. While the stock was up 20%, the industry’s gained 28.7% in the same period.We remind investors that Tatarinov had been appointed as the company’s CEO replacing Calderoni in Jan 2016. Calderoni had served as Citrix’s CEO since Oct 2015, following the retirement of Mark Templeton.We note that Tatarinov had previously served in companies like Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report)	.Apart from the frequent changes at the top, Citrix has faced challenges from other quarters as well. Citrix spun off its GoTo family of products following pressure from activist investment firm Elliott Management. Additionally, Citrix is struggling on the top-line front which is evident from its 19.74% year-over-year decline in revenues in the first quarter of 2017.Given this gloomy background, now it remains to be seen whether the appointment of Henshall yields the desired results as the company expects to increase its profitability and find favor with shareholders.Q2 Guidance MaintainedThe company said that it will release its second quarter results on Aug 2. Citrix still expects net revenue in the band of $685 million to $695 million for the second quarter. Also, earnings per share (on an adjusted basis) are anticipated to be in the range of 97 cents to $1.00.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues and earnings per share is $690.42 million and 85 cents, respectively.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCitrix currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the broader computer and technology sector include Nokia Corporation (NOK  -  Free Report)	 and Asure Software (ASUR  -  Free Report)	, with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shares of Nokia and Asure Software foresee healthy earnings per share growth rate of 18.9% and 25%, respectively, for the next three to five years.More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like Run                                                                                                  Did you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007? Now 2017 looks to be a pivotal year to get in on another emerging technology expected to rock the market. Demand could soar from almost nothing to $42 billion by 2025. Reports suggest it could save 10 million lives per decade which could in turn save $200 billion in U.S. healthcare costs.A bonus Zacks Special Report names this breakthrough and the 8 best stocks to exploit it.

Citrix suddenly changes CEO: Tatarinov out, COO David Henshall in
'Mutual separation decision' after just 18 months in the job


                        
                            By Simon Sharwood, APAC Editor

                            12 Jul 2017 at 01:19
                        


SHARE ▼

























Citrix has announced a bolt-from-the-blue change of CEO.
The company says its board and immediate-past-CEO Kirill Tatarinov reached a “mutual separation decision” that will see him depart the company. David J. Henshall, previously the company's chief financial officer and chief operations officer, now glories in the titles of CEO, president and member of the company's board.
Citrix's canned statement says the change was made ahead of plans to introduce “a series of strategic initiatives intended to drive operating margin expansion, increase capital return and facilitate further investment in accelerating Citrix’s transformation to a cloud-based subscription business and in high-growth areas, such as data security and analytics services.”
That “transformation” was flagged in the company's Q1 2017 results announcement, so we cannot image Tatarinov was unaware of it or was not involved in its preparation.
Citix's statement offers nothing more than the board's belief that “We now have the right team in place to execute on that vision.”
Which begs the question about why Tatarinov was not felt to be “right”.
Tatarinov took the job in January 2016 and, to The Register's mind, did pretty well. On his watch the company and pocketed shed its GoTo product lines and pocketed a cool US$2bn, improved profitability and forged alliances that saw Cisco and Microsoft send customers its way in preference to their own wares.
On the downside, growth was slow on his watch and while Citrix's core products did well, plans for growth were not obvious. The company also faced rumours the company was for sale, which Tatarinov did not definitively deny.
Perhaps that's where the difference of opinion lay: the announcement of Tatarinov makes much of plans to return capital to investors. One way to do that is with a sale. Another is with a new strategy. The Register wonders if the former CEO didn't think investors would be best-served by Citrix trying to innovate its way to a more pleasing balance sheet, but the board felt that was the best approach. Such a difference of opinion would be unsustainable.
Whatever the reasons for the change, Citrix says it will reveal its new plans on its next earnings call in early August. El Reg will tune in to bear witnesses at the new birth of Citrix, Mark 2, in the hope you enjoy its new direction. ®

Citrix appoints David J Henshall as President and CEO

 by Pippa Sanderson   17 July, 2017



David J Henshall, new President and CEO at Citrix.

Citrix Systems has announced that its board of directors has appointed David J Henshall, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer of Citrix, as President, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and a member of the board with immediate effect. Mr Henshall’s appointment follows the mutual decision to separate the Citrix board and Kirill Tatarinov, President, CEO and Director of Citrix.    
The Citrix board has identified the leadership team to drive the company’s long-term strategy and growth, led by David Henshall. In addition to product excellence and growth, Citrix is committed to operational efficiency and value creation. This includes a series of strategic initiatives intended to drive operating margin expansion, increase capital return and facilitate further investment in accelerating Citrix’s transformation to a cloud-based subscription business and in high-growth areas, such as data security and analytics services. 
“David is a proven leader who knows our company inside and out, and the board has the utmost confidence in him,” said Robert Calderoni, Executive Chairman of the Citrix board. “Moving forward, the board believes that accelerating our cloud transformation will position the company for even greater success in the years ahead, driving greater value for our shareholders. We now have the right team in place to execute that vision.” 
David Henshall said, “We have a talented team at Citrix and I am honoured to lead Citrix through this new chapter. We have created an impressive platform of best-in-class products and services that customers and partners rely on every day to embrace the future of work. I can assure you that we will continue to deliver and innovate for our customers and partners as we move forward as a more powerful Citrix.”
Mr Calderoni concluded, “On behalf of the entire Citrix board, I want to thank Kirill for his leadership. The progress we made under his leadership has positioned Citrix well for the next phase of its corporate transformation.”

Tatarinov Out As Citrix CEO, COO Henshall Named New President And CEO

Kirill Tatarinov is out as president and CEO of Citrix Systems and the company's board has named David J. Henshall, currently the company's CFO and chief operating officer, as the new CEO and president.
The management changes follow "the mutual separation decision between the Citrix board and Kirill Tatarinov," the company said in a statement late Monday. The company gave no additional details about the reasons for the management change.
Tatarinov, a former Microsoft applications executive, was hired in January 2016 as Citrix's president and CEO. He replaced former CEO Mark Templeton, who stepped down after the company went through a turbulent year.

Citrix, in its statement, made it clear that its appointment of Henshall as the new president and CEO is not a temporary measure.
"The Citrix board has identified the leadership team to drive the company’s long-term strategy and growth, led by David Henshall," the company said.
"David is a proven leader who knows our company inside and out, and the board has the utmost confidence in him," said Robert Calderoni, executive chairman of the Citrix board, in the statement. "Moving forward, the board believes that accelerating our cloud transformation will position the company for even greater success in the years ahead, driving greater value for our shareholders. We now have the right team in place to execute on that vision."
Calderoni, in the statement, thanks Tatarinov for his leadership, adding that: "The progress we made under his leadership has positioned Citrix well for the next phase of its corporate transformation."
The Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.-based company also said that with Henshall moving up to become president and CEO, senior vice president of finance Mark Coyle has been named interim CFO to fill the vacancy. The company said it has retained an executive search firm to find a new CFO, "with both internal and external candidates being considered."
"In addition to product excellence and growth, Citrix is committed to operational efficiency and value creation," the company's statement said. "This includes a series of strategic initiatives intended to drive operating margin expansion, increase capital return and facilitate further investment in accelerating Citrix's transformation to a cloud-based subscription business and in high-growth areas, such as data security and analytics services. Citrix will provide additional details on these initiatives on the upcoming second quarter earnings call," the statement said.
The company, a developer of virtualization, networking and file sharing software, said it would provide more information about those initiatives during its second quarter earnings call, now scheduled for Aug. 2. The company also said it is reaffirming its guidance for its second quarter, ended June 30, with revenue expected to be in the range of $685 million to $695 million.
The company also said it has formed an Operations and Capital Committee to work with Citrix management and advise the board "on a comprehensive review of opportunities to drive margin expansion and return capital to shareholders." Calderoni and Henshall will sit on the committee, along with two other directors.
On Feb. 1 Citrix completed the spin-off of its GoTo business, which was merged with LogMeIn in a transaction valued at $1.8 billion.

Citrix suddenly changes CEO: Tatarinov out, COO David Henshall in
'Mutual separation decision' after just 18 months in the job


                        
                            By Simon Sharwood, APAC Editor

                            12 Jul 2017 at 01:19
                        


SHARE ▼

























Citrix has announced a bolt-from-the-blue change of CEO.
The company says its board and immediate-past-CEO Kirill Tatarinov reached a “mutual separation decision” that will see him depart the company. David J. Henshall, previously the company's chief financial officer and chief operations officer, now glories in the titles of CEO, president and member of the company's board.
Citrix's canned statement says the change was made ahead of plans to introduce “a series of strategic initiatives intended to drive operating margin expansion, increase capital return and facilitate further investment in accelerating Citrix’s transformation to a cloud-based subscription business and in high-growth areas, such as data security and analytics services.”
That “transformation” was flagged in the company's Q1 2017 results announcement, so we cannot image Tatarinov was unaware of it or was not involved in its preparation.
Citix's statement offers nothing more than the board's belief that “We now have the right team in place to execute on that vision.”
Which begs the question about why Tatarinov was not felt to be “right”.
Tatarinov took the job in January 2016 and, to The Register's mind, did pretty well. On his watch the company and pocketed shed its GoTo product lines and pocketed a cool US$2bn, improved profitability and forged alliances that saw Cisco and Microsoft send customers its way in preference to their own wares.
On the downside, growth was slow on his watch and while Citrix's core products did well, plans for growth were not obvious. The company also faced rumours the company was for sale, which Tatarinov did not definitively deny.
Perhaps that's where the difference of opinion lay: the announcement of Tatarinov makes much of plans to return capital to investors. One way to do that is with a sale. Another is with a new strategy. The Register wonders if the former CEO didn't think investors would be best-served by Citrix trying to innovate its way to a more pleasing balance sheet, but the board felt that was the best approach. Such a difference of opinion would be unsustainable.
Whatever the reasons for the change, Citrix says it will reveal its new plans on its next earnings call in early August. El Reg will tune in to bear witnesses at the new birth of Citrix, Mark 2, in the hope you enjoy its new direction. ®
