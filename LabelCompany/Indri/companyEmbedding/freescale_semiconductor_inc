History[edit]
Freescale was one of the first semiconductor companies in the world, having started as a division of Motorola in Phoenix, Arizona in 1948[3] and then becoming autonomous by the divestiture of the Semiconductor Products Sector of Motorola in 2004. In 1955, a Motorola transistor for car radios was the world's first commercial high-power transistor. It was also Motorola's first mass-produced semiconductor device.
In the 1960s, one of the U.S. space program's goals was to land a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth. In 1968, NASA began manned Apollo flights that led to the first lunar landing in July 1969. The Apollo program was particularly significant for hundreds of employees involved in designing, testing and producing its electronics. The division of Motorola which would eventually become Freescale Semiconductor, supplied thousands of semiconductor devices, ground-based tracking and checkout equipment, and 12 on-board tracking and communications units. An "up-data link" in the Apollo's command module received signals from Earth to relay to other on-board systems. A transponder received and transmitted voice and television signals and scientific data.[4]
Also that year[clarification needed], Motorola's technologies were used to introduce the first two-way mobile radio with a fully transistorized power supply and receiver for cars.[5]
Motorola has continued its growth in the networking and communications sector in later years, providing the tools behind the radio transponder, and going on to develop the first prototype of the first analog mobile phone in 1973.[6]
The company's first microprocessor (MC6800 8-bit) was introduced in 1974, and was used in automotive, computing and video game applications.[7]
Motorola's next generation 32-bit microprocessor, the MC68000, led the wave of technologies that spurred the computing revolution in 1984, powering devices from companies such as Apple, Commodore, Atari, Sega, Sun, and Hewlett-Packard.[8]
In the 1990s, Motorola's technology was the driving force behind intelligent power switches for anti-lock brake systems, one of the first microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) inertial sensor for automotive airbags, and Motorola's MPC5200 microprocessor deployed telematic systems for General Motors' OnStar systems.[9]
Since then, Freescale continued to provide the technology behind consumer, medical, networking and automotive products from microprocessors for the world's first tubing-free wireless insulin pump,[10] to and automotive microcontrollers for efficient engine design. Freescale's motion-sensing accelerometer powers the interactivity of the Guitar Hero video games.[11] The number one provider of eReader processors worldwide was Freescale.[12] In 2009, Freescale demonstrated the world's lowest startup voltage single inductor DC/DC converter for use in solar and thermoelectric energy harvesting applications.[13]
In 2011, the company launched the industry's first multimode wireless base station processor family that scales from small to large cells – integrating DSP and communications processor technologies to realize a true "base station-on-chip".[14] In addition, a recent ABI Research market study report states that Freescale owns 60% share of the radio frequency (RF) semiconductor device market.
Also in 2011, Freescale announced the company's first magnetometer for location tracking in smart mobile devices.[15] With the partnership of McLaren Electronic Systems, they helped the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series vehicles convert from carburetors to fuel injection starting in 2012.[16][17][18]
On March 8, 2014, Freescale announced that 20 of its employees were passengers aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. That plane, carrying the Freescale employees, was lost,[19] with only small part of it found over a year later.
In March 2015, a merger agreement was announced through which Freescale Semiconductor would be acquired by NXP Semiconductors and that the companies would be merged to form a US$40 (equivalent to $40.42 in 2016) billion company.[20][21] The acquisition closed on December 7, 2015.
Kinetis[edit]
On February 26, 2013, Freescale Semiconductor announced the creation of the world's physically smallest ARM-powered chip. The Kinetis KL02 measures 1.9 by 2 millimeters and is a full microcontroller unit (MCU), means that the chip supports a processor, RAM, ROM, clock and I/O control unit. The chip competes with the Atmel M0+ offerings, which are the low-power leaders in the industry.[22] One application that Freescale says the chips could be used for is swallowable computers. Freescale already works with a variety of health and wellness customers. Both the Fitbit and OmniPod insulin pump use Freescale chips. The new chip was on display at 'Embedded World' in Nuernberg, Germany, from February 26–28, 2013.[23]
Up to now devices with leading letter codes L, E, M, W containing ARM Cortex-M0+ cores and letter code K or KW containing ARM Cortex-M4 cores are known (see also the related section in the List of Freescale products).
Products[edit]
In August 2014, Freescale Semiconductor introduced a range of fully programmable wireless charging chip and reference designs for consumer and automotive applications. The new chipset is certified to work with both the Wireless Power Consortium's Qi wireless standard and the Power Matters Alliances charging specifications.[24]
Freescale focused primarily on automotive applications and is second in market share in automotive applications to Renesas Electronics. Due to this focus and exposure it is expected that car-sharing applications like Zipcar will have a significant negative impact on future Freescale revenues.[25]
Financials[edit]
Motorola announced that their semiconductor division would be divested on October 6, 2003 to create Freescale. Freescale completed its IPO on July 16, 2004.
On September 15, 2006, Freescale agreed to a $17.6 billion buyout by a consortium led by Blackstone Group and its co-investors, Carlyle Group, TPG Capital, and Permira.[26] The buyout offer was accepted on November 13, 2006 following a vote by company shareholders. The purchase, which closed on December 1, 2006, was the largest private buyout of a technology company until the Dell buyout of 2013 and is one of the ten largest buyouts of all time.[27]
Freescale filed to go public on February 11, 2011 and completed its IPO on May 26, 2011. Freescale is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol FSL. At the time of the IPO, the company had $7.6 billion in outstanding debt on its books,[28] and the company is being investigated for misconduct related to this IPO.[29]
Litigation[edit]
Freescale is being sued by Marvell Semiconductor for infringing seven patents held by Marvell. The case is being litigated in the US District Court for the West District of Texas.[30] Freescale recently lost a patent infringement lawsuit filed by Tessera Corporation and was forced to pay an undisclosed amount as part of the settlement.[31]
Competitors[edit]
Freescale competes with a host of other silicon vendors, including Marvell Semiconductor, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, Intel, AMD, Toshiba, ST Microelectronics, Infineon, NEC Corporation, Nvidia, Microchip Technology, Renesas, VIA Technologies, and Samsung Electronics.[32]
Zune bug[edit]
Clock driver software written by Freescale was responsible for the 2008 Zune leap year bug.[33][34]

History[edit]
Freescale was one of the first semiconductor companies in the world, having started as a division of Motorola in Phoenix, Arizona in 1948[3] and then becoming autonomous by the divestiture of the Semiconductor Products Sector of Motorola in 2004. In 1955, a Motorola transistor for car radios was the world's first commercial high-power transistor. It was also Motorola's first mass-produced semiconductor device.
In the 1960s, one of the U.S. space program's goals was to land a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth. In 1968, NASA began manned Apollo flights that led to the first lunar landing in July 1969. The Apollo program was particularly significant for hundreds of employees involved in designing, testing and producing its electronics. The division of Motorola which would eventually become Freescale Semiconductor, supplied thousands of semiconductor devices, ground-based tracking and checkout equipment, and 12 on-board tracking and communications units. An "up-data link" in the Apollo's command module received signals from Earth to relay to other on-board systems. A transponder received and transmitted voice and television signals and scientific data.[4]
Also that year[clarification needed], Motorola's technologies were used to introduce the first two-way mobile radio with a fully transistorized power supply and receiver for cars.[5]
Motorola has continued its growth in the networking and communications sector in later years, providing the tools behind the radio transponder, and going on to develop the first prototype of the first analog mobile phone in 1973.[6]
The company's first microprocessor (MC6800 8-bit) was introduced in 1974, and was used in automotive, computing and video game applications.[7]
Motorola's next generation 32-bit microprocessor, the MC68000, led the wave of technologies that spurred the computing revolution in 1984, powering devices from companies such as Apple, Commodore, Atari, Sega, Sun, and Hewlett-Packard.[8]
In the 1990s, Motorola's technology was the driving force behind intelligent power switches for anti-lock brake systems, one of the first microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) inertial sensor for automotive airbags, and Motorola's MPC5200 microprocessor deployed telematic systems for General Motors' OnStar systems.[9]
Since then, Freescale continued to provide the technology behind consumer, medical, networking and automotive products from microprocessors for the world's first tubing-free wireless insulin pump,[10] to and automotive microcontrollers for efficient engine design. Freescale's motion-sensing accelerometer powers the interactivity of the Guitar Hero video games.[11] The number one provider of eReader processors worldwide was Freescale.[12] In 2009, Freescale demonstrated the world's lowest startup voltage single inductor DC/DC converter for use in solar and thermoelectric energy harvesting applications.[13]
In 2011, the company launched the industry's first multimode wireless base station processor family that scales from small to large cells – integrating DSP and communications processor technologies to realize a true "base station-on-chip".[14] In addition, a recent ABI Research market study report states that Freescale owns 60% share of the radio frequency (RF) semiconductor device market.
Also in 2011, Freescale announced the company's first magnetometer for location tracking in smart mobile devices.[15] With the partnership of McLaren Electronic Systems, they helped the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series vehicles convert from carburetors to fuel injection starting in 2012.[16][17][18]
On March 8, 2014, Freescale announced that 20 of its employees were passengers aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. That plane, carrying the Freescale employees, was lost,[19] with only small part of it found over a year later.
In March 2015, a merger agreement was announced through which Freescale Semiconductor would be acquired by NXP Semiconductors and that the companies would be merged to form a US$40 (equivalent to $40.42 in 2016) billion company.[20][21] The acquisition closed on December 7, 2015.
Kinetis[edit]
On February 26, 2013, Freescale Semiconductor announced the creation of the world's physically smallest ARM-powered chip. The Kinetis KL02 measures 1.9 by 2 millimeters and is a full microcontroller unit (MCU), means that the chip supports a processor, RAM, ROM, clock and I/O control unit. The chip competes with the Atmel M0+ offerings, which are the low-power leaders in the industry.[22] One application that Freescale says the chips could be used for is swallowable computers. Freescale already works with a variety of health and wellness customers. Both the Fitbit and OmniPod insulin pump use Freescale chips. The new chip was on display at 'Embedded World' in Nuernberg, Germany, from February 26–28, 2013.[23]
Up to now devices with leading letter codes L, E, M, W containing ARM Cortex-M0+ cores and letter code K or KW containing ARM Cortex-M4 cores are known (see also the related section in the List of Freescale products).
Products[edit]
In August 2014, Freescale Semiconductor introduced a range of fully programmable wireless charging chip and reference designs for consumer and automotive applications. The new chipset is certified to work with both the Wireless Power Consortium's Qi wireless standard and the Power Matters Alliances charging specifications.[24]
Freescale focused primarily on automotive applications and is second in market share in automotive applications to Renesas Electronics. Due to this focus and exposure it is expected that car-sharing applications like Zipcar will have a significant negative impact on future Freescale revenues.[25]
Financials[edit]
Motorola announced that their semiconductor division would be divested on October 6, 2003 to create Freescale. Freescale completed its IPO on July 16, 2004.
On September 15, 2006, Freescale agreed to a $17.6 billion buyout by a consortium led by Blackstone Group and its co-investors, Carlyle Group, TPG Capital, and Permira.[26] The buyout offer was accepted on November 13, 2006 following a vote by company shareholders. The purchase, which closed on December 1, 2006, was the largest private buyout of a technology company until the Dell buyout of 2013 and is one of the ten largest buyouts of all time.[27]
Freescale filed to go public on February 11, 2011 and completed its IPO on May 26, 2011. Freescale is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol FSL. At the time of the IPO, the company had $7.6 billion in outstanding debt on its books,[28] and the company is being investigated for misconduct related to this IPO.[29]
Litigation[edit]
Freescale is being sued by Marvell Semiconductor for infringing seven patents held by Marvell. The case is being litigated in the US District Court for the West District of Texas.[30] Freescale recently lost a patent infringement lawsuit filed by Tessera Corporation and was forced to pay an undisclosed amount as part of the settlement.[31]
Competitors[edit]
Freescale competes with a host of other silicon vendors, including Marvell Semiconductor, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, Intel, AMD, Toshiba, ST Microelectronics, Infineon, NEC Corporation, Nvidia, Microchip Technology, Renesas, VIA Technologies, and Samsung Electronics.[32]
Zune bug[edit]
Clock driver software written by Freescale was responsible for the 2008 Zune leap year bug.[33][34]

History[edit]
Freescale was one of the first semiconductor companies in the world, having started as a division of Motorola in Phoenix, Arizona in 1948[3] and then becoming autonomous by the divestiture of the Semiconductor Products Sector of Motorola in 2004. In 1955, a Motorola transistor for car radios was the world's first commercial high-power transistor. It was also Motorola's first mass-produced semiconductor device.
In the 1960s, one of the U.S. space program's goals was to land a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth. In 1968, NASA began manned Apollo flights that led to the first lunar landing in July 1969. The Apollo program was particularly significant for hundreds of employees involved in designing, testing and producing its electronics. The division of Motorola which would eventually become Freescale Semiconductor, supplied thousands of semiconductor devices, ground-based tracking and checkout equipment, and 12 on-board tracking and communications units. An "up-data link" in the Apollo's command module received signals from Earth to relay to other on-board systems. A transponder received and transmitted voice and television signals and scientific data.[4]
Also that year[clarification needed], Motorola's technologies were used to introduce the first two-way mobile radio with a fully transistorized power supply and receiver for cars.[5]
Motorola has continued its growth in the networking and communications sector in later years, providing the tools behind the radio transponder, and going on to develop the first prototype of the first analog mobile phone in 1973.[6]
The company's first microprocessor (MC6800 8-bit) was introduced in 1974, and was used in automotive, computing and video game applications.[7]
Motorola's next generation 32-bit microprocessor, the MC68000, led the wave of technologies that spurred the computing revolution in 1984, powering devices from companies such as Apple, Commodore, Atari, Sega, Sun, and Hewlett-Packard.[8]
In the 1990s, Motorola's technology was the driving force behind intelligent power switches for anti-lock brake systems, one of the first microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) inertial sensor for automotive airbags, and Motorola's MPC5200 microprocessor deployed telematic systems for General Motors' OnStar systems.[9]
Since then, Freescale continued to provide the technology behind consumer, medical, networking and automotive products from microprocessors for the world's first tubing-free wireless insulin pump,[10] to and automotive microcontrollers for efficient engine design. Freescale's motion-sensing accelerometer powers the interactivity of the Guitar Hero video games.[11] The number one provider of eReader processors worldwide was Freescale.[12] In 2009, Freescale demonstrated the world's lowest startup voltage single inductor DC/DC converter for use in solar and thermoelectric energy harvesting applications.[13]
In 2011, the company launched the industry's first multimode wireless base station processor family that scales from small to large cells – integrating DSP and communications processor technologies to realize a true "base station-on-chip".[14] In addition, a recent ABI Research market study report states that Freescale owns 60% share of the radio frequency (RF) semiconductor device market.
Also in 2011, Freescale announced the company's first magnetometer for location tracking in smart mobile devices.[15] With the partnership of McLaren Electronic Systems, they helped the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series vehicles convert from carburetors to fuel injection starting in 2012.[16][17][18]
On March 8, 2014, Freescale announced that 20 of its employees were passengers aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. That plane, carrying the Freescale employees, was lost,[19] with only small part of it found over a year later.
In March 2015, a merger agreement was announced through which Freescale Semiconductor would be acquired by NXP Semiconductors and that the companies would be merged to form a US$40 (equivalent to $40.42 in 2016) billion company.[20][21] The acquisition closed on December 7, 2015.
Kinetis[edit]
On February 26, 2013, Freescale Semiconductor announced the creation of the world's physically smallest ARM-powered chip. The Kinetis KL02 measures 1.9 by 2 millimeters and is a full microcontroller unit (MCU), means that the chip supports a processor, RAM, ROM, clock and I/O control unit. The chip competes with the Atmel M0+ offerings, which are the low-power leaders in the industry.[22] One application that Freescale says the chips could be used for is swallowable computers. Freescale already works with a variety of health and wellness customers. Both the Fitbit and OmniPod insulin pump use Freescale chips. The new chip was on display at 'Embedded World' in Nuernberg, Germany, from February 26–28, 2013.[23]
Up to now devices with leading letter codes L, E, M, W containing ARM Cortex-M0+ cores and letter code K or KW containing ARM Cortex-M4 cores are known (see also the related section in the List of Freescale products).
Products[edit]
In August 2014, Freescale Semiconductor introduced a range of fully programmable wireless charging chip and reference designs for consumer and automotive applications. The new chipset is certified to work with both the Wireless Power Consortium's Qi wireless standard and the Power Matters Alliances charging specifications.[24]
Freescale focused primarily on automotive applications and is second in market share in automotive applications to Renesas Electronics. Due to this focus and exposure it is expected that car-sharing applications like Zipcar will have a significant negative impact on future Freescale revenues.[25]
Financials[edit]
Motorola announced that their semiconductor division would be divested on October 6, 2003 to create Freescale. Freescale completed its IPO on July 16, 2004.
On September 15, 2006, Freescale agreed to a $17.6 billion buyout by a consortium led by Blackstone Group and its co-investors, Carlyle Group, TPG Capital, and Permira.[26] The buyout offer was accepted on November 13, 2006 following a vote by company shareholders. The purchase, which closed on December 1, 2006, was the largest private buyout of a technology company until the Dell buyout of 2013 and is one of the ten largest buyouts of all time.[27]
Freescale filed to go public on February 11, 2011 and completed its IPO on May 26, 2011. Freescale is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol FSL. At the time of the IPO, the company had $7.6 billion in outstanding debt on its books,[28] and the company is being investigated for misconduct related to this IPO.[29]
Litigation[edit]
Freescale is being sued by Marvell Semiconductor for infringing seven patents held by Marvell. The case is being litigated in the US District Court for the West District of Texas.[30] Freescale recently lost a patent infringement lawsuit filed by Tessera Corporation and was forced to pay an undisclosed amount as part of the settlement.[31]
Competitors[edit]
Freescale competes with a host of other silicon vendors, including Marvell Semiconductor, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, Intel, AMD, Toshiba, ST Microelectronics, Infineon, NEC Corporation, Nvidia, Microchip Technology, Renesas, VIA Technologies, and Samsung Electronics.[32]
Zune bug[edit]
Clock driver software written by Freescale was responsible for the 2008 Zune leap year bug.[33][34]

History[edit]
Freescale was one of the first semiconductor companies in the world, having started as a division of Motorola in Phoenix, Arizona in 1948[3] and then becoming autonomous by the divestiture of the Semiconductor Products Sector of Motorola in 2004. In 1955, a Motorola transistor for car radios was the world's first commercial high-power transistor. It was also Motorola's first mass-produced semiconductor device.
In the 1960s, one of the U.S. space program's goals was to land a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth. In 1968, NASA began manned Apollo flights that led to the first lunar landing in July 1969. The Apollo program was particularly significant for hundreds of employees involved in designing, testing and producing its electronics. The division of Motorola which would eventually become Freescale Semiconductor, supplied thousands of semiconductor devices, ground-based tracking and checkout equipment, and 12 on-board tracking and communications units. An "up-data link" in the Apollo's command module received signals from Earth to relay to other on-board systems. A transponder received and transmitted voice and television signals and scientific data.[4]
Also that year[clarification needed], Motorola's technologies were used to introduce the first two-way mobile radio with a fully transistorized power supply and receiver for cars.[5]
Motorola has continued its growth in the networking and communications sector in later years, providing the tools behind the radio transponder, and going on to develop the first prototype of the first analog mobile phone in 1973.[6]
The company's first microprocessor (MC6800 8-bit) was introduced in 1974, and was used in automotive, computing and video game applications.[7]
Motorola's next generation 32-bit microprocessor, the MC68000, led the wave of technologies that spurred the computing revolution in 1984, powering devices from companies such as Apple, Commodore, Atari, Sega, Sun, and Hewlett-Packard.[8]
In the 1990s, Motorola's technology was the driving force behind intelligent power switches for anti-lock brake systems, one of the first microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) inertial sensor for automotive airbags, and Motorola's MPC5200 microprocessor deployed telematic systems for General Motors' OnStar systems.[9]
Since then, Freescale continued to provide the technology behind consumer, medical, networking and automotive products from microprocessors for the world's first tubing-free wireless insulin pump,[10] to and automotive microcontrollers for efficient engine design. Freescale's motion-sensing accelerometer powers the interactivity of the Guitar Hero video games.[11] The number one provider of eReader processors worldwide was Freescale.[12] In 2009, Freescale demonstrated the world's lowest startup voltage single inductor DC/DC converter for use in solar and thermoelectric energy harvesting applications.[13]
In 2011, the company launched the industry's first multimode wireless base station processor family that scales from small to large cells – integrating DSP and communications processor technologies to realize a true "base station-on-chip".[14] In addition, a recent ABI Research market study report states that Freescale owns 60% share of the radio frequency (RF) semiconductor device market.
Also in 2011, Freescale announced the company's first magnetometer for location tracking in smart mobile devices.[15] With the partnership of McLaren Electronic Systems, they helped the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series vehicles convert from carburetors to fuel injection starting in 2012.[16][17][18]
On March 8, 2014, Freescale announced that 20 of its employees were passengers aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. That plane, carrying the Freescale employees, was lost,[19] with only small part of it found over a year later.
In March 2015, a merger agreement was announced through which Freescale Semiconductor would be acquired by NXP Semiconductors and that the companies would be merged to form a US$40 (equivalent to $40.42 in 2016) billion company.[20][21] The acquisition closed on December 7, 2015.
Kinetis[edit]
On February 26, 2013, Freescale Semiconductor announced the creation of the world's physically smallest ARM-powered chip. The Kinetis KL02 measures 1.9 by 2 millimeters and is a full microcontroller unit (MCU), means that the chip supports a processor, RAM, ROM, clock and I/O control unit. The chip competes with the Atmel M0+ offerings, which are the low-power leaders in the industry.[22] One application that Freescale says the chips could be used for is swallowable computers. Freescale already works with a variety of health and wellness customers. Both the Fitbit and OmniPod insulin pump use Freescale chips. The new chip was on display at 'Embedded World' in Nuernberg, Germany, from February 26–28, 2013.[23]
Up to now devices with leading letter codes L, E, M, W containing ARM Cortex-M0+ cores and letter code K or KW containing ARM Cortex-M4 cores are known (see also the related section in the List of Freescale products).
Products[edit]
In August 2014, Freescale Semiconductor introduced a range of fully programmable wireless charging chip and reference designs for consumer and automotive applications. The new chipset is certified to work with both the Wireless Power Consortium's Qi wireless standard and the Power Matters Alliances charging specifications.[24]
Freescale focused primarily on automotive applications and is second in market share in automotive applications to Renesas Electronics. Due to this focus and exposure it is expected that car-sharing applications like Zipcar will have a significant negative impact on future Freescale revenues.[25]
Financials[edit]
Motorola announced that their semiconductor division would be divested on October 6, 2003 to create Freescale. Freescale completed its IPO on July 16, 2004.
On September 15, 2006, Freescale agreed to a $17.6 billion buyout by a consortium led by Blackstone Group and its co-investors, Carlyle Group, TPG Capital, and Permira.[26] The buyout offer was accepted on November 13, 2006 following a vote by company shareholders. The purchase, which closed on December 1, 2006, was the largest private buyout of a technology company until the Dell buyout of 2013 and is one of the ten largest buyouts of all time.[27]
Freescale filed to go public on February 11, 2011 and completed its IPO on May 26, 2011. Freescale is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol FSL. At the time of the IPO, the company had $7.6 billion in outstanding debt on its books,[28] and the company is being investigated for misconduct related to this IPO.[29]
Litigation[edit]
Freescale is being sued by Marvell Semiconductor for infringing seven patents held by Marvell. The case is being litigated in the US District Court for the West District of Texas.[30] Freescale recently lost a patent infringement lawsuit filed by Tessera Corporation and was forced to pay an undisclosed amount as part of the settlement.[31]
Competitors[edit]
Freescale competes with a host of other silicon vendors, including Marvell Semiconductor, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, Intel, AMD, Toshiba, ST Microelectronics, Infineon, NEC Corporation, Nvidia, Microchip Technology, Renesas, VIA Technologies, and Samsung Electronics.[32]
Zune bug[edit]
Clock driver software written by Freescale was responsible for the 2008 Zune leap year bug.[33][34]

History[edit]
Freescale was one of the first semiconductor companies in the world, having started as a division of Motorola in Phoenix, Arizona in 1948[3] and then becoming autonomous by the divestiture of the Semiconductor Products Sector of Motorola in 2004. In 1955, a Motorola transistor for car radios was the world's first commercial high-power transistor. It was also Motorola's first mass-produced semiconductor device.
In the 1960s, one of the U.S. space program's goals was to land a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth. In 1968, NASA began manned Apollo flights that led to the first lunar landing in July 1969. The Apollo program was particularly significant for hundreds of employees involved in designing, testing and producing its electronics. The division of Motorola which would eventually become Freescale Semiconductor, supplied thousands of semiconductor devices, ground-based tracking and checkout equipment, and 12 on-board tracking and communications units. An "up-data link" in the Apollo's command module received signals from Earth to relay to other on-board systems. A transponder received and transmitted voice and television signals and scientific data.[4]
Also that year[clarification needed], Motorola's technologies were used to introduce the first two-way mobile radio with a fully transistorized power supply and receiver for cars.[5]
Motorola has continued its growth in the networking and communications sector in later years, providing the tools behind the radio transponder, and going on to develop the first prototype of the first analog mobile phone in 1973.[6]
The company's first microprocessor (MC6800 8-bit) was introduced in 1974, and was used in automotive, computing and video game applications.[7]
Motorola's next generation 32-bit microprocessor, the MC68000, led the wave of technologies that spurred the computing revolution in 1984, powering devices from companies such as Apple, Commodore, Atari, Sega, Sun, and Hewlett-Packard.[8]
In the 1990s, Motorola's technology was the driving force behind intelligent power switches for anti-lock brake systems, one of the first microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) inertial sensor for automotive airbags, and Motorola's MPC5200 microprocessor deployed telematic systems for General Motors' OnStar systems.[9]
Since then, Freescale continued to provide the technology behind consumer, medical, networking and automotive products from microprocessors for the world's first tubing-free wireless insulin pump,[10] to and automotive microcontrollers for efficient engine design. Freescale's motion-sensing accelerometer powers the interactivity of the Guitar Hero video games.[11] The number one provider of eReader processors worldwide was Freescale.[12] In 2009, Freescale demonstrated the world's lowest startup voltage single inductor DC/DC converter for use in solar and thermoelectric energy harvesting applications.[13]
In 2011, the company launched the industry's first multimode wireless base station processor family that scales from small to large cells – integrating DSP and communications processor technologies to realize a true "base station-on-chip".[14] In addition, a recent ABI Research market study report states that Freescale owns 60% share of the radio frequency (RF) semiconductor device market.
Also in 2011, Freescale announced the company's first magnetometer for location tracking in smart mobile devices.[15] With the partnership of McLaren Electronic Systems, they helped the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series vehicles convert from carburetors to fuel injection starting in 2012.[16][17][18]
On March 8, 2014, Freescale announced that 20 of its employees were passengers aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. That plane, carrying the Freescale employees, was lost,[19] with only small part of it found over a year later.
In March 2015, a merger agreement was announced through which Freescale Semiconductor would be acquired by NXP Semiconductors and that the companies would be merged to form a US$40 (equivalent to $40.42 in 2016) billion company.[20][21] The acquisition closed on December 7, 2015.
Kinetis[edit]
On February 26, 2013, Freescale Semiconductor announced the creation of the world's physically smallest ARM-powered chip. The Kinetis KL02 measures 1.9 by 2 millimeters and is a full microcontroller unit (MCU), means that the chip supports a processor, RAM, ROM, clock and I/O control unit. The chip competes with the Atmel M0+ offerings, which are the low-power leaders in the industry.[22] One application that Freescale says the chips could be used for is swallowable computers. Freescale already works with a variety of health and wellness customers. Both the Fitbit and OmniPod insulin pump use Freescale chips. The new chip was on display at 'Embedded World' in Nuernberg, Germany, from February 26–28, 2013.[23]
Up to now devices with leading letter codes L, E, M, W containing ARM Cortex-M0+ cores and letter code K or KW containing ARM Cortex-M4 cores are known (see also the related section in the List of Freescale products).
Products[edit]
In August 2014, Freescale Semiconductor introduced a range of fully programmable wireless charging chip and reference designs for consumer and automotive applications. The new chipset is certified to work with both the Wireless Power Consortium's Qi wireless standard and the Power Matters Alliances charging specifications.[24]
Freescale focused primarily on automotive applications and is second in market share in automotive applications to Renesas Electronics. Due to this focus and exposure it is expected that car-sharing applications like Zipcar will have a significant negative impact on future Freescale revenues.[25]
Financials[edit]
Motorola announced that their semiconductor division would be divested on October 6, 2003 to create Freescale. Freescale completed its IPO on July 16, 2004.
On September 15, 2006, Freescale agreed to a $17.6 billion buyout by a consortium led by Blackstone Group and its co-investors, Carlyle Group, TPG Capital, and Permira.[26] The buyout offer was accepted on November 13, 2006 following a vote by company shareholders. The purchase, which closed on December 1, 2006, was the largest private buyout of a technology company until the Dell buyout of 2013 and is one of the ten largest buyouts of all time.[27]
Freescale filed to go public on February 11, 2011 and completed its IPO on May 26, 2011. Freescale is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol FSL. At the time of the IPO, the company had $7.6 billion in outstanding debt on its books,[28] and the company is being investigated for misconduct related to this IPO.[29]
Litigation[edit]
Freescale is being sued by Marvell Semiconductor for infringing seven patents held by Marvell. The case is being litigated in the US District Court for the West District of Texas.[30] Freescale recently lost a patent infringement lawsuit filed by Tessera Corporation and was forced to pay an undisclosed amount as part of the settlement.[31]
Competitors[edit]
Freescale competes with a host of other silicon vendors, including Marvell Semiconductor, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, Intel, AMD, Toshiba, ST Microelectronics, Infineon, NEC Corporation, Nvidia, Microchip Technology, Renesas, VIA Technologies, and Samsung Electronics.[32]
Zune bug[edit]
Clock driver software written by Freescale was responsible for the 2008 Zune leap year bug.[33][34]

History[edit]
Freescale was one of the first semiconductor companies in the world, having started as a division of Motorola in Phoenix, Arizona in 1948[3] and then becoming autonomous by the divestiture of the Semiconductor Products Sector of Motorola in 2004. In 1955, a Motorola transistor for car radios was the world's first commercial high-power transistor. It was also Motorola's first mass-produced semiconductor device.
In the 1960s, one of the U.S. space program's goals was to land a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth. In 1968, NASA began manned Apollo flights that led to the first lunar landing in July 1969. The Apollo program was particularly significant for hundreds of employees involved in designing, testing and producing its electronics. The division of Motorola which would eventually become Freescale Semiconductor, supplied thousands of semiconductor devices, ground-based tracking and checkout equipment, and 12 on-board tracking and communications units. An "up-data link" in the Apollo's command module received signals from Earth to relay to other on-board systems. A transponder received and transmitted voice and television signals and scientific data.[4]
Also that year[clarification needed], Motorola's technologies were used to introduce the first two-way mobile radio with a fully transistorized power supply and receiver for cars.[5]
Motorola has continued its growth in the networking and communications sector in later years, providing the tools behind the radio transponder, and going on to develop the first prototype of the first analog mobile phone in 1973.[6]
The company's first microprocessor (MC6800 8-bit) was introduced in 1974, and was used in automotive, computing and video game applications.[7]
Motorola's next generation 32-bit microprocessor, the MC68000, led the wave of technologies that spurred the computing revolution in 1984, powering devices from companies such as Apple, Commodore, Atari, Sega, Sun, and Hewlett-Packard.[8]
In the 1990s, Motorola's technology was the driving force behind intelligent power switches for anti-lock brake systems, one of the first microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) inertial sensor for automotive airbags, and Motorola's MPC5200 microprocessor deployed telematic systems for General Motors' OnStar systems.[9]
Since then, Freescale continued to provide the technology behind consumer, medical, networking and automotive products from microprocessors for the world's first tubing-free wireless insulin pump,[10] to and automotive microcontrollers for efficient engine design. Freescale's motion-sensing accelerometer powers the interactivity of the Guitar Hero video games.[11] The number one provider of eReader processors worldwide was Freescale.[12] In 2009, Freescale demonstrated the world's lowest startup voltage single inductor DC/DC converter for use in solar and thermoelectric energy harvesting applications.[13]
In 2011, the company launched the industry's first multimode wireless base station processor family that scales from small to large cells – integrating DSP and communications processor technologies to realize a true "base station-on-chip".[14] In addition, a recent ABI Research market study report states that Freescale owns 60% share of the radio frequency (RF) semiconductor device market.
Also in 2011, Freescale announced the company's first magnetometer for location tracking in smart mobile devices.[15] With the partnership of McLaren Electronic Systems, they helped the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series vehicles convert from carburetors to fuel injection starting in 2012.[16][17][18]
On March 8, 2014, Freescale announced that 20 of its employees were passengers aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. That plane, carrying the Freescale employees, was lost,[19] with only small part of it found over a year later.
In March 2015, a merger agreement was announced through which Freescale Semiconductor would be acquired by NXP Semiconductors and that the companies would be merged to form a US$40 (equivalent to $40.42 in 2016) billion company.[20][21] The acquisition closed on December 7, 2015.
Kinetis[edit]
On February 26, 2013, Freescale Semiconductor announced the creation of the world's physically smallest ARM-powered chip. The Kinetis KL02 measures 1.9 by 2 millimeters and is a full microcontroller unit (MCU), means that the chip supports a processor, RAM, ROM, clock and I/O control unit. The chip competes with the Atmel M0+ offerings, which are the low-power leaders in the industry.[22] One application that Freescale says the chips could be used for is swallowable computers. Freescale already works with a variety of health and wellness customers. Both the Fitbit and OmniPod insulin pump use Freescale chips. The new chip was on display at 'Embedded World' in Nuernberg, Germany, from February 26–28, 2013.[23]
Up to now devices with leading letter codes L, E, M, W containing ARM Cortex-M0+ cores and letter code K or KW containing ARM Cortex-M4 cores are known (see also the related section in the List of Freescale products).
Products[edit]
In August 2014, Freescale Semiconductor introduced a range of fully programmable wireless charging chip and reference designs for consumer and automotive applications. The new chipset is certified to work with both the Wireless Power Consortium's Qi wireless standard and the Power Matters Alliances charging specifications.[24]
Freescale focused primarily on automotive applications and is second in market share in automotive applications to Renesas Electronics. Due to this focus and exposure it is expected that car-sharing applications like Zipcar will have a significant negative impact on future Freescale revenues.[25]
Financials[edit]
Motorola announced that their semiconductor division would be divested on October 6, 2003 to create Freescale. Freescale completed its IPO on July 16, 2004.
On September 15, 2006, Freescale agreed to a $17.6 billion buyout by a consortium led by Blackstone Group and its co-investors, Carlyle Group, TPG Capital, and Permira.[26] The buyout offer was accepted on November 13, 2006 following a vote by company shareholders. The purchase, which closed on December 1, 2006, was the largest private buyout of a technology company until the Dell buyout of 2013 and is one of the ten largest buyouts of all time.[27]
Freescale filed to go public on February 11, 2011 and completed its IPO on May 26, 2011. Freescale is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol FSL. At the time of the IPO, the company had $7.6 billion in outstanding debt on its books,[28] and the company is being investigated for misconduct related to this IPO.[29]
Litigation[edit]
Freescale is being sued by Marvell Semiconductor for infringing seven patents held by Marvell. The case is being litigated in the US District Court for the West District of Texas.[30] Freescale recently lost a patent infringement lawsuit filed by Tessera Corporation and was forced to pay an undisclosed amount as part of the settlement.[31]
Competitors[edit]
Freescale competes with a host of other silicon vendors, including Marvell Semiconductor, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, Intel, AMD, Toshiba, ST Microelectronics, Infineon, NEC Corporation, Nvidia, Microchip Technology, Renesas, VIA Technologies, and Samsung Electronics.[32]
Zune bug[edit]
Clock driver software written by Freescale was responsible for the 2008 Zune leap year bug.[33][34]

History[edit]
Freescale was one of the first semiconductor companies in the world, having started as a division of Motorola in Phoenix, Arizona in 1948[3] and then becoming autonomous by the divestiture of the Semiconductor Products Sector of Motorola in 2004. In 1955, a Motorola transistor for car radios was the world's first commercial high-power transistor. It was also Motorola's first mass-produced semiconductor device.
In the 1960s, one of the U.S. space program's goals was to land a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth. In 1968, NASA began manned Apollo flights that led to the first lunar landing in July 1969. The Apollo program was particularly significant for hundreds of employees involved in designing, testing and producing its electronics. The division of Motorola which would eventually become Freescale Semiconductor, supplied thousands of semiconductor devices, ground-based tracking and checkout equipment, and 12 on-board tracking and communications units. An "up-data link" in the Apollo's command module received signals from Earth to relay to other on-board systems. A transponder received and transmitted voice and television signals and scientific data.[4]
Also that year[clarification needed], Motorola's technologies were used to introduce the first two-way mobile radio with a fully transistorized power supply and receiver for cars.[5]
Motorola has continued its growth in the networking and communications sector in later years, providing the tools behind the radio transponder, and going on to develop the first prototype of the first analog mobile phone in 1973.[6]
The company's first microprocessor (MC6800 8-bit) was introduced in 1974, and was used in automotive, computing and video game applications.[7]
Motorola's next generation 32-bit microprocessor, the MC68000, led the wave of technologies that spurred the computing revolution in 1984, powering devices from companies such as Apple, Commodore, Atari, Sega, Sun, and Hewlett-Packard.[8]
In the 1990s, Motorola's technology was the driving force behind intelligent power switches for anti-lock brake systems, one of the first microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) inertial sensor for automotive airbags, and Motorola's MPC5200 microprocessor deployed telematic systems for General Motors' OnStar systems.[9]
Since then, Freescale continued to provide the technology behind consumer, medical, networking and automotive products from microprocessors for the world's first tubing-free wireless insulin pump,[10] to and automotive microcontrollers for efficient engine design. Freescale's motion-sensing accelerometer powers the interactivity of the Guitar Hero video games.[11] The number one provider of eReader processors worldwide was Freescale.[12] In 2009, Freescale demonstrated the world's lowest startup voltage single inductor DC/DC converter for use in solar and thermoelectric energy harvesting applications.[13]
In 2011, the company launched the industry's first multimode wireless base station processor family that scales from small to large cells – integrating DSP and communications processor technologies to realize a true "base station-on-chip".[14] In addition, a recent ABI Research market study report states that Freescale owns 60% share of the radio frequency (RF) semiconductor device market.
Also in 2011, Freescale announced the company's first magnetometer for location tracking in smart mobile devices.[15] With the partnership of McLaren Electronic Systems, they helped the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series vehicles convert from carburetors to fuel injection starting in 2012.[16][17][18]
On March 8, 2014, Freescale announced that 20 of its employees were passengers aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. That plane, carrying the Freescale employees, was lost,[19] with only small part of it found over a year later.
In March 2015, a merger agreement was announced through which Freescale Semiconductor would be acquired by NXP Semiconductors and that the companies would be merged to form a US$40 (equivalent to $40.42 in 2016) billion company.[20][21] The acquisition closed on December 7, 2015.
Kinetis[edit]
On February 26, 2013, Freescale Semiconductor announced the creation of the world's physically smallest ARM-powered chip. The Kinetis KL02 measures 1.9 by 2 millimeters and is a full microcontroller unit (MCU), means that the chip supports a processor, RAM, ROM, clock and I/O control unit. The chip competes with the Atmel M0+ offerings, which are the low-power leaders in the industry.[22] One application that Freescale says the chips could be used for is swallowable computers. Freescale already works with a variety of health and wellness customers. Both the Fitbit and OmniPod insulin pump use Freescale chips. The new chip was on display at 'Embedded World' in Nuernberg, Germany, from February 26–28, 2013.[23]
Up to now devices with leading letter codes L, E, M, W containing ARM Cortex-M0+ cores and letter code K or KW containing ARM Cortex-M4 cores are known (see also the related section in the List of Freescale products).
Products[edit]
In August 2014, Freescale Semiconductor introduced a range of fully programmable wireless charging chip and reference designs for consumer and automotive applications. The new chipset is certified to work with both the Wireless Power Consortium's Qi wireless standard and the Power Matters Alliances charging specifications.[24]
Freescale focused primarily on automotive applications and is second in market share in automotive applications to Renesas Electronics. Due to this focus and exposure it is expected that car-sharing applications like Zipcar will have a significant negative impact on future Freescale revenues.[25]
Financials[edit]
Motorola announced that their semiconductor division would be divested on October 6, 2003 to create Freescale. Freescale completed its IPO on July 16, 2004.
On September 15, 2006, Freescale agreed to a $17.6 billion buyout by a consortium led by Blackstone Group and its co-investors, Carlyle Group, TPG Capital, and Permira.[26] The buyout offer was accepted on November 13, 2006 following a vote by company shareholders. The purchase, which closed on December 1, 2006, was the largest private buyout of a technology company until the Dell buyout of 2013 and is one of the ten largest buyouts of all time.[27]
Freescale filed to go public on February 11, 2011 and completed its IPO on May 26, 2011. Freescale is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol FSL. At the time of the IPO, the company had $7.6 billion in outstanding debt on its books,[28] and the company is being investigated for misconduct related to this IPO.[29]
Litigation[edit]
Freescale is being sued by Marvell Semiconductor for infringing seven patents held by Marvell. The case is being litigated in the US District Court for the West District of Texas.[30] Freescale recently lost a patent infringement lawsuit filed by Tessera Corporation and was forced to pay an undisclosed amount as part of the settlement.[31]
Competitors[edit]
Freescale competes with a host of other silicon vendors, including Marvell Semiconductor, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, Intel, AMD, Toshiba, ST Microelectronics, Infineon, NEC Corporation, Nvidia, Microchip Technology, Renesas, VIA Technologies, and Samsung Electronics.[32]
Zune bug[edit]
Clock driver software written by Freescale was responsible for the 2008 Zune leap year bug.[33][34]

Freescale PLL line reintroduced by Lansdale Semiconductor

John McHale  Editorial Director
 - Leave a Comment
PHOENIX, Arizona. Officials at Lansdale Semiconductor, Inc. announced today the continued availability of the ML145170 PLL Frequency Synthesizer circuit with Serial Interface, which was originally designed and built by Motorola/Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.   
Lansdale has single-source rights to globally market and continue to manufacture Motorola’s line of phase lock loop (PLL) circuits. The ML145170 is a single-chip synthesizer capable of direct usage in the medium frequency (MF), high frequency (HF), and very high frequency (VHF) bands.  
The availability of the ML145170 IC is critical in supporting a variety of applications including automotive products, programmable oscillators, transceivers, cellular phones, and computers. A unique architecture also makes the PLL easy to program -- either a bit- or byte-oriented format may be used. Due to the patented BitGrabber registers, no address/steering bits are required for random access of the three registers. Thus tuning can be accomplished via a 2-byte serial transfer to the 16 bit N register.
The device features fully programmable R and N counters, an amplifier at the Fin pin, on-ship support of an external crystal, a programmable reference output, and both single and double-ended phase detectors with linear transfer functions (no dead zones). A configuration C register enables the part to be configured to meet various applications. A patented feature enables the C register to shut off unused outputs, thereby minimizing noise and interference. The ML145170 is available in dual-in-line and surface mount packaging (P Dip-16, SO 16, and TSSOP 16).
Lansdale’s exclusive product life cycle management system is a quality control system that guarantees form, fit, and function equal to the original manufacturer’s design specifications. This model is critical to for the mitigation of counterfeit parts. It assures a continuous source of high performance IC’s to the worldwide electronics market.

FREESCALE SEMICONDUCTOR, INC., Plaintiff,
v.
MAXIM INTEGRATED PRODUCTS, INC. and TANJU YURTSEVER, Defendants.


United States District Court, W.D. Texas, Austin Division.
October 30, 2013.









ORDER
ANDREW W. AUSTIN, Magistrate Judge.
Before the Court is Plaintiff Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.'s Motion to Compel Discovery Regarding the Intentional Destruction of Evidence (Dkt. No. 21); Defendant Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.'s Response (Dkt. No. 26); and Plaintiff Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.'s Reply (Dkt. No. 31). The District Court referred the above motion to the undersigned Magistrate Judge for disposition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A), FED. R. CIV. P. 72, and Rule 1(c) of Appendix C of the Local Rules of the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, Local Rules for the Assignment of Duties to United States Magistrate Judges.
I. GENERAL BACKGROUND
This case arises out of a copyright infringement dispute involving the alleged improper use of copyrighted software by Defendants Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. ("Maxim"), and Tanju Yurtsever ("Yurtsever"). Plaintiff Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. ("Freescale"), alleges that Maxim and Yurtsever "misappropriated Freescale's proprietary and confidential [s]oftware and begain illegally copying and/or creating derivative works of it to support Maxim's operations. . . ." Dkt. No. 33, ¶ 23. Freescale further charges Maxim and Yurtsever with "stealing Freescale's trade secrets, reproducing system concepts, processes, strategies, architecture and designs." Id.
Prior to his employment at Maxim, Yurtsever had spent eighteen years with Freescale, where he worked on enhancing and developing software for Freescale's manufacturing processes, including custom dispatching software. Id. ¶¶ 14, 16. In 2010, several Freescale employees, including Yurtsever, terminated their employment with Freescale to work at Maxim. Id. ¶ 18. Upon ending his employment at Freescale, Yurtsever was reminded that he had been given access to Freescale's proprietary and confidential information and that the work he would be doing at Maxim could very well result in the disclosure of Freescale's information. Id. ¶ 19. Yurtsever was also directed to collect and return all Freescale property, including all Freescale's proprietary and confidential information that Yurtsever possessed, regardless of whether the information was stored at Freescale or otherwise. Id. ¶ 20. Despite these warnings, Freescale alleges that Yurtsever failed to return all of Freescale's proprietary and confidential information; instead, Freescale asserts that Yurtsever knowingly took all of the Freescale source code on which he had worked. Id. This allegation stems from an anonymous tip Freescale received in 2012, which disclosed to Freescale that its proprietary and confidential software were being used at Maxim and displayed in presentations shown at Maxim. Id. ¶ 22. Freescale filed the instant suit on January 28, 2013.
After this case was filed, Freescale learned that Maxim had received an anonymous whistleblower submission in late 2011, informing Maxim that Freescale's proprietary and confidential software was being improperly used at Maxim by its employees, including Yurtsever. Dkt. No. 21 at 1. According to Freescale, in or around April 2012, Yurtsever met with Maxim's Legal Department regarding the allegations that he was using Freescale's confidential software information. Id. Yurtsever then proceeded to delete information on several external hard drives and flash drives containing Freescale software code and Freescale documents. Id. Shortly thereafter, Yurtsever physically destroyed the external hard drives using a screwdriver and also broke the flash drives in half, disposing of the remnants in the trash. Id. Yurtsever claims that he misunderstood the instructions provided to him by Maxim regarding the preservation of evidence, believing that he was only required to preserve evidence on "Maxim property." Id. at 2. Based on these findings, Freescale filed the instant motion on September 11, 2013, seeking discovery relating to "(a) the anonymous whistleblower submission; and (b) the communications between Yurtsever and Maxim, which led to the intentional destruction of key evidence in this case." Id. In particular, Freescale requests the Court to compel discovery on the following topics: (1) Maxim's correspondence with the anonymous whistleblower via EthicsPoint; (2) Maxim's correspondence with Yurtsever in April 2012 regarding evidence preservation, collection, or production; and (3) depositions of any Maxim employee who, in April 2012, discussed evidence preservation, collection, or production with Yurtsever. Id. The Court conducted a hearing on October 15, 2013.
II. ANALYSIS1
In its Motion to Compel Discovery, Freescale argues that it is entitled to discovery involving Maxim's communications with the anonymous whistleblower, including the initial submission as well as the follow-up messages, because such communications are not protected by the attorneyclient privilege. Dkt. No. 21 at 9. Freescale submits that the anonymous whistleblower submission and subsequent communications were not made by a client or for the purpose of seeking legal advice. Id. at 10. Freescale also contends that whether the information submitted by the anonymous whistleblower was reviewed by an attorney is irrelevant to the question of whether the information is protected by the attorney-client privilege because the EthicsPoint website does not inform the potential whistleblower that an attorney will review the submission and, in any event, Maxim's attorneys represent the interests of Maxim, not its employees individually. Id. at 11. Alternatively, Freescale argues that communications between the anonymous whistleblower and Maxim are not protected by the work product privilege. Id. at 12. Maxim responds that there is overwhelming evidence that the whistleblower was a Maxim employee. Dkt. No. 26 at 12-14. Given the evidence that the whistleblower was a Maxim employee, and that any anonymous report would go to the Maxim Chief Compliance Officer, who the Maxim website identifies as the company's general counsel, and relying on the Supreme Court's decision in Upjohn Co., et al. v. United States, et al., 449 U.S. 383 (1981), Maxim argues that any communication between a Maxim employee and the company conducted through the EthicsPoint website is protected by the attorney-client privilege. Dkt. No. 26 at 10-15.
The parties' main disagreement involves the scope of the attorney-client privilege and the extent to which the Supreme Court's decision in Upjohn applies to the circumstances of this case. At the hearing, Freescale put forth two primary arguments supporting its contention that Maxim's communications with the anonymous whistleblower are not protected by the attorney-client privilege, namely that (1) there is no evidence in the record suggesting that a person making a submission through Maxim's EthicsPoint portal would expect to receive legal advice or that the submission would be reviewed by an attorney and (2) there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the anonymous whistleblower was a Maxim employee. Concerning the application of Upjohn, Freescale contends that (1) the circumstances in this case do not arise in the same factual or procedural context as Upjohn and (2) the anonymous whistleblower has not been conclusively shown to be a Maxim employee. On the other hand, Maxim submits that Upjohn does not stand for the proposition that an employee who reports potential issues to a company needs to be seeking legal advice in order for the attorney-client privilege to attach. Rather, the communication need only be with an individual who has the ability to seek legal advice on behalf of the company. Additionally, Maxim points this Court to the company's Code of Conduct, arguing that the policy clarifies that any reports of potential issues would be reviewed by Maxim's Chief Compliance Officer, who is also Maxim's General Counsel.
At the hearing, at the Court's request, Maxim submitted a copy of the disputed document as well as its First Supplemental Privilege Log for the Court to review in camera After considering the parties' arguments as well as the document at issue, the Court will GRANT IN PART and DENY IN PART Freescale's Motion to Compel Discovery as it pertains to Maxim's communications with the anonymous whistleblower.
"The attorney-client privilege is the oldest of the privileges for confidential communications known to the common law." Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 389. The purpose of the attorney-client privilege is "to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice." Id. "A corporate client has a privilege to refuse to disclose, and prevent its attorneys from disclosing, confidential communications between its representatives and its attorneys when the communications were made to obtain legal services." Nguyen v. Excel Corp., 197 F.3d 200, 206 (5th Cir. 1999). The privilege applies not only to communications with outside counsel, but also to communications between a client corporation and its inside counsel. See AHF Community Development, LLC v. City of Dallas, 258 F. R. D. 143, 146 (N.D. Tex. 2009).
In Upjohn, the Supreme Court considered, in part, a dispute over whether written questionnaires completed by Upjohn's foreign affiliate managers were protected by the attorneyclient privilege. 449 U.S. at 387-88. In that case, independent accountants had notified Upjohn's general counsel that at least one of its foreign subsidiaries had made improper payments to a foreign government in order to obtain government business. Id. at 387. After consulting with outside counsel, Upjohn's general counsel decided to initiate an internal investigation into these alleged payments. Id. A questionnaire was then sent to all of Upjohn's foreign managers, informing them that "the company's General Counsel" had been tasked with conducting an investigation into the alleged payments to foreign governments and seeking detailed information about these payments. Id. The managers were instructed that the investigation was "highly confidential" and to only speak with employees who might be able to assist in the investigation. Id. In deciding how broadly the attorney-client privilege applied in this context, the Supreme Court ultimately rejected the "control group test" applied by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, finding the test to be too restrictive to achieve the purposes of the privilege and too difficult to apply in practice. Id. at 390-93. In reaching its conclusion, the Supreme Court explicitly recognized that the attorney-client privilege does not only extend to senior management officers, but also middle and lower-level employees who have information that could be used by the corporation's lawyers to provide legal counsel to the corporation. Id. at 391 ("Middle-level and indeed lower-level-employees can, by actions within the scope of their employment, embroil the corporation in serious legal difficulties, and it is only natural that these employees would have the relevant information needed by corporate counsel if he is adequately to advise the client with respect to such actual or potential difficulties."). Because the communications in the questionnaires "concerned matters within the scope of the employees' corporate duties, and the employees themselves were sufficiently aware that they were being questioned in order that the corporation could obtain legal advice," the Supreme Court determined that the completed questionnaires were protected by attorney-client privilege and not subject to discovery. Id. at 394-95 (emphasis added).
Here, the anonymous whistleblower made three submissions via the EthicsPoint portal used by Maxim. An initial submission was made on December 14, 2011, and two follow-up communications were submitted on December 20, 2011, and February 24, 2012. Maxim's Chief Compliance Officer and General Counsel, Ed Medlin, communicated with the anonymous whistleblower twice via EthicsPoint—once on December 14, 2011, in response to the initial submission and again on February 27, 2012, in response to the whistleblower's submission on February 24, 2012. Upon review of the documents containing these discussions, the Court determines that the initial submission made by the anonymous whistleblower on December 14, 2011, is not protected by the attorney-client privilege and should be produced. The initial submission is distinguishable from the questionnaires at issue in Upjohn because it was made prior to the start of any investigation by Maxim into the specific allegations that Freescale's software was being improperly used at Maxim. There is also insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the anonymous whistleblower was seeking legal advice or that this information was somehow solicited by Maxim in order for Maxim's legal counsel to render legal advice to the company. Consequently, the Court concludes that the initial submission by the anonymous whistleblower is not protected by the attorney-client privilege and must be produced.
However, the subsequent communications between Ed Medlin and the anonymous whistleblower via EthicsPoint are protected by the attorney-client privilege. This includes communications made via EthicsPoint by the anonymous whistleblower to Ed Medlin on December 20, 2011, and February 24, 2012, as well as the communications made by Ed Medlin to the anonymous whistleblower on December 14, 2011, and February 27, 2012. In the initial communication the whistleblower identifies him or herself as a Maxim employee.2 The content of the subsequent communications show that more specific information was being solicited from the anonymous whistleblower—a Maxim employee—in order for Maxim's General Counsel, Ed Medlin, to investigate the allegations and render legal advice to Maxim. Additionally, the content of the follow-up communications also clarifies that the messages were exchanged after Maxim had started its investigation into the anonymous whistleblower's claims. These facts align the circumstances of the subsequent communications with the situation in Upjohn, where the Supreme Court determined that information given by Upjohn employees in response to questionnaires that were meant to assist an internal investigation was protected by the attorney-client privilege. As such, the Court will DENY Freescale's Motion to Compel with respect to the subsequent communications via EthicsPoint between the anonymous whistleblower and Ed Medlin.
Freescale points this Court to a recent decision from the Eastern District of Tennessee, Leazure v. Apria Healthcare Inc., No. 1:09-224, 2010 WL 3397685 (E.D. Tenn. Aug. 26, 2010), as support for its contention that the communications between the anonymous whistleblower and Maxim are not privileged and should be produced. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 31 at 6. However, Freescale's reliance upon Leazure is unconvincing for two reasons. First, as Freescale acknowledged at the hearing, the court in Leazure primarily considered whether the documents in dispute were protected by Tennessee's attorney-client privilege rather than federal law concerning the privilege. See, e.g., Leazure, 2010 WL 3397685 at *1. Secondly, given that Maxim has submitted the disputed document for the Court's in camera review, the Court has been able to carefully evaluate the subsequent communications based on the specific content and information contained therein. As such, the Court declines to adopt Freescale's reliance upon Leazure.
Finally, because the Court finds the subsequent communications between the anonymous whistleblower and Ed Medlin to be protected by the attorney-client privilege, the Court need not reach the question of whether the communications from Ed Medlin to the anonymous whistleblower on December 14, 2011, and February 27, 2012, are further protected by the work product privilege.
III. CONCLUSION
In accordance with the foregoing discussion, the Court hereby GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Freescale's Motion to Compel Discovery Regarding the Intentional Destruction of Evidence (Dkt. No. 21). Freescale's Motion is GRANTED to the extent it seeks production of the initial submission by the anonymous whistleblower. Freescale's Motion is DENIED to the extent it seeks production of the subsequent communications between the anonymous whistleblower and Maxim's Chief Compliance Officer and General Counsel. Maxim shall produce the responsive document no later than November 6, 2013.
Furthermore, the Court hereby DISMISSES WITHOUT PREJUDICE the portion of Freescale's Motion to Compel Discovery concerning whether it is entitled to discover communications between Maxim and Yurtsever relating to the preservation of evidence.


FootNotes 
1. Prior to the hearing on October 15, 2013, the parties represented to the Court that they had reached an agreement concerning the issue of whether Freescale is entitled to discover communications between Maxim and Yurtsever relating to the preservation of evidence. Dkt. No. 35. Pursuant to the parties' resolution on that issue, Freescale agreed to withdraw that part of its Motion to Compel Discovery without prejudice. Id. As such, the Court will DISMISS WITHOUT PREJUDICE the portion of Freescale's Motion to Compel Discovery concerning whether it is entitled to discover communications between Maxim and Yurtsever relating to the preservation of evidence.

2. At the hearing and in the briefing, a significant point of contention was whether the anonymous whistleblower was actually a Maxim employee. In the initial submission, the anonymous whistleblower indicates that he/she is a Maxim employee and that the allegations contained therein were based on personal observations. Based on the information provided, the Court concludes that Maxim has sufficiently demonstrated that the anonymous whistleblower was a Maxim employee at the time the submission was made.

History[edit]
Freescale was one of the first semiconductor companies in the world, having started as a division of Motorola in Phoenix, Arizona in 1948[3] and then becoming autonomous by the divestiture of the Semiconductor Products Sector of Motorola in 2004. In 1955, a Motorola transistor for car radios was the world's first commercial high-power transistor. It was also Motorola's first mass-produced semiconductor device.
In the 1960s, one of the U.S. space program's goals was to land a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth. In 1968, NASA began manned Apollo flights that led to the first lunar landing in July 1969. The Apollo program was particularly significant for hundreds of employees involved in designing, testing and producing its electronics. The division of Motorola which would eventually become Freescale Semiconductor, supplied thousands of semiconductor devices, ground-based tracking and checkout equipment, and 12 on-board tracking and communications units. An "up-data link" in the Apollo's command module received signals from Earth to relay to other on-board systems. A transponder received and transmitted voice and television signals and scientific data.[4]
Also that year[clarification needed], Motorola's technologies were used to introduce the first two-way mobile radio with a fully transistorized power supply and receiver for cars.[5]
Motorola has continued its growth in the networking and communications sector in later years, providing the tools behind the radio transponder, and going on to develop the first prototype of the first analog mobile phone in 1973.[6]
The company's first microprocessor (MC6800 8-bit) was introduced in 1974, and was used in automotive, computing and video game applications.[7]
Motorola's next generation 32-bit microprocessor, the MC68000, led the wave of technologies that spurred the computing revolution in 1984, powering devices from companies such as Apple, Commodore, Atari, Sega, Sun, and Hewlett-Packard.[8]
In the 1990s, Motorola's technology was the driving force behind intelligent power switches for anti-lock brake systems, one of the first microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) inertial sensor for automotive airbags, and Motorola's MPC5200 microprocessor deployed telematic systems for General Motors' OnStar systems.[9]
Since then, Freescale continued to provide the technology behind consumer, medical, networking and automotive products from microprocessors for the world's first tubing-free wireless insulin pump,[10] to and automotive microcontrollers for efficient engine design. Freescale's motion-sensing accelerometer powers the interactivity of the Guitar Hero video games.[11] The number one provider of eReader processors worldwide was Freescale.[12] In 2009, Freescale demonstrated the world's lowest startup voltage single inductor DC/DC converter for use in solar and thermoelectric energy harvesting applications.[13]
In 2011, the company launched the industry's first multimode wireless base station processor family that scales from small to large cells – integrating DSP and communications processor technologies to realize a true "base station-on-chip".[14] In addition, a recent ABI Research market study report states that Freescale owns 60% share of the radio frequency (RF) semiconductor device market.
Also in 2011, Freescale announced the company's first magnetometer for location tracking in smart mobile devices.[15] With the partnership of McLaren Electronic Systems, they helped the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series vehicles convert from carburetors to fuel injection starting in 2012.[16][17][18]
On March 8, 2014, Freescale announced that 20 of its employees were passengers aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. That plane, carrying the Freescale employees, was lost,[19] with only small part of it found over a year later.
In March 2015, a merger agreement was announced through which Freescale Semiconductor would be acquired by NXP Semiconductors and that the companies would be merged to form a US$40 (equivalent to $40.42 in 2016) billion company.[20][21] The acquisition closed on December 7, 2015.
Kinetis[edit]
On February 26, 2013, Freescale Semiconductor announced the creation of the world's physically smallest ARM-powered chip. The Kinetis KL02 measures 1.9 by 2 millimeters and is a full microcontroller unit (MCU), means that the chip supports a processor, RAM, ROM, clock and I/O control unit. The chip competes with the Atmel M0+ offerings, which are the low-power leaders in the industry.[22] One application that Freescale says the chips could be used for is swallowable computers. Freescale already works with a variety of health and wellness customers. Both the Fitbit and OmniPod insulin pump use Freescale chips. The new chip was on display at 'Embedded World' in Nuernberg, Germany, from February 26–28, 2013.[23]
Up to now devices with leading letter codes L, E, M, W containing ARM Cortex-M0+ cores and letter code K or KW containing ARM Cortex-M4 cores are known (see also the related section in the List of Freescale products).
Products[edit]
In August 2014, Freescale Semiconductor introduced a range of fully programmable wireless charging chip and reference designs for consumer and automotive applications. The new chipset is certified to work with both the Wireless Power Consortium's Qi wireless standard and the Power Matters Alliances charging specifications.[24]
Freescale focused primarily on automotive applications and is second in market share in automotive applications to Renesas Electronics. Due to this focus and exposure it is expected that car-sharing applications like Zipcar will have a significant negative impact on future Freescale revenues.[25]
Financials[edit]
Motorola announced that their semiconductor division would be divested on October 6, 2003 to create Freescale. Freescale completed its IPO on July 16, 2004.
On September 15, 2006, Freescale agreed to a $17.6 billion buyout by a consortium led by Blackstone Group and its co-investors, Carlyle Group, TPG Capital, and Permira.[26] The buyout offer was accepted on November 13, 2006 following a vote by company shareholders. The purchase, which closed on December 1, 2006, was the largest private buyout of a technology company until the Dell buyout of 2013 and is one of the ten largest buyouts of all time.[27]
Freescale filed to go public on February 11, 2011 and completed its IPO on May 26, 2011. Freescale is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol FSL. At the time of the IPO, the company had $7.6 billion in outstanding debt on its books,[28] and the company is being investigated for misconduct related to this IPO.[29]
Litigation[edit]
Freescale is being sued by Marvell Semiconductor for infringing seven patents held by Marvell. The case is being litigated in the US District Court for the West District of Texas.[30] Freescale recently lost a patent infringement lawsuit filed by Tessera Corporation and was forced to pay an undisclosed amount as part of the settlement.[31]
Competitors[edit]
Freescale competes with a host of other silicon vendors, including Marvell Semiconductor, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, Intel, AMD, Toshiba, ST Microelectronics, Infineon, NEC Corporation, Nvidia, Microchip Technology, Renesas, VIA Technologies, and Samsung Electronics.[32]
Zune bug[edit]
Clock driver software written by Freescale was responsible for the 2008 Zune leap year bug.[33][34]

History[edit]
Freescale was one of the first semiconductor companies in the world, having started as a division of Motorola in Phoenix, Arizona in 1948[3] and then becoming autonomous by the divestiture of the Semiconductor Products Sector of Motorola in 2004. In 1955, a Motorola transistor for car radios was the world's first commercial high-power transistor. It was also Motorola's first mass-produced semiconductor device.
In the 1960s, one of the U.S. space program's goals was to land a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth. In 1968, NASA began manned Apollo flights that led to the first lunar landing in July 1969. The Apollo program was particularly significant for hundreds of employees involved in designing, testing and producing its electronics. The division of Motorola which would eventually become Freescale Semiconductor, supplied thousands of semiconductor devices, ground-based tracking and checkout equipment, and 12 on-board tracking and communications units. An "up-data link" in the Apollo's command module received signals from Earth to relay to other on-board systems. A transponder received and transmitted voice and television signals and scientific data.[4]
Also that year[clarification needed], Motorola's technologies were used to introduce the first two-way mobile radio with a fully transistorized power supply and receiver for cars.[5]
Motorola has continued its growth in the networking and communications sector in later years, providing the tools behind the radio transponder, and going on to develop the first prototype of the first analog mobile phone in 1973.[6]
The company's first microprocessor (MC6800 8-bit) was introduced in 1974, and was used in automotive, computing and video game applications.[7]
Motorola's next generation 32-bit microprocessor, the MC68000, led the wave of technologies that spurred the computing revolution in 1984, powering devices from companies such as Apple, Commodore, Atari, Sega, Sun, and Hewlett-Packard.[8]
In the 1990s, Motorola's technology was the driving force behind intelligent power switches for anti-lock brake systems, one of the first microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) inertial sensor for automotive airbags, and Motorola's MPC5200 microprocessor deployed telematic systems for General Motors' OnStar systems.[9]
Since then, Freescale continued to provide the technology behind consumer, medical, networking and automotive products from microprocessors for the world's first tubing-free wireless insulin pump,[10] to and automotive microcontrollers for efficient engine design. Freescale's motion-sensing accelerometer powers the interactivity of the Guitar Hero video games.[11] The number one provider of eReader processors worldwide was Freescale.[12] In 2009, Freescale demonstrated the world's lowest startup voltage single inductor DC/DC converter for use in solar and thermoelectric energy harvesting applications.[13]
In 2011, the company launched the industry's first multimode wireless base station processor family that scales from small to large cells – integrating DSP and communications processor technologies to realize a true "base station-on-chip".[14] In addition, a recent ABI Research market study report states that Freescale owns 60% share of the radio frequency (RF) semiconductor device market.
Also in 2011, Freescale announced the company's first magnetometer for location tracking in smart mobile devices.[15] With the partnership of McLaren Electronic Systems, they helped the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series vehicles convert from carburetors to fuel injection starting in 2012.[16][17][18]
On March 8, 2014, Freescale announced that 20 of its employees were passengers aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. That plane, carrying the Freescale employees, was lost,[19] with only small part of it found over a year later.
In March 2015, a merger agreement was announced through which Freescale Semiconductor would be acquired by NXP Semiconductors and that the companies would be merged to form a US$40 (equivalent to $40.42 in 2016) billion company.[20][21] The acquisition closed on December 7, 2015.
Kinetis[edit]
On February 26, 2013, Freescale Semiconductor announced the creation of the world's physically smallest ARM-powered chip. The Kinetis KL02 measures 1.9 by 2 millimeters and is a full microcontroller unit (MCU), means that the chip supports a processor, RAM, ROM, clock and I/O control unit. The chip competes with the Atmel M0+ offerings, which are the low-power leaders in the industry.[22] One application that Freescale says the chips could be used for is swallowable computers. Freescale already works with a variety of health and wellness customers. Both the Fitbit and OmniPod insulin pump use Freescale chips. The new chip was on display at 'Embedded World' in Nuernberg, Germany, from February 26–28, 2013.[23]
Up to now devices with leading letter codes L, E, M, W containing ARM Cortex-M0+ cores and letter code K or KW containing ARM Cortex-M4 cores are known (see also the related section in the List of Freescale products).
Products[edit]
In August 2014, Freescale Semiconductor introduced a range of fully programmable wireless charging chip and reference designs for consumer and automotive applications. The new chipset is certified to work with both the Wireless Power Consortium's Qi wireless standard and the Power Matters Alliances charging specifications.[24]
Freescale focused primarily on automotive applications and is second in market share in automotive applications to Renesas Electronics. Due to this focus and exposure it is expected that car-sharing applications like Zipcar will have a significant negative impact on future Freescale revenues.[25]
Financials[edit]
Motorola announced that their semiconductor division would be divested on October 6, 2003 to create Freescale. Freescale completed its IPO on July 16, 2004.
On September 15, 2006, Freescale agreed to a $17.6 billion buyout by a consortium led by Blackstone Group and its co-investors, Carlyle Group, TPG Capital, and Permira.[26] The buyout offer was accepted on November 13, 2006 following a vote by company shareholders. The purchase, which closed on December 1, 2006, was the largest private buyout of a technology company until the Dell buyout of 2013 and is one of the ten largest buyouts of all time.[27]
Freescale filed to go public on February 11, 2011 and completed its IPO on May 26, 2011. Freescale is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol FSL. At the time of the IPO, the company had $7.6 billion in outstanding debt on its books,[28] and the company is being investigated for misconduct related to this IPO.[29]
Litigation[edit]
Freescale is being sued by Marvell Semiconductor for infringing seven patents held by Marvell. The case is being litigated in the US District Court for the West District of Texas.[30] Freescale recently lost a patent infringement lawsuit filed by Tessera Corporation and was forced to pay an undisclosed amount as part of the settlement.[31]
Competitors[edit]
Freescale competes with a host of other silicon vendors, including Marvell Semiconductor, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, Intel, AMD, Toshiba, ST Microelectronics, Infineon, NEC Corporation, Nvidia, Microchip Technology, Renesas, VIA Technologies, and Samsung Electronics.[32]
Zune bug[edit]
Clock driver software written by Freescale was responsible for the 2008 Zune leap year bug.[33][34]

History[edit]
Freescale was one of the first semiconductor companies in the world, having started as a division of Motorola in Phoenix, Arizona in 1948[3] and then becoming autonomous by the divestiture of the Semiconductor Products Sector of Motorola in 2004. In 1955, a Motorola transistor for car radios was the world's first commercial high-power transistor. It was also Motorola's first mass-produced semiconductor device.
In the 1960s, one of the U.S. space program's goals was to land a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth. In 1968, NASA began manned Apollo flights that led to the first lunar landing in July 1969. The Apollo program was particularly significant for hundreds of employees involved in designing, testing and producing its electronics. The division of Motorola which would eventually become Freescale Semiconductor, supplied thousands of semiconductor devices, ground-based tracking and checkout equipment, and 12 on-board tracking and communications units. An "up-data link" in the Apollo's command module received signals from Earth to relay to other on-board systems. A transponder received and transmitted voice and television signals and scientific data.[4]
Also that year[clarification needed], Motorola's technologies were used to introduce the first two-way mobile radio with a fully transistorized power supply and receiver for cars.[5]
Motorola has continued its growth in the networking and communications sector in later years, providing the tools behind the radio transponder, and going on to develop the first prototype of the first analog mobile phone in 1973.[6]
The company's first microprocessor (MC6800 8-bit) was introduced in 1974, and was used in automotive, computing and video game applications.[7]
Motorola's next generation 32-bit microprocessor, the MC68000, led the wave of technologies that spurred the computing revolution in 1984, powering devices from companies such as Apple, Commodore, Atari, Sega, Sun, and Hewlett-Packard.[8]
In the 1990s, Motorola's technology was the driving force behind intelligent power switches for anti-lock brake systems, one of the first microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) inertial sensor for automotive airbags, and Motorola's MPC5200 microprocessor deployed telematic systems for General Motors' OnStar systems.[9]
Since then, Freescale continued to provide the technology behind consumer, medical, networking and automotive products from microprocessors for the world's first tubing-free wireless insulin pump,[10] to and automotive microcontrollers for efficient engine design. Freescale's motion-sensing accelerometer powers the interactivity of the Guitar Hero video games.[11] The number one provider of eReader processors worldwide was Freescale.[12] In 2009, Freescale demonstrated the world's lowest startup voltage single inductor DC/DC converter for use in solar and thermoelectric energy harvesting applications.[13]
In 2011, the company launched the industry's first multimode wireless base station processor family that scales from small to large cells – integrating DSP and communications processor technologies to realize a true "base station-on-chip".[14] In addition, a recent ABI Research market study report states that Freescale owns 60% share of the radio frequency (RF) semiconductor device market.
Also in 2011, Freescale announced the company's first magnetometer for location tracking in smart mobile devices.[15] With the partnership of McLaren Electronic Systems, they helped the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series vehicles convert from carburetors to fuel injection starting in 2012.[16][17][18]
On March 8, 2014, Freescale announced that 20 of its employees were passengers aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. That plane, carrying the Freescale employees, was lost,[19] with only small part of it found over a year later.
In March 2015, a merger agreement was announced through which Freescale Semiconductor would be acquired by NXP Semiconductors and that the companies would be merged to form a US$40 (equivalent to $40.42 in 2016) billion company.[20][21] The acquisition closed on December 7, 2015.
Kinetis[edit]
On February 26, 2013, Freescale Semiconductor announced the creation of the world's physically smallest ARM-powered chip. The Kinetis KL02 measures 1.9 by 2 millimeters and is a full microcontroller unit (MCU), means that the chip supports a processor, RAM, ROM, clock and I/O control unit. The chip competes with the Atmel M0+ offerings, which are the low-power leaders in the industry.[22] One application that Freescale says the chips could be used for is swallowable computers. Freescale already works with a variety of health and wellness customers. Both the Fitbit and OmniPod insulin pump use Freescale chips. The new chip was on display at 'Embedded World' in Nuernberg, Germany, from February 26–28, 2013.[23]
Up to now devices with leading letter codes L, E, M, W containing ARM Cortex-M0+ cores and letter code K or KW containing ARM Cortex-M4 cores are known (see also the related section in the List of Freescale products).
Products[edit]
In August 2014, Freescale Semiconductor introduced a range of fully programmable wireless charging chip and reference designs for consumer and automotive applications. The new chipset is certified to work with both the Wireless Power Consortium's Qi wireless standard and the Power Matters Alliances charging specifications.[24]
Freescale focused primarily on automotive applications and is second in market share in automotive applications to Renesas Electronics. Due to this focus and exposure it is expected that car-sharing applications like Zipcar will have a significant negative impact on future Freescale revenues.[25]
Financials[edit]
Motorola announced that their semiconductor division would be divested on October 6, 2003 to create Freescale. Freescale completed its IPO on July 16, 2004.
On September 15, 2006, Freescale agreed to a $17.6 billion buyout by a consortium led by Blackstone Group and its co-investors, Carlyle Group, TPG Capital, and Permira.[26] The buyout offer was accepted on November 13, 2006 following a vote by company shareholders. The purchase, which closed on December 1, 2006, was the largest private buyout of a technology company until the Dell buyout of 2013 and is one of the ten largest buyouts of all time.[27]
Freescale filed to go public on February 11, 2011 and completed its IPO on May 26, 2011. Freescale is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol FSL. At the time of the IPO, the company had $7.6 billion in outstanding debt on its books,[28] and the company is being investigated for misconduct related to this IPO.[29]
Litigation[edit]
Freescale is being sued by Marvell Semiconductor for infringing seven patents held by Marvell. The case is being litigated in the US District Court for the West District of Texas.[30] Freescale recently lost a patent infringement lawsuit filed by Tessera Corporation and was forced to pay an undisclosed amount as part of the settlement.[31]
Competitors[edit]
Freescale competes with a host of other silicon vendors, including Marvell Semiconductor, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, Intel, AMD, Toshiba, ST Microelectronics, Infineon, NEC Corporation, Nvidia, Microchip Technology, Renesas, VIA Technologies, and Samsung Electronics.[32]
Zune bug[edit]
Clock driver software written by Freescale was responsible for the 2008 Zune leap year bug.[33][34]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
