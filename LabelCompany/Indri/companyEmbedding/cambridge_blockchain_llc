Identity Compliance Simplified

              Cambridge Blockchain puts control of personal identity data back in
              the hands of the end user.  Our platform allows financial institutions
              to meet the strictest new data privacy rules, eliminate redundant
              identity compliance checks and improve the customer experience.
              



 














 





The Challenge



                Financial institutions are facing an explosion of costs related
                to identity compliance.
                Annual spending and fines for know-your-customer and anti-money
                laundering regulations now exceed $18 billion, more than double
                their levels before the financial crisis.
                At the same time, strict new data privacy
                rules are limiting the ability of institutions to freely collect
                and share the personal identity data needed to complete these
                checks.  Centralized compliance databases struggle to meet these
                conflicting priorities, resulting in duplication of the same
                identity checks across institutions and severe impacts to customer
                experience and operating costs.

Our Solution

              A better way is now possible. Cambridge Blockchain's distributed
              architecture resolves the competing challenges of transparency
              and privacy, leading to stronger regulatory compliance, lower costs
              and a seamless customer experiences.
            





User controlof personal identity



Reuse of identity validations



Blockchainaudit trail







          Cambridge Blockchain solves the problem of enabling strong
          digital identities at a global scale while providing individuals
          control over their identity data. By combining blockchain
          technology with an off-chain personal data service, we create an
          independent source of truth through the network effects of
          transactions amongst individuals and trusted parties. Never
          before has identity been so reliably and flexibly managed
          leading to seamless transactions, operational efficiencies
          and strong privacy.
          

          By giving control of personal data back to the end user, Cambridge
          Blockchain allows financial institutions to collect and validate
          client data in privacy-protecting manner.  Our platform facilitates
          client control of their own personal data in a single, unified version
          through a virtual container called a Personal Data Service ("PDS").
          Using the PDS, a user can: 1) pre-approve automated rules that allow
          financial institutions to access the data; 2) ensure that each
          division is working with the most updated version of the data, and;
          3) confirm that the data is identical to what has been checked by
          another trusted party.  The shared blockchain ledger does not contain
          any personal data, but rather cryptographic proofs that can attest
          to the validity of personal data (and who has signed it) along with
          an auditable and trusted tracking of changes.
          









Competitions and Awards











                  Cambridge Blockchain was a graduate of the (2016) FinTech Innovation

Alpha Identity Blockchain | Cambridge Blockchain






















Identity Blockchain: Genesis Block
ALPHA: Sept 10 2015 00:00:00 UTC























What are you talking about?



                  This page describes the start of the Identity Blockchain: a
                  tool for validating secure digital identity documents,
                  processing electronic signatures, and recording transactions.
                  Since this is a new blockchain, it begins with a Genesis
                  Block, shown below. All subsequent data entries in the
                  blockchain must reference this genesis block through a chain
                  of strong cryptographic proofs. Any attempt at manipulation of
                  blockchain data will break the chain of proofs, making it
                  effectively impossible to alter records without detection.
                

                  The genesis block is structured as any other typical block,
                  with the exception that it references no previous block and
                  includes no transactions. All values are represented in
                  hexadecimal, i.e. base 16, with "numbers" running from zero
                  through the letter f (0123456789abcdef). Hexadecimal is a
                  convenient way to represent the binary data of computers in a
                  form more easily readable to humans.
                

                Numbers are stored in "big-endian" order where the "big end"
                (most significant value in the sequence) is stored first.  The
                term "big-endian" derives from Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's
                Travels in which the Big Endians were a political faction who
                broke their eggs at the large end.
                



Show me the Genesis Block!


Genesis Block - The first block in the Identity
                  Blockchain!



MagicNo:
                    The "Magic Number" is an unique identifier for the
                    blockchain, and remains constant for all subsequent
                    blocks.
                    

Timestamp:
                    The genesis block timestamp is September 10, 2015 at
                    midnight UTC.  Time is represented in a UNIX format,
                    which counts up in seconds from January 1, 1970. The
                    timestamp is encoded as double (primary data type).
                    

Version:
                    The genesis block shows a version of ffff ffff (the
                    highest hexadecimal value possible) to indicate that it
                    is an alpha version, still in development.
                    

HashPrevBlock:
                    The genesis block is the first blockchain entry, so there
                    is no "previous block" to reference.  Therefore, its
                    HashPrevBlock value is 0 (zero).  The genesis block's own block
                    identifier (described below) then serves as the
                    HashPrevBlock value for the second block in the
                    blockchain.
                    

HashMerkleRoot:
                    The HashMerkleRoot is computed from transaction data.
                    It is named for Ralph Merkle, who received a patent
                    in 1979 for the efficient and secure verification of
                    large data structures using a "hash tree". The genesis
                    block contains no transactions, so its HashMerkleRoot
                    value is 0 (zero).

How is the block identifier derived?

                The colored numbers from the genesis block are used to
                compute a "block identifier" signature shown in the black
                box above.  The computation is a one-way function known
                as a cryptographic hash.  This allows one to easily verify
                that some input data maps to a given hash value, but if the
                input data is unknown, it is deliberately difficult to
                reconstruct it (or equivalent alternatives) by knowing the
                stored hash value.
                

                The particular function used here is a 256 bit "Secure Hash
                Algorithm" known as SHA 256, which was patented by the US
                National Security Agency and subsequently released under a
                royalty-free license.  This function has been in the public
                domain since 2001, and is generally considered by
                cryptography experts to be extremely secure.
