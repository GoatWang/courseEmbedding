Back to Gallery
















Hometown Hero George Lindahl will be among the honorees at The Woodlands Celebration of Excellence Gala benefiting Interfaith of The Woodlands, but says the hero label is something assigned to him.

The gala takes place Oct. 2 at The Woodlands Waterway Marriott Hotel and Convention Center, 1601 Lake Robbins Drive.

“Others think I’m a hometown hero because I devote all of my time to non-profit charities,” Lindahl said. “I’m a full-time volunteer and fundraiser and I serve on nine boards that are non profits.”




Lindahl who spent 40 years in the oil and gas industry, is the 2010-2011 chairman of the board at The Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion. At The Pavilion, he said the number one job of the board he leads is to ensure they are increasing the performing arts through a phrase they’ve coined - “rock pays for Bach.”

“Most symphonies and operas lose money,” Lindahl said. “The goal of The Pavilion is to increase performing arts like the ballet and the symphony. The Pavilion is the summer home of the Houston Symphony.”

He said The Pavilion focuses on education through programs like The Children’s Festival and scholarships for performing arts.

Lindahl serves on the Reaching Pines Capital Campaign Cabinet for the Montgomery County Women’s Center; 2007 Community Outreach event co-chair at the South Montgomery County Community Clinic and serves on the Pastor Relations Committee at The Woodlands United Methodist Church.

Lindahl said the pastoral relations committee works as a human relations group in charge of hiring, interviewing and compensation.

“It’s like an HR department of the church staffed by an outside board,” he said. “I am also active in mission work within the church.”

Lindahl is active at Interfaith of The Woodlands and now serves on the Board of Advisors and Development Committee.

He is on the board of the US Oncology Foundation and is a life time board member of Goodwill of Houston which has locations and a donation center in The Woodlands. He also donates to all of the named organizations.

Lindahl, who has a background in geology, has a passion for mineral collecting and collects antique wrist watches and cufflinks.

“Most of the real, true heroes are people you never hear about,” Lindahl said. “There are so many volunteers in The Woodlands working at charities that we never hear about. There are hundreds and hundreds out there giving their time and pocket book. The Woodlands is a very giving community.”

The annual tradition of honoring Hometown Heroes began in 1999 as a part of The Woodlands 25th Anniversary Celebration and has continued ever since, according to a release from The Woodlands Development Company.
