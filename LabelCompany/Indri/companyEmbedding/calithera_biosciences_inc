Targeting pathways critical to tumor growth and survival
		







Targeting pathways critical to tumor growth and survival
		


 












Calithera is discovering and developing novel small molecule drugs directed against tumor metabolism and tumor immunology targets for the treatment of cancer.








Tumor Metabolism
The field of tumor metabolism seeks to exploit the unique ways in which cancer cells take up and utilize nutrients in order to grow and survive. Our lead product candidate in tumor metabolism takes advantage of the pronounced dependency many cancers have on the nutrient glutamine for growth and survival.

More about CB-839 →



Tumor Immunology
Tumor immunology seeks to activate the body’s own immune system to attack and kill cancer cells. Our preclinical program in tumor immunology is focused on developing selective inhibitors of the enzyme arginase.

Calithera Biosciences is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel small molecule oncology drugs directed against tumor and immune cell targets that control key metabolic pathways in the tumor microenvironment.


Tumor metabolism and tumor immunology have emerged as promising new interrelated fields for cancer drug discovery, and recent clinical successes with therapeutic agents in each field have demonstrated the potential to create fundamentally new therapies for cancer patients. We are developing agents that take advantage of the unique metabolic requirements of tumor cells and cancer-fighting immune cells such as cytotoxic T-cells. 
Our lead product candidate, CB-839, is an internally discovered, first-in-class inhibitor of glutaminase, a critical enzyme in tumor cells. We are currently evaluating CB-839 in Phase 1 clinical trials in solid tumors. CB-839 administered as a single agent has resulted in clinical responses in renal cell cancer and acute myeloid leukemia, and clinical benefits in several other tumor types.  We are currently enrolling patients in a series of combination Phase 1b cohorts in specific solid tumor types. We are also evaluating the immune-enhancing activity of CB-839 in a separate Phase 1/2 trial in which solid tumor patients are treated with CB-839 in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor.  
Our second product candidate, CB-1158, is a first-in-class immuno-oncology metabolic checkpoint inhibitor targeting arginase, an immunosuppressive enzyme in myeloid-derived suppressor cells responsible for T-cell suppression. In July 2016, we announced the acceptance of the Investigational New Drug application, or IND, by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA.  In September 2016, we treated the first patient in a Phase 1 clinical trial with CB-1158.

Pipeline
CB-839
Arginase Inhibitors



CB-839 has the potential to be an important new therapeutic agent with a novel mechanism of action for the treatment of a broad range of cancers.
Genetically mandated alterations in the fundamental metabolic pathways of tumors often cause a dramatic rise in the uptake of the nutrients glucose and glutamine. Removal of glutamine leads to a substantial reduction in cell growth or induces cell death in certain types of cancer cells, indicating that these cells are dependent on, or “addicted” to, glutamine. Normal cells do not show this pronounced dependence on glutamine. The enzyme glutaminase, which converts glutamine to glutamate, has been identified as a critical choke point in the utilization of glutamine by cancer cells. CB-839 is a potent, selective, reversible and orally bioavailable inhibitor of human glutaminase.



Inhibition of glutaminase also results in accumulation of glutamine in tumors. Glutamine, which is frequently depleted in the tumor microenvironment due to uptake by tumor cells, has been shown to be an important nutrient for T-cell growth. CB-839 could potentially have an impact on the treatment of cancer by first starving the tumor cell, and second facilitating the activation of T-cells in the nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment.
In preclinical studies, CB-839 has been shown to halt the growth of or kill cancer cells across a range of tumor types. The compound has demonstrated antitumor activity in several different tumor models in animals. In preclinical toxicology studies, CB-839 was well tolerated in animals at doses above those shown to inhibit tumor growth. CB-839 has also shown strong synergy with immunomodulatory agents and several kinase inhibitors that target growth factor pathways.
Calithera’s clinical program seeks to identify cancers that will be most sensitive to CB-839 to allow the greatest benefit for patients and to pursue the most efficient path to regulatory approval. Based on our preclinical data, we believe several specific tumor types will be sensitive to glutaminase inhibition and benefit from treatment with CB-839.
Calithera is currently conducting multiple Phase 1b combination trials of CB-839 in solid tumors. CB-839 administered as a single agent has resulted in clinical responses in renal cell cancer and acute myeloid leukemia and clinical benefit in several other tumor types. Calithera is currently enrolling patients in a series of combination Phase 1b cohorts in specific solid tumor types of CB-839 in combination with standard therapies and immune-oncology agents.  Phase 2 trials in renal cell carcinoma and triple negative breast cancer are planned to begin in 2017.
Results of Calithera’s preclinical and clinical studies of CB-839 have been presented at several scientific conferences and these data may be viewed on our Publications page.

Science
Calithera’s ongoing research efforts are focused on discovering additional product candidates against novel tumor metabolism and immunology targets.


Tumor metabolism and tumor immunology have emerged as promising new fields for cancer drug discovery, and recent clinical successes with therapeutic agents in each field have demonstrated the potential to create fundamentally new therapies for cancer patients.  We have accumulated significant experience and understanding of tumor metabolism and tumor immunology and are applying our medicinal chemistry capabilities to identify small molecules that exploit these pathways.  To date, we have utilized this expertise to internally discover CB-839, our first-in-class oncology product candidate that is now in clinical testing.  We plan to continue to leverage our expertise to discover and develop additional product candidates advance those product candidates through clinical testing, and, if approved, ultimately commercialize meaningful therapies for patients with cancer. 

Tumor Metabolism
Many types of cancer cells develop a unique dependence on specific metabolic pathways upon which normal cells are not reliant. The primary goal of drugs targeting tumor metabolism pathways is to take advantage of cancer-specific nutrient dependencies to block cancer growth. 
The field of tumor metabolism seeks to exploit the unique ways in which cancer cells take up and utilize nutrients in order to grow and survive. It is now recognized that cancer cells rely on certain metabolic processes, or pathways, to a much greater extent than normal cells. Accordingly, when these metabolic pathways are blocked, cancer cells are essentially starved of critical nutrients and stop growing or die, whereas normal cells are largely unaffected.  Changes in cellular metabolism are remarkably consistent across many tumor types, yet fundamentally different from normal cells, providing the potential to develop broadly applicable agents that target these altered pathways, but have less toxicity than standard cytotoxic agents. 
Our lead product candidate in tumor metabolism, CB-839, takes advantage of the pronounced dependency many cancers have on the nutrient glutamine for growth and survival. CB-839 inhibits glutaminase, an enzyme required by cancer cells to utilize glutamine effectively.

Tumor Immunology
The field of tumor immunology seeks to activate the body’s own immune system to attack and kill cancer cells.  Genetically diverse tumor types have developed mechanisms to escape destruction by the body’s immune system. 
One key mechanism is through suppression of cytotoxic T cells that would otherwise attack and kill the cancer cells.  Arginine is an amino acid that is fundamental to the function of cytotoxic T cells.  Without arginine, tumor- specific cytotoxic T cells fail to express a functional T cell receptor on their surface and as a result are unable to activate, proliferate, or mount an effective anti-tumor response. 
We believe that inhibitors of arginase can promote an anti-tumor immune response by restoring arginine levels, thereby allowing activation of the body’s cancer-fighting immune cells.

Science
Calithera’s ongoing research efforts are focused on discovering additional product candidates against novel tumor metabolism and immunology targets.


Tumor metabolism and tumor immunology have emerged as promising new fields for cancer drug discovery, and recent clinical successes with therapeutic agents in each field have demonstrated the potential to create fundamentally new therapies for cancer patients.  We have accumulated significant experience and understanding of tumor metabolism and tumor immunology and are applying our medicinal chemistry capabilities to identify small molecules that exploit these pathways.  To date, we have utilized this expertise to internally discover CB-839, our first-in-class oncology product candidate that is now in clinical testing.  We plan to continue to leverage our expertise to discover and develop additional product candidates advance those product candidates through clinical testing, and, if approved, ultimately commercialize meaningful therapies for patients with cancer. 

Tumor Metabolism
Many types of cancer cells develop a unique dependence on specific metabolic pathways upon which normal cells are not reliant. The primary goal of drugs targeting tumor metabolism pathways is to take advantage of cancer-specific nutrient dependencies to block cancer growth. 
The field of tumor metabolism seeks to exploit the unique ways in which cancer cells take up and utilize nutrients in order to grow and survive. It is now recognized that cancer cells rely on certain metabolic processes, or pathways, to a much greater extent than normal cells. Accordingly, when these metabolic pathways are blocked, cancer cells are essentially starved of critical nutrients and stop growing or die, whereas normal cells are largely unaffected.  Changes in cellular metabolism are remarkably consistent across many tumor types, yet fundamentally different from normal cells, providing the potential to develop broadly applicable agents that target these altered pathways, but have less toxicity than standard cytotoxic agents. 
Our lead product candidate in tumor metabolism, CB-839, takes advantage of the pronounced dependency many cancers have on the nutrient glutamine for growth and survival. CB-839 inhibits glutaminase, an enzyme required by cancer cells to utilize glutamine effectively.

Tumor Immunology
The field of tumor immunology seeks to activate the body’s own immune system to attack and kill cancer cells.  Genetically diverse tumor types have developed mechanisms to escape destruction by the body’s immune system. 
One key mechanism is through suppression of cytotoxic T cells that would otherwise attack and kill the cancer cells.  Arginine is an amino acid that is fundamental to the function of cytotoxic T cells.  Without arginine, tumor- specific cytotoxic T cells fail to express a functional T cell receptor on their surface and as a result are unable to activate, proliferate, or mount an effective anti-tumor response. 
We believe that inhibitors of arginase can promote an anti-tumor immune response by restoring arginine levels, thereby allowing activation of the body’s cancer-fighting immune cells.

					Full Description



Calithera Biosciences, Inc., incorporated on March 9, 2010, is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company. The Company focuses on discovering and developing small molecule drugs directed against tumor and immune cell targets that control key metabolic pathways in the tumor microenvironment. The Company is engaged in developing agents that take advantage of the metabolic requirements of tumor cells and cancer-fighting immune cells, such as cytotoxic T-cells. The Company's lead product candidate, CB-839, is a critical enzyme in tumor cells. Its other product candidate, CB-1158, is being developed for hematology and oncology indications. CB-1158 is a potent and selective orally bioavailable inhibitor of the enzyme arginase.CB-839 is a selective, reversible and orally bioavailable inhibitor of human glutaminase. CB-839 binds to a site on glutaminase that is distinct from the site that binds glutamine, thereby reducing the potential for undesirable side effects due to inhibition of other enzymes and receptors that bind glutamine. In preclinical studies, CB-839 has been shown to halt the growth of or kill cancer cells across a range of tumor types. In addition, CB-839 has shown synergy with immunomodulatory agents and several kinase inhibitors that target growth factor pathways. The Company is enrolling patients in a series of combination Phase Ib cohorts in specific solid tumor types. Arginine is an amino acid that is fundamental to the function of cytotoxic T cells. In response to tumor-secreted factors, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) accumulate in the tumor and secrete the enzyme arginase, resulting in depletion of arginine from the tumor microenvironment. CB-1158 has single agent anti-tumor activity in syngeneic mouse tumor models that has been demonstrated to act through an immune mechanism. CB-1158 is being tested in a Phase I clinical trial in patients with solid tumors.The Company competes with Advanced Cancer Therapeutics, LLC, Aeglea Biotherapeutics, Inc., Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bayer Pharma AG, Celgene Corporation, Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Forma Therapeutics Holdings, LLC, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Novartis International AG, Quantum Pharmaceuticals, 3-V Biosciences, Inc., Rhizen Pharmaceuticals SA, Sprint Biosciences, Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

(CALA), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel small molecule drugs directed against tumor metabolism and tumor immunology targets for the treatment of cancer, today announced that Susan Molineaux, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Calithera, will participate in the upcoming JMP Securities 2017 Life Sciences Conference.Dr. Molineaux will participate in a panel discussion entitled, “Immuno-Oncology Combination Strategies,” on Wednesday, June 21, 2017 at 10:00 a.m. EDT.  The conference will be held in New York, NY.About Calithera Calithera Biosciences, Inc. is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel small molecule drugs directed against tumor metabolism and tumor immunology targets for the treatment of cancer. Calithera’s lead product candidate, CB-839, is an inhibitor of glutaminase. CB-839 takes advantage of the pronounced dependency many cancers have on the nutrient glutamine for growth and survival. It is currently being evaluated in Phase 1/2 clinical trials in combination with standard of care agents. CB-1158 is an investigational immuno-oncology metabolic checkpoint inhibitor designed to target arginase, a critical immunosuppressive enzyme responsible for T-cell suppression by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Arginase depletes arginine, a nutrient that is critical for the activation, growth and survival of the body’s cancer-fighting immune cells, known as cytotoxic T-cells. CB-1158 is being developed in collaboration with Incyte Corporation and is currently in a Phase I clinical trial. Calithera is headquartered in South San Francisco, California.

Calithera is discovering and developing novel small molecule drugs directed against tumor metabolism and tumor immunology targets for the treatment of cancer.








Tumor Metabolism
The field of tumor metabolism seeks to exploit the unique ways in which cancer cells take up and utilize nutrients in order to grow and survive. Our lead product candidate in tumor metabolism takes advantage of the pronounced dependency many cancers have on the nutrient glutamine for growth and survival.
