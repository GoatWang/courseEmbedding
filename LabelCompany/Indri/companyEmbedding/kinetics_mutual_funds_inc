Disclosure
The Paradigm Fund is classified as a non-diversified fund. Therefore, the value of its shares may fluctuate more than shares invested in a broader range of industries. You should consult the Fund’s prospectus for a complete list of risks associated with your investment.
You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund carefully before investing.  For a free copy of the fund’s prospectus, which contains this and other information, you may click here or call us at 1-800-930-3828.  You should read the prospectus carefully before you invest.
S&P 500 Index statistics data is based on the iShares S&P 500 Index Fund for market cap, price to book, price to earnings, return on equity, and active share. iShares is a product of BlackRock, Inc.
The MSCI ACWI (All Country World Index) Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is designed to measure the equity market performance of developed and emerging markets. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index represents an unmanaged, broad-based basket of stocks. It is typically used as a proxy for overall market performance. The S&P 500 Index returns assume that dividends are reinvested. An investor cannot invest directly in an index.
The Growth of $10,000 chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in No Load Class shares commencement of operations (12/31/99). It assumes reinvestment of capital gains and dividends. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance.
Holdings are expressed as a percentage of total net investments and may vary over time. Equity holdings are subject to change, and may not be indicative of actual market position due to the use of call and put options.
The Top 10 Sectors displayed represent a percentage of the net assets and excludes cash equivalents and other assets in excess of liabilities.
Assets represent the total net assets for the specified portfolio, which includes all fund classes.
Gross expense ratio listed for No-Load Class, Advisor Class A, Advisor Class C and Institutional Class are referenced in the April 30, 2016 respective prospectus.
The Fund’s adviser, Kinetics Asset Management LLC, has voluntarily agreed to waive management fees and reimburse fund expenses so that net annual fund operating expenses of the No Load Class do not exceed certain levels through May 1, 2017 and may be discontinued at any time by the Fund’s adviser after May 1, 2017.
Definitions:
Beta: A statistic that measures the volatility of the fund, as compared to the overall market. The market’s beta is set at 1.00; therefore a beta higher than 1.00 is considered to be more volatile than the market, while a beta lower than 1.00 is considered to be less volatile. It is important to note that a low beta for a fund does not necessarily imply that the fund has a low level of volatility, a low beta signifies only that the fund’s market-related risk is low.  The Beta has been calculated since inception.
Standard Deviation: A statistical measure of portfolio risk used to measure variability of total return around an average, over a specified period of time. The greater the standard deviation over the period, the wider the variability or range of returns and hence, the greater the fund’s volatility. The standard deviation has been calculated since inception.
Up Market Capture Ratio: A statistical measure of an investment manager’s overall performance in up-markets. The up-market capture ratio is used to evaluate how well an investment manager performed relative to an index during periods when that index has risen. The up-market capture ratio has been calculated since inception.
Down Market Capture Ratio: A statistical measure of an investment manager’s overall performance in down-markets. The down-market capture ratio is used to evaluate how well or poorly an investment manager performed relative to an index during periods when that index has dropped. The down-market capture ratio has been calculated since inception.
Sharpe Ratio: A statistical measure that uses standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk. A higher Sharpe ratio implies a better historical risk-adjusted performance. The Sharpe ratio has been calculated since inception using the 3-month treasury bill for the risk-free rate of return.
Weighted Avg. Mkt. Cap: The mean market capitalization (value of outstanding shares) of a basket of stocks, taking into account the relative weight of each investment.
Median Market Capitalization: The median market capitalization (value of outstanding shares) of a basket of stocks.
Price to Book Ratio: The harmonic weighted average of the price/book (P/B) ratios of the equity securities referenced. The ratio calculated by dividing the current price of the stock by the company’s book value per share (assets minus liabilities).
Price to Earnings Ratio: The harmonic weighted average of the price/earnings (P/E) ratios of the equity securities referenced. The P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the current price of the stock by the trailing one year earnings.
Return on Equity: The amount of net income returned as a percentage of shareholders equity. Return on equity measures a corporation’s profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested.
Turnover Ratio: A measure of how frequently assets within a fund are bought and sold by the managers represented over a one year period.
Active share: A measure of the percentage of holdings in a portfolio that differ from a benchmark index.  It is calculated by taking the sum of the differences of the weight of each holding in the portfolio and the weight of each holding in the benchmark index and dividing by two. Active Share Ratio: Active share is measured against the iShares S&P 500 ETF.

Disclosure
The Medical Fund is classified as a non-diversified fund. Therefore, the value of its shares may fluctuate more than shares invested in a broader range of industries. You should consult the Fund’s prospectus for a complete list of risks associated with your investment.
You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund carefully before investing.  For a free copy of the fund’s prospectus, which contains this and other information, you may click here or call us at 1-800-930-3828.  You should read the prospectus carefully before you invest.
S&P 500 Index statistics data is based on the iShares S&P 500 Index Fund for market cap, price to book, price to earnings, return on equity, and active share. iShares is a product of BlackRock, Inc.
The NASDAQ Composite (NASDAQ) and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500) each represent an unmanaged, broad-based basket of stocks. They are typically used as a proxy for overall market performance. NASDAQ Composite returns stated above do NOT include reinvested dividends, while the S&P 500 Index returns assume that dividends are reinvested. An investor cannot invest directly in an index.
The Growth of $10,000 chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in No Load Class shares commencement of operations (9/30/99). It assumes reinvestment of capital gains and dividends. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance.
Holdings are expressed as a percentage of total net investments and may vary over time. Equity holdings are subject to change, and may not be indicative of actual market position due to the use of call and put options.
The Top Industries displayed represent a percentage of the net assets and excludes cash equivalents and other assets in excess of liabilities.
Assets represent the total net assets for the specified portfolio, which includes all fund classes.
Gross expense ratio listed for No-Load Class, Advisor Class A and Advisor Class C Class are referenced in the April 30, 2016 respective prospectus.
The Fund’s adviser, Kinetics Asset Management LLC, has voluntarily agreed to waive management fees and reimburse fund expenses so that net annual fund operating expenses of the No Load Class do not exceed certain levels through May 1, 2017 and may be discontinued at any time by the Fund’s adviser after May 1, 2017.
Definitions:
Beta: A statistic that measures the volatility of the fund, as compared to the overall market. The market’s beta is set at 1.00; therefore a beta higher than 1.00 is considered to be more volatile than the market, while a beta lower than 1.00 is considered to be less volatile. It is important to note that a low beta for a fund does not necessarily imply that the fund has a low level of volatility, a low beta signifies only that the fund’s market-related risk is low.  The Beta has been calculated since inception.
Standard Deviation: A statistical measure of portfolio risk used to measure variability of total return around an average, over a specified period of time. The greater the standard deviation over the period, the wider the variability or range of returns and hence, the greater the fund’s volatility. The standard deviation has been calculated since inception.
Up Market Capture Ratio: A statistical measure of an investment manager’s overall performance in up-markets. The up-market capture ratio is used to evaluate how well an investment manager performed relative to an index during periods when that index has risen. The up-market capture ratio has been calculated since inception.
Down Market Capture Ratio: A statistical measure of an investment manager’s overall performance in down-markets. The down-market capture ratio is used to evaluate how well or poorly an investment manager performed relative to an index during periods when that index has dropped. The down-market capture ratio has been calculated since inception.
Sharpe Ratio: A statistical measure that uses standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk. A higher Sharpe ratio implies a better historical risk-adjusted performance. The Sharpe ratio has been calculated since inception using the 3-month treasury bill for the risk-free rate of return.
Weighted Avg. Mkt. Cap: The mean market capitalization (value of outstanding shares) of a basket of stocks, taking into account the relative weight of each investment.
Median Market Capitalization: The median market capitalization (value of outstanding shares) of a basket of stocks.
Price to Book Ratio: The harmonic weighted average of the price/book (P/B) ratios of the equity securities referenced. The ratio calculated by dividing the current price of the stock by the company’s book value per share (assets minus liabilities).
Price to Earnings Ratio: The harmonic weighted average of the price/earnings (P/E) ratios of the equity securities referenced. The P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the current price of the stock by the trailing one year earnings.
Return on Equity: The amount of net income returned as a percentage of shareholders equity. Return on equity measures a corporation’s profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested.
Turnover Ratio: A measure of how frequently assets within a fund are bought and sold by the managers represented over a one year period.
Active share: A measure of the percentage of holdings in a portfolio that differ from a benchmark index. It is calculated by taking the sum of the differences of the weight of each holding in the portfolio and the weight of each holding in the benchmark index and dividing by two. Active Share Ratio: Active share is measured against the iShares S&P 500 ETF.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund scores Below Average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Above Average because they fall between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks long-term growth of capital.




Strategy



The fund is a non-diversified fund that invests all of its investable assets in the Medical Portfolio, a series of Kinetics Portfolios Trust. The Portfolio invests at least 80% of its net assets plus any borrowings for investment purposes in common stocks, convertible securities, warrants, and other equity securities having the characteristics of common stocks of U.S. and foreign companies engaged in medical research, pharmaceutical and medical technology industries and related technology industries, with an emphasis toward companies engaged in cancer research and drug development.

Risk



The health care industries are subject to government regulation and reimbursement rates, as well as government approval of products and services, which could have a significant effect on price and availability, and can be significantly affected by rapid obsolescence and patent expirations. Sector funds can be more volatile because of their narrow concentration in a specific industry. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average

This fund scores Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund scores Below Average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



The health care industries are subject to government regulation and reimbursement rates, as well as government approval of products and services, which could have a significant effect on price and availability, and can be significantly affected by rapid obsolescence and patent expirations. Sector funds can be more volatile because of their narrow concentration in a specific industry. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
7. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
8. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
9. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.
10. Expense caps and waivers are limits that the fund company has placed on the level of the expenses borne by the fund until 5/1/2018 and indicates the maximum level of expenses (with certain exceptions) that the fund would be paying until that time. After the expiration date, the expense cap and/or waiver may be terminated or revised, which may lower the fund's yield and return.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Information is updated every day at approximately 6P CST. The Last Price, Change, and Change Percent is listed at the top, with other quote data listed in the quoteboard below.  Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity. YTD High, Low, Change, %Change: The high and low price year-to-date, with the change and percent change year-to-date.

Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."                                  Add Data Columns to this Table Learn about our Custom Views   Want to use this as  your default charts setting?

The Morningstar Category is shown next to the Morningstar Style Box which identifies a fund's investment focus, based on the underlying securities in the fund.Morningstar CategoryWhile the investment objective stated in a fund's prospectus may or may not reflect how the fund actually invests, the Morningstar category is assigned based on the underlying securities in each portfolio. Morningstar categories help investors and investment professionals make meaningful comparisons between funds. The categories make it easier to build well-diversified portfolios, assess potential risk, and identify top-performing funds. We place funds in a given category based on their portfolio statistics and compositions over the past three years. If the fund is new and has no portfolio history, we estimate where it will fall before giving it a more permanent category assignment. When necessary, we may change a category assignment based on recent changes to the portfolio.Fund OverviewCategoryMid-Cap GrowthFund FamilyKineticsNet Assets675.75MYTD Return7.01%Yield0.00%Morningstar Rating★★★Inception DateMay 26, 2005Fund OperationsLast Dividend0.26Last Cap Gain0.00Holdings Turnover2.00%Average for CategoryN/AFees & ExpensesExpenseKNPYXCategory AverageAnnual Report Expense Ratio (net)1.44%1.24%Prospectus Net Expense Ratio1.44%N/AProspectus Gross Expense Ratio1.70%N/AMax 12b1 FeeN/AN/AMax Front End Sales LoadN/A5.34%Max Deferred Sales LoadN/A1.70%3 Yr Expense Projection510N/A5 Yr Expense Projection899N/A10 Yr Expense Projection1,987N/AYahoo Small BusinessData DisclaimerHelpSuggestionsPrivacyAbout Our AdsTerms (Updated)

About Us

Horizon Kinetics LLC, founded in 1994, is an independently owned and operated investment adviser. We adhere to a long-term, contrarian, fundamental value investment philosophy that the founders established in 1985 at Bankers Trust Company. Horizon Kinetics has over 70 employees, with primary offices in New York City and White Plains, New York.
Philosophy
Horizon Kinetics was founded on the belief that a short-term investment approach, widely adopted with the modernization of financial markets, ultimately produces sub-optimal returns. We believe that investors are better served not by taking more risk, but by extending their investment time horizon, which affords far wider ranges of opportunity and valuation than are available to time-constrained institutional investors.  The startling degree of return possibility ignored by a short-term focus is most easily seen in the Equity Yield Curve, a chart you will not find elsewhere.
And while all acknowledge the tremendous power of compounding, practically speaking (and by definition) this benefit simply cannot be harnessed in a short time frame. Our investment strategies – supported entirely by our independent, fundamental research – typically reflect contrarian views that seek to take advantage of the short-term focus of the marketplace.

Investment Research
Publishing research has been the cornerstone of our investment process. We believe that requiring research analysts to frame their investment ideas in writing helps avoid the common behavioral finance error of adjusting one’s investment thesis in response to short-term market price fluctuations. Our research team produces a variety of research publications for the institutional investment community covering undervalued and often systematically mispriced classes of securities, ranging from global spin-offs to distressed debt.

Investment Strategies
With a long-term absolute return mindset, and based on first-hand research, our portfolios tend to be concentrated and avoid tracking or mimicking any benchmark or index. An investment and research process that is de-linked from the standard short-term relative-return benchmarking that leads to crowd-investing behavior should be expected to produce returns that are generally less correlated with other managers and funds. Accordingly, our strategies might be considered diversifying elements within broader asset allocations. Horizon Kinetics offers separately managed accounts, mutual funds and alternative investment products suitable for individual and institutional investors, through its wholly owned registered investment advisers. These include the Kinetics Mutual Funds, Inc. series of open-end registered investment funds.
