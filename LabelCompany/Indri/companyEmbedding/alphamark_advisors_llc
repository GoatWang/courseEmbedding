Mutual Fund Investors

AlphaMark Mutual Fund Investors
The AlphaMark equity investment philosophy is grounded by an appreciation of risk.  We identify earnings momentum in high quality, high cash flow companies.  It is imperative to select only those companies that have a sustainable business model through various economic conditions.  A sustainable business model is one that is focused on organic growth supplemented by acquisitions and capital investment.  A strong business model creates shareholder wealth as can be measured by the return on equity that a company produces.  A company that produces a reliable stream of cash from operating activities can succeed in economically challenging times.  AlphaMark Advisors incorporates a proprietary three-tier cash flow model to identify those companies that can produce reliable cash flow streams and are priced at a level that justifies the growth opportunity.  An assessment of secular trends in the markets and the economy will exert some influence on the economic sector weightings of our portfolios.  Position sizes of all of our holdings are monitored to ensure that a diversified portfolio is maintained.  Disciplined investment decisions are not based on emotional trends sold by Wall Street or the media, rather based on following and adhering to our investment philosophy through all market conditions.
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the funds carefully before investing. To obtain a prospectus, which contains this and other information, click on the prospectus link or contact AlphaMark Funds by calling 866-422-3350. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.  The AlphaMark Funds are distributed by Ultimus Fund Distributors, LLC.

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

Consensus Ratings for Hollysys Automation Technologies (NASDAQ:HOLI) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?)

Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings.

MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.50)Consensus Price Target: $18.70 (1.22% downside)

The Morningstar Category is shown next to the Morningstar Style Box which identifies a fund's investment focus, based on the underlying securities in the fund.Morningstar CategoryWhile the investment objective stated in a fund's prospectus may or may not reflect how the fund actually invests, the Morningstar category is assigned based on the underlying securities in each portfolio. Morningstar categories help investors and investment professionals make meaningful comparisons between funds. The categories make it easier to build well-diversified portfolios, assess potential risk, and identify top-performing funds. We place funds in a given category based on their portfolio statistics and compositions over the past three years. If the fund is new and has no portfolio history, we estimate where it will fall before giving it a more permanent category assignment. When necessary, we may change a category assignment based on recent changes to the portfolio.Fund OverviewCategoryLarge GrowthFund FamilyAlphaMarkNet Assets23.15MYTD Return8.70%Yield0.01%Morningstar Rating★★★Inception DateOct 30, 2008Fund OperationsLast Dividend0.00Last Cap Gain0.00Holdings Turnover59.00%Average for CategoryN/AFees & ExpensesExpenseAMLCXCategory AverageAnnual Report Expense Ratio (net)1.50%1.13%Prospectus Net Expense Ratio1.50%N/AProspectus Gross Expense Ratio1.98%N/AMax 12b1 Fee0.25%N/AMax Front End Sales LoadN/A5.32%Max Deferred Sales LoadN/A1.77%3 Yr Expense Projection575N/A5 Yr Expense Projection1,023N/A10 Yr Expense Projection2,268N/AYahoo Small BusinessData DisclaimerHelpSuggestionsPrivacyAbout Our AdsTerms (Updated)
