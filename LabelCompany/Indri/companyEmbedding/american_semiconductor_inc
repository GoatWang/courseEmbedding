FleXform-ADC™ Flexible Hybrid Development Kit
The FleXform-ADC is the world's first complete development kit for flexible hybrid electronics. The FleXform-ADC is designed for developing and prototyping printed and/or flexible sensors integrated with physically flexible FleX-ICs.The FleXform-ADC provides:"Out-of-the-box" proof of FHE feasibilityUser printable area with on-board FleX-ADC™Integration Board and SoftwareEnables printed device demonstrationFully supported by American Semiconductor's flexible technology integration team for design and manufacturingFleXform-ADC is currently available for $3,950. For availability, please contact us at sales@americansemi.com





FleX-ADCThis 2.5V integrated circuit is an 8-bit successive approximation Analog to Digital Converter with 8 input channels. What makes the FleX-ADC different from other analog-to-digital converters is that it is physically flexible just like the underlying substrate. The FleX-ADC is manufactured in a 130nm CMOS process and then converted to its current flexible format using American Semiconductor’s Silicon-on-Polymer technology.
 






 




FleXform-ADC Flexible Hybrid SystemThe substrate for the flexible hybrid system is a two-layer flexible circuit board (FCB). This is a 125 micron (5 mil) thick PET substrate with 2-layers of electronic interconnect created using screen printing techniques. We have also provided means to integrate printed sensors on the flexible circuit board. We have 6 sensor areas available for printing, two of which are connected to Op Amps for signal amplification. The flexible circuit board also provides 6 programmable GPIOs available that can be integrated with your sensors.


FleXform-ADC PCBTo control and communicate with the FleX-ADC, we have our rigid printed circuit board. The brain of this board is an ATmega328P which you might recognize as the chip used on the Arduino Uno. This chip was chosen so that FleXform-ADC is 99% Arduino compatible. The microcontroller on the PCB comes pre-programmed to let us begin using the development kit right out of the box.The features of the PCB include:3 Character 7-segment displayReset Button2 Programmable, Debounced push buttonsA breakout connector for the ZIF tailJumpers for Voltage Reference, External Voltage, and Op Amp selectionA power switch and indicator lightA Quad Op Amp ICTwo built in sensors; A thermistor and a skin resistive sensor

Smart Labels
RFID Temperature Sensor labelUHF (902-928 MHz)Passive Power (from reader)EPC Gen 2 (ISO 18000-6C)-40'C to 60C +/- 2'C~8ft Range4" x 1" Label SizeDatasheet

American Semiconductor's GP-Tag represents the leading edge of new smart label technology. This wireless sensor tag has the look, feel and application characteristics of a conventional small shipping label. The difference is that this tag can report the temperature of the environment it experiences.The passive tag has no battery requirement and the wireless capability of the tag allows reporting temperatures inside of a shipping container without requiring the container to be opened. The tag can be also be used as an integral part of data collection for product quality.The tag requires RFID readers that can provide sufficient power for the temperature sensing functions in addition to the write and read commands that are typical of Class1Gen2 RFID tags. Low-cost full-size readers and portable hand-held readers are currently available for this tag. Applications and support for reading/plotting temperature data are available for Android and Windows platforms

HEIDENHAIN Linear Encoders

















 HOME



Boost productivity—and performance—with fast, accurate linear encoders

            When you need only the highest positioning accuracy, only linear encoders from HEIDENHAIN can get the job done. Our advanced design improves productivity by eliminating machine tool position errors caused by thermal expansion, deformation of the drive mechanics, pitch issues and more. In addition to increased accuracy, high long-term speed stability and thermal behavior control, HEIDENHAIN&CloseCurlyQuote;s linear encoders are also characterized by their sturdy construction and high resistance to vibration.
          
Why HEIDENHAIN?


Wide range of position measuring devices—including sealed and exposed linear encoders, scales and length gages in absolute and incremental versions


Finer signal periods offer highest interpolation accuracy


Compact, lightweight and easy to install


Functions properly even after many years of operation


HEIDENHAIN sealed linear encoders 

An aluminum housing and downward-oriented elastic lips protect the scale, scanning carriage and its guideway from chips, dust and fluids—ideal for machine tool applications
The scanning carriage travels along the scale on a low-friction guide
Encoders connect to the external mounting block via a coupling that compensates for any misalignment between the scale and the machine guideway

HEIDENHAIN exposed linear encoders

No mechanical contact between the scanning head and the scale or scale tape
Ideal applications include measuring machines, comparators and other precision linear metrology devices, and production and measuring equipment (semiconductor applications, for example)
