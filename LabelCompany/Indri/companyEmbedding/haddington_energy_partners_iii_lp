(PRN) Haddington Ventures to Fund Tristream Energy's Growth in Midstream Energy Sector


PRNewswire


        Published 3:00 pm, Tuesday, February 13, 2007
    



































































SUGAR LAND, Texas, Feb. 13 /PRNewswire/ -- Haddington Ventures, L.L.C. and Tristream Energy, LLC announced today that Haddington Ventures has made a majority equity investment in Tristream to fund its growth in the midstream energy sector. Tristream Energy develops, acquires and operates midstream infrastructure downstream of producer facilities in major U.S. producing basins.
Tristream management is experienced in the full range of midstream operations including onshore and offshore gathering, conventional/nonconventional gas, nitrogen rejection, compression, hydrocarbon or acid gas reinjection, gas treating, processing, product fractionation and storage.

(Story continues below ...)


Tristream Energy is led by Ken Purgason, President and CEO, Tony Catalano, Executive Vice President and COO and Mike Urban, CFO. These experienced energy executives were most recently associated with the highly successful Sago Energy, LP, a midstream energy company also backed by Haddington Ventures. In 1998, Messrs. Purgason and Catalano co-founded Sago Energy, which ultimately grew to own and operate more than 2,400 miles of gathering and transmission lines and associated processing, fractionation and treating assets in Texas and Louisiana. Mr. Urban was Sago's Chief Financial Officer. Sago sold its Louisiana and Texas operating subsidiaries in 2004.
"Our renewed association with Haddington Ventures lays the groundwork for a repeat of the great success of Sago Energy," said Mr. Purgason. "The Haddington Venture principals provide not only capital but, more importantly, key midstream energy expertise and understanding. Tristream Energy has the capital backing as well as the commercial, technical, and regulatory expertise to create more value for producers' gas by providing additional sales outlets and moving stranded or shut in gas to the sales meter. Tristream can also buy producers' midstream assets, such as gathering lines, pipelines and processing or treating plants. This can provide the producer with immediate cash for additional oil and gas reserve development or acquisition opportunities."
Chris Jones, Managing Director of Haddington Ventures said, "We are excited about backing the Tristream management team in this new venture. They have a proven track record and expertise that will prove invaluable in today's competitive, volatile energy landscape. We look forward to employing capital through Tristream Energy to pursue our common goals."

Haddington Energy Partners Closes On $350 Million Private Equity Fund For Midstream Energy Investments

						 from   Haddington Ventures, L.L.C. 











 
















































 

 




















 


HOUSTON, Nov. 15, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Haddington Ventures, L.L.C. announced today that it has closed its latest private equity fund, Haddington Energy Partners IV, LP (HEP IV), with total committed capital of nearly $350 million targeted for investments in midstream energy infrastructure.  
According to senior managing partner Chris Jones, HEP IV is targeting conventional midstream opportunities and is seeking to invest in experienced midstream management teams with proven track records of success in entrepreneurial environments.  
"HEP IV clearly demonstrates Haddington's commitment to building infrastructure in the midstream energy business by investing in entrepreneurs with the skills to create and grow world-class midstream projects and companies," Mr. Jones said.  "These management teams require strong leaders able to drive strategic company visions, create and manage highly capable organizations, and integrate strong operating capabilities.  HEP IV targets management teams to both develop or acquire and optimize a wide variety of midstream infrastructure."    
"HEP IV closed at nearly double the size of HEP III, which served to diversify Haddington's investor base significantly," said Terry Crikelair, Managing Partner of Champlain Advisors, LLC, who served as exclusive placement agent.  "We were pleased with the strong interest from several new investors along with the continued support from the existing investor base."
Haddington has raised nearly $700 million of equity capital since its formation in 1998.  Currently, one third of Haddington's management teams are repeat portfolio company management teams from prior Haddington funds. 
Haddington's senior partners are all former successful midstream entrepreneurs and operators; their prior entrepreneurial backgrounds have since been supplemented with a lengthy history of working together as fund managers at Haddington.  This unusual combination of backgrounds allows Haddington to bring a wealth of midstream contacts and experiences to its portfolio company teams, along with a proven track record of successfully sponsoring midstream asset acquisition and development teams.
The participating investors in HEP IV include insurance companies, public and private pensions, endowments, bank holding companies and high net worth individuals.  
Greenwich, CT-based Champlain Advisors, LLC, a global fund placement and investor relations advisory firm, served as Haddington's exclusive placement agent in raising HEP IV.

Haddington sells Bobcat Gas Storage assets to Spectra for $540MM








July 16, 2010









































Source: Haddington
Haddington Ventures entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Bobcat Gas Storage assets and development project to Spectra Energy Corp. (NYSE:SE) for $540 million. The Bobcat Gas Storage Project was developed by Port Barre Investments, LLC, which is owned by members of management, Haddington Energy Partners III LP, a private equity fund managed by Haddington Ventures, L.L.C., and GE Energy Financial Services, the energy investing unit of GE (NYSE:GE) . Located in Port Barre, Louisiana, the project began development in 2006 and entered commercial operation in November 2008. Following the addition of a second cavern in 2009, the facility has working gas storage capacity of approximately 19 billion cubic feet. "The Bobcat project exemplifies Haddington's strategy to acquire, develop and eventually exit midstream energy projects," said Haddington Managing Director J. Chris Jones. "We are very pleased to have reached an agreement with Spectra Energy, an experienced operator, who will continue the expansion of the assets as we had envisioned. Having previously sold the Lodi Gas Storage project in California, our gas storage efforts are now focused on Magnum Gas Storage, a salt cavern storage project near Delta, Utah." Completion of the transaction is subject to approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close before year-end 2010.[Native Advertisement]
