From new investment funds to accelerator programs to crowdfunding platforms, 26 new private food and agriculture funding sources launched over the past year. We’ve compiled these funding sources into an easy-to-reference list below, which we will continue to update throughout the year. We’ll also be posting a more detailed analysis on Forbes in the next few weeks, so be sure to check back.

Alpha Strauss FoodTech Center of Excellence: Israel-based packed food company Strauss Group is partnering with startup accelerator MassChallenge to launch a food tech accelerator in Israel. Details about how the accelerator will operate and it’s specific areas of focus are limited, but Alpha Strauss’ director tells The Jewish Daily Forward that it is hoping to bring in companies that are working on infrastructure, raw ingredients and packaging, among other things. Strauss is launching the accelerator program for a couple of reasons, including: to make Israel the “Silicon Valley of food”; to attract more entrepreneurs and technologies; and to find innovative ways to compete again other multinationals.
AccelFoods: AccelFoods is a New York-based accelerator dedicated to helping promising food and beverage startups – who are already generating sales of above $100,000 on a run rate basis annually – scale their business. Launching its first class in January 2014, each class has four founding teams and runs for 6 months.

It invests between $18,000 to $35,000 and receives between a 6-8 percent equity stake in each company selected into the program. In 2013, the accelerator signed term sheets with two companies, but CEO Sam Klepfish anticipates Food Hatch will be much more active in 2014. He also says that it will likely increase the amount of money allocated per investment.
The NextFarm Accelerator:  This business accelerator program aims to support agriculture startups and promote the development sustainable sources of food for a growing global population. A partnership between Memphis Bioworks Foundation, an organization working to change Memphis’ bioscience landscape, and the Northwest Tennessee Entrepreneur Center, a public-private partnership to support local entrepreneurs, the accelerator announced its first class of 9 companies in November. These companies are diverse, ranging from precision software and sensors to expanding processing facilities and replacing synthetic dyes. Startups receive 6 months of mentorship to help them with refining business ideas and strategic planning, commercializing technology and taking products and services to the marketplace. At the end of the program, they’ll have a chance to pitch investors.

Read more about Italy’s emerging food tech ecosystem here. 
 
FOOD & FOOD TECH EQUITY CROWDFUNDING
CircleUp: By far the most popular and well-funded of the crowdfunding websites, CircleUp connects accredited investors with consumer product good and retail companies. In 2013, 11 startups raised funds through its platform, and, since its launch in 2012, a total of 21 startups have raised $21 million. The startup raised $7.5 million in series A funding led by Union Square Ventures in May 2013. It previously raised $1.5  million in seed funding from Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz’s Maveron venture capital firm, Triple Point Investors and a number of angel investors. 

AgFunder: AgFunder launched in September 2013 to bring transparency and accelerated deal flow to the $6.4 trillion global food and agriculture industry by making it easy to syndicate agricultural investment opportunities. Through its platform, agriculture, ag tech and food processing startups with a lead investor can raise capital from accredited investors. Modeled after FundersClub, AgFunder sources its own investments and then creates a dedicated investment fund for each company into which it can then syndicate investors. For now, AgFunder’s investments range between $500,000 to $1.5 million. The platform is currently running two campaigns: one for AgFunder and one for Oakland, California-based TerViva, which develops new crops for under productive agricultural land and sustainable biofuels.
CraftFund: CraftFund is launching an equity crowdfunding platform for the craft brewing and food industries. Its goal is to connect breweries and food companies with passionate investors.
CrowdBrewed: CrowdBrewed allows craft breweries to raise equity financing through its platforms. Investors can look for opportunities, review offering materials, and make investments through its secure online platform. So far, 4 companies have raised a total of $129,235 through the platform.
 
FOOD REWARDS-BASED CROWDFUNDING 
FoodStart: The platform aims to help restaurants, food trucks, bakeries, breweries and co-ops raise capital in small increments ($50-$250) from their friends, family and future customers. Similar to Kickstarter, Foodstart campaign supporters receive rewards for their contribution in the form of a gift card for perks like discounts and VIP treatment. Foodstart makes money by taking a 4 percent cut of a campaign’s funding. There are currently 25 projects on the site, but none of them have been funded
Foodie Crowd Funding:  This platform is dedicated to helping small- and medium-sized food businesses take their companies to the next level. Approved “Seekers,” food entrepreneurs looking to launch a project, pay a $99 set up fee, and the platform takes 5 percent of funds raised from projects that reach their funding goal and 7 percent from projects that elect the “partially funded“ plan. ”Funders” receive Kickstarter-esque rewards for pledges. There are currently 24 projects on the site, but  none of them appear to have met their pledge goals.
Credibles:  A project of Slow Money Alliance, Credibles enables small, sustainable food  businesses to crowdfund prepayments from customers. In exchange, backers receive Credibles, or edible credits, which are worth $1 at the business when redeemed.  The website is currently in limited beta with 36 establishments currently listed. Slow Money hopes this is an entirely new investment model for slow food.
