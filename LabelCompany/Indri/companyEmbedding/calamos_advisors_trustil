Upon sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value.
Important Fund Information

The Global Total Return and Global Dynamic Income Funds may invest up to 100% of their assets in foreign securities and invest in an array of security types and market-cap sizes, each of which has a unique risk profile. As a result of political or economic instability in foreign countries, there can be special risks associated with investing in foreign securities. These include fluctuations in currency exchange rates, increased price volatility, and difficulty obtaining information.

Investments by the Funds in lower-rated securities involve substantial risk of loss and present greater risks than investments in higher-rated securities, including less liquidity and increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment.

There are certain risks associated with an investment in a convertible bond such as default risk--that the company issuing a convertible security may be unable to repay principal and interest--and interest rate risk--that the convertible may decrease in value if interest rates increase.

Fixed-income securities are subject to interest rate risk; as interest rates go up, the value of the debt securities in the Fund's portfolio generally will decline.

Global Total Return and Global Dynamic Income Funds may invest in derivative securities. The use of derivatives presents risks different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in traditional securities. There is no assurance that any derivative strategy used by the Funds will succeed. One of the risks associated with purchasing an option is that the Funds pay a premium whether or not an option is exercised.

Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value.

Leverage creates risks which may adversely affect return, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares; and fluctuations in dividend rates on any preferred shares.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549-0102 (tel. (202) 942-8090). 
Applicants' Representations 
1. The Fund is a Massachusetts business trust registered as an open-end management investment company. The Fund commenced operations on May 1, 1999 and currently consists of one series. Additional series may be added in the future. 
2. Calamos is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and will be the investment manager for the Fund.
3. The Fund intends to offer its shares to separate accounts of both affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies, supporting variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts. Separate accounts owning shares of the Fund and their insurance company depositors are referred to as “Participating Separate Accounts” and “Participating Insurance Companies,” respectively.
4. The Fund also intends to offer one or more series of its shares directly to qualified pension and retirement plans (“Plans”) outside the separate account context. The Plans will be pension or retirement plans intended to qualify under Sections 401(a) and 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Code”). The Fund's shares will be sold to Plans which are, or are designed to be, subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1984 (“ERISA”), as amended. Participating Separate Accounts, Participating Insurance Companies, and Plans are collectively referred to as “Participants”.
5. The Participating Insurance Companies will establish their own Participating Separate Accounts and design their own contracts. Each Start Printed Page 13345Participating Insurance Company will enter into a fund participation agreement with the Funds on behalf of its Participating Separate Account and will have the legal obligation of satisfying all requirements under state and federal law. The role of the Fund, so far as the federal securities laws are applicable, will be to offer their shares to separate accounts of Participating Insurance Companies and to Plans and to fulfill any conditions that the Commission may impose upon granting the order requested in the application.
6. Plans may choose the Fund (or any series thereof) as their sole investment or as one of several investments. Plan participants may or may not be given an investment choice depending on the Plan itself. Shares of the Fund sold to Plans would be held by the trustee(s) of the Plans as mandated by Section 403(a) of ERISA. Calamos will not act as investment adviser to any of the Plans that will purchase shares of the Fund. There will be no pass-through voting to the participants in such Plans as it is not required to be provided under ERISA.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Applicants request that the Commission issue an order under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act granting exemptive relief from Sections 9(a), 13(a), and 15(a) and 15(b) of the 1940 Act and Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) thereunder, to the extent necessary to permit shares of the Fund to be offered and sold to variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of both affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies and to Plans.
2. In connection with the funding of scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust, Rule 6e-2(b)(15) provides partial exemptions from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a), and 15(b) of the 1940 Act. The exemptions granted by Rule 6e-2(b)(15) are available, however, only where the management investment company underlying the separate account (“underlying fund”) offers its shares “exclusively to variable life insurance separate accounts of the life insurer or any affiliated life insurance company * * *” Therefore, the relief granted by Rule 6e-2(b)(15) is not available with respect to a scheduled premium variable life insurance separate account that owns shares of an underlying fund that also offers its shares to a variable annuity or flexible premium variable life insurance separate account of the same company or of any affiliated life insurance company. The use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment medium for both variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of the same insurance company or of any affiliated life insurance company is referred to herein as “mixed funding.” In addition, the relief granted by Rule 6e-2(b)(15) is not available if shares of the underlying management investment company are offered to variable annuity or variable life insurance separate accounts of unaffiliated life insurance companies. The use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment medium for both variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of the same insurance company or of any unaffiliated life insurance company is referred to herein as “shared funding.”
3. In connection with the funding of flexible premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account, Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) provides partial exemptions from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a), and 15(b) of the 1940 Act. The exemptions granted by Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) are available, however, only where the separate account's underlying fund offers its shares “exclusively to separate accounts of the life insurer, or of any affiliated life insurance company, offering either scheduled contracts or flexible contracts, or both; or which also offer their shares to variable annuity separate accounts of the life insurer or of an affiliated life insurance company, or which offer their shares to any such life insurance company in consideration solely for advances made by the life insurer in connection with the operation of the separate account * * *” Therefore, Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) permits mixed funding with respect to a flexible premium variable life insurance separate account. However, Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) does not permit shared funding because the relief granted by Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) is not available with respect to a flexible premium variable life insurance separate account that owns shares of a management investment company that also offers its shares to separate accounts (including flexible premium variable life insurance separate accounts) of unaffiliated life insurance companies.
4. Applicants state that the relief granted by Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) is not affected by the purchase of shares of the Fund by a Plan. However, because the relief under Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) is available only where shares of the underlying fund are offered exclusively to separate accounts, exemptive relief is necessary if shares of the Fund are also to be sold to Plans.
5. Applicants state that the current tax law permits the Fund to increase its asset base through the sale of shares to Plans. Section 817(h) of the Code imposes certain diversification standards on the underlying assets of the variable contracts. The Code provides that such contracts shall not be treated as an annuity contract or life insurance contract for any period during which the investments are not adequately diversified in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Treasury Department. Treasury regulations provide that, to meet the diversification requirements, all of the beneficial interests in an investment company must be held by the segregated asset accounts of one or more insurance companies. The regulations do contain certain exceptions to this requirement, however, one of which permits shares of an investment company to be held by the trustee of a Plan without adversely affecting the ability of shares in the same investment company also to be held by the separate accounts of insurance companies in connection with their variable contracts (Treas. Reg. § 1.8 17-5(f)(3)(iii)).
6. Applicants state that the promulgation of Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) preceded the issuance of these Treasury regulations which made it possible for shares of a Fund to be held by the trustee of a Plan without adversely affecting the ability of shares of the Fund to also be held by the separate accounts of insurance companies in connection with their variable life insurance contracts. Thus, Applicants assert that the sale of shares of a Fund to separate accounts through which variable life insurance contracts are issued and Plans could not have been envisioned at the time of the adoption of Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15), given the then-current tax law.
7. Applicants assert that if the Funds were to sell shares only to Plans or to separate accounts funding variable annuity contracts, no exemptive relief would be necessary. Applicants state that none of the relief provided under Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) relates to Plans or to a registered investment company's ability to sell its shares to such purchasers. Exemptive relief is requested in the application only because some of the separate accounts that will invest in the Fund (or series thereof) may themselves be investment companies that rely on Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T) and that desire to have the relief continue in place.
8. In general, Section 9(a) of the 1940 Act disqualifies any person convicted of certain offenses, and any company Start Printed Page 13346affiliated with that person, from serving in various capacities with respect to an underlying registered management investment company. More specifically, Section 9(a)(3) of the 1940 Act provides that it is unlawful for any company to act as investment adviser to, or principal underwriter for, any registered open-end investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject to a disqualification enumerated in Sections 9(a)(1) or (2). Rules 6e-­2(b)(15)(i) and (ii), and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(i) and (ii) provide partial exemptions from Section 9(a) under certain circumstances, subject to the limitations on mixed and shared funding. These exemptions limit the application of eligibility restrictions to affiliated individuals or companies that directly participate in the management of the underlying management investment company.
9. Applicants state that the relief provided by Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-­3(T)(b)(15) permits the life insurer to serve as the underlying fund's investment adviser or principal underwriter, provided that none of the insurer's personnel who are ineligible pursuant to Section 9(a) are participating in the management or administration of the fund. Applicants state that the partial relief from Section 9(a) provided by Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15), in effect, limits the amount of monitoring necessary to ensure compliance with Section 9 to that which is appropriate in light of the policy and purposes of Section 9. Applicants assert that it is not necessary for the protection of investors or the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act to apply the provisions of Section 9(a) to the many individuals in an insurance company complex, most of whom typically will have no involvement in matters pertaining to investment companies funding the separate accounts. Applicants assert that it also is unnecessary to apply the restrictions of Section 9(a) to the many individuals in various unaffiliated insurance companies (or affiliated companies of participating insurance companies) that may utilize the Funds as a funding medium for variable contracts. Moreover, Applicants state that the appropriateness of the relief requested will not be affected by the proposed sale of shares of the Fund to Plans, because the insulation of the Fund from those individuals who are disqualified under the 1940 Act remains in place.
10. Applicants state that Rules 6e-­2(b)(15)(iii) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii) under the 1940 Act provide exemptions from the pass-through voting requirements with respect to several significant matters, assuming the limitations on mixed and shared funding are observed.
11. Applicants further represent that the sale of Fund shares to Plans should not affect the relief requested. With respect to Plans, there is no requirement to pass-through voting rights to Plan participants. Shares of the Funds sold to Plans would be held by the trustees of such Plans as mandated by Section 403(a) of ERISA. Section 403(a) also provides that the trustees must have exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control the Plan with two exceptions: (a) when the Plan expressly provides that the trustees are subject to the direction of a named fiduciary who is not a trustee, in which case the trustees are subject to proper directions made in accordance with the terms of the Plan and not contrary to ERISA; and (b) when the authority to manage, acquire or dispose of assets of the Plan is delegated to one or more investment managers pursuant to Section 402(c)(3) of ERISA. Unless one of the two exceptions stated in Section 403(a) applies, the Plan trustees have exclusive authority and responsibility for voting proxies.
12. Applicants state that where a named fiduciary appoints an investment manager, the investment manager has the responsibility to vote the shares held unless the right to vote such shares is reserved to the trustees or the named fiduciary. Accordingly, Applicants submit that unlike the case with insurance company separate accounts, the issue of the resolution of material irreconcilable conflicts with respect to voting is not present with respect to Plans since such Plans are not entitled to pass-through voting privileges.
13. Applicants generally expect many Plans to have their trustee(s) or other fiduciaries exercise voting rights attributable to investment securities held by the Plan in their discretion. Some of the Plans, however, may provide for the trustee(s), or investment adviser(s) or another named fiduciary to exercise voting rights in accordance with instructions from participants. Applicants submit that where a Plan does not provide participants with the right to give voting instructions, there is no potential for material irreconcilable conflicts of interest between or among contract owners and Plan investors with respect to voting of the Fund's shares. Applicants further submit that where a Plan does provide participants with the right to give voting instructions, they see no reason to believe that participants in Plans generally, or those in a particular Plan, either as a single group or in combination with participants in other Plans, would vote in a manner that would disadvantage contract owners. The purchase of shares of the Fund by Plans that provide voting rights does not present any complications not otherwise occasioned by mixed and shared funding.
14. Applicants submit that even if a Plan were to hold a controlling interest in the Fund, such control would not disadvantage other investors in the Fund to any greater extent than is the case when any institutional shareholder holds a majority of the voting securities of any open-end management investment company. In this regard applicants submit that investment in the fund by a Plan will not create any of the voting complications occasioned by mixed and shared funding. Unlike mixed or shared funding, Plan investor voting rights cannot be frustrated by veto rights of insurers or state regulators. 
15. Applicants state that no increased conflicts of interest would be presented by the granting of the requested relief. Applicants assert that shared funding does not present any issues that do not already exist where a single insurance company is licensed to do business in several states. Applicants note that where different Participating Insurance Companies are domiciled in different states, it is possible that the state insurance regulatory body in a state in which one participating Insurance Company is domiciled could require action that is inconsistent with the requirements of other insurance regulators in one or more other states in which other Participating Insurance Companies are domiciled. Applicants submit that this possibility is no different or greater than exists where a single insurer and its affiliates offer their insurance products in several states.
16. Applicants further submit that affiliation does not reduce the potential for differences in state regulatory requirements. In any event, the conditions discussed below are designed to safeguard against any adverse effects that these differences may produce. If a particular state insurance regulator's decision conflicts with the majority of other state regulators, the affected insurer may be required to withdraw its participating Separate Account's investment in the Fund.
17. Applicants also argue that affiliation does not eliminate the potential, if any exists, for divergent judgments as to when a participating insurance Company could disregard contract owner voting instructions. Potential disagreement is limited by the Start Printed Page 13347requirement that disregarding voting instructions be both reasonable and based on specified good faith determinations. however, if a participating insurance Company's decision to disregard Contract owner voting instructions represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote approving a particular change, such participating Insurance Company may be required, at the election of the Fund, to withdraw its separate account, investment in the Fund. No charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such a withdrawal. 
18. Applicants submit that there is no reason why the investment policies of the Fund with mixed funding would, or should, be materially different from what those policies would, or should, be if the Fund supported only variable annuity or only variable life insurance contracts. hence, Applicants state, there is no reason to believe that conflicts of interest would result from mixed funding. moreover, Applicants represent that the Fund will not be managed to favor or disfavor any particular insurer or type of contract.
19. As noted above, Section 817(h) of the code imposes certain diversification standards on the assets underlying the variable contracts held in the portfolios of management investment companies. Treasury Regulation Section 1.817-5(f)(3)(iii), which establishes diversification requirements for such portfolios, specifically permits, among other things, “qualified pension or retirement plans” and separate accounts to share the same underlying management investment company. Therefore, Applicants assert that neither the Code, the Treasury regulations, nor the revenue rulings thereunder, recognize or proscribe any inherent conflicts of interest if qualified plans, variable annuity separate accounts, and variable life separate accounts all invest in the same management investment company.
20. Applicants note that while there are differences in the manner in which distributions from variable contracts and Plans are taxed, the tax consequences do not raise any conflicts of interest. When distributions are to be made, and the Participating Separate Account or a Plan cannot net purchase payments to make the distributions, the Participating Separate Account or Plan will redeem shares of the Fund at their net asset value in conformity with Rule 22c-1 under the 1940 Act to provide proceeds to meet distribution needs. The Plan will then make distributions in accordance with the terms of the Plan. The life insurance company will surrender values from the Separate Account into the general account to make distributions in accordance with the terms of the variable contract.
21. Applicants state that the sale of shares to Plans should not increase the potential for material irreconcilable conflicts of interest between or among different types of investors. Applicants submit that there should be very little potential for such conflicts beyond that which would otherwise exist between variable annuity and variable life insurance contract owners.
22. Applicants also state that it is possible to provide an equitable means of giving voting rights to Participating Separate Account contract owners and to Plans. The transfer agent for the Fund will inform each Participating Insurance Company of each Participating Separate Account's share ownership in the Fund, as well as inform the trustees of Plans of their holdings. The Participating Insurance company then will solicit voting instructions in accordance with Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3 (T), as applicable, and its participation agreement with the Fund. Shares held by Plans will be voted in accordance with applicable law. The voting rights provided to Plans with respect to shares of the Fund would be no different from the voting rights that are provided to Plans with respect to shares of funds sold to the general public.
23. Applicants submit that the ability of the Fund to sell its shares directly to Plans does not create a “senior security,” as such term is defined under Section 12(g) of the 1940 Act, with respect to any contract owner as opposed to a Plans participant. Regardless of the rights and benefits of Plan participants or contract owners, the Plans and the Participating Separate Accounts only have rights with respect to their respective shares of the Fund. No shareholder of the Fund has any preference over any other shareholder with respect to distribution of assets or payments of dividends.
24. Applicants state that there are no conflicts between the contract owners of Participating Separate Accounts and Plan participants with respect to the state insurance commissioners' veto powers over investment objectives. The basic premise of shareholder voting is that shareholders may not all agree with a particular proposal. While interests and opinions of shareholders may differ, however, this does not mean that there are any inherent conflicts of interest between or among such shareholders. State insurance commissioners have been given the veto power in recognition of the fact that insurance companies usually cannot simply redeem their separate accounts out of one fund and invest in another. Generally, complex and time-consuming transactions must be undertaken to accomplish such redemptions and transfers. Conversely, trustees of Plans can make the decision quickly and redeem their shares of the Fund and reinvest in another funding vehicle without the same regulatory impediments faced by separate accounts, or, as is the case with most Plans, even hold cash pending a suitable investment. Based on the foregoing, applicants represent that even should the interests of contract owners and the interests of Plans conflict, the conflicts can be resolved almost immediately because the trustees of the Plans can, independently, redeem shares out of the Fund.
25. Applicants also assert that there does not appear to be any greater potential for material irreconcilable conflicts arising between the interests of Plan participants and contract owners of Participating Insurance Companies from possible future changes in the federal tax laws than that which already exists between variable annuity and variable life insurance contract owners.
26. Applicants believe that the summary of the discussion contained herein demonstrates that the sale of shares of the Fund to qualified plans and variable contracts does not increase the risk of material irreconcilable conflicts of interest. Furthermore, Applicants state that the use of the Fund with respect to Plans is not substantially different from the Fund's current use, in that Plans, like variable contracts, are generally long-term retirement vehicles. In addition, applicants assert that regardless of the type of shareholder in the Fund, Calamos is or would be contractually or otherwise obligated to manage the Fund solely and exclusively in accordance with the Fund's investment objectives, policies and restrictions as well as any guidelines established by the Fund's Board of Trustees.
27. Applicants assert that various factors have prevented more insurance companies from offering variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts than currently do so. These factors include the costs of organizing and operating a funding medium, the lack of expertise with respect to investment management, and the lack of public name recognition as investment professionals. In particular, some smaller life insurance companies may not find it economically feasible, or within their investment or administrative expertise, to enter the variable contract business on their own. Start Printed Page 13348Applicants assert that use of the Fund as a common investment medium for variable contracts would ameliorate these concerns. Participating Insurance companies would benefit not only from the investment advisory and administrative expertise of Calamos and its affiliates, but also from the cost efficiencies and investment flexibility afforded by a large pool of funds. Applicants submit that therefore, making the Fund available for mixed and shared funding will encourage more insurance companies to offer variable contracts. Applicants claim that this should result in increased competition with respect to both variable contract design and pricing, which can be expected to result in more product variation and lower charges. Moreover, the sale of the shares of the Fund to Plans should further increase the amount of assets available for investment by the Fund. This in turn, should inure to the benefit of contract owners by promoting economies of scale, by permitting greater safety through greater diversification, and by making the addition of new portfolios to the Fund more feasible.
28. Applicants assert that there is no significant legal impediment to permitting mixed and shared funding and sales of Fund shares to Plans.
Applicant's Conditions
Applicant consents to the following conditions if the application is granted:
1. A majority of the Board of Trustees or Board of Directors (“Board”) of the Fund shall consist of persons who are not “interested persons” of the Fund, as defined by Section  2(a)(19) of the Act and the Rules thereunder and as modified by any applicable orders of the Commission, except that if this condition is not met by reason of the death, disqualification, or bona fide resignation of any trustee or director, then the operation of this condition shall be suspended: (a) For a period of 45 days if the vacancy or vacancies may be filled by the Board; (b) for a period of 60 days if a vote of shareholders is required to fill the vacancy or vacancies; or (c) for such longer period as the Commission may prescribe by rule, or by order upon application.
2. The Board will monitor the Fund for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflict among the interests of the contract owners of all separate accounts investing in the Fund and of Plan participants investing in the Fund. A material irreconcilable conflict may arise for a variety of reasons, including: (a) An action by any state insurance regulatory authority; (b) a change in applicable federal or state insurance, tax, or securities laws or regulations, or a public ruling, private letter ruling, no-action or interpretative letter, or any similar action by insurance, tax, or securities regulatory authorities; (c) an administrative or judicial decision in any relevant proceeding; (d) the manner in which the investments of any Fund or series are being managed; (e) a difference in voting instruction given by variable annuity contract owners and variable life insurance contract owners; (f) a decision  by an insurer to disregard the voting instructions of contract owners; or (g) if applicable, a decision by a Plan to disregard voting instructions of Plan participants.
3. In the event that a Plan or Plan participant shareholder should become an owner of 10% or more of the assets of the Fund, such Plan will execute a fund participation agreement including the conditions of the Application set forth herein, to the extent applicable. A Plan or Plan participant will execute an application containing an acknowledgement of this condition at the time of its initial purchase of shares of a Fund.
4. Participating Insurance Companies, Calamos, any other investment adviser of the Fund, and any Plans that execute a fund participation agreement upon becoming an owner of 10% or more of the Fund's assets (“Participants”) will report any potential or existing conflicts to the Board. Participants will be responsible for assisting the Board in carrying out its responsibilities under these conditions by providing the Board with all information reasonably necessary for the Board to consider any issues raised. This responsibility includes, but is not limited to, an obligation by each Participating Insurance Company to inform the Board whenever it has determined to disregard contract owner voting instructions and, when pass-through voting is applicable, an obligation of each Plan to inform the Board whenever it has determined to disregard voting instructions from Plan participants. The responsibilities to report such information and conflicts and to assist the Board will be a contractual obligation of all Participating  Insurance Companies and Plans under their agreements governing participation in the Fund, and such agreements shall provide, in the case of Participating Insurance Companies, that  such responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of contract owners or, in the case of Plans, Plan participants.
5. If it is determined by a majority of the Board, or a majority of its disinterested trustees or directors, that a material irreconcilable conflict exists, the relevant Participating Insurance Companies and Plans, at  their expense and to the extent reasonably practicable (as determined by a majority of the disinterested trustees or directors), shall take whatever steps are necessary to remedy or eliminate the material irreconcilable conflict. Such steps could include: (a) withdrawing the assets allocable to some or all of the separate accounts from the Fund or any series thereof and reinvesting such assets in a different investment medium which may include another series of the Fund; (b) submitting the question as to whether such segregation should be implemented to a vote of all affected contract owners and, as appropriate, segregating the assets of any appropriate group (i.e., annuity or life insurance contract owners, or variable contract owners of one or more participating insurance companies) that votes in favor of such segregation, or offering to the affected contract owners the option of making such a change; and (c) establishing a new registered management investment company or managed separate account. If a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of an insurer's decision to disregard contract owner voting instructions and the decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote, the insurer may be required, at the election of the Fund, to withdraw its separate account's investment in the Fund, and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal. If a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a Plan's decision to disregard Plan participant voting instructions, if applicable, and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote, the Plan may be required, at the election of the Fund, to withdraw its investment in such Fund, and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the responsibility to take remedial action in the event of a Board determination of a material irreconcilable conflict and bear the cost of such remedial action shall be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies and Plans under their agreements governing participation in the Fund and these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of the contract owners and Plan participants, as appropriate.
6. For purposes of Condition 5, a majority of the disinterested members of the Board shall determine whether or not any proposed action adequately Start Printed Page 13349remedies any material irreconcilable conflict but in no event will the Fund, or Calamos (or any other investment adviser) be required to establish a new funding medium for any variable contract. No Participating Insurance Company shall be required by Condition  5 to establish a new funding medium for any variable contract if an offer to do so has been declined by a vote of the majority of contract owners materially and adversely affected by the material irreconcilable conflict. No Plan shall be required by this Condition 5 to establish a new funding medium for such Plan if: (a) An offer to do so has been declined by a vote of a majority of Plan participants materially and adversely affected by the irreconcilable material conflict, or (b) pursuant to governing Plan documents and applicable law, the Plan  makes such decision without a Plan participant vote.
7. Participants will be informed promptly in writing of the Board's determination of the existence of a material irreconcilable conflict and its implications.
8. Participating Insurance Companies will provide pass-through voting privileges to contract owners who invest in Participating Separate Accounts so long as the Commission continues to interpret the 1940 Act as requiring pass-though voting  privileges for contract owners. Accordingly, Participating Insurance Companies will vote shares of the Fund or series thereof held in Participating Separate Accounts in a manner consistent with voting instructions timely received from contract owners. In addition, each Participating Insurance Company will vote shares of the Fund, or series thereof, held in its separate accounts for which it has not received timely voting instructions as well as shares it owns, in the same proportion as those shares for which it has received voting instructions. Participating Insurance  Companies will be responsible for assuring that each of their Participating Separate Accounts calculate voting privileges in a manner consistent with all other Participating Insurance Companies. The obligation to vote the Fund's shares and calculate voting privileges in a manner consistent with all other Participating Separate Accounts shall be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance  Companies under the agreements governing participation in the Fund. Each Plan will vote as required by applicable law and governing Plan documents.
9. The Fund will notify all Participating Insurance Companies and Plans that disclosure in separate account prospectuses or plan prospectuses or other plan disclosure documents regarding potential risks of mixed and shared funding may be appropriate. The Fund shall disclose in its prospectus that: (a) Its shares are offered to insurance company separate accounts which fund both annuity and life insurance contracts, (b) due to differences in tax treatment and other considerations, the interests of  various contract owners participating in the Fund and the interest of Plans investing in the Fund may conflict, and (c) the Board will monitor for the existence of any material conflicts and determine what action, if any, should be taken.
10. All reports of potential or existing conflicts of interest received by the Board, and all Board action with regard to: (a) determining the existence of a conflict; (b) notifying Participants of a conflict; and (c) determining whether any proposed action adequately remedies a conflict, will be properly recorded in the minutes of the Board or other appropriate records and such minutes or other records shall be made available to the Commission upon request.
11. If and to the extent Rule 6e-2 Rule 6e-3(T) are amended, or Rule 6e-3 under the 1940 Act is adopted, to provide exemptive relief from any provision of the 1940 Act or the rules thereunder with respect to mixed or shared funding on terms and conditions materially different from any exemptions granted in the order requested by Applicants, then the Fund and/or Participating Insurance Companies, as appropriate, shall take such steps as may be necessary to comply with Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T), as amended, and proposed Ruled 6e-3, as adopted, to the extent applicable.
12. The Fund will comply with all provisions of the 1940 Act requiring voting by shareholders (for these purposes, the persons having a voting interest in the shares of the Fund). In particular, the Fund will either provide for annual meetings (except to the extent that the Commission may interpret Section 16 of the 1940 Act not to require such meetings) or comply with Section 16(c) of the 1940 Act (although the Fund is not one of the trusts described in Section 16(c) of the Act) as well as with Section 16(a) and, if and when applicable, section 16(b) of the 1940 Act. Further, the Fund will act in accordance with the Commission's interpretation of the requirements of Section 16(a) with respect to periodic elections of Board members and with whatever rules the Commission may promulgate with respect thereto.
13. No less than annually, the Participants shall submit to the Board such reports, materials or data as the Board may reasonably request so that the Board may carry out fully the obligations imposed upon it by the conditions contained in the Application. Such reports, materials and data shall be submitted more frequently if deemed appropriate by the Board. The obligations of the Participants to provide these reports, materials, and data to the Board when it so reasonably requests shall be a contractual obligation of all Participants under the agreements governing their participation in the Fund.
Conclusion
For the reasons and upon the facts stated above, Applicants assert that the requested exemptions are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

 THE TRUST AND THE FUNDS

     The Trust was organized as a Massachusetts business trust on December 21,
1987. Each Fund is an open-end, diversified management investment company. Prior
to June 23, 1997, the name of the Trust was CFS Investment Trust. Market Neutral
Fund was named "Strategic Income Fund" prior to July 30, 1999. Prior to April 1,
2003, Growth and Income Fund was named "Convertible Growth and Income Fund" and 
Global Growth and Income Fund was named "Global Convertible Fund." Prior to     
December 1, 2003, the Value Fund was named "Mid Cap Value Fund."

 INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES

Each Fund's investment objective is shown below:                    

GROWTH FUND seeks long-term capital growth.                         

      BLUE CHIP FUND seeks long-term capital growth. Under normal circumstances,
the Blue Chip Fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus borrowings) 
in "Blue Chip" companies.                                                       

VALUE FUND seeks long-term capital growth.                          

   GROWTH AND INCOME FUND seeks high long-term total return through growth
and current income. The Fund invests primarily in a diversified portfolio of    
convertible, fixed-income and equity securities.                                

   GLOBAL GROWTH AND INCOME FUND seeks high long-term total return through
capital appreciation and current income. The Fund invests primarily in a        
globally diversified portfolio of convertible, fixed-income and equity          
securities.                                                                     

HIGH YIELD FUND seeks the highest level of current income obtainable
consistent with reasonable risk. Its secondary objective is capital gain where  
consistent with its primary objective. Under normal circumstances, the High     
Yield Fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings) in  
high yield, fixed-income securities (junk bonds).                               

CONVERTIBLE FUND seeks current income with growth as its secondary  
objective. Under normal circumstances, the Convertible Fund will invest at least
80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings) in convertible securities.          

      MARKET NEUTRAL FUND seeks high current income consistent with stability of
principal. The Fund seeks to achieve its objective primarily through investment 
in convertible securities and employing short selling to enhance income and     
hedge against market risk.                                                      

The investment objectives of a Fund may not be changed without the  
approval of a "majority of outstanding" shares of that Fund, as defined in the  
Investment Company Act of 1940. Each of the Blue Chip Fund, Convertible Fund and
High Yield Fund will notify shareholders at least 60 days prior to any change in
its 80% policy.

INVESTMENT PRACTICES

 The prospectus contains information concerning each Fund's investment
objective and principal investment strategies and risks. This SAI provides      
additional information concerning certain securities and strategies used by the 
Funds and their associated risks.                                               

    In pursuing its investment objective, each Fund will invest as described
below and in the prospectus.                                                    

CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES                                                          

   Convertible securities include any corporate debt security or preferred
stock that may be converted into underlying shares of common stock. The common  
stock underlying convertible securities may be issued by a different entity than
the issuer of the convertible securities. Convertible securities entitle the    
holder to receive interest payments paid on corporate debt securities or the    
dividend preference on a preferred stock until such time as the convertible     
security matures or is redeemed or until the holder elects to exercise the      
conversion privilege. As a result of the conversion feature, however, the       
interest rate or dividend preference on a convertible security is generally less
than would be the case if the securities were issued in non-convertible form.   

  The value of convertible securities is influenced by both the yield of
non-convertible securities of comparable issuers and by the value of the        
underlying common stock. The value of a convertible security viewed without     
regard to its conversion feature (i.e., strictly on the basis of its yield) is  
sometimes referred to as its "investment value." The investment value of the    
convertible security typically will fluctuate inversely with changes in         
prevailing interest rates. However, at the same time, the convertible security  
will be influenced by its "conversion value," which is the market value of the  
underlying common stock that would be obtained if the convertible security were 
converted. Conversion value fluctuates directly with the price of the underlying
common stock.                                                                   

   If, because of a low price of the common stock, the conversion value is
substantially below the investment value of the convertible security, the price 
of the convertible security is governed principally by its investment value. If 
the conversion value of a convertible security increases to a point that        
approximates or exceeds its investment value, the value of the security will be 
principally influenced by its conversion value. A convertible security will sell
at a premium over its conversion value to the extent investors place value on   
the right to acquire the underlying common stock while holding a fixed income   
security. Holders of convertible securities have a claim on the assets of the   
issuer prior to the common stockholders, but may be subordinated to holders of  
similar non-convertible securities of the same issuer.                          

SYNTHETIC CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES 

      The Funds may create a "synthetic" convertible security by combining fixed
income securities with the right to acquire equity securities. In creating a    
synthetic security, the Fund may pool a basket of fixed-income securities and a 
basket of warrants or options that produce the economic characteristics similar 
to a convertible security. Within each basket of fixed-income                   

 3

P-->4976th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�6th
securities and warrants or options, different companies may issue the           
fixed-income and convertible components, which may be purchased separately and  
at different times.                                                             

   More flexibility is possible in the assembly of a synthetic convertible
security than in the purchase of a convertible security. Although synthetic     
convertible securities may be selected where the two components are issued by a 
single issuer, the character of a synthetic convertible security allows the     
combination of components representing distinct issuers, when management        
believes that such a combination would better promote the Fund's investment     
objective. A synthetic convertible security also is a more flexible investment  
in that its two components may be purchased separately. For example, the Fund   
may purchase a warrant for inclusion in a synthetic convertible security but    
temporarily hold short-term investments while postponing the purchase of a      
corresponding bond pending development of more favorable market conditions. The 
Convertible Fund's holdings of synthetic convertible securities are considered  
convertible securities for purposes of the Fund's policy to invest at least 80% 
of its net assets (plus any borrowings) in convertible securities.              

    A holder of a synthetic convertible security faces the risk of a decline
in the price of the security or the level of the index involved in the          
convertible component, causing a decline in the value of the call option or     
warrant purchased to create the synthetic convertible security. Should the price
of the stock fall below the exercise price and remain there throughout the      
exercise period, the entire amount paid for the call option or warrant would be 
lost. Because a synthetic convertible security includes the fixed-income        
component as well, the holder of a synthetic convertible security also faces the
risk that interest rates will rise, causing a decline in the value of the       
fixed-income instrument.                                                        

     The Funds may also purchase synthetic convertible securities manufactured
by other parties, including convertible structured notes. Convertible structured
notes are fixed income debentures linked to equity, and are typically issued by 
investment banks. Convertible structured notes have the attributes of a         
convertible security; however, the investment bank that issued the convertible  
note assumes the credit risk associated with the investment, rather than the    
issuer of the underlying common stock into which the note is convertible.       

DEBT SECURITIES                                                                 

     In pursuing its investment objective, each Fund may invest in convertible
and non-convertible debt securities, including lower-rated securities (i.e.,    
securities rated BB or lower by Standard & Poor's Corporation, a division of The
McGraw-Hill Companies ("S&P"), or Ba or lower by Moody's Investor Services, Inc.
("Moody's")) and securities that are not rated but are considered by the        
investment adviser to be of similar quality. There are no restrictions as to the
ratings of debt securities acquired by a Fund or the portion of a Fund's assets 
that may be invested in debt securities in a particular ratings category, except
that no Fund other than the High Yield Fund will acquire a security rated below 
C.                                                                              

     Securities rated BBB or Baa are considered to be medium grade and to have
speculative characteristics. Lower-rated debt securities are predominantly      
speculative with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay     
principal. Investment in medium- or lower-quality debt securities involves      
greater investment risk, including the possibility of issuer default or

bankruptcy. An economic downturn could severely disrupt the market for such     
securities and adversely affect the value of such securities. In addition,      
lower-quality bonds are less sensitive to interest rate changes than            
higher-quality instruments and generally are more sensitive to adverse economic 
changes or individual corporate developments. During a period of adverse        
economic changes, including a period of rising interest rates, issuers of such  
bonds may experience difficulty in servicing their principal and interest       
payment obligations.                                                            

Achievement by each Fund of its investment objective(s) will be more
dependent on the investment adviser's credit analysis than would be the case if 
the Fund were investing in higher-quality debt securities. Because the ratings  
of rating services (which evaluate the safety of principal and interest         
payments, not market risks) are used only as preliminary indicators of          
investment quality, the investment adviser employs its own credit research and  
analysis. These analyses may take into consideration such quantitative factors  
as an issuer's present and potential liquidity, profitability, internal         
capability to generate funds, debt/equity ratio and debt servicing capabilities,
and such qualitative factors as an assessment of management, industry           
characteristics, accounting methodology, and foreign business exposure.         

 Medium- and lower-quality debt securities may be less marketable than
higher-quality debt securities because the market for them is less broad. The   
market for unrated debt securities is even narrower. During periods of thin     
trading in these markets, the spread between bid and asked prices is likely to  
increase significantly, and the Fund may have greater difficulty selling its    
portfolio securities. The market value of these securities and their liquidity  
may be affected by adverse publicity and investor perceptions.                  

RULE 144A SECURITIES                                                            

      Each Fund may purchase securities that have been privately placed but that
are eligible for purchase and sale by certain qualified institutional buyers,   
such as the Funds, under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. The        
investment adviser, under the supervision of the Trust's board of trustees, will
consider whether securities purchased under Rule 144A are illiquid and thus     
subject to the Fund's restriction of investing no more than a specified         
percentage of its net assets in illiquid securities. A determination of whether 
a Rule 144A security is liquid or not is a question of fact. In making this     
determination, the investment adviser will consider the trading markets for the 
specific security, taking into account the unregistered nature of a Rule 144A   
security. In addition, the investment adviser may consider the (1) frequency of 
trades and quotes, (2) number of dealers and potential purchasers, (3) dealer   
undertakings to make a market and (4) nature of a security and of marketplace   
trades (e.g., the time needed to dispose of the security, the method of         
soliciting offers and the mechanics of transfer). The liquidity of Rule 144A    
securities will be monitored and, if as a result of changed conditions, it is   
determined that a Rule 144A security is no longer liquid, the Fund's holdings of
illiquid securities would be reviewed to determine what, if any, steps are      
required to assure that the Fund does not invest more than 10% (or 15% in the   
case of Global Growth and Income Fund) of its assets in illiquid securities.    
Investing in Rule 144A securities could have the effect of increasing the amount
of the Fund's assets invested in illiquid securities if qualified institutional 
buyers are unwilling to purchase such securities.

FOREIGN SECURITIES                                                              

    Global Growth and Income Fund may invest all of its net assets, and each
other Fund may invest up to 25% of its net assets, in securities of foreign     
issuers. For this purpose, foreign securities do not include American Depositary
Receipts (ADRs) or securities guaranteed by a United States person, but may     
include foreign securities in the form of European Depositary Receipts (EDRs),  
Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs) or other securities representing underlying   
shares of foreign issuers. Positions in those securities are not necessarily    
denominated in the same currency as the common stocks into which they may be    
converted. ADRs are receipts typically issued by an American bank or trust      
company evidencing ownership of the underlying securities. EDRs are European    
receipts listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange evidencing a similar           
arrangement. GDRs are U.S. dollar-denominated receipts issued by international  
banks evidencing ownership of foreign securities. Generally, ADRs, in registered
form, are designed for the U.S. securities markets and EDRs and GDRs, in bearer 
form, are designed for use in foreign securities markets. Each Fund may invest  
in sponsored or unsponsored ADRs. In the case of an unsponsored ADR, the Fund is
likely to bear its proportionate share of the expenses of the depository and it 
may have greater difficulty in receiving shareholder communications than it     
would have with a sponsored ADR.                                                

      To the extent positions in portfolio securities are denominated in foreign
currencies, a Fund's investment performance is affected by the relative strength
or weakness of the U.S. dollar against those currencies. For example, if the    
dollar falls in value relative to the Japanese yen, the dollar value of a       
Japanese stock held in the portfolio will rise even though the price of the     
stock remains unchanged. Conversely, if the dollar rises in value relative to   
the yen, the dollar value of the Japanese stock will fall. (See discussion of   
transaction hedging and portfolio hedging below under "Currency Exchange
Transactions.")                                                                 

    Investors should understand and consider carefully the risks involved in
foreign investing. Investing in foreign securities, which are generally         
denominated in foreign currencies, and utilization of forward foreign currency  
exchange contracts involve certain considerations comprising both risks and     
opportunities not typically associated with investing in U.S. securities. These 
considerations include: fluctuations in exchange rates of foreign currencies;   
possible imposition of exchange control regulation or currency restrictions that
would prevent cash from being brought back to the United States; less public    
information with respect to issuers of securities; less governmental supervision
of stock exchanges, securities brokers, and issuers of securities; lack of      
uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards; lack of uniform 
settlement periods and trading practices; less liquidity and frequently greater 
price volatility in foreign markets than in the United States; possible         
imposition of foreign taxes; and sometimes less advantageous legal, operational 
and financial protections applicable to foreign sub-custodial arrangements.     

      Although the Funds intend to invest in companies and government securities
of countries having stable political environments, there is the possibility of  
expropriation or confiscatory taxation, seizure or nationalization of foreign   
bank deposits or other assets, establishment of exchange controls, the adoption 
of foreign government restrictions, or other adverse political, social or       
diplomatic developments that could affect investment in these nations.

Each Fund other than Global Growth and Income Fund expects that     
substantially all of its foreign investments will be in developed nations.      
However, each Fund may invest in the securities of emerging countries. The      
securities markets of emerging countries are substantially smaller, less        
developed, less liquid and more volatile than the securities markets of the U.S.
and other more developed countries. Disclosure and regulatory standards in many 
respects are less stringent than in the U.S. and other major markets. There also
may be a lower level of monitoring and regulation of emerging markets and the   
activities of investors in such markets, and enforcement of existing regulations
has been extremely limited. Economies in individual emerging markets may differ 
favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in such respects as growth of    
gross domestic product, rates of inflation, currency depreciation, capital      
reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency and balance of payments positions. Many 
emerging market countries have experienced high rates of inflation for many     
years, which has had and may continue to have very negative effects on the      
economies and securities markets of those countries.                            

CURRENCY EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS 

   Currency exchange transactions may be conducted either on a spot (i.e.,
cash) basis at the spot rate for purchasing or selling currency prevailing in   
the foreign exchange market or through forward currency exchange contracts      
("forward contracts"). Forward contracts are contractual agreements to purchase 
or sell a specified currency at a specified future date (or within a specified  
time period) and price set at the time of the contract. Forward contracts are   
usually entered into with banks, foreign exchange dealers and broker-dealers,   
are not exchange traded, and are usually for less than one year, but may be     
renewed.                                                                        

Forward currency exchange transactions may involve currencies of the
different countries in which the Funds may invest and serve as hedges against   
possible variations in the exchange rate between these currencies. Currency     
exchange transactions are limited to transaction hedging and portfolio hedging  
involving either specific transactions or portfolio positions, except to the    
extent described below under "Synthetic Foreign Money Market Positions."        
Transaction hedging is the purchase or sale of forward contracts with respect to
specific receivables or payables of a Fund accruing in connection with the      
purchase and sale of its portfolio securities or the receipt of dividends or    
interest thereon. Portfolio hedging is the use of forward contracts with respect
to portfolio security positions denominated or quoted in a particular foreign   
currency. Portfolio hedging allows a Fund to limit or reduce its exposure in a  
foreign currency by entering into a forward contract to sell such foreign       
currency (or another foreign currency that acts as a proxy for that currency) at
a future date for a price payable in U.S. dollars so that the value of the      
foreign denominated portfolio securities can be approximately matched by a      
foreign denominated liability. A Fund may not engage in portfolio hedging with  
respect to the currency of a particular country to an extent greater than the   
aggregate market value (at the time of making such sale) of the securities held 
in its portfolio denominated or quoted in that particular currency, except that 
the Fund may hedge all or part of its foreign currency exposure through the use 
of a basket of currencies or a proxy currency where such currencies or currency 
act as an effective proxy for other currencies. In such a case, the Fund may    
enter into a forward contract where the amount of the foreign currency to be    
sold exceeds the value of the securities denominated in such currency. The use  
of this basket hedging technique may be more efficient                          

 7

P-->49710th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�10th
and economical than entering into separate forward contracts for each currency  
held in the Fund. No Fund may engage in "speculative" currency exchange         
transactions.                                                                   

If a Fund enters into a forward contract, the Fund's custodian will 
segregate liquid assets of the Fund having a value equal to the Fund's          
commitment under such forward contract. At the maturity of the forward contract 
to deliver a particular currency, the Fund may either sell the portfolio        
security related to the contract and make delivery of the currency, or it may   
retain the security and either acquire the currency on the spot market or       
terminate its contractual obligation to deliver the currency by purchasing an   
offsetting contract with the same currency trader obligating it to purchase on  
the same maturity date the same amount of the currency.                         

    It is impossible to forecast with absolute precision the market value of
portfolio securities at the expiration of a forward contract. Accordingly, it   
may be necessary for a Fund to purchase additional currency on the spot market  
(and bear the expense of such purchase) if the market value of the security is  
less than the amount of currency the Fund is obligated to deliver and if a      
decision is made to sell the security and make delivery of the currency.        
Conversely, it may be necessary to sell on the spot market some of the currency 
received upon the sale of the portfolio security if its market value exceeds the
amount of currency the Fund is obligated to deliver.                            

 If a Fund retains the portfolio security and engages in an offsetting
currency transaction, the Fund will incur a gain or a loss to the extent that   
there has been movement in forward contract prices. If the Fund engages in an   
offsetting currency transaction, it may subsequently enter into a new forward   
contract to sell the currency. Should forward prices decline during the period  
between the Fund's entering into a forward contract for the sale of a currency  
and the date it enters into an offsetting contract for the purchase of the      
currency, the Fund will realize a gain to the extent the price of the currency  
it has agreed to sell exceeds the price of the currency it has agreed to        
purchase. Should forward prices increase, the Fund will suffer a loss to the    
extent the price of the currency it has agreed to purchase exceeds the price of 
the currency it has agreed to sell. A default on the contract would deprive the 
Fund of unrealized profits or force the Fund to cover its commitments for       
purchase or sale of currency, if any, at the current market price.              

   Hedging against a decline in the value of a currency does not eliminate
fluctuations in the value of a portfolio security traded in that currency or    
prevent a loss if the value of the security declines. Hedging transactions also 
preclude the opportunity for gain if the value of the hedged currency should    
rise. Moreover, it may not be possible for a Fund to hedge against a devaluation
that is so generally anticipated that the Fund is not able to contract to sell  
the currency at a price above the devaluation level it anticipates. The cost to 
a Fund of engaging in currency exchange transactions varies with such factors as
the currency involved, the length of the contract period, and prevailing market 
conditions. Because currency exchange transactions are usually conducted on a   
principal basis, no fees or commissions are involved.                           

SYNTHETIC FOREIGN MONEY MARKET POSITIONS 

   Each Fund may invest in money market instruments denominated in foreign
currencies. In addition to, or in lieu of, such direct investment, a Fund may   
construct a synthetic foreign money market position by (a) purchasing a money   
market instrument denominated in one currency, generally U.S. dollars, and (b)  
concurrently entering into a forward contract to deliver                        

 8

P-->49711th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�11th
a corresponding amount of that currency in exchange for a different currency on 
a future date and at a specified rate of exchange. For example, a synthetic     
money market position in Japanese yen could be constructed by purchasing a U.S. 
dollar money market instrument, and entering concurrently into a forward        
contract to deliver a corresponding amount of U.S. dollars in exchange for      
Japanese yen on a specified date and at a specified rate of exchange. Because of
the availability of a variety of highly liquid short-term U.S. dollar money     
market instruments, a synthetic money market position utilizing such U.S. dollar
instruments may offer greater liquidity than direct investment in foreign       
currency and a concurrent construction of a synthetic position in such foreign  
currency, in terms of both income yield and gain or loss from changes in        
currency exchange rates, in general should be similar, but would not be         
identical because the components of the alternative investments would not be    
identical.                                                                      

SWAPS, CAPS, FLOORS AND COLLARS                                                 

   Each Fund may enter into interest rate, currency, index, credit default
and other swaps and the purchase or sale of related caps, floors and collars.   
Each Fund expects to enter into these transactions primarily to preserve a      
return or spread on a particular investment or portion of its portfolio, to     
protect against currency fluctuations, as a duration management technique or to 
protect against any increase in the price of securities the Fund anticipates    
purchasing at a later date. A Fund will not sell interest rate caps or floors   
where it does not own securities or other instruments providing the income      
stream the Fund may be obligated to pay. Interest rate swaps involve the        
exchange by a Fund with another party of their respective commitments to pay or 
receive interest, e.g., an exchange of floating rate payments for fixed rate    
payments with respect to a notional amount of principal. A currency swap is an  
agreement to exchange cash flows on a notional amount of two or more currencies 
based on the relative value differential among them and an index swap is an     
agreement to swap cash flows on a notional amount based on changes in the values
of the reference indices. A credit default swap is an agreement to transfer the 
credit exposure of fixed income products between parties. The purchase of a cap 
entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from  
the party selling such cap to the extent that a specified index exceeds a       
predetermined interest rate or amount. The purchase of a floor entitles the     
purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party     
selling such floor to the extent that a specified index falls below a           
predetermined interest rate or amount. A collar is a combination of a cap and a 
floor that preserves a certain return within a predetermined range of interest  
rates or values.                                                                

      A Fund will usually enter into swaps on a net basis, i.e., the two payment
streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date or dates        
specified in the instrument, with the Fund receiving or paying, as the case may 
be, only the net amount of the two payments. Inasmuch as a Fund will segregate  
assets (or enter into offsetting positions) to cover its obligations under      
swaps, Calamos Advisors LLC ("Calamos Advisors") and the Trust believe such     
obligations do not constitute senior securities under the Investment Company Act
of 1940 and, accordingly, will not treat them as being subject to its borrowing 
restrictions. A Fund will not enter into any swap, cap, floor or collar         
transaction unless, at the time of entering into such transaction, the unsecured
long-term debt of the securities dealers, financial institutions or other       
parties with whom the Fund has entered into such a transaction                  
("Counterparties"), combined with any credit enhancements, is rated at least A  
by S&P or Moody's or has an equivalent rating from a NRSRO or is determined to  
be of equivalent credit quality by Calamos Advisors. If there                   

9 

P-->49712th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�12th
is a default by the Counterparty, the Fund may have contractual remedies        
pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction. The swap market has grown
substantially in recent years with a large number of banks and investment       
banking firms acting both as principals and as agents utilizing standardized    
swap documentation. As a result, the swap market has become relatively liquid,  
however, some swaps may be considered illiquid. Caps, floors and collars are    
more recent innovations for which standardized documentation has not yet been   
fully developed and, accordingly, they are less liquid than swaps.              

STRUCTURED PRODUCTS 

    Each Fund may invest in interests in entities organized and operated for
the purpose of restructuring the investment characteristics of certain other    
investments. This type of restructuring involves the deposit with or purchase by
an entity, such as a corporation or trust, of specified instruments and the     
issuance by that entity of one or more classes of securities ("structured
products") backed by, or representing interests in, the underlying instruments. 
The term "structured products" as used herein excludes synthetic convertibles.  
See "Investment Practices -- Synthetic Convertible Securities." The cash flow on
the underlying instruments may be apportioned among the newly issued structured 
products to create securities with different investment characteristics such as 
varying maturities, payment priorities and interest rate provisions, and the    
extent of the payments made with respect to structured products is dependent on 
the extent of the cash flow on the underlying instruments. A Fund may invest in 
structured products, which represent derived investment positions based on      
relationships among different markets or asset classes.                         

Each Fund may also invest in other types of structured products,    
including, among others, baskets of credit default swaps referencing a portfolio
of high-yield securities. A structured product may be considered to be leveraged
to the extent its interest rate varies by a magnitude that exceeds the magnitude
of the change in the index rate. Because they are linked to their underlying    
markets or securities, investments in structured products generally are subject 
to greater volatility than an investment directly in the underlying market or   
security. Total return on the structured product is derived by linking return to
one or more characteristics of the underlying instrument. Because certain       
structured products of the type in which a Fund may invest may involve no credit
enhancement, the credit risk of those structured products generally would be    
equivalent to that of the underlying instruments. A Fund may invest in a class  
of structured products that is either subordinated or unsubordinated to the     
right of payment of another class. Subordinated structured products typically   
have higher yields and present greater risks than unsubordinated structured     
products. Although a Fund's purchase of subordinated structured products would  
have similar economic effect to that of borrowing against the underlying        
securities, the purchase will not be deemed to be leverage for purposes of the  
Fund's limitations related to borrowing and leverage.                           

  Certain issuers of structured products may be deemed to be "investment
companies" as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940. As a result, the   
Fund's investments in these structured products may be limited by the           
restrictions contained in the Investment Company Act of 1940. Structured        
products are typically sold in private placement transactions, and there        
currently may not be active trading market for structured products. As a result,
certain structured products in which the Fund invests may be deemed illiquid.

LENDING OF PORTFOLIO SECURITIES                                                 

    Each Fund may lend its portfolio securities to broker-dealers and banks.
Any such loan must be continuously secured by collateral in cash or cash        
equivalents maintained on a current basis in an amount at least equal to the    
market value of the securities loaned by the Fund. The Fund would continue to   
receive the equivalent of the interest or dividends paid by the issuer on the   
securities loaned, and would also receive an additional return that may be in   
the form of a fixed fee or a percentage of the collateral. The Fund may pay     
reasonable fees to persons unaffiliated with the Fund for services in arranging 
these loans. The Fund would have the right to call the loan and obtain the      
securities loaned at any time on notice of not more than five business days. The
Fund would not have the right to vote the securities during the existence of the
loan but could call the loan to permit voting of the securities. In the event of
bankruptcy or other default of the borrower, the Fund could experience both     
delays in liquidating the loan collateral or recovering the loaned securities   
and losses, including (a) possible decline in the value of the collateral or in 
the value of the securities loaned during the period while the Fund seeks to    
enforce its rights thereto, (b) possible subnormal levels of income and lack of 
access to income during this period, and (c) expenses of enforcing its rights.  
In an effort to reduce these risks, the investment adviser will monitor the     
creditworthiness of the firms to which the Fund lends securities.               

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS 

      Each Fund may invest in repurchase agreements, provided that Global Growth
and Income Fund may not invest more than 15%, and each other Fund may not invest
more than 10%, of its net assets in repurchase agreements maturing in more than 
seven days and any other illiquid securities. A repurchase agreement is a sale  
of securities to the Fund in which the seller agrees to repurchase the          
securities at a higher price, which includes an amount representing interest on 
the purchase price, within a specified time. In the event of bankruptcy of the  
seller, the Fund could experience both losses and delays in liquidating its     
collateral.                                                                     

OPTIONS ON SECURITIES, INDEXES AND CURRENCIES 

   Each Fund may purchase and sell (write) put options and call options on
securities, indexes or foreign currencies. A Fund may purchase agreements,      
sometimes called cash puts, that may accompany the purchase of a new issue of   
bonds from a dealer.                                                            

      A put option gives the purchaser of the option, upon payment of a premium,
the right to sell, and the writer the obligation to buy, the underlying         
security, commodity, index, currency or other instrument at the exercise price. 
For instance, a Fund's purchase of a put option on a security might be designed 
to protect its holdings in the underlying instrument (or, in some cases, a      
similar instrument) against a substantial decline in the market value by giving 
such Fund the right to sell such instrument at the option exercise price. A call
option, upon payment of a premium, gives the purchaser of the option the right  
to buy, and the seller the obligation to sell, the underlying instrument at the 
exercise price. A Fund's purchase of a call option on a security, financial     
future, index, currency or other instrument might be intended to protect a fund 
against an increase in the price of the underlying instrument that it intends to
purchase in the future by fixing the price at which it may purchase such        
instrument.                                                                     

11

P-->49714th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�14th
Each Fund is authorized to purchase and sell (write) exchange listed
options and over-the-counter options ("OTC options"). Exchange listed options   
are issued by a regulated intermediary such as the Options Clearing Corporation 
("OCC"), which guarantees the performance of the obligations of the parties to  
such options. The discussion below uses the OCC as an example, but is also      
applicable to other financial intermediaries.                                   

     With certain exceptions, OCC issued and exchange listed options generally
settle by physical delivery of the underlying security or currency, although in 
the future cash settlement may become available. Index options and Eurodollar   
instruments are cash settled for the net amount, if any, by which the option is 
"in-the-money" (i.e., where the value of the underlying instrument exceeds, in  
the case of a call option, or is less than, in the case of a put option, the    
exercise price of the option) at the time the option is exercised. Frequently,  
rather than taking or making delivery of the underlying instrument through the  
process of exercising the option, listed options are closed by entering into    
offsetting purchase or sale transactions that do not result in ownership of the 
new option.                                                                     

   OTC options are purchased from or sold to Counterparties through direct
bilateral agreement with the Counterparties. In contrast to exchange listed     
options, which generally have standardized terms and performance mechanics, all 
the terms of an OTC option, including such terms as method of settlement, term, 
exercise price, premium, guarantees and security, are set by negotiation of the 
parties. A Fund will only sell (write) OTC options (other than OTC currency     
options) that are subject to a buy-back provision permitting the Fund to require
the Counterparty to sell the option back to the Fund at a formula price within  
seven days. The Funds expect generally to enter into OTC options that have cash 
settlement provisions, although they are not required to do so. The staff of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") currently takes the position that
OTC options purchased by a fund, and portfolio securities "covering" the amount 
of a fund's obligation pursuant to an OTC option sold by it (or the amount of   
assets equal to the formula price for the repurchase of the option, if any, less
the amount by which the option is "in the money") are illiquid, and are subject 
to a fund's limitation on investing no more than 10% of its net assets (or 15%  
in the case of Global Growth and Income Fund) in illiquid securities.           

      Each Fund may also purchase and sell (write) options on securities indices
and other financial indices. Options on securities indices and other financial  
indices are similar to options on a security or other instrument except that,   
rather than settling by physical delivery of the underlying instrument, they    
settle by cash settlement, i.e., an option or an index gives the holder the     
right to receive, upon exercise of the option, an amount of cash if the closing 
level of the index upon which the option is based exceeds, in the case of a     
call, or is less than, in the case of a put, the exercise price of the option   
(except if, in the case of an OTC option, physical delivery is specified). This 
amount of cash is equal to the excess of the closing price of the index over the
exercise price of the option, which also may be multiplied by a formula value.  
The seller of the option is obligated, in return for the premium received, to   
make delivery of this amount. The gain or loss on an option on an index depends 
on price movements in the instruments making upon the market, market segment,   
industry or other composite on which the underlying index is based, rather than 
price movements in individual securities, as is the case with respect to options
on securities.                                                                  

12

P-->49715th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�15th
  A Fund will sell (write) call options and put options only if they are
"covered." For example, a call option written by a Fund will require such Fund  
to hold the securities subject to the call (or securities convertible into the  
needed securities without additional consideration) or to segregate cash or     
liquid assets sufficient to purchase and deliver the securities if the call is  
exercised. A call option sold by a Fund on an index will require such Fund to   
own portfolio securities that correlate with the index or to segregate cash or  
liquid assets equal to the excess of the index value over the exercise price on 
a current basis. A put option written by a Fund requires such Fund to segregate 
cash or liquid assets equal to the exercise price.                              

 OTC options entered into by a Fund and OCC issued and exchange listed
index options will generally provide for cash settlement. As a result, when a   
Fund sells (writes) these instruments, it will only segregate an amount of cash 
or liquid assets equal to its accrued net obligations, as there is no           
requirement for payment or delivery of amounts in excess of the net amount.     
These amounts will equal 100% of the exercise price in the case of a non        
cash-settled put, the same as an OCC guaranteed listed option sold by a Fund, or
the "in-the-money" amount plus any sell-back formula amount in the case of a    
cash-settled put or call. In addition, when a Fund sells (writes) a call option 
on an index at a time when the in-the-money amount exceeds the exercise price,  
such Fund will segregate, until the option expires or is closed out, cash or    
cash equivalents equal in value to such excess. OCC issued and exchange listed  
options sold by a Fund other than those above generally settle with physical    
delivery, or with an election of either physical delivery or cash settlement and
such Fund will segregate an amount of cash or liquid assets equal to the full   
value of the option. OTC options settling with physical delivery, or with an    
election of either physical delivery or cash settlement, will be treated the    
same as other options settling with physical delivery.                          

     If an option written by a Fund expires, such Fund realizes a capital gain
equal to the premium received at the time the option was written. If an option  
purchased by a Fund expires, such Fund realizes a capital loss equal to the     
premium paid.                                                                   

     A Fund will realize a capital gain from a closing purchase transaction if
the cost of the closing option is less than the premium received from writing   
the option, or, if it is more, such Fund will realize a capital loss. If the    
premium received from a closing sale transaction is more than the premium paid  
to purchase the option, a Fund will realize a capital gain or, if it is less,   
such Fund will realize a capital loss. The principal factors affecting the      
market value of a put or a call option include supply and demand, interest      
rates, the current market price of the underlying security or index in relation 
to the exercise price of the option, the volatility of the underlying security  
or index, and the time remaining until the expiration date.                     

     A put or call option purchased by a Fund is an asset of such Fund, valued
initially at the premium paid for the option. The premium received for an option
written by a Fund is recorded as a deferred credit. The value of an option      
purchased or written is marked-to-market daily and is valued at the closing     
price on the exchange on which it is traded or, if not traded on an exchange or 
no closing price is available, at the mean between the last bid and asked       
prices.                                                                         

  RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OPTIONS. There are several risks associated with
transactions in options. For example, there are significant differences between 
the securities markets, the currency markets and the options markets that could 
result in an imperfect correlation among                                        

13

P-->49716th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�16th
these markets, causing a given transaction not to achieve its objectives. A     
decision as to whether, when and how to use options involves the exercise of    
skill and judgment, and even a well-conceived transaction may be unsuccessful to
some degree because of market behavior or unexpected events. The ability of a   
Fund to utilize options successfully will depend on the investment adviser's    
ability to predict pertinent market investments, which cannot be assured.       

A Fund's ability to close out its position as a purchaser or seller 
(writer) of an OCC or exchange listed put or call option is dependent, in part, 
upon the liquidity of the option market. Among the possible reasons for the     
absence of a liquid option market on an exchange are: (i) insufficient trading  
interest in certain options; (ii) restrictions on transactions imposed by an    
exchange; (iii) trading halts, suspensions or other restrictions imposed with   
respect to particular classes or series of options or underlying securities     
including reaching daily price limits; (iv) interruption of the normal          
operations of the OCC or an exchange; (v) inadequacy of the facilities of an    
exchange or OCC to handle current trading volume; or (vi) a decision by one or  
more exchanges to discontinue the trading of options (or a particular class or  
series of options), in which event the relevant market for that option on that  
exchange would cease to exist, although outstanding options on that exchange    
would generally continue to be exercisable in accordance with their terms. If a 
Fund were unable to close out an option that it has purchased on a security, it 
would have to exercise the option in order to realize any profit or the option  
would expire and become worthless. If a Fund were unable to close out a covered 
call option that it had written on a security, it would not be able to sell the 
underlying security until the option expired. As the writer of a covered call   
option on a security, a Fund foregoes, during the option's life, the opportunity
to profit from increases in the market value of the security covering the call  
option above the sum of the premium and the exercise price of the call. As the  
writer of a covered call option on a foreign currency, a Fund foregoes, during  
the option's life, the opportunity to profit from currency appreciation.        

   The hours of trading for listed options may not coincide with the hours
during which the underlying financial instruments are traded. To the extent that
the option markets close before the markets for the underlying financial        
instruments, significant price and rate movements can take place in the         
underlying markets that cannot be reflected in the option markets.              

Unless the parties provide for it, there is no central clearing or  
guaranty function in an OTC option. As a result, if the Counterparty (as        
described above under "Options on Securities, Indexes and Currencies") fails to 
make or take delivery of the security, currency or other instrument underlying  
an OTC option it has entered into with a Fund or fails to make a cash settlement
payment due in accordance with the terms of that option, a Fund will lose any   
premium it paid for the option as well as any anticipated benefit of the        
transaction. Accordingly, Calamos Advisors must assess the creditworthiness of  
each such Counterparty or any guarantor or credit enhancement of the            
Counterparty's credit to determine the likelihood that the terms of the OTC     
option will be satisfied.                                                       

      Each Fund may purchase and sell (write) call options on securities indices
and currencies. All calls sold by a Fund must be "covered." Even though a Fund  
will receive the option premium to help protect it against loss, a call sold by 
a Fund exposes such Fund during the term of the option to possible loss of      
opportunity to realize appreciation in the market price of the underlying       
security or instrument and may require a fund to hold a security or instrument  
that it

might otherwise have sold. Each Fund may purchase and sell (write) put options  
on securities indices and currencies. In selling (writing) put options, there is
a risk that a Fund may be required to buy the underlying security at a          
disadvantageous price above the market price.                                   

FUTURES CONTRACTS AND OPTIONS ON FUTURES CONTRACTS 

Each Fund may use interest rate futures contracts, index futures    
contracts, volatility index futures contracts and foreign currency futures      
contracts. An interest rate, index, volatility index or foreign currency futures
contract provides for the future sale by one party and purchase by another party
of a specified quantity of a financial instrument or the cash value of an       
index(1) at a specified price and time. A public market exists in futures       
contracts covering a number of indexes (including, but not limited to, the      
Standard & Poor's 500 Index, the Russell 2000 Index, the Value Line Composite   
Index, and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index) as well as financial    
instruments (including, but not limited to, U.S. Treasury bonds, U.S. Treasury  
notes, Eurodollar certificates of deposit and foreign currencies). Other index  
and financial instrument futures contracts are available and it is expected that
additional futures contracts will be developed and traded. Each Fund may enter  
into such contract if, in the investment adviser's opinion, such contract meets 
the investment parameters of the Fund.                                          

  Each Fund may purchase and write call and put futures options. Futures
options possess many of the same characteristics as options on securities,      
indexes and foreign currencies (discussed above). A futures option gives the    
holder the right, in return for the premium paid, to assume a long position     
(call) or short position (put) in a futures contract at a specified exercise    
price at any time during the period of the option. Upon exercise of a call      
option, the holder acquires a long position in the futures contract and the     
writer is assigned the opposite short position. In the case of a put option, the
opposite is true. The Fund might, for example, use futures contracts to hedge   
against or gain exposure to fluctuations in the general level of stock prices,  
anticipated changes in interest rates or currency fluctuations that might       
adversely affect either the value of the Fund's securities or the price of the  
securities that the Fund intends to purchase. Although other techniques could be
used to reduce or increase the Fund's exposure to stock price, interest rate and
currency fluctuations, the Fund may be able to achieve its desired exposure more
effectively and perhaps at a lower cost by using futures contracts and futures  
options.                                                                        

      A Fund will only enter into futures contracts and futures options that are
standardized and traded on an exchange, board of trade or similar entity, or    
quoted on an automated quotation system.                                        

    The success of any futures transaction depends on the investment adviser
correctly predicting changes in the level and direction of stock prices,        
interest rates, currency exchange rates and other factors. Should those         
predictions be incorrect, the Fund's return might have been better had the      
transaction not been attempted; however, in the absence of the ability to use   

----------                                                                      
(1)   A futures contract on an index is an agreement pursuant to which two      
    parties agree to take or make delivery of an amount of cash equal to the
      difference between the value of the index at the close of the last trading
day of the contract and the price at which the index contract was   
      originally written. Although the value of a securities index is a function
 of the value of certain specified securities, no physical delivery of
those securities is made.

futures contracts, the investment adviser might have taken portfolio actions in 
anticipation of the same market movements with similar investment results, but, 
presumably, at greater transaction costs.                                       

     When a purchase or sale of a futures contract is made by a Fund, the Fund
is required to deposit with its custodian (or broker, if legally permitted) a   
specified amount of cash or U.S. Government securities or other securities      
acceptable to the broker ("initial margin"). The margin required for a futures  
contract is set by the exchange on which the contract is traded and may be      
modified during the term of the contract, although a Fund's broker may require  
margin deposits in excess of the minimum required by the exchange. The initial  
margin is in the nature of a performance bond or good faith deposit on the      
futures contract, which is returned to the Fund upon termination of the         
contract, assuming all contractual obligations have been satisfied. The Fund    
expects to earn interest income on its initial margin deposits. A futures       
contract held by the Fund is valued daily at the official settlement price of   
the exchange on which it is traded. Each day the Fund pays or receives cash,    
called "variation margin," equal to the daily change in value of the futures    
contract. This process is known as "marking-to-market." Variation margin paid or
received by the Fund does not represent a borrowing or loan by the Fund but is  
instead settlement between the Fund and the broker of the amount one would owe  
the other if the futures contract had expired at the close of the previous day. 
In computing daily net asset value, the Fund will mark-to-market its open       
futures positions.                                                              

    The Fund is also required to deposit and maintain margin with respect to
put and call options on futures contracts written by it. Such margin deposits   
will vary depending on the nature of the underlying futures contract (and the   
related initial margin requirements), the current market value of the option and
other futures positions held by the Fund.                                       

     Although some futures contracts call for making or taking delivery of the
underlying securities, usually these obligations are closed out prior to        
delivery by offsetting purchases or sales of matching futures contracts (same   
exchange, underlying security or index, and delivery month). If an offsetting   
purchase price is less than the original sale price, the Fund engaging in the   
transaction realizes a capital gain, or if it is more, the Fund realizes a      
capital loss. Conversely, if an offsetting sale price is more than the original 
purchase price, the Fund engaging in the transaction realizes a capital gain, or
if it is less, the Fund realizes a capital loss. The transaction costs must also
be included in these calculations.                                              

      RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FUTURES. There are several risks associated with the
use of futures contracts and futures options. A purchase or sale of a futures   
contract may result in losses in excess of the amount invested in the futures   
contract. In trying to increase or reduce market exposure, there can be no      
guarantee that there will be a correlation between price movements in the       
futures contract and in the portfolio exposure sought. In addition, there are   
significant differences between the securities and futures markets that could   
result in an imperfect correlation between the markets, causing a given         
transaction not to achieve its objectives. The degree of imperfection of        
correlation depends on circumstances such as: variations in speculative market  
demand for futures, futures options and the related securities, including       
technical influences in futures and futures options trading and differences     
between the securities markets and the securities underlying the standard       
contracts available for trading. For example, in the case of index futures      
contracts, the composition of the index, including the                          

16

P-->49719th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�19th
issuers and the weighing of each issue, may differ from the composition of the  
Fund's portfolio, and, in the case of interest rate futures contracts, the      
interest rate levels, maturities and creditworthiness of the issues underlying  
the futures contract may differ from the financial instruments held in the      
Fund's portfolio. A decision as to whether, when and how to use futures         
contracts involves the exercise of skill and judgment, and even a well-conceived
transaction may be unsuccessful to some degree because of market behavior or    
unexpected stock price or interest rate trends.                                 

      Futures exchanges may limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in certain
futures contract prices during a single trading day. The daily limit establishes
the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or   
down from the previous day's settlement price at the end of the current trading 
session. Once the daily limit has been reached in a futures contract subject to 
the limit, no more trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit. 
The daily limit governs only price movements during a particular trading day and
therefore does not limit potential losses because the limit may work to prevent 
the liquidation of unfavorable positions. For example, futures prices have      
occasionally moved to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with 
little or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of positions and    
subjecting some holders of futures contracts to substantial losses. Stock index 
futures contracts are not normally subject to such daily price change           
limitations.                                                                    

      There can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist at a time when a
Fund seeks to close out a futures or futures option position. The Fund would be 
exposed to possible loss on the position during the interval of inability to    
close, and would continue to be required to meet margin requirements until the  
position is closed. In addition, many of the contracts discussed above are      
relatively new instruments without a significant trading history. As a result,  
there can be no assurance that an active secondary market will develop or       
continue to exist.                                                              

      LIMITATIONS ON OPTIONS AND FUTURES. If other options, futures contracts or
futures options of types other than those described herein are traded in the    
future, a Fund may also use those investment vehicles, provided the board of    
trustees determines that their use is consistent with the Fund's investment     
objective.                                                                      

A Fund will not enter into a futures contract or purchase an option 
thereon if, immediately thereafter, the initial margin deposits for futures     
contracts held by the Fund plus premiums paid by it for open futures option     
positions, less the amount by which any such positions are "in-the-money," (2)  
would exceed 5% of the Fund's total assets.                                     

----------                                                                      
(2)   A call option is "in-the-money" to the extent, if any, that the value of  
the futures contract that is the subject of the option exceeds the  
exercise price. A put option is "in-the-money" if the exercise price
exceeds the value of the futures contract that is the subject of the
option.                                                             

17

P-->49720th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�20th
   When purchasing a futures contract or writing a put option on a futures
contract, a Fund must maintain with its custodian (or broker, if legally        
permitted) cash or cash equivalents (including any margin) equal to the market  
value of such contract. When writing a call option on a futures contract, the   
Fund similarly will maintain with its custodian cash or cash equivalents        
(including any margin) equal to the amount by which such option is in-the-money 
until the option expires or is closed by the Fund.                              

   A Fund may not maintain open short positions in futures contracts, call
options written on futures contracts or call options written on indexes if, in  
the aggregate, the market value of all such open positions exceeds the current  
value of the securities in its portfolio, plus or minus unrealized gains and    
losses on the open positions, adjusted for the historical relative volatility of
the relationship between the portfolio and the positions. For this purpose, to  
the extent the Fund has written call options on specific securities in its      
portfolio, the value of those securities will be deducted from the current      
market value of the securities portfolio.                                       

 In order to comply with Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC")
Regulation 4.5 and thereby avoid being deemed a "commodity pool operator," a    
Fund may use commodity futures or commodity options contracts for either risk   
management or speculative purposes without any limitation on the notional value 
of such positions. The Funds have qualified for an exemption from registration  
as "commodity pool operators" pursuant to CFTC Regulation 4.5 and, therefore,   
are not subject to registration or regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act, 
as amended.                                                                     

     TAXATION OF OPTIONS AND FUTURES. If a Fund exercises a call or put option
that it holds, the premium paid for the option is added to the cost basis of the
security purchased (call) or deducted from the proceeds of the security sold    
(put). For cash settlement options and futures options exercised by the Fund,   
the difference between the cash received at exercise and the premium paid is a  
capital gain or loss.                                                           

  If a call or put option written by a Fund is exercised, the premium is
included in the proceeds of the sale of the underlying security (call) or       
reduces the cost basis of the security purchased (put). For cash settlement     
options and futures options written by the Fund, the difference between the cash
paid at exercise and the premium received is a capital gain or loss.            

    Entry into a closing purchase transaction will result in capital gain or
loss. If an option written by a Fund was in-the-money at the time it was written
and the security covering the option was held for more than the long-term       
holding period prior to the writing of the option, any loss realized as a result
of a closing purchase transaction will be long-term. The holding period of the  
securities covering an in-the-money option will not include the period of time  
the option is outstanding.                                                      

     If a Fund writes an equity call option(3) other than a "qualified covered
call option," as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  
"Code"), any loss on such option                                                

----------                                                                      
(3)   An equity option is an option to buy or sell stock, and any other option  
  whose value is determined by reference to an index of stocks of a type
     that is ineligible to be traded on a commodity futures exchange (e.g., an
  option contract on a sub-index based on the price of nine hotel-casino
stocks). An option on a broad-based stock index (such as the S&P 500
index) is not an equity option.                                     

18

P-->49721st�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�21st
transaction, to the extent it does not exceed the unrealized gains on the       
securities covering the option, may be subject to deferral until the securities 
covering the option have been sold.                                             

  A futures contract held until delivery results in capital gain or loss
equal to the difference between the price at which the futures contract was     
entered into and the settlement price on the earlier of delivery notice date or 
expiration date. If the Fund delivers securities under a futures contract, the  
Fund also realizes a capital gain or loss on those securities.                  

      For federal income tax purposes, a Fund generally is required to recognize
as income for each taxable year its net unrealized gains and losses as of the   
end of the year on futures, futures options and non-equity options positions    
("year-end mark-to-market"). Generally, any gain or loss recognized with respect
to such positions (either by year-end mark-to-market or by actual closing of the
positions) is considered to be 60% long-term and 40% short-term, without regard 
to the holding periods of the contracts. However, in the case of positions      
classified as part of a "mixed straddle," the recognition of losses on certain  
positions (including options, futures and futures options positions, the related
securities and certain successor positions thereto) may be deferred to a later  
taxable year. Sale of futures contracts or writing of call options (or futures  
call options) or buying put options (or futures put options) that are intended  
to hedge against a change in the value of securities held by the Fund: (1) will 
affect the holding period of the hedged securities; and (2) may cause unrealized
gain or loss on such securities to be recognized upon entry into the hedge.     

  If a Fund were to enter into a short index future, short index futures
option or short index option position and the Fund's portfolio were deemed to   
"mimic" the performance of the index underlying such contract, the option or    
futures contract position and the Fund's stock positions would be deemed to be  
positions in a mixed straddle, subject to the above-mentioned loss deferral     
rules.                                                                          

In order for a Fund to continue to qualify for federal income tax   
treatment as a regulated investment company, at least 90% of its gross income   
for a taxable year must be derived from qualifying income; i.e., dividends,     
interest, income derived from loans of securities and gains from the sale of    
securities or foreign currencies, or other income (including but not limited to 
gains from options, futures or forward contracts). Any net gain realized from   
futures (or futures options) contracts will be considered gain from the sale of 
securities and therefore be qualifying income for purposes of the 90%           
requirement.                                                                    

     Each Fund distributes to shareholders annually any net capital gains that
have been recognized for federal income tax purposes (including year-end        
mark-to-market gains) on options and futures transactions. Such distributions   
are combined with distributions of capital gains realized on the Fund's other   
investments, and shareholders are advised of the nature of the payments.        

WARRANTS                                                                        

     Each Fund may invest in warrants. A warrant is a right to purchase common
stock at a specific price (usually at a premium above the market value of the   
underlying common stock at time of issuance) during a specified period of time. 
A warrant may have a life ranging from less                                     

19

P-->49722nd�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�22nd
than a year to twenty years or longer, but a warrant becomes worthless unless it
is exercised or sold before expiration. In addition, if the market price of the 
common stock does not exceed the warrant's exercise price during the life of the
warrant, the warrant will expire worthless. Warrants have no voting rights, pay 
no dividends and have no rights with respect to the assets of the corporation   
issuing them. The percentage increase or decrease in the value of a warrant may 
be greater than the percentage increase or decrease in the value of the         
underlying common stock.                                                        

PORTFOLIO TURNOVER                                                              

Although the Funds do not purchase securities with a view to rapid  
turnover, there are no limitations on the length of time that portfolio         
securities must be held. Portfolio turnover can occur for a number of reasons,  
including calls for redemption, general conditions in the securities markets,   
more favorable investment opportunities in other securities, or other factors   
relating to the desirability of holding or changing a portfolio investment. The 
portfolio turnover rates may vary greatly from year to year. A high rate of     
portfolio turnover in a Fund would result in increased transaction expense,     
which must be borne by that Fund. High portfolio turnover may also result in the
realization of capital gains or losses and, to the extent net short-term capital
gains are realized, any distributions resulting from such gains will be         
considered ordinary income for federal income tax purposes. Portfolio turnover  
for each Fund is shown under "Financial Highlights" in the prospectus.          

SHORT SALES                                                                     

    Each Fund may attempt to hedge against market risk and to enhance income
by selling short "against the box," that is: (1) entering into short sales of   
securities that it currently has the right to acquire through the conversion or 
exchange of other securities that it owns, or to a lesser extent, entering into 
short sales of securities that it currently owns; and (2) entering into         
arrangements with the broker-dealers through which such securities are sold     
short to receive income with respect to the proceeds of short sales during the  
period the Fund's short positions remain open. Each Fund other than Market      
Neutral Fund may make short sales of securities only if at all times when a     
short position is open the Fund owns an equal amount of such securities or      
securities convertible into or exchangeable for, without payment of any further 
consideration, securities of the same issue as, and equal in amount to, the     
securities sold short.                                                          

      In addition to selling short against the box, Market Neutral Fund may sell
short securities that it currently has the right to acquire upon payment of     
additional consideration, for instance, upon exercise of a warrant or option.   
Market Neutral Fund would use this technique to hedge against market risk in    
connection with a synthetic convertible security in the same way selling short  
against the box hedges against market risk in connection with a true convertible
security.                                                                       

In a short sale against the box, a Fund does not deliver from its   
portfolio the securities sold and does not receive immediately the proceeds from
the short sale. Instead, the Fund borrows the securities sold short from a      
broker-dealer through which the short sale is executed, and the broker-dealer   
delivers such securities, on behalf of the Fund, to the purchaser of such       
securities. Such broker-dealer is entitled to retain the proceeds from the short
sale until the Fund delivers to such broker-dealer the securities sold short. In
addition, the Fund is required to pay to the broker-dealer the amount of any    
dividends paid on shares sold short. Finally, to secure its                     

20

P-->49723rd�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�23rd
obligation to deliver to such broker-dealer the securities sold short, the Fund 
must deposit and continuously maintain in a separate account with the Fund's    
custodian an equivalent amount of the securities sold short or securities       
convertible into or exchangeable for such securities without the payment of     
additional consideration. The Fund is said to have a short position in the      
securities sold until it delivers to the broker-dealer the securities sold, at  
which time the Fund receives the proceeds of the sale. Because the Fund         
ordinarily will want to continue to hold securities in its portfolio that are   
sold short, the Fund will normally close out a short position by purchasing on  
the open market and delivering to the broker-dealer an equal amount of the      
securities sold short, rather than by delivering portfolio securities.          

A short sale works the same way, except that the Fund places in the 
segregated account cash or U.S. government securities equal in value to the     
difference between (i) the market value of the securities sold short at the time
they were sold short and (ii) any cash or U.S. government securities required to
be deposited with the broker as collateral. In addition, so long as the short   
position is open, the Fund must adjust daily the value of the segregated account
so that the amount deposited in it, plus any amount deposited with the broker as
collateral, will equal the current market value of the security sold short.     
However, the value of the segregated account may not be reduced below the point 
at which the segregated account, plus any amount deposited with the broker, is  
equal to the market value of the securities sold short at the time they were    
sold short.                                                                     

     Market Neutral Fund will conduct its short sales so that no more than 10%
of the net assets of the Fund, when added together, will be (i) deposited with  
brokers as collateral, and (ii) allocated to segregated accounts in connection  
with short sales, at any time.                                                  

     Short sales may protect a Fund against the risk of losses in the value of
its portfolio securities because any unrealized losses with respect to such     
portfolio securities should be wholly or partially offset by a corresponding    
gain in the short position. However, any potential gains in such portfolio      
securities should be wholly or partially offset by a corresponding loss in the  
short position. The extent to which such gains or losses are offset will depend 
upon the amount of securities sold short relative to the amount the Fund owns,  
either directly or indirectly, and, in the case where the Fund owns convertible 
securities, changes in the conversion premium.                                  

         Short sale transactions of a Fund involve certain risks. In particular,
the imperfect correlation between the price movements of the convertible        
securities and the price movements of the underlying common stock being sold    
short creates the possibility that losses on the short sale hedge position may  
be greater than gains in the value of the portfolio securities being hedged. In 
addition, to the extent that a Fund pays a conversion premium for a convertible 
security, the Fund is generally unable to protect against a loss of such premium
pursuant to a short sale hedge. In determining the number of shares to be sold  
short against a Fund's position in the convertible securities, the anticipated  
fluctuation in the conversion premiums is considered. A Fund will also incur    
transaction costs in connection with short sales. Certain provisions of the Code
may limit the degree to which the Fund is able to enter into short sales, which 
limitations might impair the Fund's ability to achieve its investment objective.
See "Taxation."                                                                 

21

P-->49724th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�24th
    In addition to enabling a Fund to hedge against market risk, short sales
may afford a Fund an opportunity to earn additional current income to the extent
the Fund is able to enter into arrangements with broker-dealers through which   
the short sales are executed to receive income with respect to the proceeds of  
the short sales during the period the Fund's short positions remain open.       

The Code imposes constructive sale treatment for federal income tax 
purposes on certain hedging strategies with respect to appreciated securities.  
Under these rules taxpayers will recognize gain, but not loss, with respect to  
securities if they enter into short sales or "offsetting notional principal     
contracts" (as defined by the Act), or futures or "forward contracts" (as       
defined by the Act) with respect to the same or substantially identical         
property, or if they enter into such transactions and then acquire the same or  
substantially identical property. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to
promulgate regulations that will treat as constructive sales certain            
transactions that have substantially the same effect as short sales.            

"WHEN-ISSUED" AND DELAYED DELIVERY SECURITIES AND REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS 

  Each Fund may purchase securities on a when-issued or delayed-delivery
basis. Although the payment and interest terms of these securities are          
established at the time the Fund enters into the commitment, the securities may 
be delivered and paid for a month or more after the date of purchase, when their
value may have changed. The Fund makes such commitments only with the intention 
of actually acquiring the securities, but may sell the securities before        
settlement date if Calamos Advisors deems it advisable for investment reasons.  
The Fund may utilize spot and forward foreign currency exchange transactions to 
reduce the risk inherent in fluctuations in the exchange rate between one       
currency and another when securities are purchased or sold on a when-issued or  
delayed-delivery basis.                                                         

 Each Fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements with banks and
securities dealers. A reverse repurchase agreement is a repurchase agreement in 
which the Fund is the seller of, rather than the investor in, securities and    
agrees to repurchase them at an agreed-upon time and price. Use of a reverse    
repurchase agreement may be preferable to a regular sale and later repurchase of
securities because it avoids certain market risks and transaction costs.        

At the time when a Fund enters into a binding obligation to purchase
securities on a when-issued basis or enters into a reverse repurchase agreement,
liquid assets (cash, U.S. Government securities or other "high-grade" debt      
obligations) of the Fund having a value at least as great as the purchase price 
of the securities to be purchased will be segregated on the books of the Fund   
and held by the custodian throughout the period of the obligation. The use of   
these investment strategies, as well as borrowing under a line of credit as     
described below, may increase net asset value fluctuation.                      

ILLIQUID SECURITIES                                                             

   Global Growth and Income Fund may invest up to 15% of its total assets,
and each other Fund may invest up to 10% of its total assets, taken at market   
value, in illiquid securities, including any securities that are not readily    
marketable either because they are restricted securities or for other reasons.  
Restricted securities are securities that are subject to restrictions           

22

P-->49725th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�25th
on resale because they have not been registered for sale under the Securities   
Act of 1933. A position in restricted securities might adversely affect the     
liquidity and marketability of a portion of the Fund's portfolio, and the Fund  
might not be able to dispose of its holdings in such securities promptly or at  
reasonable prices. In those instances where a Fund is required to have          
restricted securities held by it registered prior to sale by the Fund and the   
Fund does not have a contractual commitment from the issuer or seller to pay the
costs of such registration, the gross proceeds from the sale of securities would
be reduced by the registration costs and underwriting discounts. Any such       
registration costs are not included in the percentage limitation on a Fund's    
investment in restricted securities.                                            

TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS                                                           

Each Fund may make temporary investments without limitation when the
investment adviser determines that a defensive position is warranted. Such      
investments may be in money market instruments, consisting of obligations of, or
guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. Government or its agencies 
or instrumentalities; certificates of deposit, bankers' acceptances and other   
obligations of domestic banks having total assets of at least $500 million and  
that are regulated by the U.S. Government, its agencies or instrumentalities;   
commercial paper rated in the highest category by a recognized rating agency;   
and repurchase agreements.                                                      

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS 

   As part of its strategy for the temporary investment of cash, each Fund
may enter into "repurchase agreements" pertaining to U.S. Government securities 
with member banks of the Federal Reserve System or primary dealers (as          
designated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) in such securities. A       
repurchase agreement arises when a Fund purchases a security and simultaneously 
agrees to resell it to the vendor at an agreed upon future date. The resale     
price is greater than the purchase price, reflecting an agreed upon market rate 
of return that is effective for the period of time the Fund holds the security  
and that is not related to the coupon rate on the purchased security. Such      
agreements generally have maturities of no more than seven days and could be    
used to permit a Fund to earn interest on assets awaiting long term investment. 
The Funds require continuous maintenance by the custodian for the Fund's account
in the Federal Reserve/Treasury Book Entry System of collateral in an amount    
equal to, or in excess of, the market value of the securities that are the      
subject of a repurchase agreement. Repurchase agreements maturing in more than  
seven days are considered illiquid securities. In the event of a bankruptcy or  
other default of a seller of a repurchase agreement, the Fund could experience  
both delays in liquidating the underlying security and losses, including: (a)   
possible decline in the value of the underlying security during the period while
the Fund seeks to enforce its rights thereto; (b) possible subnormal levels of  
income and lack of access to income during this period; and (c) expenses of     
enforcing its rights.                                                           

 INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS

Each Fund has elected to be classified as a diversified, open-end   
management investment company.                                                  

23

P-->49726th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�26th
     Unless otherwise noted, each Fund operates under the following investment
restrictions. A Fund may not:                                                   

(i)   (for Blue Chip Fund, Value Fund, Global Growth and Income Fund and High   
Yield Fund only) make any investment inconsistent with the Fund's   
   classification as a diversified investment company under the Investment
     Company Act of 1940 if the Fund is classified as a diversified investment
company;                                                            

      (for each of the other Funds) as to 75% of its assets, invest more than 5%
  of its total assets, taken at market value at the time of a particular
purchase, in the securities of any one issuer, except that this     
restriction does not apply to securities issued or guaranteed by the
United States Government or its agencies or instrumentalities;      

(ii)  acquire more than 10%, taken at the time of a particular purchase, of the 
outstanding voting securities of any one issuer;                    

(iii) act as an underwriter of securities, except insofar as it may be deemed an
    underwriter for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933 on disposition of
securities acquired subject to legal or contractual restrictions on 
resale;                                                             

(iv)  (for each Fund other than Blue Chip Fund, Value Fund, Global Growth and   
   Income Fund and High Yield Fund) invest more than 10% of the Fund's net
   assets (taken at market value at the time of each purchase) in illiquid
   securities, including repurchase agreements maturing in more than seven
days;                                                               

(v)   (for Blue Chip Fund, Value Fund, Global Growth and Income Fund and High   
   Yield Fund only) purchase or sell real estate (although it may purchase
 securities secured by real estate or interests therein, or securities
 issued by companies that invest in real estate or interests therein),
     commodities or commodity contracts, except that a Fund may (a) enter into
  futures, options and options on futures, (b) forward contracts and (c)
other financial transactions not requiring the delivery of physical 
commodities;                                                        

   (for each of the other Funds) purchase or sell real estate (although it
   may purchase securities secured by real estate or interests therein, or
  securities issued by companies that invest in real estate or interests
therein), commodities or commodity contracts;                       

(vi)  make loans, but this restriction shall not prevent the Fund from (a)      
    investing in debt obligations, (b) investing in repurchase agreements or
(c) lending portfolio securities;                                   

(vii) (for Blue Chip Fund, Value Fund, Global Growth and Income Fund and High   
  Yield Fund only) borrow, except from banks, other affiliated Funds and
      other entities to the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of
1940;                                                               

     (for each of the other Funds) borrow, except that the Fund may (a) borrow
    up to 10% of its total assets, taken at market value at the time of such
      borrowing, as a temporary measure for extraordinary or emergency purposes,
 but not to increase portfolio income (the total of reverse repurchase
agreements and such borrowings will not exceed 10% of               

24

P-->49727th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�27th
total assets, and the Fund will not purchase securities when its    
    borrowings exceed 5% of total assets) and (b) enter into transactions in
options;                                                            

(viii)invest in a security if more than 25% of its total assets (taken at       
   market value at the time of a particular purchase) would be invested in
  the securities of issuers in any particular industry, except that this
     restriction does not apply to securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S.
Government or its agencies or instrumentalities; or                 

(ix)  (for Blue Chip Fund, Value Fund, Global Growth and Income Fund and High   
      Yield Fund only) issue any senior security, except to the extent permitted
under the Investment Company Act of 1940;                           

    (for each of the other Funds) issue any senior security, except that the
Market Neutral Fund may sell securities short.                      

  The above restrictions are fundamental policies and may not be changed
with respect to a Fund without the approval of a "majority" of the outstanding  
shares of that Fund, which for this purpose means the approval of the lesser of 
(a) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of that Fund or (b) 67%  
or more of the outstanding shares if the holders of more than 50% of the        
outstanding shares of that Fund are present or represented at the meeting by    
proxy.                                                                          

   Currently under the Investment Company Act of 1940, a "senior security"
does not include any promissory note or evidence of indebtedness where such loan
is for temporary purposes only and in an amount not exceeding 5% of the value of
the total assets of the issuer at the time the loan is made. A loan is presumed 
to be for temporary purposes if it is repaid within sixty days and is not       
extended or renewed.                                                            

In addition to the fundamental restrictions listed above, and as a  
non-fundamental policy, no Fund may (except as indicated):                      

    (a)   invest in shares of other open-end investment companies, except as
permitted by the Investment Company Act of 1940;                                

(b)   invest in companies for the purpose of exercising control or  
management;                                                                     

  (c)   purchase securities on margin (except for use of such short-term
credits as are necessary for the clearance of transactions, including           
transactions in options, futures and options on futures), or participate on a   
joint or a joint and several basis in any trading account in securities, except 
in connection with transactions in options, futures and options on futures;     

   (d)   make short sales of securities, except that a Fund may make short
sales of securities (i) if the Fund owns an equal amount of such securities, or 
owns securities that are convertible or exchangeable, without payment of further
consideration, into an equal amount of such securities and (ii) Market Neutral  
Fund may make short sales of securities other than those described in clause    
(i), provided that no more than 10% of its net assets would, when added         
together, be deposited with brokers as collateral or allocated to segregated    
accounts in connection with short sales other than those described in clause    
(i);                                                                            

25

P-->49728th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�28th
     (e)   invest more than 25% of its net assets (valued at time of purchase)
in securities of foreign issuers (other than securities represented by ADRs and 
securities guaranteed by a U.S. person), except that Global Growth and Income   
Fund may invest all of its assets in securities of foreign issuers.             

    (f)   (for Blue Chip Fund, Value Fund, Global Growth and Income Fund and
High Yield Fund only) invest more than 10% (or 15% in the case of Global Growth 
and Income Fund) of the Fund's net assets (taken at market value at the time of 
each purchase) in illiquid securities, including repurchase agreements maturing 
in more than seven days;                                                        

   The non-fundamental investment restrictions above may be changed by the
board of trustees without shareholder approval.                                 

      Notwithstanding the foregoing investment restrictions, a Fund may purchase
securities pursuant to the exercise of subscription rights, subject to the      
condition that such purchase will not result in the Fund's ceasing to be a      
diversified investment company. Far Eastern and European corporations frequently
issue additional capital stock by means of subscription rights offerings to     
existing shareholders at a price substantially below the market price of the    
shares. The failure to exercise such rights would result in the Fund's interest 
in the issuing company being diluted. The market for such rights is not well    
developed in all cases and, accordingly, the Fund may not always realize full   
value on the sale of rights. The exception applies in cases where the limits set
forth in the investment restrictions would otherwise be exceeded by exercising  
rights or would have already been exceeded as a result of fluctuations in the   
market value of the Fund's portfolio securities with the result that the Fund   
would be forced either to sell securities at a time when it might not otherwise 
have done so, to forego exercising the rights.                                  

MANAGEMENT
TRUSTEES AND OFFICERS                                                           

The management of the Trust, including general supervision of the duties        
performed for each Fund under the Investment Management Agreement, is the       
responsibility of its board of trustees. Each trustee elected will hold office  
for the lifetime of the Trust or until such trustee's earlier resignation, death
or removal; however, each trustee who is not an interested person of the Trust  
shall retire as a trustee at the end of the calendar year in which the trustee  
attains the age of 72 years.                                                    

The following table sets forth each trustee's position(s) with the Trust, age,  
principal occupation during the past five years, number of portfolios overseen, 
other directorships, and the date on which such trustee first became a trustee  
of the Trust. Each trustee oversees each Fund of the Trust.

The address of each officer is 1111 East Warrenville Road, Naperville, Illinois

COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES. The Trust's board of trustees  
currently has three standing committees:                                        

Executive Committee. Messrs. John Calamos and Nick Calamos are members of the   
executive committee, which has authority during intervals between meetings of   
the board of trustees to exercise the powers of the board, with certain         
exceptions. Both John Calamos and Nick Calamos are interested trustees of the   
Trust.                                                                          

Audit Committee. Messrs. Hanauer, Marsh, Neal, Rybak and Timbers serve on the   
audit committee. The audit committee operates under a written charter adopted   
and approved by the board. The audit committee selects independent auditors,    
approves services to be rendered by the auditors, monitors the auditors'        
performance, reviews the results of the Trust's audit, determines whether to    
recommend to the board that the Trust's audited financial statements be included
in the Trust's annual report and responds to other matters deemed appropriate by
the board. All members of the audit committee are independent trustees of the   
Trust.                                                                          

Governance Committee. Messrs. Hanauer, Marsh, Neal, Rybak and Timbers serve on  
the governance committee. The governance committee operates under a written     
charter adopted and approved by the board. The governance committee oversees the
independence and effective functioning of the board of trustees and endeavors to
be informed about good practices for

mutual fund boards. The governance committee also functions as a nominating     
committee by making recommendations to the board of trustees regarding          
candidates for election as non-interested trustees. In making such              
recommendations, the governance committee considers a number of factors,        
including a candidate's background, integrity, knowledge and relevant           
experience. These factors are set forth in an appendix to the written charter.  
Any prospective candidate is interviewed by the trustees, and references are    
checked. The governance committee does not have a policy to consider shareholder
recommendations regarding candidates for election as trustees. The committee    
determined that it is appropriate not to have a policy to consider shareholder  
recommendations because the current process of identifying and recommending     
potential candidates is sufficient to ensure a knowledgeable and independent    
board. All members of the governance committee are independent trustees of the  
Trust.                                                                          

In addition to the above committees, there is a pricing committee, appointed by 
the board of trustees, comprised of officers of the Trust and employees of      
Calamos Advisors.                                                               

During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, the Trust's board of trustees held 
five meetings, the executive committee held one meeting, the audit committee    
held five meetings, and the governance committee held five meetings. All of the 
trustees and committee members then serving attended at least 75% of the        
meetings of the board of trustees and applicable committees held during each    
such fiscal year.                                                               

     TRUSTEE COMPENSATION. Messrs. John Calamos and Nick Calamos, the trustees
who are "interested persons" of the Trust, do not receive compensation from the 
Trust. Although they are compensated, the noninterested trustees do not receive 
any pension or retirement benefits from the Trust. The following table sets     
forth the total compensation (including any amounts deferred, as described      
below) paid by the Trust during the periods indicated to each of the current    
trustees.

The Trust has adopted a deferred compensation plan (the "Plan"). Under the Plan,
a trustee who is not an "interested person" of Calamos Advisors and has elected 
to participate in the Plan (a "participating trustee") may defer receipt of all 
or a portion of his compensation from the Trust to defer payment of income taxes
or for other reasons. The deferred compensation payable to the participating    
trustee is credited to the trustee's deferral account as of the business day    
such compensation would have been paid to the trustee. The value of a trustee's 
deferred compensation account at any time is equal to what would be the value if
the amounts credited to the account had instead been invested in shares of one  
or more of the Funds of the Trust as designated by the trustee. Thus, the value 
of the account increases with contributions to the account or with increases in 
the value of the measuring shares, and the value of the account decreases with  
withdrawals from the account or with declines in the value of the measuring     
shares. If a participating trustee retires, the trustee may elect to receive    
payments under the plan in a lump sum or in equal annual installments over a    
period of five years. If a participating trustee dies, any amount payable under 
the Plan will be paid to the trustee's beneficiaries. Each Fund's obligation to 
make payments under the Plan is a general obligation of that Fund. No Fund is   
liable for any other Fund's obligations to make payments under the Plan.        

  CODE OF ETHICS. Employees of Calamos Advisors and CFS are permitted to
make personal securities transactions, including transactions in securities that
the Trust may purchase, sell or hold, subject to requirements and restrictions  
set forth in the Code of Ethics of the Trust, Calamos Advisors and CFS. The Code
of Ethics contains provisions and requirements designed to identify and address 
certain conflicts of interest between personal investment activities of Calamos 
Advisors and CFS employees and the interests of investment advisory clients such
as the Trust. Among other things, the Code of Ethics prohibits certain types of 
transactions absent prior approval, imposes time periods during which personal  
transactions may not be made in certain securities, and requires the submission 
of duplicate broker confirmations and statements and quarterly reporting of     
securities transactions. Additional restrictions apply to portfolio managers,   
traders, research analysts and others involved in the investment advisory       
process. Exceptions to these and other provisions of the Code of Ethics may be  
granted in particular circumstances after review by appropriate personnel.      

PROXY VOTING PROCEDURES. Each Fund has delegated proxy voting       
responsibilities to Calamos Advisors, subject to the board of trustees' general 
oversight. Each Fund expects Calamos Advisors to vote proxies related to that   
Fund's portfolio securities for which the Fund has voting authority consistent  
with the Fund's best economic interests. Calamos Advisors has adopted its own   
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures ("Policies"). The Policies address, among  
other things, conflicts of interest that may arise between the interests of the 
Funds, and the interests of the adviser and its affiliates.                     

  The following is a summary of the Policies used by Calamos Advisors in
voting proxies.                                                                 

To assist it in voting proxies, Calamos Advisors has established a  
Committee comprised of members of its Portfolio Management and Research         
Departments. The Committee and/or its members will vote proxies using the       
following guidelines.                                                           

    In general, if Calamos Advisors believes that a company's management and
board have interests sufficiently aligned with the Fund's interest, Calamos     
Advisors will vote in favor of                                                  

30

P-->49733rd�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�33rd
proposals recommended by a company's board. More specifically, Calamos Advisors 
seeks to ensure that the board of directors of a company is sufficiently aligned
with security holders' interests and provides proper oversight of the company's 
management. In many cases this may be best accomplished by having a majority of 
independent board members. Although Calamos Advisors will examine board member  
elections on a case-by-case basis, it will generally vote for the election of   
directors that would result in a board comprised of a majority of independent   
directors.                                                                      

   Because of the enormous variety and complexity of transactions that are
presented to shareholders, such as mergers, acquisitions, reincorporations,     
adoptions of anti-takeover measures (including adoption of a shareholder rights 
plan, requiring supermajority voting on particular issues, adoption of fair     
price provisions, issuance of blank check preferred stocks and the creation of a
separate class of stock with unequal voting rights), changes to capital         
structures (including authorizing additional shares, repurchasing stock or      
approving a stock split), executive compensation and option plans, that occur in
a variety of industries, companies and market cycles, it is extremely difficult 
to foresee exactly what would be in the best interests of the Fund in all       
circumstances. Moreover, voting on such proposals involves considerations unique
to each transaction. Accordingly, Calamos Advisors will vote on a case-by-case  
basis on proposals presenting these transactions.                               

Finally, Calamos Advisors has established procedures to help resolve
conflicts of interests that might arise when voting proxies for the Funds. These
procedures provide that the Committee, along with Calamos Advisors' Legal and   
Compliance Departments, will examine conflicts of interests with the Fund of    
which Calamos Advisors is aware and seek to resolve such conflicts in the best  
interests of the Fund, irrespective of any such conflict. If a member of the    
Committee has a personal conflict of interest, that member will refrain from    
voting and the remainder of the Committee will determine how to vote the proxy  
solely on the investment merits of any proposal. The Committee will then        
memorialize the conflict and the procedures used to address the conflict.

---------------------                                                           

(1) Blue Chip Fund commenced operations on December 1, 2003.                    

(2) Value Fund commenced operations on January 2, 2002.                         

    The Agreement continues in effect with respect to each Fund from year to
year so long as such continuation is approved at least annually by (1) the board
of trustees or the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of   
the Fund, and (2) a majority of the trustees who are not interested persons of  
any party to the Agreement, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose  
of voting on such approval. At a meeting of the board of trustees of the Trust  
held on July 7, 2004, called in part for the purpose of voting on the renewal of
the Agreement, the Agreement was renewed through July 31, 2005 by the unanimous 
vote of the trustees present at the meeting, and the unanimous vote of the      
"non-interested" trustees of the Trust voting separately.                       

     In evaluating the Agreement, the trustees reviewed materials furnished by
Calamos Advisors, including information regarding Calamos Advisors, its         
affiliates and their personnel, operations and financial condition. The trustees
discussed with representatives of Calamos Advisors each Fund's operations and   
Calamos Advisors' ability to provide advisory and other services to the Funds.  
The trustees also reviewed, among other things:                                 

 -     the investment performance of other Calamos Advisors funds with
similar investment strategies;                          

    -     the proposed fees to be charged by Calamos Advisors for investment
management services;                                    

-     each Fund's projected total operating expenses;               

   -     the investment performance, fees and total expenses of investment
         companies with similar objectives and strategies managed by other
investment advisers; and                                

-     the experience of the investment advisory and other personnel 
         providing services to the Funds and the historical quality of the
services provided by Calamos Advisors.                  

The trustees considered the following as relevant to their          
recommendations: (1) the favorable history, reputation, qualification,          
investment process and background of Calamos                                    

34

P-->49737th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�37th
Advisors, as well as the qualifications of its personnel, resources available   
and its financial condition; (2) the magnitude of Calamos Advisors' fees and the
expense ratio of each Fund in relation to the nature and quality of services    
expected to be provided and the fees and expense ratios of comparable investment
companies; (3) the performance of each fund in relation to the results of other 
comparable investment companies managed by other advisers and unmanaged indices 
over various periods; (4) the ability of Calamos Advisors to receive research   
products and services from brokers in connection with brokerage transactions    
executed for the Funds and other accounts managed by Calamos Advisors; (5) the  
profitability of Calamos Advisors' relationship with the Funds; and (6) other   
factors that the trustees deemed relevant. The trustees deemed each of these    
factors to be relevant to their consideration of the Agreement, and concluded   
that the terms of the Agreement and the services to be provided were reasonable 
and appropriate, and that renewal of the Agreement was in the best interests of 
the Funds. The Agreement may be terminated as to a Fund at any time, without    
penalty, by either the Trust or Calamos Advisors upon 60 days' written notice,  
and is automatically terminated in the event of its assignment as defined in the
Investment Company Act of 1940.                                                 

      The use of the name "Calamos" in the name of the Trust and in the names of
the Funds are pursuant to licenses granted by Calamos Advisors, and the Trust   
has agreed to change the names to remove those references if Calamos Advisors   
ceases to act as investment adviser to the Funds.                               

As of March 30, 2004, the Trust and Calamos Advisors entered into a 
Financial Accounting Services Agreement pursuant to which Calamos Advisors shall
provide the following financial accounting services to the Funds: management of 
expenses and expense payment processing; monitor the calculation of expense     
accrual amounts for any Fund and make any necessary modifications; coordinate   
any expense reimbursement calculations and payment; calculate yields on the     
Funds in accordance with rules and regulations of the SEC; calculate net        
investment income dividends and capital gains distributions; calculate track and
report tax adjustments on all assets of each Fund, including but not limited to 
contingent debt and preferred trust obligations; prepare excise tax and fiscal  
year distributions schedules; prepare tax information required for financial    
statement footnotes; prepare state and federal income tax returns; prepare      
specialized calculations of amortization on convertible securities; prepare     
year-end dividend disclosure information; monitor trustee deferred compensation 
plan accruals and valuations; and prepare Form 1099 information statements for  
the trustees and service providers.                                             

    For providing those financial accounting services, Calamos Advisors will
receive a fee payable monthly at the annual rate of 0.0175% on the first $1     
billion of combined assets of the Funds (the "Combined Assets"); 0.0150% on the 
next $1 billion of Combined Assets; and 0.0110% on Combined Assets above $2     
billion ("financial accounting service fee"). Each Fund will pay its pro rata   
share of the financial accounting service fee payable to Calamos Advisors based 
on relative net assets of each Fund.                                            

EXPENSES 

 Subject to the expense limitations described below, the Funds pay all
their own operating expenses that are not specifically assumed by Calamos       
Advisors, including (i) fees of the investment adviser; (ii) interest, taxes and
any governmental filing fees; (iii) compensation and                            

35

P-->49738th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�38th
expenses of the trustees, other than those who are interested persons of the    
Trust, the investment adviser or the distributor; (iv) legal, audit, custodial  
and transfer agency fees and expenses; (v) fees and expenses related to the     
organization of the Funds and registration and qualification of the Funds and   
their shares under federal and state securities laws; (vi) expenses of printing 
and mailing reports, notices and proxy material to shareholders, and expenses   
incidental to meetings of shareholders; (vii) expenses of preparing prospectuses
and of printing and distributing them to existing shareholders; (viii) insurance
premiums; (ix) litigation and indemnification expenses and other extraordinary  
expenses not incurred in the normal course of the business of the Trust; (x)    
distribution expenses pursuant to the Funds' Distribution Plans; and (xi)       
brokerage commissions and other transaction-related costs.                      

Calamos Advisors has contractually undertaken to limit the annual   
operating expenses of each class of shares of each Fund through August 31, 2005 
in excess of certain limits as described in the prospectus under " - Who Manages
the Funds?"

DISTRIBUTION PLAN 

    The Trust has adopted a plan pursuant to rule 12b-1 under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 (the "Plan"), whereby Class A shares, Class B shares and    
Class C shares of each Fund pay to CFS, service and distribution fees as        
described in the prospectus.                                                    

    The board of trustees of the Trust has determined that a continuous cash
flow resulting from the sale of new Class A shares, Class B shares and Class C  
shares is necessary and appropriate to meet redemptions and to take advantage of
buying opportunities without having to make unwarranted liquidations of         
portfolio securities. The board also considered that continuing growth in the   
size of the Funds would be in the best interests of shareholders because        
increased size would allow the Funds to realize certain economies of scale in   
their operations and would likely reduce the proportionate share of expenses    
borne by each shareholder. The board of trustees therefore determined that it   
would benefit each of the Funds to have monies available for the direct         
distribution and service activities of CFS, as the Funds' distributor, in       
promoting the continuous sale of the Funds' shares. The board of trustees,      
including the non-interested trustees, concluded, in the exercise of their      
reasonable business judgment and in light of their fiduciary duties, that there 
is a reasonable likelihood that the Plans will benefit the Funds and their      
shareholders.                                                                   

     The Plan has been approved by the board of trustees, including all of the
trustees who are non-interested persons as defined in the Investment Company Act
of 1940. The substance of the Plan has also been approved by the vote of a      
majority of the outstanding shares of each of the Funds. The Plan must be       
reviewed annually and may be continued from year to year by vote of the board of
trustees, including a majority of the trustees who are non-interested persons of
the Funds and who have no direct or indirect financial interest in the operation
of the Plan ("non-interested trustees"), cast in person at a meeting called for 
that purpose. It is also required that the selection and nomination of          
non-interested trustees be done by non-interested trustees. The Plan may be     
terminated at any time, without any penalty, by such trustees, by any act that  
terminates the distribution agreement between the Trust and CFS, or, as to any  
Fund, by vote of a majority of that Fund's outstanding shares.                  

36

P-->49739th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�39th
   The Plan may not be amended to increase materially the amount spent for
distribution or service expenses or in any other material way without approval  
by a majority of the outstanding shares of the affected Fund, and all such      
material amendments to the Plan must also be approved by the non-interested     
trustees, in person, at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on any such  
amendment.                                                                      

  CFS is required to report in writing to the board of trustees at least
quarterly on the amounts and purpose of any payments made under the Plan and any
distribution or service agreement, as well as to furnish the board with such    
other information as may reasonably be requested to enable the board to make an 
informed determination of whether the Plan should be continued.                 

      During the period ended March 31, 2004, each of the Funds made payments to
CFS pursuant to the Plan in the following amounts:

 OTHER COMPENSATION TO DEALERS

CFS or its affiliates, at its expense, currently provides additional
compensation to certain investment dealers, banks or other intermediaries,      
including third party administrators of qualified plans ("Intermediaries").     
These payments may be made, at the discretion of CFS or its affiliates, to      
Intermediaries who have sold shares of the Funds. The level of payments made to 
a qualifying Intermediary in any given year will vary and in no case would      
exceed the sum of (a) 0.25% of the prior twelve month period's fund sales by    
that Intermediary and (b) 0.12% of assets attributable to that Intermediary. A  
number of factors will be considered in determining payments, including the     
qualifying Intermediary's sales, assets and redemption rates and, the quality of
the Intermediary's relationship with CFS or its affiliates. CFS or its          
affiliates makes these payments to help defray the costs incurred by qualifying 
Intermediaries in connection with efforts to educate financial advisers about   
the Funds so they can make recommendations and provide services that are        
suitable and meet shareholder needs. CFS or its affiliates will, on an annual   
basis, determine the advisability of continuing these payments. CFS or its      
affiliates may also pay expenses associated with meetings that facilitate       
educating financial advisers and shareholders about the Funds that are conducted
by Intermediaries.                                                              

As of June 30, 2004, the Intermediaries that CFS and its affiliates 
anticipate will receive additional compensation include: A.G. Edwards & Sons,   
Inc., Capital Analyst Inc., Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith    
Incorporated, National Financial Services, Raymond James & Associates, Security 
Benefit Life and UBS PaineWebber.

      Purchases and redemptions are discussed in the Funds' prospectus under the
headings "How Can I Buy Shares?" and "How Can I Sell Shares?" All of that       
information is incorporated herein by reference.                                

You may purchase or redeem shares of the Funds through certain      
Intermediaries. These Intermediaries may charge for their services. Any such    
charges could constitute a substantial portion of a smaller account, and may not
be in your best interest. You may purchase or redeem shares of the Funds        
directly from or with the Trust without any charges other than those described  
in the prospectus.                                                              

   An Intermediary, who accepts orders that are processed at the net asset
value next determined after receipt of the order by the Intermediary, accepts   
such orders as agent of the Trust. The Intermediary is required to segregate any
orders received on a business day after the close of regular session trading on 
the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") and transmit those orders separately   
for execution at the net asset value next determined after that business day. It
is the responsibility of the Intermediary to transmit purchase orders and       
redemption requests received by them to U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC so they 
will be received in a timely manner.                                            

HOW TO PURCHASE SHARES 

  Shares of the Funds are sold through selected broker-dealers and banks
that have signed agreements with CFS, or may be purchased by check or wire as   
described below. The minimum initial investment by a shareholder in each Fund is
$1,000, except for Market Neutral Fund which is $10,000. For certain qualified  
retirement plans, such as individual retirement accounts, the minimum initial   
investment is $500. The minimum subsequent investment in any Fund is $50 or     
more. Each Fund reserves the right to waive or reduce the minimum initial or    
subsequent investment requirement for any omnibus account of any intermediary   
with whom Calamos Advisors has entered into an agreement, including without     
limitation, profit sharing or pension plans, Section 401(k) plans, Section      
403(b)(7) plans in the case of employees of public school systems and certain   
non-profit organizations, and certain other qualified retirement plans. Each    
Fund reserves the right to reject any order for the purchase of its shares in   
whole or in part, and to suspend the sale of its shares to the public in        
response to conditions in the securities markets or otherwise. Each purchase of 
shares is confirmed by a written statement mailed to the shareholder, without   
issuance of share certificates.                                                 

In addition, the Funds are required to comply with various federal  
anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Consequently, the Funds will request
the following information from all investors: full name, date of birth, Social  
Security number, and permanent street address. Corporate, trust, and other      
entity accounts require additional documentation. The Funds will use this       
information to verify your identity. The Funds will return your application if  
any of this information is missing, and may request additional information from 
you to assist in verifying your identity. In the event that the Funds are unable
to verify your identity, they reserve the right to redeem your account at the   
current day's net asset value. A Fund may be required to "freeze" the account of
a shareholder if the shareholder appears to be involved in suspicious activity  
or if certain account information matches information on government lists of    
known terrorists or other

suspicious persons, or the Fund may be required to transfer the account or      
proceeds of the account to a government agency.                                 

OFFERING PRICE 

     Class A shares of each Fund are sold to investors at net asset value plus
a sales charge, which may be reduced or waived as described below. Class B      
shares are sold without an initial sales charge but are subject to higher       
ongoing expenses than Class A shares of the same Fund, and a contingent deferred
sales charge payable upon certain redemptions. Class C shares of each Fund are  
sold without an initial sales charge but are subject to higher ongoing expenses 
than Class A shares of the same Fund. When placing an order, you must specify   
whether the order is for Class A, Class B or Class C shares.                    

     The differences between Class A shares, Class B shares and Class C shares
lie primarily in their initial and contingent deferred sales charge structures  
and in their asset-based sales charges in the form of Rule 12b-1 distribution   
fees. These differences are summarized in the table below. See also "Expenses"  
and "How to Redeem Shares." Each class has distinct advantages and disadvantages
for different investors, and you may choose the class that best suits your      
circumstances and objectives.

 CFS from its own resources at the time of investment. Annual 12b-1 fees are

  is for administrative services and the balance is for distribution services.

  The sales charges on sales of Class A shares of each Fund (except when
waived as described below under "How to Purchase Shares - Sales Charge Waiver") 
are as follows:

*  On an investment of $1 million or more, CFS from its own resources pays      
the selling dealer a commission of .50% of the amount of the investment.  
If you purchase such shares without a sales charge (other than by         
reinvestment of dividends or distributions) and redeem them within two    
years, a contingent deferred sales charge will be imposed at the rate of  
1% on shares redeemed within one year after purchase, and, if you         
purchased shares after July 31, 2001, .50% on shares redeemed during the  
second year after purchase, determined on a first-in, first-out basis.    
However, CFS will waive the contingent deferred sales charge in the event 
that the selling dealer waives the .50% commission to which the dealer is 
entitled. Accordingly, if you are not charged an upfront sales charge or a
contingent deferred sales charge, the selling dealer will not receive a   
commission or finder's fee.                                               

      Each Fund receives the entire net asset value of all of its Class A shares
sold. CFS, the Funds' principal underwriter, retains the sales charge on sales  
of Class A shares from which it allows discounts from the applicable public     
offering price to investment dealers. The normal discount to dealers is set     
forth in the above table. Upon notice to all dealers with whom it has sales     
agreements, CFS may allow up to the full applicable sales charge, as shown in   
the above table, during periods and for transactions specified in such notice   
and such reallowances may be based upon attainment of minimum sales levels.     
Dealers who receive 90% or more of the sales charge may be deemed to be         
underwriters under the Securities Act of 1933. CFS retains the entire amount of 
any deferred sales charge on Class C shares redeemed within one year of         
purchase. CFS may from time to time conduct promotional campaigns in which      
incentives would be offered to dealers meeting or exceeding stated target sales 
of shares of a Fund. The cost of any such promotional campaign, including any   
incentives offered, would be borne entirely by CFS and would have no effect on  
either the public offering price of Fund shares or the percentage of the public 
offering price retained by the selling dealer.                                  

      CFS compensates firms for sales of Class B shares at the time of sale at a
commission rate of up to 4.00% of the amount of Class B shares purchased. CFS is
compensated by each Fund for services as distributor and principal underwriter  
for Class B shares. Class B shares of a Fund will automatically convert to Class
A shares of the same Fund eight years after issuance on the basis of the        
relative net asset value per share. The purpose of the conversion feature is to 
relieve holders of Class B shares from the 12b-1 fee when they have been        
outstanding long enough for CFS to have been compensated for distribution       
related expenses. For purposes of conversion to Class A shares, shares purchased
through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions paid with respect 
to Class B shares in a shareholder's Fund account will be converted to Class A  
shares on a pro rata basis.                                                     

WHICH CLASS OF SHARES SHOULD YOU PURCHASE?                                      

     The decision as to which class of shares you should purchase depends on a
number of factors, including the amount and intended length of the investment.  
Investors making investments that qualify for reduced sales charges might       
consider Class A shares. Investors who prefer not to pay an initial sales charge
and who plan to hold their investment for more than eight years might consider  
Class B shares. Investors who prefer not to pay an initial sales charge but who 
plan to redeem their shares within eight years might consider Class C shares. No
order for Class B shares of any Fund may exceed $100,000 and no order for Class 
C shares of any Fund may exceed $1,000,000. For more information about the three
share classes, consult your financial representative or the call us toll free at
(800) 823-7386. Financial services firms may receive different compensation     
depending upon which class of shares they sell.

  You may also purchase shares by wiring funds from your bank. To insure
proper credit to your account, please call the Funds at (800) 823-7386 before   
sending your wire. The wire should be sent to U.S. Bank, N.A.; ABA #075000022;  
for U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC, P.O. Box 701, Milwaukee, WI 53201, bank    
account no. 112-952-137; FBO Calamos [fund name] Fund; [shareholder name and    
account number]. The applicable offering price for a purchase by wire is the    
offering price per share next determined after receipt of the wired funds.      
Receipt of a wire could be delayed by delays on the Federal Reserve wire system.
After you have wired funds, you must complete the application form and send it  
to CFS. A Fund will not honor redemption requests until the completed           
application has been received, and failure to submit a completed application may
result in backup withholding as required by the Code.                           

PURCHASES BY MAIL 

    You may also purchase shares of a Fund by sending a check payable to the
Fund, along with information identifying you and your account number to the     
Fund's transfer agent: U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC, P.O. Box 701, Milwaukee,
WI 53201. An initial investment made by check must be accompanied by a completed
application. A subsequent investment may be made by detaching the stub from your
account statement and sending it with your check in the envelope provided with  
your statement. All checks must be drawn on a U.S. bank in U.S. funds. A check  
written by a third party will not be accepted. A charge ($25 minimum) may be    
imposed if any check submitted for investment does not clear. If you purchase   
shares by check, you will not be able to redeem the shares until the check has  
been collected, which may take 15 days.                                         

PURCHASES BY TELEPHONE                                                          

    You may purchase shares of a Fund by telephone once you have established
an account. Complete information regarding the telephone purchase privilege is  
included in the prospectus under "How Can I buy Shares?"

PURCHASES BY EXCHANGE 

    Effective June 1, 2004, you may purchase shares of a Fund by exchange of
shares from another Fund or by exchange of shares of Prime Obligations Fund, a  
portfolio of First American Funds (such shares are referred to as "Prime        
Obligations Shares") either by mail or by instructing your broker-dealer or     
other sales agent, who will communicate your order to the Trust's transfer      
agent. If you have a brokerage account with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &     
Smith Incorporated ("Merrill Lynch") that holds shares of Summit Cash Reserves  
Fund, a series of Financial Institution Series Trust (such shares are referred  
to as "Summit Fund Shares"), and the Summit Fund Shares were purchased by       
exchange from a Fund, you may purchase shares of a Fund through your Merrill    
Lynch broker by exchange of Summit Fund Shares. See "How to Redeem Shares -     
Redemption by Exchange." No sales charge is imposed on purchases of Class A     
shares by exchange of Class A shares from another Fund or by exchange of Prime  
Obligations Shares or Summit Fund Shares, previously purchased through use of   
the exchange privilege. Please review the information under "How to Redeem
Shares - Redemption by Exchange."

SALES CHARGE WAIVER 

 In addition to the sales charge waivers enumerated in the prospectus,
dividends and distributions paid on shares of a Fund will be reinvested in      
shares of the same class of that Fund at net asset value (without the payment of
any sales charge) unless you elect to receive dividends and distributions in    
cash. Additionally, proceeds of shares redeemed by a Fund within the previous 60
days also may be reinvested in shares of the same class of that Fund at net     
asset value without the payment of any sales charge.                            

RIGHTS OF ACCUMULATION                                                          

 The sales charges described above also apply on a cumulative basis to
Class A shares of the Funds and any other series of the Trust as to which a     
sales charge applies, and over any period of time. You may combine the value at 
the current public offering price of Class A, B and C shares of any fund already
owned with a new purchase of Class A shares of any fund to reduce the sales     
charge on the new purchase. To receive the cumulative quantity reduction, you   
must give CFS or your dealer notification of the prior purchases at the time of 
the current purchase.                                                           

    For purposes of determining which purchases may be combined to determine
the sales charge rate, you and your spouse can add together shares you purchase 
for your individual accounts (including IRAs and 403(b) plans), or for your     
joint accounts, or for trust or custodial accounts on behalf of your children   
under the age of 21. In addition, a fiduciary can count all shares purchased for
a trust, estate or other fiduciary account (including one or more employee      
benefit plans of the same employer) that has multiple accounts.                 

The Funds receive purchase orders through a variety of distribution 
channels, including financial intermediaries and cannot always identify accounts
that should be combined for purposes of assessing the amount of a sales charge. 
When you buy shares, be sure to specify to your intermediary any other accounts 
that may entitle you to a reduced sales charge.                                 

LETTER OF INTENT                                                                

      You may reduce the sales charges you pay on the purchase of Class A shares
by making investments pursuant to a letter of intent. The applicable sales      
charge then is based upon the indicated amount intended to be invested during a 
thirteen-month period in shares of the Funds as to which a sales charge would be
imposed and any other series of the Trust. You may compute the thirteen-month   
period starting up to ninety days before the date of execution of the letter of 
intent. Your initial investment must be at least 5% of the amount your letter of
intent indicates you intend to invest. Each investment made during the period   
receives the reduced sales charge applicable to the total amount of the intended
investment. During the term of the letter of intent, shares representing 5% of  
the indicated amount will be held in escrow. Shares held in escrow have full    
dividend and voting privileges. The escrowed shares will be released when the   
full amount indicated has been purchased. If the full indicated amount is not   
purchased during the term of the letter of intent, you will be required to pay  
CFS an amount equal to the difference between the dollar amount of the sales    
charges actually paid and the amount of the sales charges that you would have   
paid on your aggregate purchase if the total of such purchases

had been made at a single time, and CFS reserves the right to redeem shares from
your account if necessary to satisfy that obligation. A letter of intent does   
not obligate you to buy or a Fund to sell the indicated amount of the shares but
you should read it carefully before signing. Additional information is contained
in the letter of intent included in the application.                            

HOW TO REDEEM SHARES 

  Shares of the Funds will be redeemed at the respective net asset value
next determined after receipt of a redemption request in good form on any day   
the NYSE is open for trading. Requests received after the time for computation  
of a Fund's net asset value for that day will be processed the next business    
day.                                                                            

     If Class C shares, or Class A shares for which the initial purchase price
was $1 million or more, on which no initial sales charge was imposed are        
redeemed within one year after purchase (other than by reinvestment of dividends
or distributions), determined on a first-in, first-out basis, a contingent      
deferred sales charge of 1% of the purchase price will be imposed. A contingent 
deferred sales charge of .50% of the purchase price will be imposed on the      
redemption during the second year after purchase of Class A shares, where the   
initial purchase price was $1 million or more.                                  

REDEMPTION FEE ON SHARES HELD FIVE DAYS OR LESS 

     A redemption of shares of a Fund (except shares purchased with reinvested
dividends or distributions) held for five days or less may be subject to a      
redemption fee of 2% of the redemption proceeds that will be deducted from those
proceeds. The redemption fee is paid to the Fund and is intended to deter       
short-term trading. The redemption fee is also intended to offset portfolio     
transaction costs, market impact, and other costs associated with short-term    
trading. If the shares redeemed were purchased on different days, the shares    
held shortest will be redeemed first for purposes of determining whether the    
redemption fee applies.                                                         

For shares held through an Intermediary, the redemption fee will be 
charged in generally the same manner as for shares held directly with a Fund.   
However, due to operational requirements and/or limitations, certain            
Intermediaries' methods for tracking and calculating the fee may differ in some 
respects from those of the Funds. In addition, certain Intermediaries may not   
presently possess the operational capabilities to charge the fee. In those      
instances, a fee may not be able to be applied. The Funds cannot always monitor 
the imposition of redemption fees on shares that are purchased through          
Intermediaries or held in omnibus accounts. If you purchased shares through an  
Intermediary, you should contact the Intermediary for information on how the    
redemption fee may be applied to your shares.                                   

      Each Fund reserves the right to waive the redemption fee at its discretion
where such waiver is believed not to materially harm the Fund and is consistent 
with the Fund's efforts to deter abusive short-term trading. The Funds reserve  
the right to modify or eliminate the redemption fee or waivers at any time.

CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE--CLASS B SHARES                                

      A contingent deferred sales charge may be imposed upon redemption of Class
B shares. There is no such charge upon redemption of any share appreciation or  
reinvested dividends on Class B shares. The charge is computed at the following 
rates based on the lesser of the redemption price or purchase price excluding   
amounts not subject to the charge.                                              

                                                                [Download Table]

    The contingent deferred sales charge for Class B and Class C shares will
be waived: (a) in the event of the total disability (as evidenced by a          
determination by the Social Security Administration) of the shareholder         
(including a registered joint owner) occurring after the purchase of the shares 
being redeemed, (b) in the event of the death of the shareholder (including a   
registered joint owner), (c) for redemptions made pursuant to a systematic      
withdrawal plan (see "Systematic Withdrawal Plan" below), (d) for redemptions   
made pursuant to any IRA systematic withdrawal based on the shareholder's life  
expectancy including, but not limited to, substantially equal periodic payments 
described in Code Section 72(t)(2)(iv) prior to age 59-1/2 and (e) for          
redemptions to satisfy required minimum distributions after age 70-1/2 from an  
IRA account (with the maximum amount subject to this waiver being based only    
upon the shareholder's Calamos IRA accounts).                                   

CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE - GENERAL INFORMATION.                         

     The following example illustrates the operation of the Class B contingent
deferred sales charge:                                                          

      Assume that an individual opens an account and makes a purchase payment of
      $10,000 for 1,000 Class B shares of a Fund (at $10 per share) and that six
    months later the value of the investor's account for that Fund has grown
      through investment performance to $11,000 ($11 per share). If the investor
 should redeem $2,200 (200 shares), a contingent deferred sales charge
    would be applied against $2,000 of the redemption (the purchase price of
     the shares redeemed, because the purchase price is lower than the current
    net asset value of such shares ($2,200)). At the rate of 5%, the Class B
contingent deferred sales charge would be $100.                     

REDEMPTION BY MAIL 

     A written request for redemption must be received by the Trust's transfer
agent at its address shown under "Purchases by Mail" above to constitute a valid
redemption request.                                                             

Your redemption request must:                                       

44

P-->49747th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�47th
1.    specify the Fund, your account number and the number of shares or dollar  
amount to be redeemed, if less than all shares are to be redeemed;  

2.    be signed by all owners exactly as their names appear on the account; and 

3.    include a signature guarantee for each signature on the redemption request
    by CFS, by a securities firm that is a member of the NYSE, or by a bank,
    savings bank, credit union, savings and loan association or other entity
that is authorized by applicable state law to guarantee signatures. 

    In the case of shares held by a corporation, the redemption request must
be signed in the name of the corporation by an officer whose title must be      
stated, and a certified bylaw provision or resolution of the board of directors 
authorizing the officer to so act may be required. In the case of a trust or    
partnership, the signature must include the name of the registered shareholder  
and the title of the person signing on its behalf. Under certain circumstances, 
before shares can be redeemed, additional documents may be required in order to 
verify the authority of the person seeking to redeem.                           

REDEMPTION BY WIRE OR TELEPHONE                                                 

     Broker-dealers or other sales agents may communicate redemption orders by
wire or telephone to the Trust's transfer agent. These firms may charge for     
their services in connection with your redemption request but the Funds do not  
impose any such charges. Additionally, if your shares are held for you by the   
Trust's transfer agent, you may redeem up to $50,000 worth of shares by         
telephone, as described in the prospectus under "How Can I Sell Shares?"
EXPEDITED REDEMPTION                                                            

      Unless share certificates have been issued to you, you may have redemption
proceeds of at least $5,000 wired directly to a domestic commercial bank account
or brokerage account that you have previously designated. Normally, such        
payments will be transmitted no later than the second business day following    
receipt of your redemption request (provided redemptions may be made under the  
general criteria set forth below). A $15 service charge for payment of          
redemption proceeds by wire will be deducted from the proceeds.                 

REDEMPTION BY EXCHANGE 

  You may redeem all or any portion of your shares of a Fund and use the
proceeds to purchase shares of any of the other Funds or Prime Obligations      
Shares (or Summit Fund Shares if your Fund shares are held in a brokerage       
account with Merrill Lynch and Merrill Lynch has commenced offering the exchange
program for Summit Fund Shares) if your signed, properly completed application  
is on file. AN EXCHANGE TRANSACTION IS A SALE AND PURCHASE OF SHARES FOR FEDERAL
INCOME TAX PURPOSES AND MAY RESULT IN CAPITAL GAIN OR LOSS. Before exchanging   
into Prime Obligations Shares (or Summit Fund Shares), you should obtain the    
prospectus relating to those shares from the First American Funds (or from      
Merrill Lynch, in the case of Summit Fund Shares) and read it carefully. The    
exchange privilege is not an offering or recommendation of Prime Obligations    
Shares or Summit Fund Shares. If you should redeem (and not exchange) your Prime
Obligations Shares (or Summit Fund Shares), you would pay the applicable        

45

P-->49748th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�48th
contingent deferred sales charge percentage. The registration of the account to 
which you are making an exchange must be exactly the same as that of the account
from which the exchange is made and the amount you exchange must meet any       
applicable minimum investment of the fund being purchased. An exchange may be   
made by following the redemption procedure described above under "Redemption by
Mail" and indicating the fund to be purchased, except that a signature guarantee
normally is not required. An exchange may also be made by instructing your      
broker-dealer or other sales agent, who will communicate your instruction to    
CFS. No sales charge is imposed on purchases by exchange into the same class of 
shares.                                                                         

TRANSACTION RESTRICTIONS                                                        

      The Funds reserve the right to reject any order for the purchase of shares
in whole or in part for any reason, and to suspend the sale of shares to the    
public in response to conditions in the securities markets or otherwise. The    
Funds are intended for long-term investment purposes only, and discourage       
short-term or excessive trading practices. These practices may disrupt portfolio
management strategies and may increase expenses, and thus harm fund performance.

     Each Fund may, in its discretion, suspend, and may permanently terminate,
the trading or exchange privileges of any investor who engages in trading       
activity that it believes would be disruptive to the Fund. Although each Fund   
will attempt to give prior notice of a suspension or termination of an exchange 
privilege when it is reasonably able to do so, the suspension or termination may
be effective immediately, thereby preventing any uncompleted exchange.          

     In addition, the Funds receive purchase and sale orders through financial
intermediaries and cannot always identify or reasonably detect short-term or    
excessive trading that may be facilitated by those intermediaries or by the use 
of omnibus accounts by those intermediaries. Omnibus accounts are comprised of  
multiple investors whose purchases and redemptions are aggregated and netted    
before being submitted to the Funds making it more difficult to locate and      
eliminate short-term or excessive trading. Certain intermediaries may not       
presently possess the same operational capabilities to track the number of      
purchase, redemption or exchange orders made by an individual investor as the   
Funds, or they may lack such capabilities entirely. Certain intermediaries may  
possess other capabilities to deter short-term or excessive trading upon which  
the Funds may rely. In general, the Funds cannot eliminate the possibility that 
short-term or excessive trading activity will occur in the Funds.               

 As noted above, the Funds reserve the right to reject or restrict any
purchase order (including exchanges) from any investor. To minimize harm to the 
Funds and their shareholders, the Funds may, at each Fund's sole discretion,    
exercise these rights if an investor has a history of excessive trading or if an
investor's trading, in the judgment of a Fund, has been or may be disruptive to 
such Fund. In making this judgment, a Fund may consider trading done in multiple
accounts under common ownership or control.                                     

GENERAL                                                                         

     A check for proceeds of a redemption will not be released until the check
used to purchase the shares has been collected, which is usually no more than 15
days after purchase. You may avoid this delay by purchasing shares through a    
wire transfer of funds. A Fund may                                              

46

suspend the right of redemption under certain extraordinary circumstances in    
accordance with the rules of the SEC. Due to the relatively high cost of        
handling small accounts, each Fund reserves the right upon 30 days' written     
notice to involuntarily redeem, at net asset value, the shares of any           
shareholder whose account has a value of less than $500, unless the reduction in
value to less than $500 was the result of market fluctuation. PLEASE TELEPHONE  
THE FUNDS IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT REQUIREMENTS FOR A REDEMPTION BEFORE  
SUBMITTING A REQUEST. YOU MAY NOT CANCEL OR REVOKE YOUR REDEMPTION REQUEST ONCE 
YOUR INSTRUCTIONS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED AND ACCEPTED.                              
SHAREHOLDER ACCOUNTS                                                            

    Each shareholder of a Fund receives quarterly account statements showing
transactions in shares of the Fund and with a balance denominated in Fund       
shares. A confirmation will be sent to the shareholder upon purchase,           
redemption, dividend reinvestment, or change of shareholder address (sent to the
former address).                                                                

RETIREMENT PLANS                                                                

You may use the Funds as investments for your Individual Retirement 
Account ("IRA"), profit sharing or pension plan, Section 40l(k) plan, Section   
403(b)(7) plan in the case of employees of public school systems and certain    
non-profit organizations, and certain other qualified plans. A master IRA plan  
and information regarding plan administration, fees, and other details are      
available from CFS and authorized broker-dealers.                               

SYSTEMATIC WITHDRAWAL PLAN 

     You may request that a Fund periodically redeem shares having a specified
redemption value and send you a check for the proceeds. In order to initiate the
Systematic Withdrawal Plan, call (800) 823-7386 and request a Systematic        
Withdrawal form. Your account must have a share balance of $25,000 or more.     
Withdrawal proceeds are likely to exceed dividends and distributions paid on    
shares in your account and therefore may deplete and eventually exhaust your    
account. The periodic payments are proceeds of redemption and are taxable as    
such. The maximum annual rate at which Class B shares may be redeemed (and Class
C shares in their first year following purchase and Class A shares purchased in 
amounts of $1,000,000 or more) under a systematic withdrawal plan is 10% of the 
net asset value of the account. Because a sales charge is imposed on purchases  
of shares of the Funds, you should not purchase shares while participating in   
the Systematic Withdrawal Plan. You may modify or terminate your Systematic     
Withdrawal Plan by written notice to the transfer agent at least seven business 
days prior to the start of the month in which the change is to be effective.    

AUTOMATIC BANK DRAFT PLAN                                                       

   If you own shares of a Fund, you may purchase additional shares of that
Fund through the Automatic Bank Draft Plan. Under the Plan, the Trust will      
automatically debit your bank checking account on a monthly or semi-monthly     
basis in an amount ($50 or more) specified by you and invest the specified      
amount in additional shares of the Fund. To obtain an Automatic Bank Draft Plan 
form, call (800) 823-7386. The Plan is not available to clients of service      
organizations that offer similar investment services.

EXCHANGE PRIVILEGE                                                              

 You may exchange shares of any Fund for shares of another Fund or for
Prime Obligations Shares (or for Summit Fund Shares if your Fund shares are held
in a brokerage account with Merrill Lynch) or exchange Prime Obligations Shares 
or Summit Fund Shares for shares of a Fund, without payment of any sales charge 
as described above under "How to Purchase Shares - Purchase by Exchange" and    
"How to Redeem Shares - Redemption by Exchange."
NET ASSET VALUE                                                                 

In computing the net asset value of each Fund, portfolio securities,
including options, that are traded on a national securities exchange are valued 
at the last reported sales price. Securities quoted on the NASDAQ National      
Market System are valued at the Nasdaq Official Closing Price ("NOCP"), as      
determined by Nasdaq, or lacking an NOCP, the last current reported sale price  
as of the time of valuation. Securities traded in the over-the-counter market   
and listed securities for which no sales were reported are valued at the mean of
the most recently quoted bid and asked prices. Each outstanding futures contract
is valued at the official settlement price for the contract on the exchange on  
which the contract is traded, except that if the market price of the contract   
has increased or decreased by the maximum amount permitted on the valuation date
("up or down the limit"), the contract is valued at a fair value as described   
below. Short-term securities with maturities of 60 days or less are valued at   
amortized cost which approximates market value.                                 

      When market prices are not readily available or when the valuation methods
mentioned above are not reflective of a fair value of the security, the security
is valued at a fair value following procedures approved by the board of         
trustees. These procedures may utilize valuations furnished by pricing services 
approved by the board of trustees, which include market transactions for        
comparable securities and various relationships between securities that are     
generally recognized by institutional traders, a computerized matrix system, or 
appraisals derived from information concerning the securities or similar        
securities received from recognized dealers in those securities.                

     The markets in which non-U.S. securities trade are sometimes open on days
when the NYSE is not open and the Funds do not calculate their net asset values,
and sometimes are not open on days when the Funds do calculate their net asset  
values. Even on days on which both the foreign market and the NYSE are open,    
several hours may have passed between the time when trading in the foreign      
market closed and the NYSE closes and the Funds calculate their net asset       
values. The Funds monitor for significant events that may affect the value of a 
foreign security. A Fund may price a non-U.S. security it holds at a fair value 
determined according to procedures, or a systematic fair valuation model        
provided by a third party adopted by the board of trustees if it appears that   
the value of the security has been materially affected by events occurring      
between the close of the primary market or exchange on which the security is    
traded and the time for computing net asset value.                              

    Each Fund's net asset value is determined only on days on which the NYSE
is open for trading. That Exchange is regularly closed on Saturdays and Sundays 
and on New Year's Day, the third Mondays in January and February, Good Friday,  
the last Monday in May, Independence                                            

48

Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas. If one of these holidays falls on a 
Saturday or Sunday, the NYSE will be closed on the preceding Friday or the      
following Monday, respectively.                                                 

    Securities that are principally traded in a foreign market are valued as
of the close of the appropriate exchange or other designated time. Trading in   
securities on European and Far Eastern securities exchanges and over-the-counter
markets is normally completed at various times before the close of business on  
each day on which the NYSE is open. Trading of these securities may not take    
place on every NYSE business day. In addition, trading may take place in various
foreign markets on Saturdays or on other days when the NYSE is not open and on  
which the Fund's net asset value is not calculated. Therefore, such calculation 
does not take place contemporaneously with the determination of the prices of   
many of the portfolio securities used in such calculation and the value of the  
Fund's portfolio may be significantly affected on days when shares of the Fund  
may not be purchased or redeemed.                                               

REDEMPTION IN KIND                                                              

    The Funds have elected to be governed by Rule 18f-1 under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 pursuant to which they are obligated to redeem shares solely
in cash up to the lesser of $250,000 or 1% of the net asset value of a Fund     
during any 90-day period for any one shareholder. Redemptions in excess of these
amounts will normally be paid in cash, but may be paid wholly or partly by a    
distribution in kind of securities.                                             

 PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

TOTAL RETURN 

      From time to time the Funds may quote total return figures. "Total Return"
for a period is the percentage change in value during a period of an investment 
in Fund shares, including the value of shares acquired through reinvestment of  
all dividends and capital gains distributions. "Average Annual Total Return" is 
the average annual compounded rate of change in value represented by the Total  
Return for the period.                                                          

Average Annual Total Return will be computed as follows:            

ERV           =    P(1+T)(n)                              

        Where:        P    =   a hypothetical initial investment of $1,000

      T    =   average annual total return

n    =   number of years      

                    ERV  =   ending redeemable value of a hypothetical
                                  $1,000 investment made at the beginning of the
                        period, at the end of the period (or
               fractional portion thereof)

  The Funds may also quote after-tax total returns to show the impact of
assumed federal income taxes on an investment in the Funds. The Funds' total    
return "after taxes on distributions" shows the effect of taxable distributions,
but not any taxable gain or loss, on an                                         

49

P-->49752nd�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�52nd
investment in shares of the Funds for a specified period of time. The Funds'    
total return "after taxes on distributions and sale of Fund shares" shows the   
effect of both taxable distributions and any taxable gain or loss realized by   
the shareholder upon the sale of fund shares at the end of a specified period.  
To determine these figures, all income, short-term capital gain distributions,  
and long-term capital gain distributions are assumed to have been taxed at the  
highest marginal individualized federal tax rate then in effect. Those maximum  
tax rates are applied to distributions prior to reinvestment and the after-tax  
portion is assumed to have been reinvested in the Fund. State and local taxes   
are ignored.                                                                    

    Actual after-tax returns depend on a shareholder's tax situation and may
differ from those shown. After-tax returns reflect past tax effects and are not 
predictive of future tax effects. Average Annual Total Return (After Taxes on   
Distributions) is computed as                                                   

follows:                                                                        

ATV(D)  = P(l+T)(n)                                               

Where: P = a hypothetical initial investment of $1,000                          

T = average annual total return (after taxes on distributions)    

n = number of years                                               

    ATV(D)  = ending value of a hypothetical $1,000 investment made at the
      beginning of the period, at the end of the period (or fractional portion
thereof), after taxes on fund distributions but not after taxes on
redemptions.                                                      

      Average Annual Total Return (After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of Fund
Shares) is computed as follows:                                                 

ATV(DR) = P(l+T)(n)                                             

Where:  P = a hypothetical initial investment of $1,000                         

 T = average annual total return (after taxes on distributions and
redemption)                                                     

n = number of years                                             

      ATV(DR) = ending value of a hypothetical $1,000 investment made at the
        beginning of the period, at the end of the period (or fractional portion
thereof), after taxes on fund distributions and redemption.     

YIELD                                                                           

    Each Fund other than Growth Fund, Blue Chip Fund and Value Fund may also
quote yield figures. The yield of a Fund is calculated by dividing its net      
investment income per share (a hypothetical figure as defined in SEC rules)     
during a 30-day period by the net asset value per share on the last day of the  
period. The yield formula provides for semiannual compounding, which assumes    
that net investment income is earned and reinvested at a constant rate and      
annualized at the end of a six-month period. The yield is not based on actual   
dividends paid.                                                                 

Yield will be computed as follows:                                  

YIELD =   2[((a-b/cd)+1)(6)-1]

Where: a =  dividends and interest earned during the period                     

b =  expenses accrued for the period (net of reimbursements)      

   c =  the average daily number of shares outstanding during the period
that were entitled to receive dividends         

     d =  the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period

    The annualized yields of Market Neutral Fund and High Yield Fund for the
30 days ended March 31, 2004 were as follows:

      The figures quoted assume reinvestment of all dividends and distributions.
Quotations of Average Annual Total Return take into account the effect of any   
sales charge on the amount available for investment or redemption; quotations of
Total Return will indicate whether or not the effect of the sales charge is     
included. The figures will not necessarily be indicative of future performance. 
The performance of a Fund is a result of conditions in the securities markets,  
portfolio management, and operating expenses. Although information such as yield
and total return is useful in reviewing a Fund's performance and in providing   
some basis for comparison with other investment alternatives, it should not be  
used for comparison with other investments using different reinvestment         
assumptions or time periods.                                                    

 DISTRIBUTOR

     CFS, a broker-dealer, serves as principal underwriter and distributor for
the Funds, subject to change by a majority of the "non-interested" trustees at  
any time. CFS is located at 1111 East Warrenville Road, Naperville, Illinois
60563-1493. CFS is an indirect subsidiary of Calamos Asset Management, Inc. CFS 
is responsible for all purchases, sales, redemptions and other transfers of     
shares of the Funds without any charge to the Funds except the fees paid to CFS 
under the Distribution Plans and distribution agreement. CFS is also responsible
for all expenses incurred in connection with its performance of services for the
Funds, including, but not limited to, personnel, office space and equipment,    
telephone, postage and stationery expenses. CFS receives commissions from sales 
of shares of the Funds that are not expenses of the Funds but represent sales   
commissions added to the net asset value of shares purchased from the Funds. See
"How to Purchase Shares -- Offering Price" in the prospectus. CFS also receives 
brokerage commissions for executing portfolio transactions for the Funds. See   
"Portfolio Transactions." CFS received and retained commissions on the sale of  
shares of each of the Funds as shown below during the indicated periods:

 CFS has the exclusive right to distribute shares of the Funds through
affiliated and unaffiliated dealers. The obligation of CFS is an agency or "best
efforts" arrangement, which does not obligate CFS to sell any stated number of  
shares.                                                                         

In connection with the exchange privilege, CFS acts as a service    
organization for the Prime Obligations Fund, which is a portfolio of First      
American Funds.                                                                 

PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS

     Portfolio transactions on behalf of the Funds effected on stock exchanges
involve the payment of negotiated brokerage commissions. There is generally no  
stated commission in the case of securities traded in the over-the-counter      
markets, but the price paid by the Funds usually includes an undisclosed dealer 
commission or mark-up. In underwritten offerings, the price paid by the Funds   
includes a disclosed, fixed commission or discount retained by the underwriter  
or dealer.

In executing portfolio transactions, Calamos Advisors uses its best 
efforts to obtain for the Funds the most favorable combination of price and     
execution available. In seeking the most favorable combination of price and     
execution, Calamos Advisors considers all factors it deems relevant, including  
price, the size of the transaction, the nature of the market for the security,  
the amount of commission, the timing of the transaction taking into account     
market prices and trends, the execution capability of the broker-dealer and the 
quality of service rendered by the broker-dealer in other transactions.         

      The trustees have determined that portfolio transactions for the Funds may
be executed through CFS if, in the judgment of Calamos Advisors, the use of CFS 
is likely to result in prices and execution at least as favorable to the Funds  
as those available from other qualified brokers and if, in such transactions,   
CFS charges the Funds commission rates consistent with those charged by CFS to  
comparable unaffiliated customers in similar transactions. The board of         
trustees, including a majority of the trustees who are not "interested"         
trustees, has adopted procedures that are reasonably designed to provide that   
any commissions, fees or other remuneration paid to CFS are consistent with the 
foregoing standard. The Funds will not effect principal transactions with CFS.  

     In allocating the Funds' portfolio brokerage transactions to unaffiliated
broker-dealers, Calamos Advisors may take into consideration the research,      
analytical, statistical and other information and services provided by the      
broker-dealer, such as general economic reports and information, reports or     
analyses of particular companies or industry groups, market timing and technical
information, and the availability of the brokerage firm's analysts for          
consultation. Although Calamos Advisors believes these services have substantial
value, they are considered supplemental to Calamos Advisors' own efforts in the 
performance of its duties under the management agreement. As permitted by       
Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("1934 Act"), Calamos      
Advisors may pay a broker-dealer that provides brokerage and research services  
an amount of commission for effecting a securities transaction for a Fund in    
excess of the commission that another broker-dealer would have charged for      
effecting that transaction if the amount is believed by Calamos Advisors to be  
reasonable in relation to the value of the overall quality of the brokerage and 
research services provided. Other clients of Calamos Advisors may indirectly    
benefit from the availability of these services to Calamos Advisors, and the    
Funds may indirectly benefit from services available to Calamos Advisors as a   
result of transactions for other clients.                                       

     In certain cases, Calamos Advisors may obtain products or services from a
broker that have both research and non-research uses. Examples of non-research  
uses are administrative and marketing functions. These are referred to as "mixed
use" products. In each case, Calamos Advisors makes a good faith effort to      
determine the proportion of such products or services that may be used for      
research and non-research purposes. That determination is based upon the time   
spent by Calamos Advisors personnel for research and non-research uses. The     
portion of the costs of such products or services attributable to research usage
may be defrayed by Calamos Advisors through brokerage commissions generated by  
transactions of its clients, including the Funds. Calamos Advisors pays the     
provider in cash for the non-research portion of its use of these products or   
services.

TAXATION

   The following is only a summary of certain tax considerations affecting
the Funds and their shareholders. No attempt is made to present a detailed      
explanation of the tax treatment of the Funds or their shareholders, and the    
discussion here is not intended as a substitute for careful tax planning.       
Investors are urged to consult their tax advisers with specific reference to    
their own tax situations.                                                       

At the time of your purchase, a Fund's net asset value may reflect  
undistributed income, capital gains, or net unrealized appreciation of          
securities held by that Fund. A subsequent distribution to you of such amounts, 
although constituting a return of your investment, would be taxable either as a 
dividend or capital gain distribution.                                          

     Some of the Funds' investment practices are subject to special provisions
of the Code that, among other things, may (i) disallow, suspend or otherwise    
limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, (ii) convert lower taxed   
long-term capital gain into higher taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary    
income, (iii) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the  
deductibility of which is more limited) and/or (iv) cause a Fund to recognize   
income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash with which to make       
distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement  
and the distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise taxes. The     
Funds will monitor their transactions and may make certain tax elections to     
mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent disqualification of the Funds as 
a regulated investment companies.                                               

A Fund is permitted to invest in securities issued or purchased at a
discount. Tax rules could require a Fund to accrue and distribute income not yet
received. Depending upon particular circumstances, this treatment may also      
affect the tax character and amount of income required to be recognized by the  
Fund holding the security. A Fund could be required to sell securities in its   
portfolio that it otherwise might have continued to hold in order to generate   
sufficient cash to make these distributions.                                    

    Foreign currency gains and losses, including the portion of gain or loss
on the sale of debt securities attributable to foreign exchange rate            
fluctuations, are taxable as ordinary income. If the net effect to a Fund of    
those transactions is a gain, the income dividend paid by the Fund will be      
increased; if the result is a loss, the income dividend paid will be decreased. 

   Income received by a Fund from sources within various foreign countries
will be subject to foreign income taxes withheld at the source. Under the Code, 
if more than 50% of the value of a Fund's total assets at the close of its      
taxable year comprises securities issued by foreign corporations, the Fund may  
file an election with the Internal Revenue Service to "pass through" to its     
shareholders the amount of foreign income taxes paid by that Fund. Pursuant to  
that election, shareholders would be required to: (i) include in gross income,  
even though not actually received, their respective pro rata share of foreign   
taxes paid by the Fund; (ii) treat their pro rata share of foreign taxes as paid
by them; and (iii) either deduct their pro rata share of foreign taxes in       
computing their taxable income, or use it as a foreign tax credit against U.S.  
income taxes (but not both). No deduction for foreign taxes may be claimed by a 
shareholder who does not itemize deductions.

QUALIFICATION AS A REGULATED INVESTMENT COMPANY                                 

   Each Fund intends to continue to qualify, and elect to be treated, as a
regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Code so as to be relieved
of federal income tax on its net investment income and capital gains that it    
currently distributes to shareholders.                                          

Each Fund must meet several requirements to maintain its status as a
regulated investment company. These requirements include the following: (1) at  
least 90% of the Fund's gross income must be derived from dividends, interest,  
payments with respect to securities loans, and gains from the sale or           
disposition of securities; and (2) at the close of each quarter of the Fund's   
taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the value of the Fund's total assets must     
consist of cash, U.S. Government securities, securities of other regulated      
investment companies, and other securities such that no more than 5% of the     
value of the Fund may consist of such other securities of any one issuer, and   
the Fund must not hold through such other securities more than 10% of the       
outstanding voting stock of any issuer, and (b) the Fund must not invest more   
than 25% of the value of its total assets in the securities of any one issuer   
(other than U.S. Government securities) or two or more issuers controlled by the
Fund and engaged in the same, similar, or related trades or businesses.         

EXCISE TAX ON REGULATED INVESTMENT COMPANIES                                    

  To avoid a 4% excise tax, each Fund will be required to distribute, by
December 31st of each year, at least an amount equal to the sum of (i) 98% of   
its ordinary income for such year and (ii) 98% of its capital gain net income   
(the latter of which generally is computed on the basis of the one-year period  
ending on October 31st of such year), plus any amounts that were not distributed
in previous taxable years. For purposes of the excise tax, a Fund will be       
treated as having distributed any ordinary income or capital gain net income    
retained by, and subject to federal income tax in the hands of, the Fund.       

ALLOCATION AMONG FUNDS

      The assets received by the Trust from the sale of shares of each Fund, and
all income, earnings, profits and proceeds thereof, subject only to the rights  
of creditors, are specifically allocated to that Fund, and constitute the       
underlying assets of that Fund. The underlying assets of each Fund are required 
to be segregated on the books of account, and are to be charged with the expense
in respect to that Fund and with a share of the general expenses of the Trust.  
Any general expenses of the Trust not readily identifiable as belonging to a    
particular Fund shall be allocated by or under the direction of the trustees in 
such manner as the trustees determine to be fair and equitable. Each share of   
each Fund represents an equal proportionate interest in that Fund with each     
other share and is entitled to such dividends and distributions out of the      
income belonging to that Fund as are declared by the trustees. Upon any         
liquidation of a Fund, shareholders thereof are entitled to share pro rata in   
the net assets belonging to that Fund available for distribution.

matters as the purchase and sale of securities by a Fund, payment of dividends  
or payment of expenses of a Fund.                                               

      U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC, P.O. Box 701, Milwaukee, WI 53201, serves
as transfer agent and dividend paying agent for each Fund.                      

 Shares of any of the Funds may be purchased through certain financial
service companies who are agents of the Funds for the limited purpose of        
completing purchases and sales. For services provided by such a company with    
respect to Fund shares held by that company for its customers, the company may  
charge the Fund a fee of up to $6 per account for Network Level III accounts.   
For all other accounts, $16 per account or 0.15% of the account's average net   
assets for Class A shares and $19 per account for Class B and Class C shares.   

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

     Ernst & Young LLP, Sears Tower, 233 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois
60606, audits and reports on the Funds' annual financial statements, reviews    
certain regulatory reports and the Funds' federal income tax returns, and       
performs other professional accounting, tax and advisory services when engaged  
to do so by the Funds.                                                          

 GENERAL INFORMATION
SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION                                                         

 Each Fund is a series of Calamos Investment Trust (formerly named CFS
Investment Trust). As of March 18, 1996, all shares of each Fund then           
outstanding were re-designated as Class A shares of that Fund. Under the terms  
of the Agreement and Declaration of Trust, the trustees may issue an unlimited  
number of shares of beneficial interest without par value for each series of    
shares authorized by the trustees and the trustees may divide the shares of any 
series into two or more classes of shares of that series. As of the date of this
Statement of Additional

Information, the Trust has eight series in operation. All shares issued will be 
fully paid and non-assessable and will have no preemptive or conversion rights. 
In the future, the board of trustees may authorize the issuance of shares of    
additional series and additional classes of shares of any series.               

    Each Fund's shares of a given class are entitled to participate pro rata
in any dividends and other distributions declared by the Fund's board of        
trustees with respect to shares of the Fund. All shares of the Fund of a given  
class have equal rights in the event of liquidation of that class.              

     Under Massachusetts law, the shareholders of the Trust may, under certain
circumstances, be held personally liable for the Trust's obligations. However,  
the Trust's Declaration of Trust disclaims liability of the shareholders,       
trustees, and officers of the Trust for acts or obligations of the Funds that   
are binding only on the assets and property of the Fund. The Declaration of     
Trust requires that notice of such disclaimer be given in each agreement,       
obligation, or contract entered into or executed by the Trust or the board of   
trustees. The Declaration of Trust provides for indemnification out of a Fund's 
assets of all losses and expenses of any Fund shareholder held personally liable
for the Fund's obligations. Thus, the risk of a shareholder incurring financial 
loss on account of shareholder liability is remote, because it is limited to    
circumstances in which the disclaimer is inoperative and the Fund itself is     
unable to meet its obligations.                                                 

VOTING RIGHTS                                                                   

     Each share has one vote and fractional shares have fractional votes. As a
business trust, the Trust is not required to hold annual shareholder meetings.  
However, special meetings may be called for purposes such as electing or        
removing trustees, changing fundamental policies or approving an investment     
advisory agreement.                                                             

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

      Audited financial statements for the Trust for the fiscal year ended March
31, 2004 are incorporated herein by reference from the Trust's annual report to 
shareholders.

APPENDIX--DESCRIPTION OF BOND RATINGS 

   A rating of a rating service represents the service's opinion as to the
credit quality of the security being rated. However, the ratings are general and
are not absolute standards of quality or guarantees as to the creditworthiness  
of an issuer. Consequently, Calamos Advisors believes that the quality of debt  
securities in which a Fund invests should be continuously reviewed. A rating is 
not a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold a security, because it does not  
take into account market value or suitability for a particular investor. When a 
security has received a rating from more than one service, each rating should be
evaluated independently. Ratings are based on current information furnished by  
the issuer or obtained by the ratings services from other sources that they     
consider reliable. Ratings may be changed, suspended or withdrawn as a result of
changes in or unavailability of such information, or for other reasons.         

    The following is a description of the characteristics of ratings used by
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") and Standard & Poor's Corporation, a
division of The McGraw-Hill Companies ("S&P").                                  

MOODY'S RATINGS                                                                 

     Aaa--Bonds rated Aaa are judged to be of the best quality. They carry the
smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as             
"gilt-edged." Interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally 
stable margin and principal is secure. Although the various protective elements 
are likely to change, such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to    
impair the fundamentally strong position of such bonds.                         

 Aa--Bonds rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards.
Together with the Aaa group they comprise what are generally known as high grade
bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection   
may not be as large as in Aaa bonds or fluctuation of protective elements may be
of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present that make the long  
term risk appear somewhat larger than in Aaa bonds.                             

    A--Bonds rated A possess many favorable investment attributes and are to
be considered as upper medium-grade obligations. Factors giving security to     
principal and interest are considered adequate, but elements may be present that
suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future.                  

  Baa--Bonds rated Baa are considered as medium-grade obligations, i.e.,
they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured. Interest payments and     
principal security appear adequate for the present, but certain protective      
elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great  
length of time. Such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in   
fact have speculative characteristics as well.                                  

    Ba--Bonds rated Ba are judged to have speculative elements; their future
cannot be considered as well assured. Often the protection of interest and      
principal payments may be very moderate and thereby not well safeguarded during 
both good and bad times over the future. Uncertainty of position characterizes  
bonds in this class.                                                            

 A-1

P-->497Last�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�75th
B--Bonds rated B generally lack characteristics of the desirable    
investment. Assurance of interest and principal payments or of maintenance of   
other terms of the contract over any long period of time may be small.          

      Caa--Bonds rated Caa are of poor standing. Such bonds may be in default or
there may be present elements of danger with respect to principal or interest.  

   Ca--Bonds rated Ca represent obligations that are speculative in a high
degree. Such bonds are often in default or have other marked shortcomings.      

S&P RATINGS                                                                     

   AAA--Bonds rated AAA have the highest rating. The obligor's capacity to
meet its financial commitment on the bond is extremely strong.                  

AA--Bonds rated AA differ from AAA bonds only in small degree. The  
obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the bond is very strong. 

    A--Bonds rated A are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of
changes in circumstances and economic conditions than bonds in higher rated     
categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on 
the bond is still strong.                                                       

 BBB--Bonds rated BBB exhibit adequate protection parameters. However,
adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to
a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the bond.

  BB--B--CCC--CC AND C--Bonds rated BB, B, CCC, CC and C are regarded as
having significant speculative characteristics. BB indicates the lowest degree  
of speculation among such bonds and C the highest degree of speculation. While  
such bonds will likely have some quality and protective characteristics, these  
may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse          
conditions.
