 Operational Intelligence for the Internet of Things
The Internet of Things is growing exponentially—
and so is the need for operational intelligence.






Operational Intelligence for a Waterfall of Sensor Data
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to embedding sensors, computing, and connectivity in many of our everyday devices, such as thermostats, lighting, cameras, and appliances. This opens the door to an unprecedented level of automation and personalization. However, without a scalable way to track and analyze all of the data being produced, these benefits cannot be fully realized.
“By 2020, the IoT will have expanded … [to] a population of about 26 billion units.” – Gartner
In-memory computing meets the challenge by simultaneously tracking millions of intelligent devices and analyzing telemetry in real time. This provides the operational intelligence required to react to changing patterns, optimize behavior, and head off impending problems. Operational intelligence unlocks the power of the IoT.



It’s Not Just Devices
The IoT includes more than intelligent devices in the home. Machines on a manufacturing floor, a fleet of rental cars or trucks, and even a windmill farm benefit from operational intelligence.


In-Memory Computing: A Perfect Fit for the IoT
With its ability to quickly update data, analyze it in parallel, and run in live, mission-critical environments, ScaleOut’s in-memory computing provides an ideal computing platform for the IoT.










How In-Memory Computing Enables the IoT
Analytics strategies that focus on analyzing static data, such as last week’s machine logs, can help identify long term trends, but they cannot react fast enough to capture business opportunities in the moment. The IoT needs real-time analytics that can track live, continuously-updated data with extremely low latency.
The secret sauce that makes this possible is in-memory computing. This technology has been used for more than a decade to store and update large, fast-changing data sets, such as shopping carts and financial data. More recently, ScaleOut Software introduced scalable, in-memory computing capabilities to give this computing platform the horsepower needed to rapidly analyze live data and provide immediate feedback. For example ScaleOut ComputeServer can analyze a terabyte of continuously changing data in a few seconds or less.
As illustrated in the following diagram, ScaleOut ComputeServer’s in-memory data grid tracks real-time state changes generated by an array of intelligent devices and maintains an in-memory representation of the state of these devices, enriched by historical information held on disk. It then uses data-parallel analytics to look for patterns and generate real-time feedback as required, providing operational intelligence.
Using In-Memory Computing to Analyze Data from the IoT










The Possibilities are Endless
The use of operational intelligence with the Internet of Things has countless possibilities. Imagine a commercial food processor that streams sensor updates from its machines into a real-time analytics cluster to predict and avoid failure scenarios. A rental car company can use operational intelligence to track vehicles, look for lost or erratic drivers, and anticipate deviations from safe practices. A brick-and-mortar retailer can improve its competitive edge by using operational intelligence to precisely track RFID tags attached to inventory and thereby lower costs while enhancing the customer’s shopping experience.
In short, operational intelligence gives companies the means to leverage the fast-changing data created by the IoT, and it empowers them to optimize business processes and grow profits.
So what are some examples of operational intelligence being used in the IoT? Imagine a commercial food processor that streams sensor updates off of its machines into real-time analytics cluster to instantly predict failure scenarios. Or imagine a large cable provider analyzing user data coming off of set top boxes in real-time and delivering content recommendations immediately based on that analysis. Finally, imagine a brick-n-mortar retailer — competing with e-commerce — using operational intelligence to combine a consumer’s location with her shopping history to deliver a personalized shopping experience. A sales associate, armed with a tablet, could discover the consumer’s preferences, sizes, etc. before they’ve interacted. In short, operational intelligence gives companies the means to leverage the fast-changing data created by the IoT, and it empowers them to enhance the customer experience, optimize business processes, and grow profits.

In-Memory Computing with Data-Parallel Stream Processing
Fast and intuitive in-memory computing platform for live, operational data streams









Streams of live data flow into the in-memory data grid and are combined with historical data…Integrated in-memory compute engine analyzes live data in real time and generates immediate results…Real-time alerts and feedback provide operational intelligence needed by live systems. 





Move Computing to Where the Data Lives
Beyond just serving as a fast, scalable repository for live data, in-memory data grids (IMDGs) provide the foundation for real-time analytics. By harnessing the scalable computing power of the server clusters on which they run, IMDGs enable large, in-memory data sets to be analyzed in parallel, delivering immediate results and important feedback to live systems. While they can serve distributed queries to select data of interest for client applications, their real power lies in the ability to host data-parallel computations within the grid — moving computing to where the data lives — to deliver blazing performance and eliminate bottlenecks to scalability.

The eXtremeDB Embedded Database, Feature-By-Feature:

Core In-Memory Database System (IMDS) Design
As an in-memory database system (IMDS), eXtremeDB gives your application speed without rewrites or expensive new hardware. It eliminates disk and file I/O, cache management and other sources of latency. By working with data directly in main memory, eXtremeDB avoids the overhead of data duplication and transfer inherent in disk-based DBMSs. Databases can be created in shared memory, enabling concurrent access by multiple processes. Read about the performance advantages of IMDS technology in the white papers offered from this site.
Tiny Footprint (Approximately 150K)
Small code size and minimal overhead (database system memory footprint is as small as 15% of managed data volume) means less RAM is required; eXtremeDB’s streamlined design permits a lower cost CPU. As a result, your design can use less expensive hardware, resulting in lower manufacturing costs. Or, use the extra CPU speed to offer a snappier user experience than your competition, and use the extra memory to manage more data at the same cost as competing products.
Optional On-Disk or Hybrid Storage
In addition to the core eXtremeDB in-memory data storage, McObject's eXtremeDB Fusion edition adds hybrid storage: certain record types can be designated for on-disk storage, with flexible caching. Choose the best storage medium based on performance, persistence, cost and form factor.  
High Availability and Clustering
Committed to 99.999% uptime or better? eXtremeDB High Availability (HA) edition ensures continuous database operation even in the face of hardware or software failure. eXtremeDB HA supports both synchronous (2-safe) and asynchronous (1-safe) replication, with automatic failover.

In distributed architectures based on eXtremeDB Cluster, every database instance serves as a master. Any process on any node can update its local database, and Cluster efficiently replicates changes to other nodes. Clustering can dramatically increase available net processing power, lower system expansion costs (by enabling use of low-cost “commodity” hardware), and maximize scalability and reliability for data-intensive applications.
ACID Transactions
eXtremeDB’s transactions support the ACID (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated and Durable) principles, which safeguard data integrity by guaranteeing that updates will complete together or the database will roll back to a pre-transaction state. eXtremeDB also enables the developer to prioritize transactions.
64-bit Support
The 64-bit edition of eXtremeDB scales to support databases that are terabytes in size, to address the real-time database needs of financial, social network, object-caching and other highly scalable applications.

In a published benchmark test, an eXtremeDB-64 database grew to 1.17 terabytes and 15.54 billion rows, with no apparent limits on it scaling further. Performance remained consistent as the database size increased, suggesting nearly linear scalability. For a simple SELECT against the fully populated database, eXtremeDB-64 processed 87.78 million query transactions per second using its native application programming interface (API) and 28.14 million transactions per second using a SQL ODBC API. 
Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)
Another important tool for scalability is eXtremeDB's optional Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) transaction manager, which is available as an alternative to the "pessimistic" database locking of the original eXtremeDB MURSIW (MUltiple Reader, SIngle Writer) transaction manager. MVCC can dramatically improve scalability and performance, especially in applications with on-disk or hybrid (in-memory and on-disk) database storage; many tasks or processes concurrently modifying the database (versus read-only); and in multi-core systems. 
Transaction Logging
eXtremeDB Transaction Logging edition adds recoverability by writing database changes into a transaction log on persistent media. Logging may be set to different levels of transaction durability, allowing system designers to make intelligent trade-offs between performance and risk of unrecoverable transactions.
Open Replication
McObject's eXtremeDB Data Relay technology facilitates seamless, fine-grained data sharing between real-time systems based on eXtremeDB, and external systems such as enterprise DBMSs. As part of the eXtremeDB Transaction Logging edition, Data Relay helps developers by simplifying the code that “looks inside” database transactions for changes that should be relayed. It also guarantees maximum efficiency by eliminating the CPU-intensive task of monitoring database activity. Sharing of data can be either synchronous or asynchronous.
Cache Prioritization
eXtremeDB Fusion improves on typical Least Recently Used (LRU) cache policies by allowing applications to influence how long certain pages remain in cache, to minimize retrieval overhead for objects used in time-sensitive tasks. When considering whether to remove a page from the cache, eXtremeDB's LRU algorithm examines the cache priority property set for the page; the higher the priority, the longer the page remains linked to the LRU list (stays in cache). A caching priority of zero is the default.
Event Notifications
Similar to triggers in a relational database management system, this feature enables eXtremeDB to notify an application when something "of interest" in the database changes. It is available in synchronous and asynchronous modes.
Deterministic Rule-Based SQL Optimizer
Cost-based SQL optimizers must collect sample data, generate statistics and analyze thousands -- sometimes hundreds of thousands -- of possible execution plans; these requirements make cost-based optimizers' operation CPU-intensive and unpredictable. In contrast, eXtremeSQL (eXtremeDB's SQL interface) uses a highly efficient and predictable rule-based optimizer.
Pattern Search
For flexibility in querying, eXtremeDB supports the use of wildcards to search tree index entries for single and multiple character matches.
Security Features
eXtremeDB protects your database. Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) on the database page level detects whether unauthorized modification to stored data has occurred, while RC4 encryption employs a user-provided cipher to prevent access or tampering. In addition to safeguarding sensitive data (in financial or defense systems, for example) page-level CRC can be used in devices such as portable audio players to help enforce digital rights management.
Binary Schema Evolution
eXtremeDB can save a database as a binary image and then restore it with a changed schema. This can accomplish design changes more quickly, using less memory and storage, than the alternative approach using XML import/export.
Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs)
eXtremeDB generates an interface that enables remote processes (i.e. on another network node) to read/update an eXtremeDB database.
Database Striping/Mirroring
eXtremeDB Fusion can exploit multi-disk (solid state or spinning) configurations with its support for RAID-like data striping and data mirroring. Striping accelerates performance when working with two or more disks by parallelizing access to data. Mirroring provides continuous backup by replicating data onto separate disks (if disk A fails, identical records are available from disk B).
XML Import/Export
eXtremeDB's schema compiler, mcocomp, can generate XML interface functions for each class, providing the means to retrieve an object encoded as XML, to create or replace (update) an object in the database from the content of an XML string, to generate the XML schema for each class in the database in order to facilitate sharing data with other XML-enabled systems, and to accomplish simple eXtremeDB schema evolution.
Kernel Mode Deployment
McObject pioneered the concept of an in-memory database that deploys in the operating system kernel. eXtremeDB Kernel Mode leverages the high priority, zero-latency responsiveness afforded to kernel tasks—and meets the data sorting, access and retrieval needs of applications that place key functions there.
C/C++, SQL, Java APIs
eXtremeDB provides the developer with multiple application programming interfaces (APIs). Access eXtremeDB using a fast, native navigational API consisting of C/C++ functions. This is provided as both a type-safe and intuitive application-specific API (functions are generated based on the data design), and as a uniform data access (UDA) API for a consistent interface across all projects. eXtremeDB’s SQL implementation includes an ODBC API for interoperability, a more succinct and easier to use proprietary API, and a type 3, version 4 JDBC driver. eXtremeDB’s Java Native Interface (JNI) and C# native interface offer the fastest possible DBMS solutions in these languages, and the ability to access eXtremeDB while working entirely with "plain old" Java and C# objects.
Designed To Prevent Database Corruption
The eXtremeDB native API is type-safe: errors in data-typing are caught at compile time, to eliminate database corruption. In addition, the eXtremeDB runtime implements many verification traps and consistency checks. After application debugging, the optimized version of the eXtremeDB runtime can be used, removing traps and internal checks, and restoring valuable clock cycles.

In addition, cyclic redundancy check is built into the backup-and-restore feature for in-memory databases, executing automatically when a file is loaded to ensure the database was written in its entirety when saved, and has not been corrupted.
B-Tree, R-Tree, Patricia Trie, KD-Tree and Hash Indexes
eXtremeDB provides a wide range of database indexes, to boost application performance and minimize footprint. eXtremeDB offers R-trees for geospatial data, Patricia tries for IP/telecom, KD-trees for multi-dimensional data and Query-by-Example (QBE), B-trees, hash indexes and more. For in-memory databases, rather than storing duplicate data, indexes contain only a reference to data, keeping memory requirements to an absolute minimum.
Wide Range of Supported Data Types
eXtremeDB supports a wide range of data types -- including structures, arrays, vectors and BLOBs -- for maximum coding efficiency. Data can be stored in the same complex form in which it is used in the application, or as normalized relations.
Custom Collations
eXtremeDB includes hooks that enable developers to provide a desired character sorting sequence (collation) for data stored as text, including collation that supports a particular language or combination of languages. A single application can support search and other text-processing functions in multiple languages.
Broad platform support
eXtremeDB operates on multiple platforms including all major server and real-time operating systems (RTOSs), and can even run without an OS in "bare bones boards" configurations. It is designed to minimize reliance on OS-specific features, in order to simplify the task of porting to new operating systems.
Source code available
Available source code provides the ultimate transparency for developers using eXtremeDB. Use it for porting, learning, or to add a needed function.
Proven Solution
Compared to self-developed (‘homegrown’) data management, eXtremeDB offers a proven solution that slashes months from development, QA and ongoing support. Why take on the complexity and cost of developing a database management system from scratch, when an off-the-shelf solution meets your requirements?
Unmatched Developer Support
McObject technical support engineers are database and real time application experts who  answer customer questions in detail. Whether embedded systems beginners with basic configuration questions or seasoned developers looking for hints on optimization, customers get prompt, informative answers and continued follow-up to speed production and get the most from eXtremeDB.

 Operational Intelligence for the Internet of Things
The Internet of Things is growing exponentially—
and so is the need for operational intelligence.






Operational Intelligence for a Waterfall of Sensor Data
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to embedding sensors, computing, and connectivity in many of our everyday devices, such as thermostats, lighting, cameras, and appliances. This opens the door to an unprecedented level of automation and personalization. However, without a scalable way to track and analyze all of the data being produced, these benefits cannot be fully realized.
“By 2020, the IoT will have expanded … [to] a population of about 26 billion units.” – Gartner
In-memory computing meets the challenge by simultaneously tracking millions of intelligent devices and analyzing telemetry in real time. This provides the operational intelligence required to react to changing patterns, optimize behavior, and head off impending problems. Operational intelligence unlocks the power of the IoT.



It’s Not Just Devices
The IoT includes more than intelligent devices in the home. Machines on a manufacturing floor, a fleet of rental cars or trucks, and even a windmill farm benefit from operational intelligence.


In-Memory Computing: A Perfect Fit for the IoT
With its ability to quickly update data, analyze it in parallel, and run in live, mission-critical environments, ScaleOut’s in-memory computing provides an ideal computing platform for the IoT.










How In-Memory Computing Enables the IoT
Analytics strategies that focus on analyzing static data, such as last week’s machine logs, can help identify long term trends, but they cannot react fast enough to capture business opportunities in the moment. The IoT needs real-time analytics that can track live, continuously-updated data with extremely low latency.
The secret sauce that makes this possible is in-memory computing. This technology has been used for more than a decade to store and update large, fast-changing data sets, such as shopping carts and financial data. More recently, ScaleOut Software introduced scalable, in-memory computing capabilities to give this computing platform the horsepower needed to rapidly analyze live data and provide immediate feedback. For example ScaleOut ComputeServer can analyze a terabyte of continuously changing data in a few seconds or less.
As illustrated in the following diagram, ScaleOut ComputeServer’s in-memory data grid tracks real-time state changes generated by an array of intelligent devices and maintains an in-memory representation of the state of these devices, enriched by historical information held on disk. It then uses data-parallel analytics to look for patterns and generate real-time feedback as required, providing operational intelligence.
Using In-Memory Computing to Analyze Data from the IoT










The Possibilities are Endless
The use of operational intelligence with the Internet of Things has countless possibilities. Imagine a commercial food processor that streams sensor updates from its machines into a real-time analytics cluster to predict and avoid failure scenarios. A rental car company can use operational intelligence to track vehicles, look for lost or erratic drivers, and anticipate deviations from safe practices. A brick-and-mortar retailer can improve its competitive edge by using operational intelligence to precisely track RFID tags attached to inventory and thereby lower costs while enhancing the customer’s shopping experience.
In short, operational intelligence gives companies the means to leverage the fast-changing data created by the IoT, and it empowers them to optimize business processes and grow profits.
So what are some examples of operational intelligence being used in the IoT? Imagine a commercial food processor that streams sensor updates off of its machines into real-time analytics cluster to instantly predict failure scenarios. Or imagine a large cable provider analyzing user data coming off of set top boxes in real-time and delivering content recommendations immediately based on that analysis. Finally, imagine a brick-n-mortar retailer — competing with e-commerce — using operational intelligence to combine a consumer’s location with her shopping history to deliver a personalized shopping experience. A sales associate, armed with a tablet, could discover the consumer’s preferences, sizes, etc. before they’ve interacted. In short, operational intelligence gives companies the means to leverage the fast-changing data created by the IoT, and it empowers them to enhance the customer experience, optimize business processes, and grow profits.

In-Memory Computing with Data-Parallel Stream Processing
Fast and intuitive in-memory computing platform for live, operational data streams









Streams of live data flow into the in-memory data grid and are combined with historical data…Integrated in-memory compute engine analyzes live data in real time and generates immediate results…Real-time alerts and feedback provide operational intelligence needed by live systems. 





Move Computing to Where the Data Lives
Beyond just serving as a fast, scalable repository for live data, in-memory data grids (IMDGs) provide the foundation for real-time analytics. By harnessing the scalable computing power of the server clusters on which they run, IMDGs enable large, in-memory data sets to be analyzed in parallel, delivering immediate results and important feedback to live systems. While they can serve distributed queries to select data of interest for client applications, their real power lies in the ability to host data-parallel computations within the grid — moving computing to where the data lives — to deliver blazing performance and eliminate bottlenecks to scalability.



Operational Intelligence
Operational intelligence uses the power of in-memory computing to track fast-changing data within live systems, analyze them in parallel, and then provide immediate insights and actionable feedback — with far-reaching benefits.

The eXtremeDB Embedded Database, Feature-By-Feature:

Core In-Memory Database System (IMDS) Design
As an in-memory database system (IMDS), eXtremeDB gives your application speed without rewrites or expensive new hardware. It eliminates disk and file I/O, cache management and other sources of latency. By working with data directly in main memory, eXtremeDB avoids the overhead of data duplication and transfer inherent in disk-based DBMSs. Databases can be created in shared memory, enabling concurrent access by multiple processes. Read about the performance advantages of IMDS technology in the white papers offered from this site.
Tiny Footprint (Approximately 150K)
Small code size and minimal overhead (database system memory footprint is as small as 15% of managed data volume) means less RAM is required; eXtremeDB’s streamlined design permits a lower cost CPU. As a result, your design can use less expensive hardware, resulting in lower manufacturing costs. Or, use the extra CPU speed to offer a snappier user experience than your competition, and use the extra memory to manage more data at the same cost as competing products.
Optional On-Disk or Hybrid Storage
In addition to the core eXtremeDB in-memory data storage, McObject's eXtremeDB Fusion edition adds hybrid storage: certain record types can be designated for on-disk storage, with flexible caching. Choose the best storage medium based on performance, persistence, cost and form factor.  
High Availability and Clustering
Committed to 99.999% uptime or better? eXtremeDB High Availability (HA) edition ensures continuous database operation even in the face of hardware or software failure. eXtremeDB HA supports both synchronous (2-safe) and asynchronous (1-safe) replication, with automatic failover.

In distributed architectures based on eXtremeDB Cluster, every database instance serves as a master. Any process on any node can update its local database, and Cluster efficiently replicates changes to other nodes. Clustering can dramatically increase available net processing power, lower system expansion costs (by enabling use of low-cost “commodity” hardware), and maximize scalability and reliability for data-intensive applications.
ACID Transactions
eXtremeDB’s transactions support the ACID (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated and Durable) principles, which safeguard data integrity by guaranteeing that updates will complete together or the database will roll back to a pre-transaction state. eXtremeDB also enables the developer to prioritize transactions.
64-bit Support
The 64-bit edition of eXtremeDB scales to support databases that are terabytes in size, to address the real-time database needs of financial, social network, object-caching and other highly scalable applications.

In a published benchmark test, an eXtremeDB-64 database grew to 1.17 terabytes and 15.54 billion rows, with no apparent limits on it scaling further. Performance remained consistent as the database size increased, suggesting nearly linear scalability. For a simple SELECT against the fully populated database, eXtremeDB-64 processed 87.78 million query transactions per second using its native application programming interface (API) and 28.14 million transactions per second using a SQL ODBC API. 
Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)
Another important tool for scalability is eXtremeDB's optional Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) transaction manager, which is available as an alternative to the "pessimistic" database locking of the original eXtremeDB MURSIW (MUltiple Reader, SIngle Writer) transaction manager. MVCC can dramatically improve scalability and performance, especially in applications with on-disk or hybrid (in-memory and on-disk) database storage; many tasks or processes concurrently modifying the database (versus read-only); and in multi-core systems. 
Transaction Logging
eXtremeDB Transaction Logging edition adds recoverability by writing database changes into a transaction log on persistent media. Logging may be set to different levels of transaction durability, allowing system designers to make intelligent trade-offs between performance and risk of unrecoverable transactions.
Open Replication
McObject's eXtremeDB Data Relay technology facilitates seamless, fine-grained data sharing between real-time systems based on eXtremeDB, and external systems such as enterprise DBMSs. As part of the eXtremeDB Transaction Logging edition, Data Relay helps developers by simplifying the code that “looks inside” database transactions for changes that should be relayed. It also guarantees maximum efficiency by eliminating the CPU-intensive task of monitoring database activity. Sharing of data can be either synchronous or asynchronous.
Cache Prioritization
eXtremeDB Fusion improves on typical Least Recently Used (LRU) cache policies by allowing applications to influence how long certain pages remain in cache, to minimize retrieval overhead for objects used in time-sensitive tasks. When considering whether to remove a page from the cache, eXtremeDB's LRU algorithm examines the cache priority property set for the page; the higher the priority, the longer the page remains linked to the LRU list (stays in cache). A caching priority of zero is the default.
Event Notifications
Similar to triggers in a relational database management system, this feature enables eXtremeDB to notify an application when something "of interest" in the database changes. It is available in synchronous and asynchronous modes.
Deterministic Rule-Based SQL Optimizer
Cost-based SQL optimizers must collect sample data, generate statistics and analyze thousands -- sometimes hundreds of thousands -- of possible execution plans; these requirements make cost-based optimizers' operation CPU-intensive and unpredictable. In contrast, eXtremeSQL (eXtremeDB's SQL interface) uses a highly efficient and predictable rule-based optimizer.
Pattern Search
For flexibility in querying, eXtremeDB supports the use of wildcards to search tree index entries for single and multiple character matches.
Security Features
eXtremeDB protects your database. Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) on the database page level detects whether unauthorized modification to stored data has occurred, while RC4 encryption employs a user-provided cipher to prevent access or tampering. In addition to safeguarding sensitive data (in financial or defense systems, for example) page-level CRC can be used in devices such as portable audio players to help enforce digital rights management.
Binary Schema Evolution
eXtremeDB can save a database as a binary image and then restore it with a changed schema. This can accomplish design changes more quickly, using less memory and storage, than the alternative approach using XML import/export.
Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs)
eXtremeDB generates an interface that enables remote processes (i.e. on another network node) to read/update an eXtremeDB database.
Database Striping/Mirroring
eXtremeDB Fusion can exploit multi-disk (solid state or spinning) configurations with its support for RAID-like data striping and data mirroring. Striping accelerates performance when working with two or more disks by parallelizing access to data. Mirroring provides continuous backup by replicating data onto separate disks (if disk A fails, identical records are available from disk B).
XML Import/Export
eXtremeDB's schema compiler, mcocomp, can generate XML interface functions for each class, providing the means to retrieve an object encoded as XML, to create or replace (update) an object in the database from the content of an XML string, to generate the XML schema for each class in the database in order to facilitate sharing data with other XML-enabled systems, and to accomplish simple eXtremeDB schema evolution.
Kernel Mode Deployment
McObject pioneered the concept of an in-memory database that deploys in the operating system kernel. eXtremeDB Kernel Mode leverages the high priority, zero-latency responsiveness afforded to kernel tasks—and meets the data sorting, access and retrieval needs of applications that place key functions there.
C/C++, SQL, Java APIs
eXtremeDB provides the developer with multiple application programming interfaces (APIs). Access eXtremeDB using a fast, native navigational API consisting of C/C++ functions. This is provided as both a type-safe and intuitive application-specific API (functions are generated based on the data design), and as a uniform data access (UDA) API for a consistent interface across all projects. eXtremeDB’s SQL implementation includes an ODBC API for interoperability, a more succinct and easier to use proprietary API, and a type 3, version 4 JDBC driver. eXtremeDB’s Java Native Interface (JNI) and C# native interface offer the fastest possible DBMS solutions in these languages, and the ability to access eXtremeDB while working entirely with "plain old" Java and C# objects.
Designed To Prevent Database Corruption
The eXtremeDB native API is type-safe: errors in data-typing are caught at compile time, to eliminate database corruption. In addition, the eXtremeDB runtime implements many verification traps and consistency checks. After application debugging, the optimized version of the eXtremeDB runtime can be used, removing traps and internal checks, and restoring valuable clock cycles.

In addition, cyclic redundancy check is built into the backup-and-restore feature for in-memory databases, executing automatically when a file is loaded to ensure the database was written in its entirety when saved, and has not been corrupted.
B-Tree, R-Tree, Patricia Trie, KD-Tree and Hash Indexes
eXtremeDB provides a wide range of database indexes, to boost application performance and minimize footprint. eXtremeDB offers R-trees for geospatial data, Patricia tries for IP/telecom, KD-trees for multi-dimensional data and Query-by-Example (QBE), B-trees, hash indexes and more. For in-memory databases, rather than storing duplicate data, indexes contain only a reference to data, keeping memory requirements to an absolute minimum.
Wide Range of Supported Data Types
eXtremeDB supports a wide range of data types -- including structures, arrays, vectors and BLOBs -- for maximum coding efficiency. Data can be stored in the same complex form in which it is used in the application, or as normalized relations.
Custom Collations
eXtremeDB includes hooks that enable developers to provide a desired character sorting sequence (collation) for data stored as text, including collation that supports a particular language or combination of languages. A single application can support search and other text-processing functions in multiple languages.
Broad platform support
eXtremeDB operates on multiple platforms including all major server and real-time operating systems (RTOSs), and can even run without an OS in "bare bones boards" configurations. It is designed to minimize reliance on OS-specific features, in order to simplify the task of porting to new operating systems.
Source code available
Available source code provides the ultimate transparency for developers using eXtremeDB. Use it for porting, learning, or to add a needed function.
Proven Solution
Compared to self-developed (‘homegrown’) data management, eXtremeDB offers a proven solution that slashes months from development, QA and ongoing support. Why take on the complexity and cost of developing a database management system from scratch, when an off-the-shelf solution meets your requirements?
Unmatched Developer Support
McObject technical support engineers are database and real time application experts who  answer customer questions in detail. Whether embedded systems beginners with basic configuration questions or seasoned developers looking for hints on optimization, customers get prompt, informative answers and continued follow-up to speed production and get the most from eXtremeDB.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
