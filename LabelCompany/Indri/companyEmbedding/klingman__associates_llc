Founder and President



The biggest thing I see with successful advisors is they generally care more about people than they do about money.
    Gerard Klingman WSJ Live interview











Gerry provides financial planning and investment advisory services to corporate executives, entrepreneurs, professional athletes and other high-net-worth individuals and their families.
Gerry received a bachelor's degree in economics from Princeton University in 1983. He attained his Certified Financial Planner™ certification from the College of Financial Planning in 1989 and later earned CLU® and ChFC® designations from the American College, as well as a CFS® designation from the Institute of Business & Finance. He is a member of the Financial Planning Association.
With more than 30 years of experience, Gerry is widely recognized as a leader in the field of financial planning and investment management. In 2011, Research magazine named Gerry to its Advisor Hall of Fame*. In 2008, America's premier financial weekly magazine, Barron's, started its annual ranking of America's Top 100 Independent Advisors. Gerry has been named to the list every year and has been a featured speaker at the Top 100 annual conference**. Since its inception in 2013, Gerry has been named to the FT 400, a ranking of America's top investment advisors by the Financial Times***. Gerry also has been featured in many leading industry publications including the Wall Street Journal.

 

Gerry serves on numerous charitable boards, both locally and nationally. He and his wife, Penney, live in Bedford Corners, New York.  Gerry enjoys golf, skiing and spending time with his family.

 
*Award is based on serving a minimum of 15 years in the industry, acquiring substantial assets under management, demonstrating a high level of client service and earning recognitions from their peers and the broader community.    
    **Award is based on assets under management, advisor's contribution to firm revenues and profits, and indications of service quality.
      
      ***Award is based on a numeric score calculated by FT based on six broad factors. 
 
CFP® | Certified Financial Planner™ | 
  Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc., owns the certification marks above, which it awards to individuals who successfully complete initial and ongoing certification requirements.

Giving Back  | Klingman & Associates, LLC


































Market












To whom much is given, much is required – giving back




Along with the achievement of wealth comes many opportunities. And we believe the greatest is the opportunity to do good for the people and the causes we believe in. By sharing our good fortune, we gain something of greater value than wealth itself – the ability to make a difference in the world.    
Our team is proud to support a variety of local organizations and charitable initiatives including:

Best Buddies International
Hope’s Door
God's Love We Deliver
First Tee of Metropolitan New York
Guiding Eyes for the Blind
Head Strong Project
Neighbors Link
Leukemia & Lymphoma Society

And our commitment to giving back doesn't stop with any one group or cause. Whatever inspires you, we'd be proud to help you share your support through a variety of charitable giving strategies available including donor advised funds, pooled income funds, charity advised accounts and charitable gift annuities. To learn more about how we can help you give back to the causes you hold dear, contact us today.

Glossary of Investment Terms
 
Keeping up with the increasing number of investment products and services in the marketplace today can be confusing.  This glossary is designed to help you understand some of the more common investment and financial terms you may encounter.  Your financial advisor can explain these terms more completely and discuss with you those relevant to your situation.
A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | Y | Z


A
Accrued interest – The interest due on a bond since the last interest payment was made. The buyer of the bond pays the market price plus accrued interest.
Acquisition – The acquiring of control of one corporation by another.  In "unfriendly" takeover attempts, the potential buying company may offer a price well above current market values, new securities and other inducements to stockholders.  The management of the subject company might ask for a better price or try to join up with a third company.  (See:  Merger, Proxy)
American Depositary Receipt (ADR) – a security issued by a U.S. bank in place of the foreign shares held in trust by that bank, thereby facilitating the trading of foreign shares in U.S. markets.
American Stock Exchange (AMEX) – The second largest stock exchange in the United States, located in the financial district of New York City.  (Formerly known as the Curb Exchange from its origin on a Manhattan street.)
Amortization – Accounting for expenses or charges as applicable rather than as paid.  Includes such practices as depreciation, depletion, write-off of intangibles, prepaid expenses and deferred charges.
Annual report – The formal financial statement issued yearly by a corporation.  The annual report shows assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and earnings - how the company stood at the close of the business year, how it fared profit-wise during the year, as well as other information of interest to shareowners.
Arbitrage – A technique employed to take advantage of differences in price.  If, for example, ABC stock can be bought in New York for $10 a share and sold in London at $10.50, an arbitrageur may simultaneously purchase ABC stock here and sell the same amount in London, making a profit of $.50 a share, less expenses.  Arbitrage may also involve the purchase of rights to subscribe to a security, or the purchase of a convertible security - and the sale at or about the same time of the security obtainable through exercise of the rights or of the security obtainable through conversion.  (See: Convertible, Rights)
Assets – Everything a corporation owns or that is due to it: cash, investments, money due it, materials and inventories, which are called current assets; buildings and machinery, which are known as fixed assets; and patents and goodwill, called intangible assets. (See: Liabilities)

Auction market – The system of trading securities through brokers or agents on an exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange.  Buyers compete with other buyers while sellers compete with other sellers for the most advantageous price.
Auditor's report – Often called the accountant's opinion, it is the statement of the accounting firm's work and its opinion of the corporation's financial statements, especially if they conform to the normal and generally accepted practices of accountancy.
Averages – Various ways of measuring the trend of securities prices, one of the most popular of which is the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 industrial stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange.  The prices of the 30 stocks are totaled and then divided by a divisor that is intended to compensate for past stock splits and stock dividends, and that is changed from time to time.  As a result, point changes in the average have only the vaguest relationship to dollar-price changes in stocks included in the average.  (See: NYSE Composite Index)

Depletion accounting – Natural resources, such as metals, oil, gas and timber, that conceivably can be reduced to zero over the years, present a special problem in capital management.  Depletion is an accounting practice consisting of charges against earnings based upon the amount of the asset taken out of the total reserves in the period for which accounting is made.

On common shares, the dividend varies with the fortunes of the company and the amount of cash on hand, and may be omitted if business is poor or the directors determine to withhold earnings to invest in plant and equipment.  Sometimes a company will pay a dividend out of past earnings even if it is not currently operating at a profit.
Dollar-cost-averaging – A system of buying securities at regular intervals with a fixed dollar amount.  Under this system investors buy by the dollars' worth rather than by the number of shares.  If each investment is of the same number of dollars, payments buy more shares when the price is low and fewer when it rises.  Thus temporary downswings in price benefit investors if they continue periodic purchases in both good and bad times, and the price at which the shares are sold is more than their average cost. Dollar-cost-averaging does not assure a profit and does not protect against loss in declining markets. Since dollar-cost-averaging involves continuous investment in securities regardless of fluctuating price levels of such securities, investors should consider their financial ability to continue purchases through periods of low price levels.(See: Formula investing)
Down tick – (See: Up tick)
Dow theory – A theory of market analysis based upon the performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and transportation stock price averages.  The theory says that the market is in a basic upward trend if one of these averages advances above a previous important high, accompanied or followed by a similar advance in the other.  When both averages dip below previous important lows, this is regarded as confirmation of a downward trend.  The Dow Jones is one type of market index.  (See: NYSE Composite Index)

Corporations raising additional money may do so by offering their stockholders the right to subscribe to new or additional stock, usually at a discount from the prevailing market price.  The buyer of a stock selling ex-rights is not entitled to the rights.  (See: Ex-dividend, Rights)

Fiscal year – A corporation's accounting year.  Due to the nature of their particular business, some companies do not use the calendar year for their bookkeeping.  A typical example is the department store that finds December 31 too early a date to close its books after the Christmas rush.  For that reason many stores wind up their accounting year January 31.  Their fiscal year, therefore, runs from February 1 of one year through January 31 of the next.  The fiscal year of other companies may run from July 1 through the following June 30.  Most companies, though, operate on a calendar year basis.

Par – In the case of a common share, par means a dollar amount assigned to the share by the company's charter.  Par value may also be used to compute the dollar amount of common shares on the balance sheet.  Par value has little relationship to the market value of common stock.  Many companies issue no-par stock but give a stated per share value on the balance sheet.  In the case of preferred stocks it signifies the dollar value upon which dividends are figured.  With bonds, par value is the face amount, usually $1,000.

Point – In the case of shares of stock, a point means $1.  If ABC shares rise 3 points, each share has risen $3.  In the case of bonds a point means $10, since a bond is quoted as a percentage of $1,000.  A bond that rises 3 points gains 3% in $1,000, or $30 in value.  An advance from 87 to 90 would mean an advance in dollar value from $870 to $900.  In the case of market averages, the word point means merely that and no more.  If, for example, the NYSE Composite Index rises from 90.25 to 91.25, it has risen a point.  A point in this index, however, is not equivalent to $1.  (See: Index)

This means that $45.25 is the highest price any buyer wanted to pay at the time the quote was given on the floor of the exchange and that $45.50 was the lowest price that any seller would take at the same time.

Before a security may be admitted to dealings on a national securities exchange, it must be registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Because the additional stock is usually offered to stockholders below the current market price, rights ordinarily have a market value of their own and are actively traded.

Short sale – A transaction by a person who believes a security will decline and sells it, though the person does not own any.  For instance:  You instruct your broker to sell short 100 shares of XYZ.  Your broker borrows the stock so delivery can be made to the buyer.  The money value of the shares borrowed is deposited by your broker with the lender.  Sooner or later you must cover your short sale by buying the same amount of stock you borrowed for return to the lender.  If you are able to buy XYZ at a lower price than you sold it for, your profit is the difference between the two prices - not counting commissions and taxes.  But if you have to pay more for the stock than the price you received, that is the amount of your loss.  Stock exchange and federal regulations govern and limit the conditions under which a short sale may be made on a national securities exchange.  Sometimes people will sell short a stock they already own in order to protect a paper profit.  This is know as selling short against the box.

Specialist – A member of the New York Stock Exchange who has two primary functions:  first, to maintain an orderly market in the securities registered to the specialist.  In order to maintain an orderly market, the exchange expects specialists to buy or sell for their own account, to a reasonable degree, when there is a temporary disparity between supply and demand. Second, the specialist acts as a broker's broker.  When commission brokers on the exchange floor receive a limit order, say, to buy at $50 a stock then selling at $60 - they cannot wait at the post where the stock is traded to see if the price reaches the specified level.  They leave the order with a specialist, who will try to execute it in the market if and when the stock declines to the specified price.  At all times the specialists must put their customers' interests above their own.  (See: Limit order)

Split – The division of the outstanding shares of a corporation into a larger number of shares.  A 3-for-1 split by a company with 1 million shares outstanding results in 3 million shares outstanding.  Each holder of 100 shares before the 3-for-1 split would have 300 shares, although the proportionate equity in the company would remain the same; 100 parts of 1 million are the equivalent of 300 parts of 3 million.  Ordinarily, splits must be voted by directors and approved by shareholders.  (See: Stock dividend)

Stop sell orders are generally used to protect unrealized profits or limit loss on a holding.  A stop order becomes a market order when the stock sells at or beyond the specified price and, thus, may not necessarily be executed at that price.
