DuPont Names Stacy L. Fox as Senior Vice President and General Counsel Following Retirement of Thomas Sager

	6.10.14







WILMINGTON, Del., June 10, 2014 – DuPont announced today that it has named Stacy L. Fox as senior vice president and general counsel effective Oct. 1, succeeding Thomas L. Sager, who is retiring following 37 years of service to the company.
“Tom has served as an outstanding general counsel at DuPont. He has set an exceptional benchmark as a lawyer through his unwavering commitment in promoting and developing diversity not only within DuPont, but throughout the legal community,” said DuPont Chair and CEO Ellen Kullman. “He has been an innovator and pioneer in the legal profession and all who worked with him will miss his steady counsel and strong leadership.
“Stacy comes to us as a proven leader with exceptional experience as a lawyer and business executive. She will play an important role in supporting DuPont’s growth, and I am pleased to welcome her to the company.”
Prior to joining DuPont, Fox, 60, held the position of senior vice president, Strategy, and general counsel and secretary of Sunoco, Inc. Previously, she served as executive vice president of Corporate Transactions and Legal Affairs for Visteon, an $18 billion multinational automotive supplier and general counsel of Collins & Aikman, also in the automotive industry. Fox began her legal career as a corporate and litigation associate at a well-regarded law firm, before moving in-house to Unisys and later Johnson Controls. Most recently she has served under Michigan's Governor Rick Snyder as the deputy emergency manager for the city of Detroit, assisting his team in guiding the city through the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. In addition, she is a founder and principal of the Roxbury Group, a Detroit based real estate development and investment firm specializing in complex urban redevelopment projects. 
Fox earned her J.D. at The University of Michigan Law School and B.S. with distinction at the University of Michigan. 
Sager joined DuPont in 1976 as an attorney in the labor and corporate security group after receiving his J.D. from Wake Forest University School of Law.  He was named associate general counsel in 1994.  In January 1998 he was named chief litigation counsel with responsibilities for all litigation. Sager was named vice president and assistant general counsel in November 1999, and to his current position in July 2008. He helped pioneer the DuPont Convergence and Law Firm Partnering Program (DuPont Legal Model). Through his leadership, this program has become a benchmark in the industry and has received international acclaim for its innovative approach to the business of practicing law. 
DuPont (NYSE: DD) has been bringing world-class science and engineering to the global marketplace in the form of innovative products, materials, and services since 1802. The company believes that by collaborating with customers, governments, NGOs, and thought leaders, we can help find solutions to such global challenges as providing enough healthy food for people everywhere, decreasing dependence on fossil fuels, and protecting life and the environment.

Stacy Fox to leave Detroit emergency manager's office for DuPont
              Effective Oct. 1, Fox will be DuPont's general counsel.  
By Amy Haimerl 

TwitterFacebookLinkedInGoogle+CommentsEmailPrinter-friendly version 


Bankruptcy










Stacy Fox
 


Stacy Fox found her post-emergency management gig.
Starting Oct. 1, Fox will be the senior vice president and general counsel of Wilmington, Del.-based DuPont. She has served as Detroit’s deputy emergency manager under Kevyn Orr since October 2013.
“Stacy comes to us as a proven leader with exceptional experience as a lawyer and business executive,” said DuPont chair and CEO Ellen Kullman in a news release. “She will play an important role in supporting DuPont’s growth.”
Detroit City Council is expected to vote out Orr at the end of his 18-month state-appointed term in October. And with him, his staff could be seeking new positions as well because city government is expected to be reinstated as of Oct. 1. Gov. Rick Snyder has not indicated whether he would appoint a new emergency manager — or reappoint Orr — if the city’s bankruptcy trial extended further into the fall than anticipated.
Fox, 60, is the co-founder of Detroit-based real estate development group The Roxbury Group and on the executive committee of Downtown Detroit Partnership. She resigned from her position as principal at Roxbury to serve with Orr, acting as his deputy and chief of staff.
Previously, she served as vice president of strategy and general counsel for Philadelphia-based Sonoco Inc. She is also a former general counsel and executive for Visteon Corp., Johnson Controls Inc. and Collins & Aikman Corp.

More than any other leader that I’ve worked with, Stacey has the experience and energy to execute at a highest level.  Stacey bridges silos and is a networker extraordinaire the partners internal to drive efficiencies and is not risk adverse, but rather bold in driving change.  Stacey seeks to drive understanding and insight to outpace the competition in terms of utilizing feedback to enhance the customer experience and differentiate Rite Aid as a brand.
