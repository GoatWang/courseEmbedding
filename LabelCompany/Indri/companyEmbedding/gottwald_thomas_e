How you know them: Thomas E. “Teddy” Gottwald is chairman, president and CEO of NewMarket Corp., the Richmond-based petroleum additives company that is the parent company of Afton Chemical Corp. and Ethyl Corp. He has been board chairman since July 2014 and president and CEO since March 2004, when the NewMarket holding company was created. He was president and CEO of Ethyl from 2001 to 2004. He joined the company in 1984.His father, Bruce C. Gottwald, is a board member and served as chairman of NewMarket and Ethyl for about 20 years. He is also former CEO of Ethyl.How they have shaped the region: Three generations of Gottwalds have led the Richmond-based company, a maker of petroleum additives that help keep car engines running smoothly.“The company has been here for 129 years now, since 1887, in various forms,” Teddy Gottwald said. “Thirty years is just one small piece of a long history that the company has here in Richmond.”The Gottwald family’s biggest impact on the region has been a stalwart commitment to keeping the company in Richmond and creating jobs, he said. NewMarket’s corporate headquarters is at South Fourth and East Byrd streets downtown.“There are lot of good corporate citizens in Richmond that contribute to a lot of community activities and facilities, and we are proud of our record in that regard,” he said.The Gottwalds and the company have been supporters of the Science Museum of Virginia. Bruce Gottwald was one of the founding board members of the VCU School of Engineering Foundation.“The engineering school started very modestly and grew astonishingly,” Bruce Gottwald said. “I can hardly imagine back to when it started with one or two hundred students to the size of the school now.”“In our kind of business, you either have technology or you don’t exist, and having young people get that kind of education right here a few blocks away is a great benefit to us, and we think it is also a great benefit to the city and state,” he said.Bruce Gottwald, 82, also recalls watching cannon canister being made at the Tredegar Iron Works when he was a boy.
NewMarket owns the Tredegar property, which is now home to the American Civil War Center at Historic Tredegar.For the whole of the company’s history, “We have been essentially in the same place, give or take a few hundred yards, here on the riverfront,” Teddy Gottwald said. “The riverfront has been a major part of our company and a big part of our contributions, too.”Focusing on Richmond was a key reason why the company built its $70 million research center that opened in 1994 at South Second and Spring streets, across from the company’s headquarters on the former site of the State Penitentiary.The 240,000-square-foot center allowed the company to shut down research facilities in St. Louis and Baton Rouge, La., and move all the high-paying research jobs here.
