Chairman's message
                Francisco González
            








BBVA has been developing a strategy for years based on diversification in markets with high growth potential, a customer-centric business model and technology as a key element in order to face the transformation process being experienced in the financial sector.
BBVA is an increasingly global financial group, and we have used these recent years to continue our expansion into markets with high growth potential, such as Turkey and Latin America that already provide more than half of our annual gross income.
In addition to the profound regulatory changes in our industry, as well as the turning of the world economy towards emerging markets, society, lifestyles and buying habits are also changing rapidly.
Conventional banking business models are no longer enough to meet customer needs. BBVA has been able to anticipate and evolve, offering our customers new, more simple solutions that they can access how, where and when they want. All this has been possible due to the use of technology as a strategic element to differentiate us from our competitors.
And even more importantly, at BBVA we are working for a better future for people, our customers, our employees and society at large. The BBVA team are part of a corporate culture based on the principles of integrity, prudence and transparency, which have been key in allowing us to build a strong business model that is able to grow and is very customer centric.
I invite you to browse through the Group’s corporate website, the best online storefront to find out in detail who we are and how we work, reflecting our commitment to transparency.
I also suggest you visit the Group’s other websites that can be accessed from here. There you will find the widest range of products and services, designed and engineered to meet the specific needs of each of our customers.

History of BBVA
The history of BBVA is the story of many people who, since the mid-nineteenth century, have formed part of over a hundred financial institutions that progressively joined together to widen business horizons. Today BBVA is working for a better future for people, searching for lasting customer relationships that will change the perception of business. As a result of this work BBVA has become a veritable point of reference at international level as a highly-regarded, award-winning bank.
BBVA has its eyes firmly fixed on the future and is a pioneer in adapting to the changing requirements of an increasingly global market, in short, to the bank of the 21st century. This vision is backed by one and a half centuries of history.








The beginnings
BBVA’s story starts in 1857 when the Spanish Board of Trade sponsored the creation of Banco de Bilbao as a currency-issuing and discount bank. This was a pioneer initiative driven by economic growth in the region. Until the 1890s it was practically the only bank in that part of Spain.







In 1872, the law passed on December 2 created Banco Hipotecario (BHE) with the aim of granting long-term loans for property.
In the second half of the 19th century Banco de Bilbao played a leading role in operations involving infrastructure projects and development of the steel industry. In 1878 it lost the right to issue currency and reorganized as a lending and discount bank.Banco de Vizcaya was set up in 1901. It carried out its first operations in Bilbao and gradually spread throughout the country. Apart from its activities as a commercial and general purpose bank, it intervened in the creation and development of a large part of the Spanish industrial sector.In 1902 Banco de Bilbao merged with Banco del Comercio, although both continued to operate as separate entities.
In 1909 Caja Postal was set up as a public entity and started operations in 1916, with the issuing and administration of savings books.
A consortium of bankers and manufacturers founded Banco de Crédito Industrial (BCI) in 1920 with the express aim of boosting the installation and consolidation of industry through long-term lending. Both Banco de Bilbao and Banco de Vizcaya formed part of this consortium.
In 1923 the Servicio Nacional de Crédito Agrícola was created under the ministry of agriculture to provide loans to agricultural associations against the joint and several liability of their members.

Expansion
Against a background of economic development in the 1960s, Banco de Bilbao grew further, absorbing other banks and started to create a financial group. At the same time Banco de Vizcaya also continued to develop as a modern universal bank and began to emerge as an important financial group. Greater flexibility by the authorities with regard to new branches allowed it to extend its network.
Caja Postal added opening current accounts, trading in securities and granting specific credit lines to its existing services.The Banking Sector Reform Act 1962 nationalized BCI, BHE and BCL and converted the Servicio Nacional de Crédito Agrícola into Banco de Crédito Agrícola (BCA). All four thus became public entities. However in 1971 they were recast as joint stock companies and became official loan entities(under the Official Credit System Act).
During the 1980s Banco de Bilbao’s strategy was to attain sufficient size in order to participate in financial business generated by advances in technology, deregulation, securitization and the interrelationship between domestic and international markets.
Banco de Vizcaya contributed to the refloating of banks affected by the economic turmoil and pursued a policy of strong growth through acquisitions. This turned it into a large banking group. The most important operation was the acquisition of Banca Catalana in 1984.
In the meantime the official credit entities expanded their business through market operations. In 1982 BEX lost the exclusive right to provide export finance. It refocused its goals on becoming a universal bank and on building a financial group. During this process it acquired Banco de Alicante (1983).
In 1988 Banco de Bilbao and Banco de Vizcaya merged to form BBV.
Corporación Bancaria de España was set up in 1991 as a government corporation and credit entity with bank status. It started out with a federated banking model. However in 1998 Corporación Bancaria de España (already privatized via IPOs), BEX (which had merged with BCI), BHE and Caja Postal were merged into a single bank: Argentaria.

The creation of BBVA
BBV and Argentaria announced their planned merger on 19th October 1999. The goal was to continue creating value. The new bank (BBVA) had the advantages of significant size, a strong capital base, a considerable financial structure and appropriate geographic diversification of its business and risks. As a result there was a greater profit potential.




In 1999, BBVA was created with a significant size, a strong capital base and a considerable financial structure. 







Customers now had access to a bigger network and a wider range of products. They also enjoyed easier access to new channels and a considerable international presence.Employees also had more opportunity for career advancement.
The integration of BBVA went very smoothly. This was attributed to the following:

The speed of strategic decisions. The immediate definition of the new organization and a general agreement with employees.
The speed with which working groups were set up and plans were made for each area of activity.
The successful achievement of ambitious timetables – with time to spare in some cases.
The enthusiasm, commitment, effort and co-operative spirit of everyone at BBVA.

The integration process was given an important boost in January 2000 by the roll-out of the single BBVA brand. This helped the group to quickly generate an image that was strongly positioned in terms of identity and distinguishing characteristics. The BBVA integration process was carried out with speed and efficiency and concluded in February 2001.
The integration of the group’s retail businesses in Spain (BBV, Argentaria, Banca Catalana, Banco del Comercio and Banco de Alicante) made it possible to leverage the potential of a significant branch network under the BBVA brand.
The efficiency of the BBVA integration was recognized by top financial publications. In 2000 it was chosen World’s Best Bank (Forbes) and Best Bank in Spain (The Banker). In 2001 it was Best Bank in Latin America (Forbes) and Best European Bank (Lafferty).

Transformation of BBVA
BBVA has earned a spot among the world’s leading financial institutions, more so after the recent financial crisis, during which it showcased notable strengths:  Recurrence of results, structural resilience in any scenario and value generation for our stakeholders, a value that will grow even more thanks to the technological capabilities we have been developing and which will allow us to deliver on our goal to become the best bank in the digital era.




New competitive environment
The World has changed, tthe rules have changed, and, therefore, the way in which business is done has too. Now more than ever, in this new environment, the customer has more power than ever. This is also true in the banking sector. On one hand, after the post-crisis restructuring process, there is more regulation. On the other, new technologies have driven a digital transformation that has acted as a catalyst, enabling the ascent of new competitors.
The result is that people have new needs. In their new way of life, customers feel they need to be connected, anywhere, anytime. They also want their needs to be met immediately, including the consumption of relevant, useful contents. And customers are becoming increasingly aware about the benefits that smart data can bring.

Changes in the post-crisis industry:

○      New tougher and increased banking regulation.
○      Restructuring process.
○      Reputation

New competitors

○      Arrival of start-ups and fintech companies,

New technologies

○      Mobile banking grows
○      Customers more interested on mobile banking than branches
○      Big Data, Blockchain, the Cloud, A.I. (Machine Learning)
New customer expectations and behaviors
There is a growing demand among customers looking for new ways to interact with banks.

In the new ecosystem of horizontal relations, customers are one click away, one second away from the competition. They look for the user friendliness and streamlined processes that they have come to expect from online banking, as part of their access habits through multiple digital channels.
Only by offering a compelling customer experience, that meets our customers’ demands, will we at BBVA be able to claim that our business model is really customer-centric.





Vision / Purpose
The new competitive scenario requires us to place customers right at the center of everything we do:
-Offering the best banking solutions, in accordance with their needs
-Helping them make better financial decisions
-Having a positive impact on people’s lives and companies’ activities.
These needs help us define better our purpose, which will inspire both internal and external stakeholders. Keeping this objective in mind, BBVA has defined a new Purpose that will serve as a guide in our strategy and decision making process, a purpose that is aligned with our future vision:




Strategic Priorities
We began our transformation process in 2007. Since then, we have developed our own platforms and are now adapting to the new paradigm of exponential growth. And all of this with a clear objective in mind: putting technology to the service of our customers.
To guide us in this journey, we defined six strategic priorities for the entire BBVA Group:

 A new standard in customer experience, the keystone of our strategy:

Wikipedia defines “customer experience” as the product of an interaction between an organization and a customer during the duration of their relationship (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_experience). This relationship includes a series of interactions or customer journeys that encompass several different concepts: attraction, awareness, discovery, cultivation, advocacy and purchase and use of a service.
a.- Easy, tailor-made solutions
b.- Planned decisions and monitoring tools

 Drive digital sales:

All channels are important but digital channels are different. They  have the greatest potential for growth, and are not as developed in the financial sector as in other sectors. There are huge opportunities. In order to take advantage of them, consistent models need to be created that are supported by research, using simple and understandable metrics. Increasing digital sales will help us to grow in a way that sets us apart.
a.- Exponential sales growth in digital channels with a focus on mobile phones.
b.- Driver to boost business and improve customer experience.

New business models:

The way people do their banking is changing and moving toward new experiences. For this reason, we feel new business models are needed.
a.- A new paradigm versus traditional banking
b.- To adapt to this new ecosystem, we have taken two approaches:
i.- Developing new business models internally
ii.- Partnering with disruptive startups and investing in companies with high potential for digital transformation

 Optimize capital allocation:

Optimizing capital allocation is essential, as it allows us to maximize profit over time.
a.- Meet the higher RORCA regulatory requirements
b.- Our model has proven to be robust in the face of the financial crisis, but the current macro environment requires additional effort in capital allocation.

 Unrivaled efficiency.

At BBVA we want our efficiency level to always remain below 50%. We will rely on strategic indicators with real-time metrics and conscientious tracking and will monitor recurring and transformation costs.
a.- Simplify processes by using the latest technology in order to have a presence in the different channels in the most efficient manner.
b.- Make our experience accessible to our customers in order to provide them the highest quality.

 A first class workforce.

We are committed to our employees and to empathizing with customers’ needs.
a.- Development, inspiration and talent retention.
b.- Experience when determining priorities





Moving ahead in our digital transformation

Products and digital sales


Development of products and technological services such as:
Traditional products (mortgages, car insurance, one-click credit, etc.)

New business models. We are creating new sources of income for the group with a wide range of digital business models:


Digital M&A
Investing in disruptive startups
In-house developments
Strategic alliances


Cultural change: We are transforming our internal organization to promote a new culture:


New ways of working: Agile, with collaborative tools
Collaborative cultures, entrepreneurship (trial-error)

At BBVA, we are accelerating our transformation process to become the best bank for our customers.

USA Patriot Act
USA Patriot Act: What is it and how does it apply to BBVA?
The USA Patriot Act is a U.S. law approved in 2001 following the September 11th terrorist attacks. Its main purpose is to increase government control to fight terrorism and improve different U.S. security agencies’ capacities through coordination and granting the agencies greater monitoring power.
One of the ways in which the USA Patriot Act combats terrorism is by the monitoring banks in order to prevent money laundering, a source of funding for terrorist groups.
In accordance to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act, all banks located outside the U.S. that wish to engage in or maintain international relations  with a U.S. bank  or broker/dealer are required to provide certain information about the nature of their business and their supervision.
That’s how the USA Patriot Act applies to BBVA.

FATCA
The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is a law introduced by the U.S. Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to encourage enhanced tax compliance and transparency with respect to U.S. citizens or residents. FATCA requires financial institutions around the world to identify U.S. persons that have foreign bank accounts, among others, and report them to the U.S. tax authorities. To ensure compliance, a 30% withholding tax will be imposed on certain payments to non-compliant institutions and individuals.
BBVA, along with its subsidiaries and branches, is committed to help ensure international tax compliance while maintaining high standards of customer data security. BBVA is therefore proactively implementing changes in its current business practices to ensure compliance with FATCA.
BBVA institutions affected by FATCA have already been registered with the IRS and will appeal in the next official IRS list of participating financial institutions.
FATCA requires financial institutions across the globe to fulfill certain requirements:
>>Identify the following customers with a BBVA account:

U.S. citizens or residents
U.S. corporations
Certain legal institutions, mainly private equity entities owned by U.S. citizens
Account holders who fail to provide identification documents when requested

>>Report information on account holders listed above to the IRS or local tax authorities. This information includes:

Personal information: name, address and U.S. Tax Identification Number (US TIN)
Account information: account number, account balance and payments made or received in the account

>>Withhold 30% from account holders on certain payments from the U.S. (mainly interest and dividends) that fail to comply with FATCA .
However, It is not expected that FATCA will affect most of BBVA’s customers. FATCA entered into force on July 1, 2014. Reporting began in 2015.
Please note that BBVA does not provide tax advice. If required, we recommend our customers seek independent advice on FATCA from a professional tax advisor. BBVA and its subsidiaries are not liable for any errors, omissions or opinions contained within this document.

Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for. Language definitions Where guidance is non-specific as to dates for completion, the following is used. Project to be completed by 2018 = December 31, 2017 Project to be completed in 2018 = December 31, 2018

        Spain's capital will for the first time host the Service Design Global Conference (SDGC17), the leading event in 'service design.'
      

        BBVA will be the principal sponsor of the upcoming edition of the Service Design Global Conference, one of the most important meetings of the international design community, which will be held this year in Madrid.
      

        The Service Design Network (SDN), which is organizing SDGC2017, expects over 650 attendees at the event, including designers, academics and presenters from around the world. The principal international design schools will also be represented, including the Istituto Europeo di Design and the Savannah College of Art and Design. These leading design institutions are great promoters of the service design discipline, due to its importance in the conceptualization of new products and services.

        The field of service design has come a long way in recent years.  In complex data-based environments and information systems, where users have to navigate between different channels, service design allows connecting and giving meaning to these relationship moments, also known as touchpoints, between companies and their customers.
      

        In this sense, the most pioneering institutions have become aware of the importance of the experiences that their services deliver.  'If they generate customer value, this will positively impact business results,' said Rob Brown, BBVA's head of Marketing, Design & Responsible Business.
      

        Brown recalled that the origins of service design can be traced to the public sector. In recent years, sectors such as finance, telecommunications and retail started adopting these practices.  Since then, design and the area known as 'service design', have become a key part of building customer relationship models.  He said: 'BBVA is a clear example of the integration of design at a strategic level within the organization, where its role has evolved quickly and has resulted in the creation of the first global and multidisciplinary team.'
      

SDGC2017 has become one of the most important forums of the design sector, allowing designers and experts to share experiences and new lessons in the field. 'An event of this kind is the perfect environment for learning, networking and exchanging experiences with the largest community of designers in the world. We're delighted to join the SDN in showcasing the enormous contribution that service design has made in our daily work,' said Brown.
      

        SDN president Birgit Mager said, 'Bringing the 10th global Service Design Network conference to Madrid is a great opportunity to share with the Spanish public and private service sector the impact Service Design has on innovation and quality of services. Having BBVA as our key sponsoring partner is very meaningful for us. Just now Forrester is celebrating BBVA for having as the best mobile banking service in the world . This and many other outstanding achievements are also rooted in the systematic application of Service Design,  so BBVA is a role-model for innovation in the (financial) service domain.'

        For BBVA's Brown, 'The theme of this year's conference, 'Service design at scale,' is one of the challenges that many companies like BBVA will soon have to face. We are already working to bring design to a global scale, in an organization with a very diverse culture that offers services to 70 million customers around the world.'
      

        The meeting in Madrid, the tenth to date, will be held at La N@ve, a space dedicated to new technologies that recently hosted MoneyConf 2017. SDGC17 will position the Spanish capital as one of the design powers, alongside New York, Amsterdam and Stockholm.
      

        During the two days of activities, the experts attending SDGC17 will attempt to answer questions such as the evolution of service design in an increasingly digital and technological world, the approximation of projects according to their scale and the importance of the design of the so-called touchpoints that go beyond a specific product or service.
