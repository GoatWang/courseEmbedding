Patent number:  9709307
                                            

Abstract:  Servicing devices and methods of use for servicing refrigerant systems are described herein. A servicing device may include a body and actuator. The body includes a first fluid port that is coupleable to a fluid port of a fluid source; a second fluid port, that is operatively couples to a refrigeration system; a passage in fluid communication with the first and second fluid ports and in fluid communication; and a plunger at least partially disposed in the passage of the body, and the plunger is adjustable between a released position and an engaged position, during use. The actuator is coupled to the body, and, during use, downward movement the actuator raises or lowers a plunger such that substantially continuous fluid communication between the first fluid port and the second fluid port is established.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Grant

Composite boards and a method of making the same



Patent number:  8586655
                                            

Abstract:  A composite board is manufactured from hydrophobic coconut coir fibers which have been treated to remove at least a portion of coconut pith therefrom; and a hydrophobic vinyl polymer, such as a polyolefin. The composite board is manufactured without any step of chemically modifying coconut coir fibers. The composite board is manufactured by removing at least a portion of coconut pith from coconut coir fibers using a cyclonic separator; combining coconut coir fibers with a hydrophobic polymer to form a mixture; and extruding the mixture to form a composite board.

REFRIGERANT CHARGING ASSEMBLIES AND METHODS OF USE



Publication number:  20130118187
                                            

Abstract:  Refrigerant charging systems and methods of use are described herein. A refrigerant charging system may include a conduit, a valve releasably connectable to the outlet portion and coupled to a first end of the conduit; and a disconnect coupler fitting connected to a second end of the conduit. The disconnect coupler fitting may include a control structure positioned in a hollow body that, during use, allows refrigerant flow to the refrigerant circuit. The control structure may include one or more openings that allow controlled leakage of fluid from the refrigerant charging assembly when the refrigerant charging assembly is disconnected from at least the refrigerant service unit.

Publication number:  20120324920
                                            

Abstract:  Servicing devices and methods of use for servicing refrigerant systems are described herein. The servicing device may include a body and a plunger. The body may include a first fluid port, a second fluid port, and a passage. The first fluid port operatively couples to a fluid port of a fluid source. The second fluid port operatively couples to a refrigeration system. The passage is in fluid communication with the fluid ports of the body and in fluid communication with a measuring device. A plunger is at least partially disposed in the passage of the body. A first portion of the plunger is engagable with an integrated valve of the fluid source. Adjustment of the plunger to a released position allows communication between the second fluid port and the measuring device while inhibiting communication between the first fluid port and the fluid source.

Publication number:  20110041522
                                            

Abstract:  Various embodiments of adapter systems and related apparatus, and methods of operating the same are described. The adapter of the systems is couplable to an outlet of a fluid source and an inlet of a routing device. The adapter includes a plunger configured to engage an integrated valve of the fluid source and to receive a member of the routing device. The routing device member includes an end capable of breaking a seal. Coupling of the routing device to the outlet may advance the plunger such that plunger engages the integrated valve and at least partially opens the integrated valve.
