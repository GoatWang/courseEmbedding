Abel, Paul C
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Minnesota:













How important is contractor licensing in Minnesota?



Contractors acting as sole proprietors, or qualifying persons for a construction related business entity, must pass a two part exam. The first section tests building code compliance knowledge. Section two tests a candidate's understanding of Minnesota business and law.











Your liability risk when hiring Abel, Paul C



Licensed contractors in Minnesota must carry both active workers' compensation and general liability insurance policies. Request a copy of the insurance certificate for each before any work begins. 











Financial recourse when hiring Abel, Paul C



The purpose of the Minnesota Contractor Recovery Fund is to compensate consumers who have suffered losses due to a licensed contractor's fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest practices, conversion of funds, or failure to perform. All licensed contractors are required to pay a fee to the fund. The total amount that can be paid out against any one licensed contractor is $75,000. If multiple claims are filed against the same contractor, they are prorated. In these situations, you may not be able to recover your entire loss. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Minnesota, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Biography
Paul G Abel is an astronomer, mathematician and a co-presenter on the BBC's The Sky at Night. Paul has written for many popular astronomy magazines promoting amateur astronomy and the science that amateurs can contribute to the field. He regularly gives talks to various astronomical societies and speaks at astronomical events. Paul has an observatory in his garden (or converted garden shed, to give it its real name), which houses his telescope. From there he makes frequent observations of the Moon and the planets. He is a visual observer and prefers to draw what he sees and records his own observations in log books. Dr Abel is currently an Astronomer in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at the University of Leicester, where he teaches and looks into the mysteries of Hawking Radiation. He trained as a mathematician, and his PhD is in an area of Theoretical Physics concerned with evaporating black holes. Paul is currently assistant director of the Saturn section of the British Astronomical Association, and a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society.
