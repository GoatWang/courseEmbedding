I have many wonderful memories  of Ed  for over 30 years--both professional and personal. He was a man of great intelligence, integrity and talent , who also had a beautiful heart and soul. I am truly saddened by our losing him. My sincere sympathy to his wonderful family. Chip O'Shea

Ed was my best friend thru High School, went to college together, was my best Man in my wedding and our families stayed connected through our lives. Ed and his family was an extended member of all the Vespucci families. His values were centered around his family and was a leader in the community. He will be deeply missed and my prayers go out to his family . I will miss him like a brother and cherish all the times we had together. A true friend.Al Vespucci
