Welcome

About Susan
I bring my passion for food, health, faith and the arts to create colorful campaigns for clients nationwide. I work with nonprofits, book authors, government agencies and small business owners.
Collaborative Approach to Your Design
My approach is collaborative: I ask questions. I listen. I learn what you need. And then I create designs that truly reflect your cause or your product, that speak straight to your audience.
Services
I’m equally expert in print and online design. We can start with any project, big or small in scope.
Working Together
Learn more about me, the services I provide, projects I’ve worked on, and how we can get started working together. Then contact me for a free half hour consultation.
Workshops
I’m pleased to announce that I’m teaching a series of workshops called: Creating an Online Presence.  There are more being scheduled in December 2013…  > Read More Here

In 1990, Ms. Sneidmiller participated in the Performance calibration grading session with the Bar Examiners, giving her a unique insight into what the Bar Examiners require in a passing answer. Ms. Sneidmiller focuses her Performance instruction on the skills the Bar Examiners expect bar candidates to demonstrate in order to pass the Performance testing format.

In addition to maintaining her private practice, Ms. Sneidmiller is a certified Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) for the CA Superior Court, appointed by judges on a case-by-case basis to conduct independent investigations and present recommendations at court hearings for placement of children in the foster care system.
