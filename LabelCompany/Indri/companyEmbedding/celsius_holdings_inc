Celsius Holdings, Inc. Expands to Hong Kong with New Entity: Celsius Holdings Asia Limited - Product Distribution Now Hits retail through A.S. Watson






Jul 10, 2017, 8:30am EDT














BOCA RATON, Fla., July 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CELH), the makers of CELSIUS®, a clinically proven fitness drink, today announced significant corporate milestones, advancing the Company's position with an international presence in Hong Kong.  The Hong Kong expansion is the fruition of an alliance which began in November 2016, when Celsius Holdings, Inc. reached a distribution agreement with A.S. Watson Group (ASW), the largest international health and beauty retailer in Asia and Europe.
Celsius Holdings, Inc. will partner with A.S. Watson Industries, a member of ASW, which owns the renowned bottled water brand Watsons Water, and also other beverage distributing businesses.  The partnership will focus on Hong Kong distribution, increasing market share and leveraging the CELSIUS® brand.   
Kim Siu, General Manager – Marketing of A.S. Watson Industries is glad to launch CELSIUS® in Hong Kong, "A.S. Watson Industries has been expanding our product portfolio, to offer more health-enhancing beverage products to customers. CELSIUS® is an ideal partner to our expansion, a scientifically proven, high performance fitness drink with great taste, providing unique calorie reduction and fat-burning benefits, which is perfect for all occasions. We are excited to become the exclusive distributor of CELSIUS® in Hong Kong, which will be launched in key supermarket and convenience store chains. We hope that the introduction of CELSIUS® will be able to bring the health and fitness lifestyle of HK people to another level."
As part of the global mission, Celsius Holdings, Inc., has set up a new business entity in Hong Kong known as Celsius Asia Holdings Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary focused on Asia expansion.  The new entity is based in the Causeway Bay area of Hong Kong and led by Roger C. Ng, Managing Director, Asia.  Joining Ng are three experienced beverage industry veterans; Ronnie Char serving as General Manager, Asia; Jeremy One, leading the Sales and Marketing efforts, and Chris Lee, leading the Digital Marketing. 
"We have built a solid leadership team for Asia," said Ng.  "Each of the executives has cross-functional business experience, and understands how to launch and elevate a brand.  Ronnie, Jeremy and Chris worked together at Red Bull Asia and helped launch the brand locally.  Collectively, we are driven to put CELSIUS® fitness drinks in the hands of health-conscious consumers through our Asian expansion."
"Furthermore," said Ng, "one of the first initiatives for Celsius Asia Holdings Limited was the debut of two signature flavors, Cola and Peach Mango.  The company unveiled the drinks at the recent HKXP event organized by Li Ka Shing Foundation to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). On the retail side, CELSIUS® fitness drinks will be available to consumers on July 10 through A.S Watson distribution."
"The HKXP event showcased some of the most innovative lifestyle and technology companies which are redefining consumer mindsets.  It's all about functional technology," said Ronnie Char, General Manager, Asia. "We see the intersection of both functional and technology in our portfolio, and that's where it all makes sense. CELSIUS® has been popular in other countries, and, based on our research, we think the consumers in the Hong Kong market will enjoy a great tasting fitness drink – and incorporate its 'functionality' into their innovative lifestyles."
"The extension of our CELSIUS® brand into Hong Kong establishes our presence in Asia and provides a significant opportunity to expand in the region," said John Fieldly, interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Celsius Holdings, Inc.  "We have done our homework and are creating the brand awareness, and leveraging shelf space for fitness drinks in Hong Kong.  Part of our mantra is to educate consumers about the benefits of a healthy fitness drink that our beverage portfolio provides.  The debut of Cola and Peach Mango in Hong Kong are just the start of our exciting and innovative brand launch."
Recently, Celsius Holdings, Inc. has boosted brand awareness and corporate equity with second quarter landmarks including an up-listing on the NASDAQ, the first ever (natural) line extension, and a new, second product in the portfolio, CELSIUS HEAT™.  In April 2017, the CELSIUS® brand was named "Best Functional Drink" at the Innovbev Global Beverage Congress Awards held by Zenith Global, in Frankfurt, Germany.  In addition, according to SPINS nationwide data, the CELSIUS® brand is now the second fastest growing 'energy / other functional product' (SPINS, MULO 52wks ending 4.22.17).
About A.S. Watson Group
Established in Hong Kong in 1841, A.S. Watson Group is the largest international health and beauty retailer in Asia and Europe with 13,300 stores in 25 markets. Each year, over three billion customers and members shop with our 13 retail brands, both in stores and online.
A.S. Watson Group is also a member of the world-renowned multinational conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings Limited, which has five core businesses - ports and related services, retail, infrastructure, energy and telecommunications in over 50 countries.

About Celsius Holdings, Inc.
Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CELH), founded in April, 2004, is a global company, with a proprietary, clinically proven formula for its brand CELSIUS®. Celsius Holdings, Inc., has a corporate mission to become the global leader of a branded portfolio which is proprietary, clinically proven or innovative in its category, and offers significant health benefits.
CELSIUS®' original line comes in seven delicious sparkling and non-carbonated flavors in sleek 12oz cans, and is also available in single serve powdered packets. CELSIUS®' new natural line is available in six refreshing flavors: three sparkling and three non-carbonated, this line is naturally caffeinated and naturally sweetened.
New to the portfolio, CELSIUS HEAT™, a trainer's grade version of the proprietary blend, offers additional caffeine as well as L-citrulline, a proven vasodilator.  CELSIUS HEAT™ is sold in 16oz cans and is available in three carbonated flavors: Inferno Punch, Cherry Lime and Blueberry Pomegranate.  CELSIUS HEAT™ targets professional trainers, endurance & competitive athletes, those who focus on defined, physical fitness results, and the military, versus the flagship line which comes in a smaller package and appeals to the masses, as an active lifestyle brand.
CELSIUS® has no preservatives, no aspartame, no high fructose corn syrup, and is non-GMO, with no artificial flavors or colors. The CELSIUS® line of products is kosher and vegan certified, soy, gluten, and sugar free and contains very little sodium.  CELSIUS ® is sold nationally at Fitness Clubs, 7-Eleven stores, Sprouts, The Fresh Market, and key regional retailers such as HEB, Publix, Winn-Dixie, Harris Teeter, Shaws and others. The first university study of the science underlying CELSIUS® products was conducted in 2005, and additional studies from the University of Oklahoma were conducted over the next five years. All studies were published in peer-reviewed journals and validate the unique benefits CELSIUS® provides.

Launches Second Line of Products for Continued Growth

BOCA RATON, Fla., May 11, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Celsius Holdings Inc. (OTCQX:CELH), the maker of CELSIUS®, the leading global fitness drink, today reported financial results for the three month period ended March 31, 2017. 
First Quarter 2017 Highlights:

Revenue of $6.0 million, up 63.1% compared to $3.7 million in the year ago quarter


Domestic revenue increased 81% to a record $4.8 million, up from $2.7 million in the year ago quarter

International revenue increased 18% to $1.2 million, up from $1.0 million in the year ago quarter

Gross profit of $2.4 million, inclusive of a one-time charge of $235,000 for the write-down of old packaging and fees associated with label changes, compared to $1.5 million in the year ago quarter

Net loss to common stockholders of $(2.0) million compared to $(1.3) million in the year ago quarter

Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA* of $(322,000), excluding $725,000 of non-recurring expenses, including CEO retirement and transition expenses of $490,000, inventory write-down of $194,000 and packaging label changes of $41,000, compared to $(886,000) in the year ago quarter

Launched the second line in the product portfolio, CELSIUS HEAT™, a new trainer's grade dietary supplement targeting athletic trainers, body builders, military personnel and endurance athletes 

"Our financial results reflect a robust start to our ongoing business operations in 2017 with total revenue up 63% on increased volume in both domestic and international markets," said John Fieldly, Interim President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. "During the first quarter of 2017 we completed our rebranding, pioneering our position as the leading global fitness drink by adding a global brand mark iconic 'C' to our packaging and the tagline 'Live Fit'. We launched our second product line, CELSIUS HEAT™, as scheduled late in the first quarter, and it is being well received among the personal training, body building and elite athlete communities. CELSIUS HEAT™ is initially available in Vitamin Shoppe®, 24Hour Fitness®, Gold's Gym®, hi-health®, Youfit, and other fine retailers. 
"Our efforts to improve profitability by controlling and reducing our cost of goods continue, while we execute our plans for global expansion, broader distribution and entry into new markets against a backdrop of strong and growing consumer demand for healthy beverages," concluded Fieldly.
Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2016
Revenue
Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016 was $6.0 million and $3.7 million, respectively, an increase of 63%. This increase was driven primarily by a 81% growth in domestic revenue associated from blended growth rates of 47% in retail accounts arising mainly from growth in existing accounts and expansion of convenience store distribution initiatives, 88% growth in internet retailer accounts and 237% in health and fitness accounts mainly derived from growth in existing account and the initial launch of Celsius Heat™ into the channel from the same period in 2016.  
Gross profit
Gross profit was $2.4 million, or 39.7% of revenue, in the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $1.5 million, or 41.3% of revenue, for the same period in 2016. The increase in gross profit is primarily due to increases in revenue and reductions in the cost of raw materials. The decrease in gross profit margin is due to a one-time charge of $235,400 associated with a write-down of old packaging and fees associated with label changes. Excluding this one-time charge, gross profit margin increased 230 basis points to 42.0% compared to the prior year period.  
Operating expenses
Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016 were $2.2 million and $1.8 million, respectively. The 20% increase is due primarily to increases in investments in human resources of $247,000, warehousing of $41,000 and increases in marketing programs of $69,000. 
General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016 were $2.1 million and $875,000, respectively. The increase was primarily the result of non-recurring expenses including $490,000 for CEO retirement and transition expenses, $328,000 of stock-based compensation for directors as well as an increase in options expense of $200,000 and investments in human resources, professional fees and research and development, all of which were partially offset by a reduction in travel expenses. 
Other expense
Total other expense was $48,000 and $57,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, respectively as a result of lower interest expense on a lower outstanding debt balance.
Net Loss
For the three months ended March 31, 2017, Celsius had a net loss of $1.9 million, and after giving effect to preferred stock dividends of $90,245, a net loss to common stockholders of $2.0 million or $0.05 per share based on a weighted average of 41,783,853 shares outstanding. In comparison, for the three months ended March 31, 2016 the company had a net loss of $1.2 million, and after giving effect to preferred stock dividends of $86,652, a net loss to common stockholders of $1.3 million or $0.03 per share based on a weighted average of 38,380,380 shares outstanding.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of March 31, 2017, the company had cash of $20.9 million compared to $11.7 million as of December 31, 2016. The company had working capital of $24.2 million and $15.4 million as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. 
Cash used in operations during the three months ended March 31, 2017 totaled $861,000. The company incurred a net loss of $2.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017, increasing the accumulated deficit to $55.3 million as of March 31, 2017.

Celsius HEAT is a totally different product since it contains 2000 mg of Citrulline. The gym rats love the effect of Citrulline. It gives you more of a "pumped feeling".    This product could also have broad appeal to the military channel, since this market tends to go more for the higher caffeine choices out there.   We doubt that ordinary users of Celsius Energy will migrate over to the Celsius HEAT product.
