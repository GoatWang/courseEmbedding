 How to invest 











Ascent Investment Partners is based in St. Louis and was formed to meet the unique needs of fixed income investors. Because safety and stability are the primary reasons investors include a fixed income allocation in their portfolios, we carefully balance risk and after-tax return in every investment decision. 

Ascent Investment Partners was formed by veterans of the A.G. Edwards internal money management firm, Gallatin Asset Management (A.G. Edwards & Sons is a predecessor firm of Wells Fargo Advisors). Gallatin served as a discretionary fixed income advisor to conservative brokerage clients looking for disciplined investment management.
While at Gallatin, the team offered strategies using both taxable and tax-exempt securities, focusing on principal preservation and prudent trading. Gallatin grew substantially during their tenure in part because the firm offered advisors and their clients personalized service and peace of mind in a rapidly shifting environment. Ascent Investment Partners continues that legacy as a more accessible entity.


Sandra Pourcillie, CFA
Principal
Sandra is a Principal of Ascent Investment Partners, LLC.

Prior to forming Ascent, Sandra oversaw the management of $1.7 billion in separately managed bond accounts for high net worth and institutional clients at Evergreen Investments (successor firm to Gallatin Asset Management, and A.G. Edwards Asset Management).  She was responsible for helping formulate, implement and monitor investment strategy across approximately 2,100 individual accounts.  Prior to the Wachovia and Wells Fargo mergers, she was the manager of the Gallatin fixed income group within A.G. Edwards, Inc.  She also served on the A.G. Edwards & Sons Investment Strategy Committee, which developed the firm’s asset allocation for its managed ETF portfolios (assets totaling approximately $7 billion).
Prior to joining A.G. Edwards in 1997, Sandra served as a municipal credit analyst at Boatmen’s Trust Company, where she evaluated the credit quality and trend of municipal issuers in support of their municipal mutual funds, trust portfolios and tax-exempt money market funds.  Sandra joined Boatmen’s after her tenure with the State of Missouri budget office, where she analyzed, made recommendations on, and tracked Department of Public Safety and Revenue budget requests and legislative/policy initiatives for the Governor of Missouri.
Sandra has been a CFA Charter holder since 1999, and holds Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in political science and economics from the University of Missouri at Columbia.

 AltheaDx 
  
 Since 1998, AltheaDx’s primary mission has been to assist our pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners in discovering and validating genetic biomarkers that can predict drug response.  We provide start-to-finish suite of services focused on genetic biomarker discovery, assay development, assay validation and prospective/retrospective clinical trial testing in support of companion diagnostic development and commercialization.  At the core of our services is a comprehensive set of gene expression and genotyping analysis capabilities for both pre-clinical and clinical applications utilizing state of the art genomics tools including real-time PCR, microarray technologies and next-generation sequencing. 

   Pharmacogentic Testing  
 Individual patient response to medications is influenced by genetic variation in the enzymes responsible for drug metabolism as well as targeted receptors and transporters. The family of cytochrome P450 genes code for enzymes responsible for approximately 80% of phase 1 drug metabolism. Genetic variation of these genes alone is estimated to influence 20-25% of all drug therapies to the extent that outcome is affected. Clinically significant genetic alterations in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes can result in decreased or increased enzyme activity. These alterations in enzyme function are categorized into four phenotypes. Knowing a patient’s metabolic phenotype and its impact on drug metabolism can empower clinical treatment decisions, increase drug efficacy and reduce the risk of adverse events. 

 Tests 



 Extensive Metabolizers (EM) 
                                            Carry 2 functional genes and have normal enzyme activity. Standard medication dosing is appropriate for extensive metabolizers. 
 Poor Metabolizers (PM) 
                                            Lack or have decreased functional enzymes, and a reduced capacity to metabolize substrate medications. Poor metabolizers are at risk for side effects due to toxic drug accumulation and may require lower doses. 
 Intermediate Metabolizers (IM) 
                                            Also lack or have decreased functional enzymes, and a reduced capacity to metabolize substrate medications and therefore may also require reduced drug doses. 
 Ultra-Rapid Metabolizers (UM) 
                                            May need increased medication dosing in order to offset the higher rate of metabolism and experience therapeutic efficacy.

 Ally Clinical Diagnostics 
  
 RWe are bringing diagnostic testing and understanding closer to the community and setting forward on a mission to educate the public about the importance of their individual diagnostic image. Our 20,000 sq. ft. state-of-the-art laboratory in Dallas is home to the newest, avant-garde diagnostic platforms that provide the highest levels of accuracy and quality to our patients and clients. We pride ourselves with lasting patient and client relationships, highly personalized and receptive service, and easy to access diagnostic information. We understand that our patients are more than a specimen and an accession number. We treat each test for what it really is... a LIFE. 

   Clinical Toxicology Laboratory  
 It is well known that the mixing of multiple prescription drugs as well as with illicit drugs can be extremely harmful to a patient. It is important to understand the physiology of their patient, and have assurance that the patient is taking said medication in the prescribed dose. There are numerous accounts of patients either selling medications, or taking multiples from numerous doctors. 
 In today’s world of growing drug use and prescription drug abuse the physicians need to protect themselves from what has become in all likelihood a very real possibility regarding patients. One simple unknown action on the side of a patient could very well result in a doctor losing his license or facing a courtroom. 
 Ally Clinical Diagnostics would love to be this security blanket, we expect nothing more than the highest quality and we strive to deliver this quality to our physicians. We have a turnaround time set at 48 hours or less for all confirmation testing from the minute they reach our door, in most cases you will see results in the same day, which is unheard of in toxicology confirmation testing.

We are Ascent. We break down barriers.





American healthcare is moving towards a holistic, integrated model targeting overall wellness rather than specific services.  To remain competitive and promote positive revenue streams in this new era of accountable care, Ascent Healthcare Group is partnering with organizations to break down the barriers that overcomplicate medical practice and fracture the continuity of care.


 Mark at Ascent Healthcare Group was essential to the success of our project. He provided the perfect mix of Epic experience and management consulting knowledge to help us through trouble spots in our Epic install. He distinguished himself as one of the best consultants we've contracted with and we would not hesitate to work with him again!" - VP of IT at Scott and White Healthcare

Breaking Down BarriersHow we do it?

 


At Ascent Healthcare Group, we have chosen to pursue a different course in the traditional world of healthcare management consultation - one focused not only on fixing today’s problem, but helping you uncover tomorrow’s opportunity. A course founded on overcoming obstacles, promoting operational transparency in the pursuit of quality patient care, and addressing the wellness of your full organization as well as the immediate pain of a specific problem.
American healthcare is moving toward a more holistic, integrated model that targets overall wellness more than specific services.  This transition, although potentially painful, is a necessary trial on the climb to new progressive models of healthcare.  To remain competitive and promote positive streams of revenue in this new era of accountable care, hospitals must work to break down the barriers that overcomplicate medical practices and the doctor-patient relationship.
Ascent can help overcome the barriers that stand between your organization and itself, and ultimately between your organization and those who depend on you for their care. From staff augmentation to leadership in Epic-driven efficiency projects, our team looks forward to assisting your hospital in achieving new levels of visibility, transparency and clinical excellence.
Healthcare is changing, and we believe that the best path to scaling that mountain of change is the one that travels through lucidity, organizational visibility, adaptability and trust. That’s why we chose to call ourselves Ascent - because we want to help you make that journey to the top.

Quality over Quantity
Throughout the American healthcare industry today, quality is driving change: the transition from fee-for-service to overall wellness, a growing focus on long term benefits, and an expanding emphasis on excellence in the institutions, organizations and technologies that deliver medical care.
At Ascent Healthcare, we believe strongly in not “over-solving” problems.  We don’t want to simply help you throw more resources at an issue, ultimately adding new layers of complexity to the original challenge rather than overcoming it.  We want to get to the root cause, applying the best experience available to restore organizational health and operational growth.
