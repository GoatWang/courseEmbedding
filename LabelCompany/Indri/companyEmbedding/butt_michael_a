Will the Butt Buffer fit my motorcycle seat?
The Butt Buffer seat covers come in a variety of different sizes and fit just about any motorcycle seat. Click here to view our sizing chart.


Does the Butt Buffer raise the height of my seat?
Nope. The polymer cushioning on the Butt Buffer is the only material available that can provide incredible comfort with minimal thickness, so your seat stays at the height you want.


Can the Butt Buffer leak like gel or air pads?
Not at all, our hospital-grade seat cushioning is made of a solid and elastic material that doesn’t leak like liquid or gas based seat cushions, even if the cushion is punctured.



Are Butt Buffers hard to clean and maintain?
It’s very easy to keep your Butt Buffer in tip-top shape. We recommend using Scotchguard or a comparable product to protect the fabric. In the rare case your Butt Buffer needs to be cleaned, auto-upholstery cleaner works wonders.


What makes Butt Buffers better than memory foam?
Memory foam needs to be several inches thick to provide any improvement in comfort. However, that’s much to thick for a motorcycle seat cushion. Typical 1/4 inch memory foam seat cushions provide no value at all.


Are Butt Buffers easy to install?
Absolutely! All of our seat cushions come a non-slip bottom, syou can just place it on your bike and go. For added security, almost all of our top cushions come with adjustable velcro straps that can be secured to your seat.

Physics and Chemistry of Interfaces, 3rd Edition

Hans-J�rgen Butt, Karlheinz Graf, Michael Kappl 
ISBN: 978-3-527-41216-7
495 pages
April 2013



















Description
The third edition of this excellent textbook for advanced students in material science, chemistry, physics, biology, engineering, or for researchers needing background knowledge in surface and interface science. 
The general yet comprehensive introduction to this field focuses on the essential concepts rather than specific details, on intuitive understanding rather than learning facts. 
The text reflects the many facets of this discipline by linking physical fundamentals, especially those taken from thermodynamics, with application-specific topics. Similarly, the theory behind important concepts is backed by clearly explained scientific-engineering aspects, as well as by a wide range of high-end applications from microelectronics and biotechnology. Manifold high-end applications from surface technology, biotechnology, and microelectronics are used to illustrate the basic concepts.
New to this edition are such hot topics as second harmonic generation spectroscopy, surface diffusion mechanisms and measurement of surface diffusion, optical spectroscopy of surfaces, atomic layer deposition, superlubricity, bioadhesion, and spin coating. At the same time, the discussions of liquid surfaces, the Marangoni effect, electric double layer, measurement of surface forces, wetting, adsorption, and experimental techniques have been updated, while the number and variety of exercises are increased, and the references updated.

Author Information
Hans-J�rgen Butt is Director at the Max Planck Institue for Polymer Research in Mainz, Germany. He studied physics in Hamburg and G�ttingen, Germany. Then he went to the Max-Planck-Institute of Biophysics in Frankfurt. After receiving his Ph.D. in 1989 he went as a post-doc to Santa Barbara, California, using the newly developed atomic force microscope. From 1990-95 he spent as a researcher back in Germany at the Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysics. In 1996 he became associate professor for physical chemistry at the University Mainz, three years later full professor at the University of Siegen. Only two years later he joined the Max-Planck-Institute of Polymer Research in Mainz and became director for Experimental Physics. 

Karlheinz Graf graduated at the Institute for Physical Chemistry in Mainz, and spent a postdoc year at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). He has served as Project leader at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research, where his research concentrates on droplet evaporation, the structuring of polymer surfaces, and on constructing a MPIA which is a special AFM capable of measuring forces between a solid surface and an adaptive lipid monolayer in a Langmuir trough. Afterwards he was acting Professor in the Physical and in the Analytical Chemistry of the University of Siegen and, later on, a staff scientist at the Gutmann group at the University of Duisburg-Essen. Recently he became Professor for Physical Chemistry at the University of Applied Sciences (Hochschule Niederrhein) in Krefeld.

Michael Kappl studied physics at the University of Regensburg and the Technical University of Munich, and did his PhD thesis work in Ernst Bamberg's group at the Max-Planck-Institute of Biophysics in Frankfurt. After a year of postdoctoral research at the University of Mainz in the group of Prof. Butt, he worked as a consultant for Windows NT network solutions at the Pallas Soft AG, Regensburg. In 2000, he rejoined the group of Prof. Butt. Since 2002 he is project leader at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research. By using focused ion beam methods, his investigates the adhesion and friction of micro- and nanocontacts, and capillary forces.

Reviews
Comments on the previous editions

"A general yet comprehensive introduction to surface and interface science, this book focuses on essential concepts, and includes application from biotechnology to micoelectronics." (Materials World)

"This textbook is really an excellent reference work for advanced students (and their teachers) in material science, chemistry, physics, biology, engineering, or for researchers needing background knowledge in this field. I believe that it should be considered mandatory reading for someone who wants to join this research area. It is very didactic, clear, concise, and well-organized...I really enjoyed reading the book...There are several other books dealing with surface and interface science, but this is probably the best for a general introduction to this subject." (ChemPhysChem)

"... the book is well worth a place on the shelf of material scientists and engineers involved in surface phenomena." (Materials World)

"... an excellent tool that is highly recommendable to students and experts equally." (TU Chemnitz) 

"The book is highly recommended as a source of key information or inspiration and as an introduction to a fascinating and multi-facetted field of research and technology." (Advanced Materials)

Recipes | Bad Byron's Specialty Food Products, Inc.









































































Recipe Categories:
Butt Rub® Barbeque Seasoning
Jubilee® Seafood Seasoning
Unca Duke's Geaux Jus

"For as long as there has been a south, ...food has been central to the region's image, its personality and its character."
- John Egerton, Southern Food, 1987







Recipes







Butt Rub® Barbeque SeasoningButt Rub® originated as a seasoning or “dry rub” to barbeque meats.   We soon discovered though, that it was good on many other things, hence the slogan “A little Butt Rub makes everything better”®.
Butt Rub® has more applications than can be listed here.  With less than half the salt content of most commercially available seasoning salts, about half the heat of the commercial “CAJUN” seasonings and a wonderful balance of salt, pepper, onion, garlic, paprika (for color) and chipotle (smoked sweet red ripened jalapeños), Butt Rub® enhances everything in the kitchen!
A few recipes follow but one rule of thumb:  When cooking in or out, have Butt Rub® handy.  Try it on eggs, potatoes, potato salad, macaroni & cheese, dressings, corn, cantaloupe, popcorn, any meat or game, soups, stew and more. Enjoy!
Jubilee® Classic Gulf South Crabcakes
Yields 6 crabcakes 
Ingredients:

1/2 cup breadcrumbs
3 tablespoons mayonnaise 
2 teaspoons Creole or Dijon mustard 
1 tablespoon Worcestershire 
1 tablespoon green onion, minced 
1 egg, lightly beaten 
2 teaspoons Bad Byron’s Jubilee® Seafood Seasoning 
Dash Tabasco® 
Dash lemon juice 
1 pound lump crabmeat 
Flour and butter as needed  

Directions:
Mix well all ingredients except crabmeat, flour and butter 
Gently fold in crabmeat and mix well. Mold into patties a little larger than golf ball size 
Flatten and dust lightly on each side with flour 
Sauté on medium heat until golden brown on each side (approximately 5
minutes per side)

Meat Loaf Burgers
(submitted by Tom Vogel of Marion, Iowa)
Ingredients:

2 lbs. ground beef or 1 lb. ground beef and 1 lb. pork sausage
1 egg
1 cup bread crumbs
½ cup apple sauce
1 cup shredded cheese (Mozzarella or Swiss)
4 tablespoons ketchup
1 pkg dry onion soup mix
½ tablespoon Bad Byron’s Butt Rub®

Directions:
In a bowl, mix all ingredients together. When ingredients are mixed together, make into patties approximately 4 inches across and approximately ¾ of an inch thick. NOTE: 2 lbs. should make approximately 8 burgers.
Prepare Grill:
Preheat grill to around 300 degrees. When ready to cook, spray or brush grill grate with cooking oil to prevent sticking.
Grilling:
Use ½ tablespoon of Bad Byron’s Butt Rub® to 1½ cup of butter or margarine. Mix and melt in the microwave, stove top, or grill. (Butter or margarine mix is used for basting the meat loaf burgers and buns).
Place burgers on a plate and brush one side of the meat loaf burgers lightly with the melted butter or margarine mix.
Arrange the meat loaf burgers buttered side down on hot grate and brush the other side of the meat loaf burgers lightly with melted butter or margarine mix. Grill until bottoms are nicely browned, approximately 4-5 minutes.
Using a spatula, turn the meat loaf burgers over and baste with butter or margarine mix and grill until they are browned and cook to taste, approximately 5-7 minutes.
Buns:
Using Ciabatta bread or Texas Garlic Toast (my two favorite choices) brush butter or margarine mix on top side of bread, grill until brown, then flip and brush bottom side of bread with butter or margarine mix, grill until brown. Do this during the last two minutes the meat loaf burgers are cooking. Set out toppings (any condiments will work on a meat loaf burger). Put burgers on toasted buns and serve.
Sauce: (optional)
I use the microwave for this.

1/3 cup ketchup
1/3 cup prepared mustard
¼ cup brown sugar

Heat the ingredients at low heat so you will not burn the sauce. Stir until sugar is dissolved. Put meat loaf burger on bun and add sauce. Enjoy.

Butt Rub® White Wine Skillet Chicken
(submitted by Billy Garrett)
Easy, delicious and impressive. I use thighs and legs because I prefer the flavor of the dark meat. This also works very well with pork chops. Serves four.

2 Tbs. olive oil
6 thighs and legs or a chicken, cut into 6 pieces (3-1/2 to 4 lb.)
Bad Byron’s Butt Rub®
Black pepper
1 medium onion, finely chopped
1 cup dry white wine
1 cup homemade or low-salt canned chicken stock
2 Tbs. butter
2 sprigs thyme

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Season the chicken liberally with Butt Rub® and black pepper and sear it in the skillet on the skin side to brown it and to render the fat from the skin, about 5 minutes. Turn the chicken over and cook on the bone side for about 5 minutes. Remove and reserve the chicken.
Pour off all but 2 Tbs. of the fat from the pan. Add the onion, sauté until the onion is well-clarified, about 5 minutes. Add the wine and chicken stock to the pan and stir to deglaze the pan. Put the chicken back into the pan along with the thyme. Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce to a simmer, cover the skillet with a lid, and simmer the chicken in the sauce until cooked through, 35 – 45 minutes.
Remove the chicken and thyme sprigs from the pan, turn the heat to high and bring the liquid to a boil. Reduce the volume of liquid by half, about 5 minutes (or 6 to 7 minutes if you want a thicker sauce). Add the butter, stir to combine, and remove the pan from the heat. Serve the chicken over egg noodles or rice; taste and season the sauce with salt and pepper if necessary and spoon it over all.

Multiple Award Winning Black Bean Chili
(submitted by Doug White, Aggressive Appliances, Orlando, FL)
Ingredients:

1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
½ pound ground beef
½ pound spicy sausage
3 (15 ounce) cans black beans, undrained
1 (14.5 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 ½ tablespoons chili powder
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon dried basil leaves
3 tablespoons Butt Rub®
1 tablespoon cumin
Cayenne pepper to taste
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat; cook onion and garlic until onions are translucent. Add beef and sausage and cook, stirring, until meat is brown. Stir in beans, tomatoes, chili powder, oregano, basil, Butt Rub, cumin, cayenne and vinegar. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer 60 minutes or more, until flavors are well blended.

Butt Rub® & Geaux Jus® Bloody Mary
(submitted by Billy Garrett)

1 ½ oz. vodka
¾ c. V8® juice
½ t. Butt Rub®
½ oz. Geaux Jus®
½ oz. Worcestershire®
Tabasco®  to taste
¼ oz. celery seed
Squeeze of lemon wedge
Squeeze of lime wedge
Celery stick for garnish

Directions:
Combine all ingredients with a cup of ice and shake well.  Garnish with celery stick.
Tastes good & nutritious too!

Grilled White Fish with Butt Rub®
(contributed by Mark Purcell)
With the skin side of the filet down, coat the fish with a little olive oil, butter, Butt Rub® and top with grated parmesan cheese.  Place the fish on tin foil and grill for about 10-15 minutes until a slight crust builds up on the edges.  Or you can broil the fish in the oven for about the same amount of time.

Butt Rub® Maine Beer Chicken aka Deep Fried Heaven
(contributed by Daryl Riggs)
Take 2 whole chickens, remove the gizzards and stuff from the inside.  Take a large trashbag, put chickens inside, pour 4 cans of your favorite beer in with them.  Let them soak for 2 hours, refrigerated.  Do not drink the beer afterwards.  Take the chickens out, rub generously with Butt Rub®, refrigerate for at least 3 hours.  Peel 2 large Vidalia onions, shove inside each chicken, along with 2 cloves of minced garlic.    Get one of those King Cookers ( or similar) fill with peanut oil, bring to 275 degrees, lower chickens inside and let em’ fry for about 35 minutes.

Easy Low Carb – High Protein Meal
(contributed by G Scott Whiting)
Ingredients:

1 can of Choplets
1 serving of Olive Oil
1 can of low carb Alfredo Sauce
1 cup of Sharp Shredded Cheese
1 jar of Butt Rub® BBQ Seasoning

Directions:
Fry the choplets (sprinkling them with Butt Rub® ) in olive oil about 2 minutes on each side over a medium heat, then place them in a baking pan.  Sprinkle cheese over the choplets and pour the alfredo sauce over the entire surface of the choplets and cheese.  Bake the entire dish at 350 degrees for 10-15 minutes.  If you want a nice touch, sprinkle parsley or a little more cheese on the top – or get wild and use both!

Meatless Meat Balls
(contributed by G Scott Whiting)
Ingredients:

3 cups – Oatmeal
3 cups – Bread Crumbs
3 cups – Stove Top Stuffing
3 cups – Special K cereal (really!)
2-3 cups – Sharp Cheddar Cheese (shredded)
2 packages Dry Lipton Onion Soup
3 cups of Water
6 Egg Beaters (or 4 eggs)
3-5 Tbsp of Butt Rub® BBQ Seasoning

Directions:
Mix everything very well together and let stand covered for 20-30 minutes so everything is moistened.  If you need additional water, add another 1/2 cup and mix again.  Form into meatballs and fry in olive oil in a pan.  Put into a baking dish and add BBQ sauce.  Note:  You can also add Mushroom soup and 1/2 can of milk so the mushroom soup is more like a gravy for a Swedish Meatball Style instead of BBQ Sauce.

Quesadilla
(contributed by G Scott Whiting)
Ingredients:

1 package of Frozen Morningstar Farms Griller Crumble
1 package of Quesadilla shells
1 serving of your favorite cheese or various different cheeses (Go Wild!)
1 can Pan Spray
1 serving of Butt Rub® BBQ Seasoning
1 serving of Sour Cream
1 serving of Salsa

Directions:
Precook the Morningstar Frozen Griller Crumble with a good helping of Butt Rub®  BBQ Seasoning and olive oil.  Cook until desired texture (about 3-5 minutes).  Remove and set aside.
In a medium heated pan, spray a quesadilla shell and spray it with a pan spray and lay that side down.  Now the fun part – Add your favorite cheeses on the shell and add a good helping of the griller crumble you precooked.  Put another quesadilla shell on top and spray the top with a non-stick pan spray.  After about 2 minutes, CAREFULLY flip the entire quesadilla so that both sides are cooked golden brown.  Cut in quarters and serve with sour cream and salsa.

Black Bean and Smoked Pork Chili
(submitted by David Ross)
Ingredients:

3 cans black beans, drained
2 lbs leftover smoked pork butt (Note: it’s hard to have leftovers)
1 onion
1 green pepper, coarsely chopped
2 tablespoons Bad Byron’s Butt Rub®
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons oregano
1/4 teaspoon cayenne
1 bay leaf
1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes

Add more water if needed.
Serve over rice or spaghetti.
Garnish with the usual suspects: chopped onion, sour cream, shredded cheese, chopped avocado, etc.

Butt Rub®Sloppy Joes
(submitted by Robert Worsley)

1 tsp Bad Byron’s Butt Rub®
1 medium sweet onion (diced)
Your favorite BBQ Sauce – I like Texas Rib Rangers (mild or spicy)

Butt Rub® Steamed Shrimp
Everyone that has tried it says it’s the best tasting steamed shrimp they have ever had.
For Commercial Steamers:
Lay down a layer of thawed shrimp in steam pan, sprinkle a moderate amount of Butt Rub® on shrimp.  (Adjust the amount of Butt Rub® for your personal taste or that of your customer).  Small to medium in shell shrimp – 3 minutes.  Large in shell shrimp – 4 minutes.  You can also do individual frozen shrimp – just add 1 minute to steam time.
They hold well in a plastic bag.  The flavor will permeate even more in the bag.  This is great for carryout orders.  Serve with butter on the side.  These shrimp can also be served cold.  You can also use the steamer to do Butt Rub® Fish Fillet (try Grouper).  Butt Rub® is also great on steamed crab legs.

Butt Rub® and a Beer
(submitted by Susan Martelli – Grand Cru Wine Cellar)
(Chicken)
This is one of our favorite ways to barbeque chicken. It’s simple, fast, and nearly goof proof. The meat is moist and succulent. The chicken grills from the outside and is steamed from the inside with flavors infused from the onions and herbs.
Ingredients:





2 lb Whole Chicken (fryer)
1/2 Onion, finely sliced
1 12 ounce CAN of American Beer
A few sprigs of fresh herbs, Rosemary works well.




Bad Byron’s Butt Rub® to cover chicken
1 Tablespoon, Hot Sauce
2 Cloves garlic, coarsely chopped





Directions:
Clean the chicken inside and out. Pat dry. Coat the outside of the chicken with Bad Byron’s Butt Rub®.
Stuff the cavity with the onions, garlic and herbs.
Using a can opener (the pointy kind) make about five openings in the top of the can of beer. Pour out half of the beer (If you
like beer-drink it). Add the hot sauce to the beer can.
Carefully place the chicken (this is the tricky part) open end first over the beer can so that the chicken sits upright on the can.
Place the beer can and chicken assembly on the grill and cook with the lid closed until done.

Rob’s Butt Rub® Grilling Technique
(Contribution of Robert Conners, Orlando FL) 
Rob says: “In response to your recipe request my recipe is simply Butt Rub seasoned grilled steak. I really don’t have a recipe as much as a technique that you may share.” 
To begin with, you do not have to pay for an expensive cut of beef to have a steak dinner that tastes like a million. My favorite cut, which is very reasonable and VERY TASTY is referred to as a Chuck Eye Steak. If you find a good cut of it, it will be hard to distinguish it from a Rib Eye in appearance or flavor. 
Now for the technique. When I am grilling pork chops or steaks my preferred method is to grill from the frozen state. As soon as I return from shopping I season generously with Butt Rub and freeze before grilling. The result is the steaks get to take-on the Butt Rub flavors and the grilling process produces a steak that is grilled well and very flavorful on the outside, but remains medium to medium rare or rare & juicy on the inside.
To go with, toss some fresh mushrooms, onions, peppers, etc. in a little olive oil and Butt Rub, skewer them, grill them and ENJOY!

Butt Rub® Roasted Salmon
(Contribution John Jacob, Santa Rosa Beach FL)
Ingredients:

Fresh Salmon fillet with skin removed
Butt Rub® Seasoning
Molasses
Crushed garlic cloves
Balsamic Vinegar

Directions:
Apply a liberal coating of Butt Rub® on both sides.  Let it sit while you prepare the glaze.
Molasses Glaze:  In a sauce pan combine molasses, a couple of cloves of crushed garlic and balsamic vinegar to taste.  Be careful not to overpower with the vinegar.  Also if you have a strong molasses, you can add a small amount of good (grade B) maple syrup.  
Let this mixture simmer for a few minutes.
In a 450-475° oven, roast the salmon fillet on a sheet pan with the molasses mixture on top for about 10-15 minutes.

Rick’s Butt Rub® Pork Loin
(Contribution of Rick Ruark)
Rick says he only shares this recipe with a few quality people, so he thought it was time to share it with his good buddy Bad Byron and his friends.  He calls this the “GOOP” concoction.
You will need: 

1 6-8 lb pork loin
1 cup Wesson oil
3/4 cup Worcestershire
4 tablespoons Butt Rub seasoning
3 tablespoons black pepper
2 tablespoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Use mesquite chips on the coals (IMPORTANT) 
I like to butter-fly the loin to reduce cooking time.  Cook over medium grill (about 310 degrees) 
Continue to baste pork while cooking over grill.  Don’t let the meat dry out.  As you baste continue to sprinkle a little extra Butt Rub on the meat (just a little at a time). 
Use all the “GOOP” concoction when you baste–don’t leave any in the bowl. As you get to the bottom of the bowl you will notice good spices …keep spreading this on the meat, it will form a nice spice crust. 
As the meat reaches 170 degrees internal, pull from the grill and let the meat rest for a couple of minutes. 
Slice into bite size pieces and share with only the closet of friends. 

Butt Rub® Potatoes (Grilled)
(Contribution of Rick Ruark)
Rick says this is a simple recipe that is awesome at his deer camp.
Take a good size baking potato (also good on sweet potatoes) and slice in about 1/2 inch wide pieces, keeping the shape of the potato.
At this point you will want to transfer the whole potato onto a piece of tin foil.
Now, take an onion and slice it into about 1/4 inch wide pieces. 
Here comes the rocket science part of it.  Place the onion slices between the potato slices. 
After you finally get this done, put several large pats of butter on top so when it melts it will get all into it. 
Sprinkle GENEROUSLY with Butt Rub. 
Wrap the potato with the tin foil and put onto a hot grill (about 375 degrees).  Cook until tender. 
Now stand away from the grill and let your friends get to it.  I promise you, it is the best potatoes we have around our camp. 
If you want to get fancy, cook up some bacon and slice into small pieces to put on the potato after you pull it from the fire (you knew I would add meat in here somewhere).

Squeeze a small amount of lemon juice on the fillets and season lightly to moderate with Butt Rub® 
Lightly coat melted butter or olive oil on each catfish fillet

5 cloves garlic
1 roasted bell pepper, small dice




½ bunch green onions, minced
Butt Rub® to taste
Brown sugar, as needed
Chicken stock, 1 cup
Cream, ½ cup

Sauté corn in butter until it begins to brown.
Add diced onion and continue to cook until onions begin to caramelize.

1/3 cup Butt Rub® seasoning
juice from 2 lemons
1 gallon water

Directions:
Agitate the brine with a wire whisk until the salt and sugar dissolve. You can also heat up the brine to help this along.
Place the poultry in a large heavy zip top bag (Can be any thing from Cornish hens to turkey, whole or pieces)
Cover meat with (cool) brine and store refrigerated for 1 hour per pound of meat.
Rinse with cool water and pat dry.
Apply olive oil and a light dusting of butt rub and you are ready to cook.

Butt Rub® Wings
Unbelievably simple and dynamite tasting.  This how I sample people at trade shows and other promotions.
Season chicken wings with Butt Rub® – (No oil, no marinade or any other ingredients)
Grill on a medium high grill until well browned on each side.

Butt Rub® Ribs
Ribs are a tough cut of meat. A common mistake is cooking at too high a temperature, as in grilling. Slow it down and cook ribs indirectly at approximately 225°.
But first, learn to remove the membrane on the back side of the ribs. You can lift it up with a metal skewer. Get a grip and then pull it off. This is to allow seasoning to penetrate both sides of the rack and will also help the fat render off from the ribs.
We season every rib with a moderate application of Butt Rub®. Season prior to placing on the grill. Keep temperature low as mentioned and after the 1st hour mist the ribs lightly with apple or pineapple juice. Baby backs will reach ideal tenderness in approximately 4 1/2 hours and spareribs will need approximately 1 hour more. You may choose to “finish” the ribs with applying a sauce or glaze, the final 15-20 minutes of cooking, although these ribs will be delicious without a sauce.

Jubilee® Seafood SeasoningFrom South Texas to South Florida, Southern cooking traditions meet the Gulf’s bounty with great exuberance. The pinnacle of this relationship can be found in Alabama, along the eastern shore of Mobile Bay. Here, a rare phenomenon known as a “Jubilee” exists when the conditions are just right. Shouts of “Jubilee” can be heard in the night, and locals gather the bay seafood that is waiting for them patiently along the shore. In the spirit of this offering we present Bad Byron’s Jubilee® Seafood Seasoning – The flavor of the Gulf South™.

Jubilee® Seafood Seasoning Fish Stew
(submitted by Ted Whisnant)
In the Pee Dee area of South Carolina, a catfish stew ranks highly with fine dining. The locals have great recipes, but innovations are welcome from any and all. This is my recipe for catfish stew using Jubilee® Seafood Seasoning.
Select 3 to 3 1/2pounds of catfish filets. Use Jubilee® seasoning to rub the filets and then wrap the fish snugly in plastic. Refrigerate overnight.
The following day, fry 4-6 pieces of bacon or fatback. Then sauté 1 to 1 1/2 cups of red, yellow, and green bell pepper with 1 to 1 1/2 cups of chopped red onions in the bacon drippings. Season with salt and fresh ground pepper to taste.
To the sautéed vegetables, add 2 cans of stewed tomatoes, one can of condensed tomato soup, and a one pound package of frozen okra. Season with Tabasco to taste. (You may wish to sauté some jalapeño peppers with the bell peppers; if so, omit the Tabasco). Depending on the liquid in the tomatoes, you may wish to add water. The desired consistency of the finished fish stew is similar to spaghetti sauce.
Add the uncooked fish to the soup (stew) and cook slowly for about one hour. If you wish to dress up the recipe, add uncooked shrimp, canned clams, or scallops. Here in SC we want the fish only.
Meanwhile, prepare a large pot of white rice. We prefer long grain rice, but use whatever you like. I once used Uncle Ben’s Tomato Basil with good results.
Serve the reduced stew ladled over rice with hushpuppies, garlic bread, or even regular sliced bread. Onion rings, french fries, or fried sweet potatoes also go well with fish stew. Some folks like cole slaw served on the side. We like it hot and spicy, but you can adjust this according to your taste. This is a great cold night dish, particularly for a group of men who’ve had a few cocktails.

How Glutimax Butt Enhancement Works



Butt enhancement seems to be the new craze these days, right? All of the women and men are hyping up about enhancing their butt size. And why not? They want to look better at the beach or the pool. It goes back to that old concept- look good, feel good... 

People generally start looking to enhance their butt when their skin is stretched to the point of breaking down. Similar to how elastic will lose it's elasticity over time. Losing collagen and elastin in your skin will also cause fine lines, stretch marks, tone loss and wrinkles too. 

As this gradual breakdown in your skin is happening over time, it is losing collagen and elastin. Along with excessive stretching to the skin, it actually starts to show through to your skin externally to yourself and others. This external area in your skin is scientifically known as the epidermis (skin layers).
                                        



When you start to apply Glutimax, it actually penetrates through the epidermis (the top skin layer) deep down into the second layer of your skin which is known as the dermis. Here is where our all natural formulation of ingredients go to work! This butt enhancement cream goes to work repairing the damage to your skin FAST. It goes to work repairing your skin cells and tissue from the inside, out. 

Glutimax is a safe and very effective micro active topical cream that penetrates deep into your skin! This formula will make your buttocks bigger, rounder and firmer in just weeks! Our formulation is made up of the safest and finest all natural ingredients in the world.



Glutimax butt enhancement cream does what no other product can come close to doing. It is also very gentle and will not irritate your skin!

Buttocks Enhancement Ingredients



Glutimax buttocks enhancement is manufactured in America. It is produced in FDA approved facilities under their strict guidelines and procedures following code. This also ensures you are getting a quality product EVERY TIME made up from the finest quality ingredients we've found on earth. Glutimax maintains a 3 year shelf life if stored in a cool, dry and room temperature area.



Glutimax Buttocks Enhancement Ingredients: Stabilized Aloe Vera Gel, Water, Octyl Palmitate, Black Cohosh Extract, Damiana Extract, Calendula Extract, Saw Palmetto Extract, Don Quai Extract, PEG-8 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Safflower Oil, TEA-Carbomer 940, Squalene, Polysorbate 65, Methyl & Propyl Parabens, Honey, Natural Vitamin E (D-Alpha And Mixed Tocopherols), Niacinamide, Cassia (Cinnamon) Oil, Lepidium Meyenli (Maca) Root Extract, Ascorbic Acid and Fragrance.

Aloe Vera: a succulent plant species that is said to have originated in Sudan and is distributed world wide. The aloe vera benefits for skin health care are astonishing. Aloe has the ability to penetrate the deep various layers of our skin and even reach muscles fast. This penetrates your skin so deep that it can even go past your muscle and absorb into your bones. Science states that Aloe Vera is an antibacterial. It has certainly been proven to speed up wounds in rats when tested on them. For people who have had dermabrasion treatment, their damaged skin healed 38% faster or more when aloe was applied. Aloe vera also acts at the cellular level to nourish and regenerate skin cells which is effective for skin care.

Water: a substance made up from the chemical formula H2O. Water is known to help skin retain it's moisture. Water will carry the body's nutrients into the skin so that your skin will get the nutrients it needs.

Octyl Palmitate: an ester that is also known as Ethylhexyl Palmitate. This topical ingredient is normally found in personal care products for health and beauty such as body lotions and skin moisturizers. It will coat your skin as a lubricant and give it that smooth and soft look.

Black Cohosh: a plant of the buttercup family which is also referred to as Actaea Racemosa. Black cohosh is known to have many unique attributes and helpful to the body's molecular structure.

Damiana: a small shrub that will produce aromatic flowers. It is also known as Turnera Diffusa and has been known to be helpful with physical and sexual performance. It widens blood vessels which is a vasodilation effect. This results in the skin being in a state of relaxation while smoothing muscle cells. The primary function of vasodilation is to increase blood flow to tissue in the body that needs it most.

Calendula: a genus plant in the daisy family that is a species of annual or perennial herbaceous. For hundred of years people have applied it topically to sooth irritated tissue. Calendula perhaps has the longest history of use of any all natural herb in skin care.

Saw Palmetto: an extract of serenoa repens (fruit). This is another ingredient that has been used for many different forms of medicine for hundred of years. It is known to penetrate deep into your body to deliver vitamins, nutrients and more.

Don Quai: an herb from the family Apiaceae in China commonly called the "female ginseng". It is also known as Angelica Sinensis. It will increase blood volume, replenish red blood cells and much more.

Safflower Oil: this all natural lubricant will act as a security wall to prevent water from exiting your skin. This will help your skin retain the moisture and fatty acids it needs to achieve buttocks enhancement results.

Honey: contains natural anti-microbial and antioxidant properties which protect the skin. It rejuvenates depleted skin and also leaves it feeling supple, silky and soft. It is made using nectar from flowers.

Vitamin E: scientifically proven as a preventative topical measure from radical skin damage. It renews skin cells by minimizing oxidative stress. It also helps fight wrinkles, fine lines, cellulite and will promote collagen production.

Niacinamide: this popular 100% natural vitamin will boost skin cell production. It also assists your skin in retaining the moisture and fatty acids it needs to give you those voluptuous curves where desired. Niacinamide also has been proven to stop certain skin cell pigmentation which minimizes unwanted dark spots.

Maca Root: an astonishing super food packed with nutrients, amino acids, minerals, healthy fats, vitamins and more! The healthy fats will store in your curvy areas such as the buttocks, hips and thighs. Maca is an essential component of any effective buttocks enhancement program.
