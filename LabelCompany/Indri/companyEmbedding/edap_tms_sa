After a local or general anaesthetic is administered, the patient lies down on his right hand side (right lateral decubitus) and stays in this position throughout the treatment.
Three phases treatment

Patients undergoing Ablatherm® HIFU treatment are given a general or spinal anesthetic. A probe is introduced in the rectum and the imaging transducer starts the gland scanning to plan the treatment. The treatment transducer then emits high intensity focused ultrasound in the prostate gland. At the point where the ultrasound waves are focused the absorption of the ultrasound beam creates a sudden temperature increase (around 85°C) which destroys the tissue in the targeted zone.


3D imaging (3D imaging of the prostate with 7.5MHz transducer)
Treatment planning (fully adjustable treatment parameters to suit all prostate anatomies)
Robotic treatment (robotic treatment of the prostate following the treatment plan)

EDAP TMS SA (NASDAQ:EDAP) has withdrawn its U.S. 510(k) application for its Focal One device after discussions with the FDA. It plans to file another application with new clinical data.
CEO Marc Oczachowski says, "As mentioned during our last quarterly call, a shift in biopsy protocol has created difficulties in comparing biopsy data under the current 510k application. We actively worked with some of our key users in Europe to gather new and additional clinical data on Focal One in order to provide them to the agency for review. It is not possible to include this new clinical data in our current file under review, and thus need to withdraw our current application and submit a new 510(k) with the new set of clinical data, which will be filed very soon."

EDAP TMS S.A. (EDAP) Expands Product Portfolio With New Urological Stone Laser  











Tweet








2/26/2015 8:59:40 AM


 LYON, France, Feb. 26, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EDAP TMS SA (Nasdaq:EDAP), the global leader in therapeutic ultrasound, today announced a multi-national strategic OEM partnership with Quanta System, a leading manufacturer of medical lasers for surgical and other applications. Under the agreement, Quanta will manufacture customized urological stone lasers to be sold under the EDAP brand. Additionally, EDAP will continue to distribute Holmium lasers in France and certain North African territories, pursuant to its exclusive agreement with Lumenis in those regions.  Marc Oczachowski, EDAP's Chief Executive Officer, commented, "The addition of urological stone lasers to EDAP's product portfolio will provide excellent synergy with our existing lithotripsy offering for the treatment of urinary stones. We are excited to partner with Quanta System, the world leader in development and manufacture of stone lasers to bring their cutting-edge technology to urologists and patients and drive incremental growth for our Company. This strategic partnership enables EDAP to offer a complete range of minimally invasive solutions from intracorporeal lithotripsy lasers to extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy devices, covering the full scope of urinary tract stone indications."  Oczachowski continued: "With our well-established, worldwide network of fully-owned subsidiaries, dedicated distributors and partners, we are well positioned to maximize our lithotripsy sales activity going forward."  Paolo Salvadeo, Quanta System's Chief Executive Officer, commented: "We are very happy to partner with EDAP as this new cooperation strengthens our position in the worldwide urology market, where Quanta already enjoys strong market share in laser lithotripsy. Our core solutions for urinary stones represent a real benchmark for the industry, and we are pleased to offer them to EDAP, a dynamic company that shares many similarities with Quanta, and to contribute to their continued success throughout the world."  About EDAP TMS SA   EDAP TMS SA markets today Ablatherm® for high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment of localized prostate cancer. HIFU treatment is shown to be a minimally invasive and effective treatment option with a low occurrence of side effects. Ablatherm-HIFU is generally recommended for patients with localized prostate cancer (stages T1-T2) who are not candidates for surgery or who prefer an alternative option, or for patients who failed radiotherapy treatment, Ablatherm-HIFU is approved and commercialized in Europe as a treatment for prostate cancer and is currently under regulatory review in the U.S. following submission of the Pre-Market Approval Application in February 2013 after the completion of a multi-center U.S. Phase II/III clinical trial under an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) granted by the FDA. In March 2013, the Company introduced a new innovative HIFU device, the Focal One® dedicated to focal therapy of prostate cancer. Focal One® is CE marked but is not FDA approved. The Company also develops its HIFU technology for the potential treatment of certain other types of tumors. EDAP TMS SA also produces and commercializes medical equipment (the Sonolith® range) for treatment of urinary tract stones using extra-corporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL). For more information on the Company, please visit http://www.edap-tms.com, and http://www.hifu-planet.com.  About Quanta System S.p.A.

The Company's HIFU and UDS divisions operate in Europe, the Americas, Asia and the rest of the world. The Company is developing HIFU technology for the treatment of certain other types of tumors. The Company also produces and commercializes medical equipment for treatment of urinary tract stones using extra-corporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) and distributes other types of urology devices in certain countries.High Intensity Focused Ultrasound DivisionThe Company's HIFU division is engaged in the development, manufacturing and marketing of medical devices based on HIFU technology for the invasive treatment of urological and other clinical indications. HIFU technology uses a high-intensity convergent ultrasound beam generated by high power transducers to produce heat. HIFU technology is intended to allow the surgeon to destroy a well-defined area of diseased tissue without damaging surrounding tissue and organs, thereby eliminating the need for incisions, transfusions and general anesthesia and associated complications. The Company's HIFU Division markets two HIFU devices: the Ablatherm and the Focal One. The Ablatherm is used for the treatment of organ-confined prostate cancer, referred to as T1-T2 stage. Ablatherm is approved for commercial distribution in the European Union, the United States, South Korea, Canada, Australia, Taiwan, South Africa, New Zealand, the Philippines, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, Russia, Venezuela, Peru and Ecuador. HIFU Division also produces and markets the Focal One device, a HIFU robotic device for the focal therapy of localized prostate cancer, thereby destroying focused cancer cells only. Focal One is approved for commercial distribution in the European Union, Canada, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Peru and Chile. The Company's HIFU division has an installed base of approximately 100 Ablatherm machines, over 14 Focal One and approximately 350 trained clinical sites across the world were using this technology. In addition, the HIFU division is also engaged in leasing equipment, as well as the sale of disposables, spare parts and maintenance services. The Company's HIFU mobile treatment option provides access to the HIFU devices without requiring hospitals and clinics to make an up-front investment in the equipment. Instead, hospitals and clinics perform treatments using these devices.The Company competes with SonaCare Medical, General Electric, Theraclion, Elbit Medical Imaging, Haifu and Philips Healthcare.Urology Devices and Services DivisionThe Company's UDS division is engaged in the development, marketing, manufacturing and servicing of medical devices for the minimally invasive diagnosis or treatment of urological disorders, urinary stones, and other clinical indications. The Company's UDS division's primary business is producing and marketing devices, known as lithotripters, for the treatment of urinary tract stones by means of ESWL technology. The UDS division manufactures two models of lithotripters: the Sonolith i-move and the Sonolith i-sys. The UDS division sells over 827 ESWL lithotripters across the world and maintains otherwise serviced 608 installed lithotripters. The Company is also engaged in the leasing of lithotripters, as well as the sale of disposables, spare parts and maintenance services. The Company manufactures its own products as part of EDAP TMS France SAS, its subsidiary.
