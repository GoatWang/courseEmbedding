Checklist: 9 Questions Every Advisor Should Be Able to Answer 




Whatever your priorities, this can help you find someone who understands you and has the resources to help you manage your financial life 











AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER, WE ALL face major turning points in our lives—getting married, becoming a parent, receiving a life-changing promotion, getting ready to retire. At times like these, many people feel a need for financial help, and start to wonder whether working with a financial advisor might make sense. That's when the search begins.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future. Someone who'll be there for you for years to come, and who can provide more than just stock recommendations.
To find an advisor who can help you with those decisions, don't be afraid to ask the following tough questions—they'll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you.
1. What types of clients do you work with?
Some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession. Others might have particular knowledge in a specialty, such as sustainable investing or retirement planning. Ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future.
2. What is your track record?
No advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance. And beware those who do. But an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty.
3. How often will we talk?
An advisor should be committed to conversations in person, by phone, or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require. Every client has different needs and expectations. Be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances.
4. How realistic are my goals?
Even if you have a strong idea of what you want to accomplish with your money, the right advisor can help you better understand and prioritize your goals, including making any necessary tradeoffs based on your finances, timelines and investing preferences.

5. How will we keep my strategy on course?
Even the best strategy will need adjusting as financial markets and your goals change. An advisor should have a plan for regular reviews and the ability to correct as market conditions and your priorities shift.
6. What happens if the markets are volatile? Will you call me?
When markets get scary, there's nothing worse than feeling isolated and alone. One of an advisor's most vital functions is to reach out at such times, hear your concerns, offer perspective, and talk about any needed adjustments to your strategy.
7. What if I'm upset about a service issue or an investment?
As life becomes increasingly automated, there's nothing like a human voice and quick response when you're concerned about a financial matter. Advisors who define their success by your success will be eager to quickly resolve any such issues.
8. Who will I actually be working with?
Many advisors have teams of professionals to enhance the services they provide. Ask who you'd be working with on a regular basis and their level of experience. Beyond the immediate team, does the company supporting them have access to a broad array of financial insights and resources?
9. How do I pay you for your work?
It's never easy to ask, but the right advisors will welcome this question. Clarity about fees is vital to a successful relationship. Payment—whether a percentage of assets or per transaction—should be structured around your needs and preferences.

Amerivest Investment Management, LLC, Aug. 19, 2014

















Home | Previous Page





























 
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 - Section 205(a)(1)
Amerivest Investment Management, LLC
August 19, 2014
Response of the Chief Counsel's Office
Division Of Investment Management
IM Ref. No. 20144101037

Your letter dated August 18, 2014 requests our assurance that we would not recommend enforcement action to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission" or "SEC") under Section 205(a)(1) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the "Advisers Act") against Amerivest Investment Management, LLC ("Amerivest"), an investment adviser that is an affiliate of TD Ameritrade, Inc. ("TD Ameritrade") and is registered with the Commission under the Advisers Act, if Amerivest offers to certain clients an advisory fee rebate (the "Proposed Fee Arrangement") in the manner described in your letter and summarized below.
Background
You state the following:
Amerivest currently offers a discretionary advisory service known as Amerivest Portfolios, which is made available to retail brokerage clients of TD Ameritrade (the "Service").  Under the Service, Amerivest serves as the investment adviser to the clients and is responsible for implementing the asset allocation models and corresponding mutual fund and exchange-traded fund investment recommendations provided by Morningstar Associates, LLC ("Morningstar Associates").  Morningstar Associates serves as an investment adviser and independent consultant to Amerivest with respect to the Service, but does not enter into an investment advisory agreement with Amerivest's clients.  Amerivest vets and implements Morningstar Associates' investment recommendations in their entirety, subject to non-investment related factors such as tax considerations and any reasonable restrictions a client may impose.1   Morningstar Associates is compensated by Amerivest based on a fee schedule that includes an asset-based fee component and a licensing fee component.  Accordingly, Morningstar Associates does not receive performance-based compensation.
Under the Proposed Fee Arrangement, Amerivest would continue to charge a quarterly asset-based advisory fee in advance.  However, Amerivest would rebate investment advisory fees for eligible clients who are invested in a model portfolio that experiences two consecutive discrete calendar quarters of negative performance (before advisory fees) during a twelve-month period (a "Term").  The amount of the rebate would be equal to 100% of the advisory fees paid by each eligible client for the two calendar quarters in which the performance composite for the model portfolio corresponding to the client's account experienced negative performance.  To determine whether performance was negative, each calendar quarter would be measured independently; the performance for multiple quarters would not be aggregated.  Amerivest will fully and clearly disclose the rules governing eligibility for the Proposed Fee Arrangement and the methodology for calculating the composite performance (together, the "Rebate Terms") to all clients participating in the Service.  Amerivest will follow the Rebate Terms and apply them fairly and consistently.  In the event that Amerivest decides to change the Rebate Terms in a manner that would disadvantage participating clients, Amerivest will notify participating clients of the change, and no such change will become effective prior to the commencement of the next subsequent Term.
The Proposed Fee Arrangement will not contain any "catch up" or other provision that would allow Amerivest to recapture foregone fees through future appreciation.  Amerivest will not deviate from or otherwise seek to influence Morningstar Associates' investment recommendations for the purpose of avoiding payment of any fee rebate under the Proposed Fee Arrangement.  Amerivest may deviate from Morningstar Associates' recommendations solely: (i) for non-investment and non-performance related reasons such as tax considerations or reasonable client restrictions; or (ii) to the extent so required to fulfill its fiduciary duty to clients.  Amerivest will make and keep true, accurate and current records detailing any such deviation and explaining why such deviation was necessary.  There will be no contract, arrangement, or other understanding, explicit or tacit, by and between Amerivest and Morningstar Associates or any principals thereof, such that Morningstar Associates' compensation or continued engagement would be affected by the payment or non-payment by Amerivest of any fee rebate pursuant to the Proposed Fee Arrangement.
The Proposed Fee Arrangement would be implemented for (i) all new discretionary client accounts, and (ii) all existing discretionary client accounts with a new deposit of $25,000 or higher, provided that the new deposit represents net new assets to Amerivest.  Clients would not have to elect to participate in the Proposed Fee Arrangement or request a fee rebate.  The fee rebate would automatically apply in the event of two consecutive calendar quarters of negative performance.  To be eligible for the Proposed Fee Arrangement, an account must participate in the Service for a minimum of two consecutive calendar quarters during the Term, and during such participation the client must not withdraw more than the required deposit of $25,000 to remain eligible for subsequent quarters.  Amerivest would reserve the right to extend the Term for additional twelve-month periods or to discontinue the Proposed Fee Arrangement upon ninety (90) days advance written notice to clients.
Subject to enforcing the requirements set forth in the preceding paragraph, Amerivest will not take any action for the purpose of negating or compromising a client's eligibility for the rebate, including, without limitation, any action that would result in a client no longer participating in the Service.
Analysis
Section 205(a)(1) of the Advisers Act generally prohibits registered investment advisers from entering into, extending, renewing or performing any investment advisory contract that provides for compensation to the investment adviser on the basis of a share of capital gains or capital appreciation in a client's account or any portion thereof.  Section 205(a)(1) is designed, among other things, to eliminate "profit sharing contracts [that] are nothing more than 'heads I win, tails you lose' arrangements," and that "encourage advisers to take undue risks with the funds of clients," to speculate, or to overtrade.2
You argue that Section 205(a)(1) does not, on its face, extend to fee waivers or rebates that are contingent on negative performance.  You acknowledge, however, that the SEC staff in Investment Advisers Act Release No. 721 (May 16, 1980) ("Release 721")3   stated that the concerns animating the performance fee ban "are as apposite to advisory fees which are contingent upon an advisory account obtaining a certain level of performance as they are to fees which vary directly with capital gains or appreciation."4
You note that the SEC staff has nonetheless provided no-action assurances in situations where fees are contingent on performance, but the conflicts of interest associated with performance fees are not present or are substantially mitigated.5   In particular, you state that in Trainer the SEC staff took the position that although a general satisfaction guarantee supported by the offer of a full refund was a contingent fee arrangement squarely within the scope of Release 721, it was "structured in a manner that would greatly reduce any incentive on the part of the [a]dvisers to take undue risks, speculate, or overtrade[]" and "could serve to encourage the [a]dvisers to develop a strong culture of client service and responsiveness."6
While you acknowledge that the Proposed Fee Arrangement represents a contingent fee arrangement of the kind prohibited by Section 205(a)(1) for the reasons discussed in Release 721, you argue that several aspects of the Proposed Fee Arrangement make it highly unlikely that Amerivest would attempt to avoid the rebate by taking undue risks, timing transactions in a client's account or over-trading.  In particular, you argue that Amerivest would not be in a position to directly affect the value of a client's account because Morningstar Associates, an investment adviser that is independent from Amerivest, would be responsible for security selection and asset allocation recommendations with respect to the model portfolios.  Moreover, you believe that any incentive that Amerivest might have to override Morningstar Associates' asset allocation recommendations in order to invest in more speculative investments is mitigated by the inability to recapture waived or rebated fees.  You argue that the Proposed Fee Arrangement is designed to further align Amerivest's interests with those of its clients because Amerivest does not make money if an eligible client does not make money.  You contend that the Proposed Fee Arrangement is the opposite of the "heads I win, tails you lose" approach that Section 205(a)(1) was designed to prevent.
We believe that certain aspects of the Proposed Fee Arrangement - particularly the role of Morningstar Associates in selecting securities and making asset allocation recommendations and the limited discretion Amerivest would have to deviate from such recommendations - help to alleviate the concerns that form the basis of Section 205(a)(1).  Based on the facts and representations in your letter, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission under Section 205(a)(1) of the Advisers Act against Amerivest if Amerivest enters into the Proposed Fee Arrangement as described in your letter and summarized above.
Our position is based particularly on your representations that:  (1) Amerivest will fully and clearly disclose the Rebate Terms to all clients participating in the Service, and will follow the Rebate Terms and apply them fairly and consistently; (2) in the event that Amerivest decides to change the Rebate Terms in a manner that may disadvantage participating clients, Amerivest will notify participating clients of the change, and no such change will become effective prior to the commencement of the next subsequent Term; (3) the Proposed Fee Arrangement will not contain any "catch up" or other provision that would allow Amerivest to recapture foregone fees through future appreciation; (4) Amerivest will not deviate from or otherwise seek to influence Morningstar Associates' investment recommendations for the purpose of avoiding payment of any fee rebate under the Proposed Fee Arrangement; (5) Amerivest may deviate from Morningstar Associates' recommendations solely: (i) for non-investment and non-performance related reasons such as tax considerations or reasonable client restrictions; or (ii) to the extent so required to fulfill its fiduciary duty to clients; (6) Amerivest will make and keep true, accurate and current records detailing any such deviation and explaining why such deviation was necessary; (7) the mere fact that Amerivest has deviated from or declined to implement a recommendation of Morningstar Associates will not - in and of itself - result in a loss of eligibility for the rebate; (8) there will be no contract, arrangement, or other understanding, explicit or tacit, by and between Amerivest and Morningstar Associates or any principals thereof, such that Morningstar Associates' compensation or continued engagement would be affected by the payment or non-payment by Amerivest of any fee rebate pursuant to the Proposed Fee Arrangement; and (9) subject to enforcing certain eligibility requirements, Amerivest will not take any action for the purpose of negating or compromising a client's eligibility for the rebate including, without limitation, any action that would result in a client no longer participating in the Service.
Because our position is based on the facts and representations made in your letter, you should note that any different facts or circumstances might require a different conclusion.
Kyle R. Ahlgren
 Senior Counsel
 



1 You state that Amerivest's vetting process is designed to consider whether the asset allocations and securities recommendations provided by Morningstar Associates are reasonable in relation to the investment mandate and risk/return characteristics of each model portfolio and the overall operation of the Service.  You state further that Amerivest may choose not to implement a recommendation provided by Morningstar Associates based on non-investment related considerations that might adversely impact client accounts (e.g., the tax ramifications of substituting one ETF for another).  You represent that the mere fact that Amerivest has deviated from or declined to implement a recommendation of Morningstar Associates will not - in and of itself - cause a client to be ineligible for the rebate.

Press Release Details
TD Ameritrade Announces the Launch of New Amerivest ETF Portfolios


April 4, 2011

Download this Press Release (PDF 18 KB)

 A unique combination of guidance, portfolio management and objective fund recommendations 
 OMAHA, Neb.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Client assets held in exchange-traded funds ("ETFs") at TD Ameritrade, Inc. ("TD Ameritrade"), a brokerage subsidiary of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation, have grown nearly 38 percent in the last year, while at the same time, demand for guidance among retail investors has continued to grow. To answer this demand, TD Ameritrade's affiliated investment advisor, Amerivest Investment Management, LLC ("Amerivest"), has added five pre-constructed, professionally managed diversified portfolios, built solely from ETFs, to its current menu of managed portfolios. 
 For investors who want to create cost-effective, diversified investment plans, but who admittedly need support in doing so, Amerivest Portfolios provides a unique combination of guidance and portfolio management along with objective fund recommendations. 
 Constructed based on the objective recommendations of independent, third-party expert Morningstar Associates, the portfolios are built to address a broad range of investment needs, based largely on an investor's risk tolerance and time horizon for investing. Amerivest recommends a portfolio based on investor goals and risk profile and provides ongoing management. To provide an added layer of guidance, investors also get ongoing portfolio rebalancing from Amerivest. 
 To help investors pursue their unique goals, Amerivest offers five diversified asset allocation models — Conservative, Stable, Balanced, Growth and Aggressive Growth — each constructed with the investor's choice of either mutual funds, or now, ETFs. 
 "We continue to see growth among investors who fall somewhere between those who want to manage their own portfolios and those who seek complete financial advice," said Ram Subramaniam, head of products at TD Ameritrade. "This offering meets the needs of these investors by offering objective guidance, diversification and simplicity." 
 "A fundamental principle of investing is proper diversification across asset classes to enhance the risk-return tradeoff in a portfolio," said Peng Chen, president of Morningstar's global investment management division. "We're pleased to work with TD Ameritrade and Amerivest to lend our asset allocation and investment selection expertise to help their clients invest in well-constructed portfolios that they can hold for the long term." 
 Amerivest Portfolios offers a cost-effective way to pursue long-term investment goals for investors looking for investment recommendations from objective, third-party experts. 
 For more information on Amerivest Portfolios, visit www.tdameritrade.com. 
 AMTD-G 
 Before investing in any ETF, carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses involved. For a prospectus containing this and other important information, please visit the TD Ameritrade Web site or contact a TD Ameritrade Client Services representative at 800-669-3900. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing. 
 ETFs are registered investment companies that trade on an exchange like a stock. Commission fees typically apply. Those who practice frequent dollar-cost averaging and active traders may generate trading costs that outweigh any cost benefit. Trading prices may not reflect the actual net asset value of the underlying securities. ETFs can entail risks similar to direct stock ownership and are subject to risks similar to those of their underlying securities, including, but not limited to, market, sector or industry risks, and those regarding short-selling and margin account maintenance. 
 Past performance of a security does not guarantee future results or success. 
 Diversification does not eliminate the risk of experiencing investment losses.

Checklist: 9 Questions Every Advisor Should Be Able to Answer 




Whatever your priorities, this can help you find someone who understands you and has the resources to help you manage your financial life 











AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER, WE ALL face major turning points in our lives—getting married, becoming a parent, receiving a life-changing promotion, getting ready to retire. At times like these, many people feel a need for financial help, and start to wonder whether working with a financial advisor might make sense. That's when the search begins.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future. Someone who'll be there for you for years to come, and who can provide more than just stock recommendations.
To find an advisor who can help you with those decisions, don't be afraid to ask the following tough questions—they'll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you.
1. What types of clients do you work with?
Some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession. Others might have particular knowledge in a specialty, such as sustainable investing or retirement planning. Ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future.
2. What is your track record?
No advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance. And beware those who do. But an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty.
3. How often will we talk?
An advisor should be committed to conversations in person, by phone, or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require. Every client has different needs and expectations. Be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances.
4. How realistic are my goals?
Even if you have a strong idea of what you want to accomplish with your money, the right advisor can help you better understand and prioritize your goals, including making any necessary tradeoffs based on your finances, timelines and investing preferences.

Watch the webcast



5. How will we keep my strategy on course?
Even the best strategy will need adjusting as financial markets and your goals change. An advisor should have a plan for regular reviews and the ability to correct as market conditions and your priorities shift.
6. What happens if the markets are volatile? Will you call me?
When markets get scary, there's nothing worse than feeling isolated and alone. One of an advisor's most vital functions is to reach out at such times, hear your concerns, offer perspective, and talk about any needed adjustments to your strategy.
7. What if I'm upset about a service issue or an investment?
As life becomes increasingly automated, there's nothing like a human voice and quick response when you're concerned about a financial matter. Advisors who define their success by your success will be eager to quickly resolve any such issues.
8. Who will I actually be working with?
Many advisors have teams of professionals to enhance the services they provide. Ask who you'd be working with on a regular basis and their level of experience. Beyond the immediate team, does the company supporting them have access to a broad array of financial insights and resources?
9. How do I pay you for your work?
It's never easy to ask, but the right advisors will welcome this question. Clarity about fees is vital to a successful relationship. Payment—whether a percentage of assets or per transaction—should be structured around your needs and preferences.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
