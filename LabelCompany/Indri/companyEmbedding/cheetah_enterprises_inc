The following table details the Company's intended use of proceeds from this
Offering, for the first twelve (12) months after successful completion of the
Offering. None of the expenditures itemized are listed in any particular order
of priority or importance. Since the Company does not intend to pay any
Offering expenses from the proceeds from this Offering, and assuming that
$100,000 (100%), $75,000 (75%), $50,000 (50%), or $25,000 (25%) of the Offering
is sold, the gross aggregate proceeds will be allocated as follows:

Expenditure Item**                       100%       75%       50%        25%

Working Capital                            7,000         -          -          -
Total                                 $  100,000 $  75,000  $  50,000  $  25,000

There is no minimum amount we are required to raise in this Offering, and any
funds received will be immediately available to us.

**The above expenditures are defined as follows:

Professional Fees: Pertains to legal services and accounting fees that will be
incurred by the Company for maintaining fully reporting status with the SEC.

DTC-Eligibility Fees: Pertains to the cost to apply for our shares to be
eligible for trading with the Depository Trust Corporation ("DTC").

Automobile Inventory: Pertains to the cost or purchasing used automobiles for
resale. We anticipate locating automobiles in the $3,000 - $7,000 range.

Automobile Parts & Repairs: Pertains to the cost of parts and repairs that are
may be required for some of our used automobiles to get them in resale
condition.

Insurance, licenses, and registration: Pertains to the cost to maintain business
licenses, insurance on automobiles, temporary vehicle demonstration licensing,
and title transfer / registration costs.

Website Design and Development: Pertains to the payments that will be made to
design and develop our websites. This will be to develop both our corporate
website, www.cheetahenterprises.com and our Costa Rican marketing website,
www.cheetahautos.com.

Advertising and Marketing: Pertains to the cost of advertising and marketing our
products in the Costa Rican market.

Office and Miscellaneous Expenses: These are the costs of operating our office,
including telephone services, mail, stationery, accounting, office supplies,
bank service fees and charges, and other miscellaneous expenses associated with
running our office.

Working Capital: Pertains to the funds allocated to general working capital. 
Funds will be used to cover short falls in other areas, if applicable, during
the next 12 months.

There is no assurance that we will be able to raise the entire $100,000 with
this Offering.  Therefore, the following details how we will use the proceeds if
we raise only 75%, 50%, or 25% of this Offering:

If only 75% ($75,000) of this Offering is sold, we estimate that this would
still provide sufficient capital to purchase $25,000 of used automobiles
(approximately 4-7 vehicles), significantly develop both our corporate and
vehicle sales websites, and spend $7,000 on advertising and marketing. We would
not have any funds available in working capital to cover unexpected costs, which
would necessitate reducing expenses in other areas, most likely in website and
marketing costs. Reducing our website and marketing costs would affect our
ability to turn over our inventory quickly and could materially affect our
ability to generate sales growth in the first year.

If only 50% ($50,000) of this Offering is sold, we estimate that this would
provide sufficient capital to purchase $15,000 of used automobiles
(approximately 3-5 automobiles), only develop a very basic corporate website at
www.cheetahenterprises.com, without any development on our
www.cheetahautosales.com website for advertising vehicles and our Costa Rican
based business. We would only be able to spend $1,000 on advertising and
marketing our services and only $1,000 for office and miscellaneous expenses. 
Under this scenario, we estimate that we would be able to generate enough
revenues to sustain our business for the next 12-months. We would not have any
extra funds to allocate for other financial short falls, and should we be unable
to generate sufficient revenues to sustain our business, we will have to find
other sources of financing.

If 25% ($25,000) of this Offering is sold, we would still incur expected
professional (legal and accounting) fees of $20,000, which will have to be paid
to maintain reporting status during the next 12 months. We will also pay
minimal office and miscellaneous expenses, and $3,000 will be available for the
purchase of one used automobile and related repair and licensing costs. Based
on raising only 25%, or $25,000, we will allocate only $500 to development of
our website and only $500 to advertising and marketing. This would seriously
hinder the development of our business and our ability to generate
sufficient revenues. We would not be able to develop the business and/or
generate sufficient revenues in the first year without additional financing. 
Further, we would not be able to pay for making our securities DTC-Eligible,
and, thus, it is unlikely an investor in this Offering would be able to trade
his or her shares in a public market, should a public market even be achieved.

If we do not raise sufficient funds to pay professional fees, estimated to be
$20,000 for the first 12 months, we would not be able to remain reporting with
the SEC, and, therefore, we would not be able to obtain an OTCQB quotation.

We feel we need to raise a minimum of $50,000 in Offering proceeds in order to
implement our business plan and support our operations for the next 12 months.


The automotive industry is competitive and has low barriers to entry. We
compete locally and will eventually compete on a country wide basis, with a
variety of primarily local companies that offer similar services as ours. Some
of these companies have had many more years of business experience or have
greater financial and personnel resources, including marketing and sales
organizations than we do, and may be able to better source product and
customers. We do not believe any one company holds a dominant share of the
local or country-wide market on which we are focused.

We’ve come a long way from the days when a computer was the size of a large room. In 1946, a computer needed an estimated 174 kilowatts to run; a modern 13-inch Apple MacBook Pro uses 43 watts—a more than 400,000% change. A tablet consumes even less.
As size and energy consumption have decreased, variety has increased. Businesses and consumers now have myriad options at their fingertips, with new features emerging every year. Need something portable? Try a notebook computer. Want something desk-bound but space-saving? You can browse all-in-one desktop computers or even thin clients. Just looking for something light? Try an ultrabook for a balance of power and weight. 
CDW knows your business has specific needs, which is why we carry a wide selection of computers from the industry’s top brands, including Apple,  Lenovo and HP. And don’t forget to check out our Deal of the Week for special discounts on everything from workstations to tablet PCs.

CDW sells a large variety of servers and accessories for servers for organizations of all sizes. Within Servers, you will find different types of x86 servers for business as well as RISC-based-servers. No matter your organizational requirements, CDW can assist you in finding a server that meets and exceeds the requirements and expectations of your institution whether it's choosing the best server for enterprise, exchange server, or a server for small business.
Rack-mountable and tower servers are servers that conform to different-sized enclosures for mounting servers of varying form factors such as 1U, 2U, 3U and 4U. With CDW's search functionality, it's never been easier to find a rack-mountable server that meets your business needs. 
CDW also sells blade servers which have been known to save space and energy in conjunction with a blade server enclosure. For more information on saving space and energy by implementing a blade server solution, contact a CDW storage management solutions specialist.
Having trouble locating an HP server for your needs? Check out CDW's new Server Advisor tool. The Server Advisor asks you some basic questions about expected server uses, how many users will connect to your server as well as where it's going to be located and your expected organizational growth. All of these variables are taken into consideration and then an optimal HP server is identified and recommended for your business needs, whether it's the best server for small business or a large-scale server deployment in a dedicated data center.
For more complex server decisions such as whether or not to virtualize, what the best servers for virtualization are and what servers are good for cloud computing, you should consult a CDW solutions specialist to assist you in a virtualization or cloud computing solution for your specific needs.
