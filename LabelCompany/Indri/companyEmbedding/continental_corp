Animal Feeds




 
Blending and Coating Animal Feeds in the Rollo-Mixer ® Batch Mixer
The first Rollo-Mixer ® Batch Mixer was invented in 1960 to mix dairy feed with sticky molasses. Today, our customers in the feed industry manufacture all types of feed products including, poultry, swine, beef, and calf feeds, as well as specialty race horse feeds that are shipped to race tracks around the world. The gentle Rollo-Mixer ® Batch Mixer excels at uniformly mixing fragile ingredients such as crimped oats, flaked corn, steamed grains and pellets. High percentages of viscous liquids such as molasses and fats are evenly applied with a liquid blender attachment. This allows the Rollo-Mixer ® Batch Mixer to stay clean by isolating and controlling the point of liquid addition with Free-Fall Processing ®.

Plastic Products




 
Blending and Coating Plastic Products in the Rollo Mixer
The Rollo-Mixer ® Batch Mixer is involved in many plastic applications from specialty plastics used in the electronic industry to post blending plastic pellets for the automotive industry. Plastic powder blends with liquid and dry additives are uniformly mixed in the Rollo-Mixer ® Batch Mixer to create recyclable plastic containers for the packaging industry. Coating nylon pellets with TiO2 powders or simply blending nylon with other additives is well suited for the Rollo-Mixer ® Batch Mixer. With Continental’s award winning coating technology, densifying polycarbonate flakes with polyglycol has allowed our customers to increase the density of the plastic ingredient while improving its value and performance. Regrind plastics are blended with small amounts of color pigments that must be uniformly mixed to match finished color specifications.

Rubber Products




 
Blending and Coating Rubber Products in the Rollo Mixer
One of the most challenging mixing applications we encountered involved blending nitrile rubber with powder additives. The Rollo-Mixer’s dynamic mix action divides and combines these materials over 25 times per revolution while maintaining a uniform mixed product to down-line processing equipment. Not only do the two ingredients have a wide variance in particle size, but keeping them mixed while feeding the extruder is critical to producing a uniform TPE pellet. Many automotive parts like window and door seals are made from these versatile rubber pellets. Other applications include post-blending TPE pellets used to make rubber soles for the shoe and boot industry.

Stone, Clay, and Glass




 
Blending and Coating Stone, Clay, and Glass in the Rollo Mixer
The lighting industry has used the Continental Rollo-Mixer ® Batch Mixer for many years to blend glass cullet and other constituents that are formed into products like glass insulators. These glass blends contain a wide variety of particle sizes and densities along with minor ingredients that must be uniformly mixed going into the furnace, so that the viscosity of the molten glass coming out of the furnace is consistent and uniform. Treating clays with liquid additives is ideal with Continental’s unique Free-Fall Processing ®. This award winning coating technology allows our customers to apply small percentages of expensive liquids onto all of the particles’ surface area, thus creating a uniformly coated finished product.

Paint with a Purpose

Quality Systems Approved Manufacturer of Industrial and Corrosion Resistant Paints founded in 1916.
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS
Continental specializes in compliant water-borne, high solids and 2K paint technologies. This also includes our ground breaking development of ZERO VOC High Performance 2K urethane paint chemistry
PROBLEM SOLVERS
Our customers depend on Continental to diagnose and find solutions to their Industrial Paint needs and problems whether those needs entail compliance challenges, application issues, production line difficulties or field performance deficiencies. Continental’s customer-driven approach has yielded flexible paint solutions for its clients with paint formulations that are adapted to meet specific and often complex coating requirements.
CUSTOMER FOCUSED
Continental’s Research & Development is focused on solving problems in the real world of paint lines and government regulations. The typical corporate approach of trying to influence the paint customer to use an existing paint or paint system is no longer an adequate solution for many companies. Most all of our paints are custom-designed to fit the exact requirements of our customers’ specifications and paint lines. That’s because we keep our avenue of research as open as possible by not imposing strict limits on our raw material choices. This open-ended approach, along with the creativity of our chemists, has yielded breakthrough paint technologies that fit your demanding production requirements.
PAINT SOLUTIONS THAT WORK
Our customers depend on Continental to diagnose and find solutions to their Industrial Paint problems whether those problems entail compliance difficulties, application issues, production line challenges or field performance shortcomings. Continental’s customer-driven approach has yielded flexible paint solutions for its clients with paint formulations that are custom-designed to meet specific and often complex coating requirements.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

The LegalZoom 3-step process was developed by attorneys from some of the most prestigious law firms in America. There are no complex instructions to follow and nothing to download or print. Simply answer a few questions and get started on
              setting up your corporation.

Here's how it works:

Complete the Incorporation Questionnaire
						Complete our simple questionnaire. With LegalZoom, you can choose to form a new corporation or incorporate an existing business. You can also select provisions to help you guard against personal liability.
We Create and File Your Incorporation Papers
						We create and file the Articles of Incorporation (or, in some states, the "Certificate of Formation" or "Certificate of Incorporation") with the Secretary of State (or in some states, the "Department of State" or "Corporation Commission"). We even create company-specific bylaws and organizational minutes.
Final Wrap-Up
						When we receive your filed Articles of Incorporation back from the state, we send them to you along with the rest of your formation documents, as well as easy instructions regarding next steps.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
