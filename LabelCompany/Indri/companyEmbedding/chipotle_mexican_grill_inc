Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) screwed up, and it screwed up bad. We’re talking “getting caught cheating on your girlfriend for the second time” bad — you have no reasonable expectation of forgiveness, you just have to wait and see, if you even care about hanging around anymore at all. And CMG stock is rightfully paying a dear price.

Chipotle shares are now down more than 10% since Tuesday following a pair of reports that put its year-plus retribution attempts into question.
CMG — which already was flailing in the wake of a disappointing full-year outlook issued in late June — has fully given back all of its rebound gains since bottoming out in the wake of the big E. coli scare in 2015 that helped spark its biggest selloff.
At the moment, shares now sit at lows last seen in 2013.
How Chipotle’s Snowball Started Rolling
The damage started on Tuesday after several news outlets reported that numerous customers had complained about getting sick at a Chipotle location in Sterling, Virginia. The illness, which later was confirmed as a norovirus outbreak, sparked immediate intraday selling in CMG stock.
Chipotle’s trust was already thin following the wide outbreak of E. coli in October, but also another E. coli batch in July, as well as norovirus and salmonella outbreaks in the latter half of the year — but was put further into doubt amid a much different health concern.
Over the next couple days, reports began to surface about rodents being seen at one of Chipotle’s Dallas-area locations, with diners later producing video of rodents crawling on the floors and walls.
While Chipotle said this was “an extremely isolated and rare incident,” continued selling through the end of the week indicates that investors feel otherwise.
But the question now becomes one of whether you can ever go long CMG stock again with any confidence. The tired ol’ adage “Buy when there’s blood in the streets” immediately comes to mind, but when it’s a river of plasma … it’s probably worth at least waiting a little bit.
Still, there are a few reasons to at least consider buying Chipotle … at some point, if not now.
Management
The first actually came more than half a year back, when Chipotle ditched is co-CEO structure and Bill Ackman was able to push new directors — thick with restaurant experience — on the board. The argument then was these directors would help push innovation and ensure that the company toed a healthier line. While that latter argument is chipped, it’s not broken; I want to give this team time to see how they react to Chipotle’s first major crisis under their watch.
One problem: Chipotle’s insistence on using the freshest, most all-natural ingredients involves a more complicated supply chain than many other restaurants, and is partly why food sickness might always be an issue.
“(Chipotle’s) food sourcing is a laudable effort—and it’s what customers want. But they’re probably walking a fine line between offering fresh, local ingredients and decentralized food preparation and the risk of introducing foodborne pathogens because it is such a complicated food chain,” Melinda Wilkins, director of the online master of science in food safety at Michigan State University, told Wired last year.
However, while it’s doubtful the chain will ever look as simple as, say, McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), the board has been working on solving this complexity. Now, investors need to watch to see how management responds on this front.
Willingness to Expand
Chipotle features one of the most limited menus in the fast-food world, setting up its buffett line to pump out a couple of products customizable with just a handful of veggies, meats and cheese. That’s why investors should take heart at the company’s willingness (under Ackman’s new board members) to branch out to new areas.

The staff here was aces today. They engaged the little boy I had with me and were super friendly and kind. They all seemed to have a good relationship and that always gives a place a better vibe. 

I just wish it wasn't so damn cold inside!  My little mans quesadilla was cold way too soon and I was freezing in a hoodie. 


But the food is always great and the service is super efficient. And I always enjoy reading their bags and cups.







**UPDATE: no change in hours posted for the Sunday before the July 4th holiday, which is a TUESDAY by the way, however the doors were closed/locked and window shades pulled. This was 8:45 on Sunday 7/2/17. If you're gonna close your store early, at least post prior notice or make it on the hour. You're supposed to close at 10pm., not just whenever you feel like it.**

Would give 0 stars if possible. 
I absolutely agree with the other reviews. The service here is slow, underprepared, and the food is typically put together sloppily. Unprofessional conversations and comments are carried on behind the counters.. only problem is the counter doesn't do anything to drown out the discussions. They often run of out items.

The food is standard for a Chipotle, but they are grossly understaffed and often the line is almost to the door. This unfortunately doesn't make anyone move any faster. The staffing issue is apparent when food bits are cross contaminated into other bins and on the counter space between items.

I wish there was another Mountain View/Los Altos location nearby.







I wish I could give 0 stars to this place. We came here on a Monday evening to grab a burrito bowl (first time at this location) and there were only two people in line in front of us. 
Somehow It took at least 10 minutes till we finally could pay for our food. They had 2 young and extremely slow people working on the line and another one walking around doing nothing. They assembled our bowls and put them aside to start assembling the other ones for the next cutomers in line. Our bowls were getting cold and we had to wait a while till they took care of a couple in front of us which took forever. I've never seen service being so slow without any legitimate reason for it to be SO slow! 
The food was a disaster too - the steak was tasteless and had a rubber-like texture that made me feel like I could break my teeth if I kept eating it. Guacamole was disgusting: the taste didn't even remind of avocado and made me gag. 
Note to management: train your employees, improve efficiency and food quality.







Cons:
Brown rice was undercooked
Chicken was not salted at all and had no flavor
Carnitas and chips were way over salted
Fajitas were under cooked and too hard 
Employee looked miserable 

Pros:
Guac was fresh 
Steak was good







Crap service crap location. Lettuce looked days old. Employees were really grumpy which means chipotle treats their people like shi^#.  Shame.  I'm not giving steve Ells or any of his other corporate goons another dime.







Chipotle has become a revived favorite of mine since their Chiptopia rewards program rolled out earlier this summer, and since they cleaned up their food quality problems.

It seems redundant to review a national chain because they rotate their employees and management so much, and because the quality is meant to be uniform, but the point is that not every Chipotle is run the same way, unfortunately. This particular location is pretty good compared to others, though.

The line moves fast, the workers are friendly, they don't skimp on their portions, and the food is the usual standard quality. They even go above and beyond to drip the beans and the pico de gallo before they drop it in your bowl.

The end result? The properly-balanced Chipotle burrito bowl that you would expect at any other location, but always ends up escaping you anyway. This location does it right, and serves it with a smile.







The previous reviewers are on point when they say TERRIBLE customer service! The guy assembling our food gave us a big attitude about having multiple orders. He slopped together our order and threw the spoons into the containers each time, as if to confirm his annoyance. He also did an awful job wrapping our burrito, with the tortilla splaying out. 

Whoever manages this location needs to really clean up this shop. Get rid of employees who don't care or want to be here. No one wants to pay to get their food thrown together with a huge dose of unwarranted rudeness.







The customer service here is laughable... as in, it sucks. Big time. 

I've been here more than a few times, and there are 1-2 guys who are consistently friendly. BUT the rest of the people just hate making delicious burritos. One of the guys barely said two words and POINTED at each ingredient as a way of asking if I wanted it.... 

I've also seen one of the guys who was making the guac sneakily shove a tortilla chip in his mouth. LULz. 

Everything else is fine, honestly.The food quality is up-to-par. The location has tons of indoor + outdoor seating and a decently large parking lot.







One of the worst experiences ever! 
Rude employees making my sandwich like shoveling mud! No thank you no hello and don't even ask me what I want just looking at me ??? And constantly joking with each other? I wonder does this place has a manager? 
I will never go back to this store even if it's free!







If I could give this place zero stars I would. They had 8! I repeat 8 people working an only 1 person helping make the damn food! Don't go to this place it's a fucking joke. When you only have 2 people in front of you and it takes 30mins for them to take your order... smfh!







I wish there was a negative stars option. This location is horrible in fact it's the worst location I have ever been to. They need new management.  The sofritas and beans are cold. The fajita veggies are always burnt with lots of hard burnt pieces ruining the flavor of your bowl/burrito....  the guy making my bowl was ghetto.  Like sagging pants,  covered in tattoos and not artist ones really poorly done ones and he looked unhygienic.  Furthermore, he was not friendly at all and was acting like I was waisting his time when we we're the only ones in the line. Super attitude...  

The dinning room was empty yet the tables were dirty. All of the employees were in the back and the guy who made out bowls had to call back there to get someone to ring us up.  I have never seen such horrible employees at a Chipotle and I wouldn't be surprised if this location shut down.







I LOVE Chipotle, but this location has the worst customer service! It seems to me when a company has recently suffered losses and customers as much as Chipotle, you'd think management would work hard to keep their remaining customers. 

Last night, I ordered a chicken salad and a chicken bowl. I was given a small amount of white rice in my bowl and politely asked the female employee TWO TIMES for more rice. Ordered extra chicken for the salad and chips & guacamole. Nothing more. Pretty simple. But after I came home, this is what I was charged:

Chicken Bowl (2 @ $7.15) = $14.30
Veggie 3 Pointer = $5.25
Extra Chicken = $2.30
Chips & Guac = $3.55
Total after tax = $27.31

Wow, thanks for ripping me off, Jose! I still love Chipotle, but not this location! There was no one else in line and I still felt rushed. So much so that I forgot to ask for refried beans in my chicken bowl. That never happens at the Sunnyvale location and the employees don't pad the bill either!!!







Came here yesterday (Friday) for dinner only to find that the store was closed due to not having any hot water.

Came back tonight @820pm for a chorizo bowl to find that there was barely and chorizo left and not even any being cooked for its replacement. They tell me it'll be 10 minutes to cook so I said I'll wait. It took 25 min.







I have never step foot inside this location, but had such an incredible customer experience over the phone that I just had to share. 

The boyfriend forgot his wallet at home (1.5hrs away) one day, and I scrambled to find a way to ensure he gets fed for lunch. Thank goodness for online ordering. As I'm going through the process, the earliest pick-up time is past his scheduled lunch hour. I take it one step further by trying my luck by calling the store location. I talk to this guy, Alex, I think? I tell him my situation and he offers to speed things up for him if he just comes inside and orders directly in-person. I tell him that I need to specifically place the order online so that I may use my credit card to pay for the meal. This guy takes it to another level and offers for my boyfriend to ask for him directly and will comp his meal. 

Full transparency, my efforts took so long that my boyfriend didn't have enough time to take advantage of the offer. But considering the thoughtfulness of this guy over the phone, and the fact that he spent all that time with me on the phone on a very busy lunch rush with a large catering order to attend to, I could not let this go unnoticed. Plus, in the event the guy I spoke to is reading this, it makes me feel better knowing why my boyfriend never showed up.

It's just nice to know that there are still people out there who go the extra mile. Thank you!







Haven't been to a place with worse customer service than this establishment. The guys behind the counter are more busy talking among themselves than listening to what I am asking them.  They just want to rush you through the assembly line. If you have more than one order it's a nightmare to get what you want. One guy is adding white rice and another one is adding chicken even though what I wanted was brown rice and tofu. They don't even bother asking. Makes wonder if these employees receive any training at all. I have had this experience multiple times and not just at this Chipotle location. Makes me think something is seriously wrong with how Chipotle conducts business and what values it stands for. Absolutely disgusted.







This is the worst Chipotle ever. Terrible customer service and the food is stale. Never coming back.







I write this as a fan of Chipotle, but I must say that this particular location is a blight on the overall company image.

I've been there twice in two days,. The place has an overall sloppy appearance. The tables are not cleaned, the staff is somewhat rude and informal, and the fruit prep is sloppy and untrained.

I've seen two different personelle now wrap two different burritos making it into a ball rather than a cylinder. Completely falls apart and inedible. Sloppy and uncaring.

Also the food quality: The food did not taste fresh,  most notably the meat and the wrap. On this last time I came out they were out of chips. Since when has Chipotle ever been out of chips?. It happens at this location, apparently.

They were completely out of napkins at the condiment section.

You would think for a chain that has had some food safety issues in the last few years, that they would be doubling down on safety, customer service, and quality. This place does not seem to of gotten the memo or follow the news. If I had heard this location was the source of food safety concerns I would not in the least be surprised.

This location is in serious need of adult supervision. This franchise owner is negligent in what they're doing, and Chipotle corporate should take action immediately with this franchise owner.







Don't know why everyone's hating on this Chipotle so much. 

Came here for a quick lunch and got my go-to: sofritas burrito to go!  Staff wasn't too efficient (line wait was about 5-10 minutes), however they were polite. There were about three people in the assembly line on Thursday late afternoon around 2PM-ish. Here's the thing...lunch rush is called lunch RUSH for a reason. People only get an hour break, so of course they was speedy service when there's high traffic. You HAVE to thank your Chipotle assembly line soldiers! They are doing this for basically 0% tip, and your rudeness isn't going to rub them the right way! I always thank my Chipotle warriors, and if you're doing a "secret menu" request or a "secrets to Chipotle" insider move, be cool about it. 

The location is in the middle of a busy shopping plaza with many other food options around. Parking is a beezy because everything is so tight and narrowly spaced, be careful not to dent anyone else's car. I wouldn't come back to this location unless I happened to be in a rush and needed food on the way, but this Chipotle shouldn't deserve so much hate! There are plenty of spots for diners and they also have an outdoors area for patio seating.

I personally prefer the Cupertino or West San Jo Chipotle over this one, but there wasn't any hatred towards this location like other Yelpers have voiced below.







The service line was not organized and except for the cashier the folks were rude it was late maybe they were tired but being polite is a requirement in the hospitality industry. They had run of chicken and I was informed after the fact of staying in line and half way through the line.







Decent burrito, not amazing but ok.  When we arrived the line was well over 20 people long.  If my GF didn't want Chipotle I'd have left right then.  It took nearly 6 minutes of waiting in line for them to even ring up a customer.  We were in line about 25 minutes before we got up to the counter  The employees work out of rythm with each other which slows the process down.  Burritos sit on the cold counter with warm meat on them cooling then get watery ice cold sour cream put on them that guarantees your take out will be cold by the time you get anywhere.  All for only $9.90 with guacamole.  
I won't be back............

The staff here was aces today. They engaged the little boy I had with me and were super friendly and kind. They all seemed to have a good relationship and that always gives a place a better vibe. I just wish it wasn't so damn cold inside!  My little mans quesadilla was cold way too soon and I was freezing in a hoodie. But the food is always great and the service is super efficient. And I always enjoy reading their bags and cups.

Updated review



**UPDATE: no change in hours posted for the Sunday before the July 4th holiday, which is a TUESDAY by the way, however the doors were closed/locked and window shades pulled. This was 8:45 on Sunday 7/2/17. If you're gonna close your store early, at least post prior notice or make it on the hour. You're supposed to close at 10pm., not just whenever you feel like it.**Would give 0 stars if possible. I absolutely agree with the other reviews. The service here is slow, underprepared, and the food is typically put together sloppily. Unprofessional conversations and comments are carried on behind the counters.. only problem is the counter doesn't do anything to drown out the discussions. They often run of out items.The food is standard for a Chipotle, but they are grossly understaffed and often the line is almost to the door. This unfortunately doesn't make anyone move any faster. The staffing issue is apparent when food bits are cross contaminated into other bins and on the counter space between items.I wish there was another Mountain View/Los Altos location nearby.

I wish I could give 0 stars to this place. We came here on a Monday evening to grab a burrito bowl (first time at this location) and there were only two people in line in front of us. Somehow It took at least 10 minutes till we finally could pay for our food. They had 2 young and extremely slow people working on the line and another one walking around doing nothing. They assembled our bowls and put them aside to start assembling the other ones for the next cutomers in line. Our bowls were getting cold and we had to wait a while till they took care of a couple in front of us which took forever. I've never seen service being so slow without any legitimate reason for it to be SO slow! The food was a disaster too - the steak was tasteless and had a rubber-like texture that made me feel like I could break my teeth if I kept eating it. Guacamole was disgusting: the taste didn't even remind of avocado and made me gag. Note to management: train your employees, improve efficiency and food quality.

Chipotle has become a revived favorite of mine since their Chiptopia rewards program rolled out earlier this summer, and since they cleaned up their food quality problems.It seems redundant to review a national chain because they rotate their employees and management so much, and because the quality is meant to be uniform, but the point is that not every Chipotle is run the same way, unfortunately. This particular location is pretty good compared to others, though.The line moves fast, the workers are friendly, they don't skimp on their portions, and the food is the usual standard quality. They even go above and beyond to drip the beans and the pico de gallo before they drop it in your bowl.The end result? The properly-balanced Chipotle burrito bowl that you would expect at any other location, but always ends up escaping you anyway. This location does it right, and serves it with a smile.

The previous reviewers are on point when they say TERRIBLE customer service! The guy assembling our food gave us a big attitude about having multiple orders. He slopped together our order and threw the spoons into the containers each time, as if to confirm his annoyance. He also did an awful job wrapping our burrito, with the tortilla splaying out. Whoever manages this location needs to really clean up this shop. Get rid of employees who don't care or want to be here. No one wants to pay to get their food thrown together with a huge dose of unwarranted rudeness.

The customer service here is laughable... as in, it sucks. Big time. I've been here more than a few times, and there are 1-2 guys who are consistently friendly. BUT the rest of the people just hate making delicious burritos. One of the guys barely said two words and POINTED at each ingredient as a way of asking if I wanted it.... I've also seen one of the guys who was making the guac sneakily shove a tortilla chip in his mouth. LULz. Everything else is fine, honestly.The food quality is up-to-par. The location has tons of indoor + outdoor seating and a decently large parking lot.

If I could give this place zero stars I would. They had 8! I repeat 8 people working an only 1 person helping make the damn food! Don't go to this place it's a fucking joke. When you only have 2 people in front of you and it takes 30mins for them to take your order... smfh!

I wish there was a negative stars option. This location is horrible in fact it's the worst location I have ever been to. They need new management.  The sofritas and beans are cold. The fajita veggies are always burnt with lots of hard burnt pieces ruining the flavor of your bowl/burrito....  the guy making my bowl was ghetto.  Like sagging pants,  covered in tattoos and not artist ones really poorly done ones and he looked unhygienic.  Furthermore, he was not friendly at all and was acting like I was waisting his time when we we're the only ones in the line. Super attitude...  The dinning room was empty yet the tables were dirty. All of the employees were in the back and the guy who made out bowls had to call back there to get someone to ring us up.  I have never seen such horrible employees at a Chipotle and I wouldn't be surprised if this location shut down.

I LOVE Chipotle, but this location has the worst customer service! It seems to me when a company has recently suffered losses and customers as much as Chipotle, you'd think management would work hard to keep their remaining customers. Last night, I ordered a chicken salad and a chicken bowl. I was given a small amount of white rice in my bowl and politely asked the female employee TWO TIMES for more rice. Ordered extra chicken for the salad and chips & guacamole. Nothing more. Pretty simple. But after I came home, this is what I was charged:Chicken Bowl (2 @ $7.15) = $14.30Veggie 3 Pointer = $5.25Extra Chicken = $2.30Chips & Guac = $3.55Total after tax = $27.31Wow, thanks for ripping me off, Jose! I still love Chipotle, but not this location! There was no one else in line and I still felt rushed. So much so that I forgot to ask for refried beans in my chicken bowl. That never happens at the Sunnyvale location and the employees don't pad the bill either!!!








Overcharged me for 2 chicken bowls instead of 1. Not helping keep the customers who still frequent Chipotle!

Came here yesterday (Friday) for dinner only to find that the store was closed due to not having any hot water.Came back tonight @820pm for a chorizo bowl to find that there was barely and chorizo left and not even any being cooked for its replacement. They tell me it'll be 10 minutes to cook so I said I'll wait. It took 25 min.

I have never step foot inside this location, but had such an incredible customer experience over the phone that I just had to share. The boyfriend forgot his wallet at home (1.5hrs away) one day, and I scrambled to find a way to ensure he gets fed for lunch. Thank goodness for online ordering. As I'm going through the process, the earliest pick-up time is past his scheduled lunch hour. I take it one step further by trying my luck by calling the store location. I talk to this guy, Alex, I think? I tell him my situation and he offers to speed things up for him if he just comes inside and orders directly in-person. I tell him that I need to specifically place the order online so that I may use my credit card to pay for the meal. This guy takes it to another level and offers for my boyfriend to ask for him directly and will comp his meal. Full transparency, my efforts took so long that my boyfriend didn't have enough time to take advantage of the offer. But considering the thoughtfulness of this guy over the phone, and the fact that he spent all that time with me on the phone on a very busy lunch rush with a large catering order to attend to, I could not let this go unnoticed. Plus, in the event the guy I spoke to is reading this, it makes me feel better knowing why my boyfriend never showed up.It's just nice to know that there are still people out there who go the extra mile. Thank you!

Haven't been to a place with worse customer service than this establishment. The guys behind the counter are more busy talking among themselves than listening to what I am asking them.  They just want to rush you through the assembly line. If you have more than one order it's a nightmare to get what you want. One guy is adding white rice and another one is adding chicken even though what I wanted was brown rice and tofu. They don't even bother asking. Makes wonder if these employees receive any training at all. I have had this experience multiple times and not just at this Chipotle location. Makes me think something is seriously wrong with how Chipotle conducts business and what values it stands for. Absolutely disgusted.

This is the worst Chipotle ever. Terrible customer service and the food is stale. Never coming back.

I write this as a fan of Chipotle, but I must say that this particular location is a blight on the overall company image.I've been there twice in two days,. The place has an overall sloppy appearance. The tables are not cleaned, the staff is somewhat rude and informal, and the fruit prep is sloppy and untrained.I've seen two different personelle now wrap two different burritos making it into a ball rather than a cylinder. Completely falls apart and inedible. Sloppy and uncaring.Also the food quality: The food did not taste fresh,  most notably the meat and the wrap. On this last time I came out they were out of chips. Since when has Chipotle ever been out of chips?. It happens at this location, apparently.They were completely out of napkins at the condiment section.You would think for a chain that has had some food safety issues in the last few years, that they would be doubling down on safety, customer service, and quality. This place does not seem to of gotten the memo or follow the news. If I had heard this location was the source of food safety concerns I would not in the least be surprised.This location is in serious need of adult supervision. This franchise owner is negligent in what they're doing, and Chipotle corporate should take action immediately with this franchise owner.

Don't know why everyone's hating on this Chipotle so much. Came here for a quick lunch and got my go-to: sofritas burrito to go!  Staff wasn't too efficient (line wait was about 5-10 minutes), however they were polite. There were about three people in the assembly line on Thursday late afternoon around 2PM-ish. Here's the thing...lunch rush is called lunch RUSH for a reason. People only get an hour break, so of course they was speedy service when there's high traffic. You HAVE to thank your Chipotle assembly line soldiers! They are doing this for basically 0% tip, and your rudeness isn't going to rub them the right way! I always thank my Chipotle warriors, and if you're doing a "secret menu" request or a "secrets to Chipotle" insider move, be cool about it. The location is in the middle of a busy shopping plaza with many other food options around. Parking is a beezy because everything is so tight and narrowly spaced, be careful not to dent anyone else's car. I wouldn't come back to this location unless I happened to be in a rush and needed food on the way, but this Chipotle shouldn't deserve so much hate! There are plenty of spots for diners and they also have an outdoors area for patio seating.I personally prefer the Cupertino or West San Jo Chipotle over this one, but there wasn't any hatred towards this location like other Yelpers have voiced below.

The service line was not organized and except for the cashier the folks were rude it was late maybe they were tired but being polite is a requirement in the hospitality industry. They had run of chicken and I was informed after the fact of staying in line and half way through the line.

            Listed in Yelp's 100 in 2015 Challenge!, My Neighborhood, Mexican!!!!


Decent burrito, not amazing but ok.  When we arrived the line was well over 20 people long.  If my GF didn't want Chipotle I'd have left right then.  It took nearly 6 minutes of waiting in line for them to even ring up a customer.  We were in line about 25 minutes before we got up to the counter  The employees work out of rythm with each other which slows the process down.  Burritos sit on the cold counter with warm meat on them cooling then get watery ice cold sour cream put on them that guarantees your take out will be cold by the time you get anywhere.  All for only $9.90 with guacamole.  I won't be back............








Only part of this crazy line!  Damn!

Specialties

            Changing the way the world thinks about and eats fast food.  When Chipotle opened its first restaurant in 1993, the idea was simple: show that food served fast didn't have to be a "fast-food" experience. Using high-quality raw ingredients, classic cooking techniques, and distinctive interior design, we brought features from the realm of fine dining to the world of quick-service restaurants.  Over 20 years later, our devotion to finding the very best ingredients we can--with respect for animals, farmers, and the environment--is shown through our Food With Integrity commitment. And as we grow, our dedication to creating an exceptional experience for our customers is the natural result of cultivating a culture of genuine, rewarding opportunities for our employees.
        
History

                    Established in 1993.
            

                Steve Ells, founder, chairman and co-CEO, started Chipotle with the idea that food served fast did not have to be a typical fast food experience. Today, Chipotle continues to offer a focused menu of burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads made from fresh, high-quality raw ingredients, prepared using classic cooking methods and served in a distinctive atmosphere. Through our vision of Food with Integrity, Chipotle is seeking better food not only from using fresh ingredients, but ingredients that are sustainably grown and naturally raised with respect for the animals, the land, and the farmers who produce the food. Chipotle opened its first restaurant in 1993 and currently operates more than 1000 restaurants. For more information, visit our website today.

food is ALWAYS amazing!!! I come here all the time... check my check ins ;)
I go out of my way to come to this one
customer service is always great.  Francisco has such a great personality.







What's up with this chipotle? I ordered steak bowl with all sides and got a half empty bowl.
I had 3 pieces of tiny steaks cubes. In other Chipotle, I would get 3 times the portion I got today. 

I get that some Chipotle gives less than others, but this is really beyond my expectation. 

I still like Chipotle, but will stay away from this one from now on.







Chipotle is terrible. Back in 2002 or so McDonald's had an investment in this awful company. They make tacos and burritos like Subway makes sandwiches. But Mexican food is supposed to be authentic. This is not.

And even worse, they use Postmates for their deliveries! Postmates is a scam. They pay ALL employees as independent contractors, not just drivers.

Boycott all chipotles. UNO MAS is good. Or Rubio's. Taco Bell.







Upon entering, I saw patrons eating hefty Chipotle bowls. Only one person was in front of us in line. A lady helped us with our two bowls and super skimped on our bowls. I got the veggie bowl and always ask for extra bell pepper mix, each tong full she gave was half of a normal scoop. Her rice was also half of a normal scoop too. Both guacamole containers were 3/4 full. Needless to say this was not a good visit. Our bowls were 2/3 full vs. the normal 3/4. 

Rude service too.







I find it hard to believe that anyone, yes anyone, let alone Chipotle, can make a terrible burrito. But, alas, I learned today that it's possible. where do I start? How about the tortilla being really hot on one side and freezing cold on the other? Or that the rice and chicken were barely lukewarm? It was just a cold-hot mess.
And, honestly, I resent having to pay $2.10 for guacamole for a burrito. That should be illegal. But never mind, I won't be worrying about this ever again at a Chipotle!







I used Chipotle catering for the first time for a small work event and it was great! The online ordering system is extremely easy to use and allows for modifications and special requests. I chose to do pick-up instead of delivery to ensure for the first time to ensure nothing was forgotten. The food was hot and fresha and ready by the pick-up time. The manager even helped bring the food into the car. Included in the order are disposable chafing dishes and fuel which is made for very easy presentation. I would definitely recommend Chipotle for any catering needs.







In Chipotle, we trust!

This is my go to Chipotle. At first like everyone else, I gave into the mistrust as the wide spew of health concerns exploded on news outlets on numerous occasions. Health scares definitely repel the crowds and I'm thankful that I get to enjoy my meal in peace.

This particular location's entrance faces the street and is right across from Michaels so you have to walk around the plaza to find the door.

I find that most Chipotles are just average. I have yet to experience one that blows my mind. But this Chipotle in particular is more than sufficient. I find that they're very sparse when it comes to good customer service or a hefty scoop of protein. They can get skimpy with their portions, but most places are so unless you get double meat, you're basically left with a bowl of beans, lettuce, and salsa juice.

I usually get the burrito bowl with brown rice, black beans, chicken, corn, pico, lettuce, sour cream and cheese. The sour cream at Chipotle is my favorite! It's so incredibly thick and dreamy, unlike the quality of sour cream you get at your standard grocery store.

Overall, this is a Chipotes that will satisfy for your clean Mexican food cravings and provide a clean atmosphere to dine in.







Vegetarian and low carb friendly! I got a salad bowl with sofrito tofu and beans and cheese and grilled veggies and pico de gallo and salad dressing. My carnivore partner was happy with whatever they put in his burrito. Fast prep and right near work! Who could ask for more. Oh and decent prices to, under $10 for most entrees! I am sure that I will be back.







I love Chipotle, but I wouldn't give them all a 5 star.  The other day, there was a nice family in front of me with 3 children being children (playing and running around having fun while in line).  The parents were obviously stressed out and were having a difficult time keeping the kids under control.  I found the experience rather comical, but you could tell that the parents felt bad for me when one of the kids accidentally punch my leg.  Apparently, one of the Chipotle employees felt bad as well, because he ended up giving me my meal free of charge!! 

The staff here are amazing!  I eat at this Chipotle all the time for lunch and the staff are always fantastic and ready to serve your meal with a smile.  I'll definitely keep coming back!  I hope everyone has a great experience here like I do every time!







This place is pretty good. I actually really like the flavors combining inside the burrito. The grilled green peppers and onions give it a nice fajita flavor, and I enjoy the corn salsa with it's spicy kick. It is a nice change of pace from the multitude Mexican burrito places, as it tastes a little different.

The reason I am only giving Chipotle 3 stars is their dang cheapness on meat! Why so cheap? I don't get it. They go overboard on the "filler" of rice and beans, leaving little space for the meat, they then daintily sprinkle the meat on top like it's gold, chintzy chintzy chintzy. If only they would train their people to be more generous? I actually stopped going to Chipotle because of this, and only came back today after a very long time, and yep....still cheapo's on the meat.







I have eaten here many times, but today the beef was clearly tasting like old meat that has gone bad. I needed to buy a chicken taco to go after my dinner for someone else, so I took it as a chance to let the server know. He really didnt seem to care. I recommended he taste one, I wasn't really complaining, more letting him know that there is something wrong. I then mentioned it to the cashier and got the same non caring kind of response.  He mentioned that it must have been the style of the person preparing it that day. I repeated that it was just 20 min ago. No movement in any way to fix it for future customers, nor taking care of my second order. Seeing the low reviews here now makes sense.







This chipotle is absolutely GROSS!!!!! I go to chipotle almost every day! The one on El Camino and I never had a problem today was my first time trying this location with my co worker and we both threw our bowls away! The guacamole was not right the recipe was off! The steak was so hard I could not chew. The lady gave me a half a scoop of rice I had to ask for more... also the cook was just standing there on his phone.... this chipotle must be ran by a very cheap owner and a manager who does not care!







I literally stop to any chipotle I can when traveling (I also used to work for chipotle so when it comes to customer service I know how it should and should not be like) this one was the next offramp... we get here and we weren't even greeted. The guy that started serving us looked like he hated it here and hated that he had to serve me. He rushed through everything and almost put corn when I said NO corn. Then he did the guacamole and I clearly saw a huge avocado slice not mashed and asked for him to take it out. He acted like I was stupid and got a spoon and basically just moved it around and didn't even get it. Just plain out rude. The fellow at the cashier was fine, not energetic or anything.
But low and behold I sit down and there's a huge avocado slice just like I said there was _ thanks dude.
BUT overall the food tastes really good, just think y'all need to fix your attitudes... I was not amused and I'm sure a secret shopper wouldn't be amused. And if this restaurant is even considered a restauranteur store I would literally be shocked.







I rarely visit Chiptole since using their nutrition calculator https://chipotle.com/nutrition-calculator,  frightening!   We have so many authentic Mexican places to choose from, why choose Faux Mexican?   But on this day we happened to be in that devils triangle of shopping; Costco, Bed Bath Beyond and REI, we were hungry so decided to split a burrito.   When I requested that the burrito be cut in half, the person making it said  "we are not allowed to do that" and then directed me to the plastic cutlery...strange. The burrito was not great, the plastic cutlery, the blaring music all made for an underwhelming experience.   

I suppose the same people who like Starbucks, prefer a cookie-cutter fast-food restaurant to the real deal....not me.  Awarding two stars, although that is generous IMO.







I just wanted to give a shout out to my local Chipotle. I'm 9 months pregnant (due any day now) and I've been to Chipotle more times during this pregnancy than I should probably admit to. But every single employee there has been extremely kind and helpful over the last few months. They have taken the time to get to know me, check in on me, have talked baby names, held the door open-- even paid for my food themselves on multiple occasions. So many small acts of friendliness have really made a difference and I really appreciate how wonderful everyone has been. There are some great employees here and Chipotle should be proud.







The place I go to for all of my chipotle needs!! 

What can I say about this place? Great location, clean, outdoor seating, and quick service even when the line is out the door. 

A little skimpy on the Guacamole but if you ask for a little more they are pretty good about that. 

The staff is very friendly and helpful. I think a lot of people would agree with me that this location is a go-to if you're in the area. It's nice to see a staff that always has a smile on their face after finishing the transaction.







Never going back to this sh*thole. While building a  burrito, I spotted charred, black & burnt pieces of chicken, when I pointed it out the employee just shrugged and mixed the burnt meat with the other unburnt pieces saying "we grill our food". I asked for the manager, who was on break, so I couldn't report this person. Serving burnt carcinogens to unsuspecting patrons!







Let me start with this- I am an avid Chipotle fan. During about a 7 year span, I ate at chipotle at least once per week. 
I just ate the worst burrito I have ever received. There were only two people in line, so I'm not sure what the rush was to finish my burrito, but the European gentleman who was helping me didn't seem to have a clue, though he was very nice. I asked for a steak burrito, which was looking good til I asked for lettuce- I asked for a pinch of lettuce- he grabbed possibly the largest handful I had ever seen. 
Ok, all seems well, first three bites- all lettuce. The first 3/4 of the burrito had 0 meat, literally just lettuce, rice, and a fat ball of cheese. I am disappointed and will not be returning to this chipotle.







Enjoyed our carnitas bowls. We always get double rice no beans because we like the cilantro rice so much. Reasonably healthy food very inexpensive. The servers we had tonight weren't very friendly & the cashier was more interested in cleaning up than ringing up which was nice but it was holding up the line. We usually go to this location as the wait is less than the El Monte location, more tables & not as gloomy.







I usually order online and pick up in store but since they seem to always get my order incorrect, I decided to walk in. The line was short, which was nice but the customer service was kinda blah. I hate establishments where employees don't seem to enjoy where they work,  makes the whole experience pretty junk. I hope this place gets it together soon.

What's up with this chipotle? I ordered steak bowl with all sides and got a half empty bowl.I had 3 pieces of tiny steaks cubes. In other Chipotle, I would get 3 times the portion I got today. I get that some Chipotle gives less than others, but this is really beyond my expectation. I still like Chipotle, but will stay away from this one from now on.

Chipotle is terrible. Back in 2002 or so McDonald's had an investment in this awful company. They make tacos and burritos like Subway makes sandwiches. But Mexican food is supposed to be authentic. This is not.And even worse, they use Postmates for their deliveries! Postmates is a scam. They pay ALL employees as independent contractors, not just drivers.Boycott all chipotles. UNO MAS is good. Or Rubio's. Taco Bell.

Upon entering, I saw patrons eating hefty Chipotle bowls. Only one person was in front of us in line. A lady helped us with our two bowls and super skimped on our bowls. I got the veggie bowl and always ask for extra bell pepper mix, each tong full she gave was half of a normal scoop. Her rice was also half of a normal scoop too. Both guacamole containers were 3/4 full. Needless to say this was not a good visit. Our bowls were 2/3 full vs. the normal 3/4. Rude service too.

I find it hard to believe that anyone, yes anyone, let alone Chipotle, can make a terrible burrito. But, alas, I learned today that it's possible. where do I start? How about the tortilla being really hot on one side and freezing cold on the other? Or that the rice and chicken were barely lukewarm? It was just a cold-hot mess.And, honestly, I resent having to pay $2.10 for guacamole for a burrito. That should be illegal. But never mind, I won't be worrying about this ever again at a Chipotle!

I used Chipotle catering for the first time for a small work event and it was great! The online ordering system is extremely easy to use and allows for modifications and special requests. I chose to do pick-up instead of delivery to ensure for the first time to ensure nothing was forgotten. The food was hot and fresha and ready by the pick-up time. The manager even helped bring the food into the car. Included in the order are disposable chafing dishes and fuel which is made for very easy presentation. I would definitely recommend Chipotle for any catering needs.

In Chipotle, we trust!This is my go to Chipotle. At first like everyone else, I gave into the mistrust as the wide spew of health concerns exploded on news outlets on numerous occasions. Health scares definitely repel the crowds and I'm thankful that I get to enjoy my meal in peace.This particular location's entrance faces the street and is right across from Michaels so you have to walk around the plaza to find the door.I find that most Chipotles are just average. I have yet to experience one that blows my mind. But this Chipotle in particular is more than sufficient. I find that they're very sparse when it comes to good customer service or a hefty scoop of protein. They can get skimpy with their portions, but most places are so unless you get double meat, you're basically left with a bowl of beans, lettuce, and salsa juice.I usually get the burrito bowl with brown rice, black beans, chicken, corn, pico, lettuce, sour cream and cheese. The sour cream at Chipotle is my favorite! It's so incredibly thick and dreamy, unlike the quality of sour cream you get at your standard grocery store.Overall, this is a Chipotes that will satisfy for your clean Mexican food cravings and provide a clean atmosphere to dine in.








Location and entrance is located towards the street side, facing Michaels.

Vegetarian and low carb friendly! I got a salad bowl with sofrito tofu and beans and cheese and grilled veggies and pico de gallo and salad dressing. My carnivore partner was happy with whatever they put in his burrito. Fast prep and right near work! Who could ask for more. Oh and decent prices to, under $10 for most entrees! I am sure that I will be back.

I love Chipotle, but I wouldn't give them all a 5 star.  The other day, there was a nice family in front of me with 3 children being children (playing and running around having fun while in line).  The parents were obviously stressed out and were having a difficult time keeping the kids under control.  I found the experience rather comical, but you could tell that the parents felt bad for me when one of the kids accidentally punch my leg.  Apparently, one of the Chipotle employees felt bad as well, because he ended up giving me my meal free of charge!! The staff here are amazing!  I eat at this Chipotle all the time for lunch and the staff are always fantastic and ready to serve your meal with a smile.  I'll definitely keep coming back!  I hope everyone has a great experience here like I do every time!

This place is pretty good. I actually really like the flavors combining inside the burrito. The grilled green peppers and onions give it a nice fajita flavor, and I enjoy the corn salsa with it's spicy kick. It is a nice change of pace from the multitude Mexican burrito places, as it tastes a little different.The reason I am only giving Chipotle 3 stars is their dang cheapness on meat! Why so cheap? I don't get it. They go overboard on the "filler" of rice and beans, leaving little space for the meat, they then daintily sprinkle the meat on top like it's gold, chintzy chintzy chintzy. If only they would train their people to be more generous? I actually stopped going to Chipotle because of this, and only came back today after a very long time, and yep....still cheapo's on the meat.

I have eaten here many times, but today the beef was clearly tasting like old meat that has gone bad. I needed to buy a chicken taco to go after my dinner for someone else, so I took it as a chance to let the server know. He really didnt seem to care. I recommended he taste one, I wasn't really complaining, more letting him know that there is something wrong. I then mentioned it to the cashier and got the same non caring kind of response.  He mentioned that it must have been the style of the person preparing it that day. I repeated that it was just 20 min ago. No movement in any way to fix it for future customers, nor taking care of my second order. Seeing the low reviews here now makes sense.

This chipotle is absolutely GROSS!!!!! I go to chipotle almost every day! The one on El Camino and I never had a problem today was my first time trying this location with my co worker and we both threw our bowls away! The guacamole was not right the recipe was off! The steak was so hard I could not chew. The lady gave me a half a scoop of rice I had to ask for more... also the cook was just standing there on his phone.... this chipotle must be ran by a very cheap owner and a manager who does not care!

I literally stop to any chipotle I can when traveling (I also used to work for chipotle so when it comes to customer service I know how it should and should not be like) this one was the next offramp... we get here and we weren't even greeted. The guy that started serving us looked like he hated it here and hated that he had to serve me. He rushed through everything and almost put corn when I said NO corn. Then he did the guacamole and I clearly saw a huge avocado slice not mashed and asked for him to take it out. He acted like I was stupid and got a spoon and basically just moved it around and didn't even get it. Just plain out rude. The fellow at the cashier was fine, not energetic or anything.But low and behold I sit down and there's a huge avocado slice just like I said there was _ thanks dude.BUT overall the food tastes really good, just think y'all need to fix your attitudes... I was not amused and I'm sure a secret shopper wouldn't be amused. And if this restaurant is even considered a restauranteur store I would literally be shocked.

I rarely visit Chiptole since using their nutrition calculator chipotle.com/nutrition-c…,  frightening!   We have so many authentic Mexican places to choose from, why choose Faux Mexican?   But on this day we happened to be in that devils triangle of shopping; Costco, Bed Bath Beyond and REI, we were hungry so decided to split a burrito.   When I requested that the burrito be cut in half, the person making it said  "we are not allowed to do that" and then directed me to the plastic cutlery...strange. The burrito was not great, the plastic cutlery, the blaring music all made for an underwhelming experience.   I suppose the same people who like Starbucks, prefer a cookie-cutter fast-food restaurant to the real deal....not me.  Awarding two stars, although that is generous IMO.

I just wanted to give a shout out to my local Chipotle. I'm 9 months pregnant (due any day now) and I've been to Chipotle more times during this pregnancy than I should probably admit to. But every single employee there has been extremely kind and helpful over the last few months. They have taken the time to get to know me, check in on me, have talked baby names, held the door open-- even paid for my food themselves on multiple occasions. So many small acts of friendliness have really made a difference and I really appreciate how wonderful everyone has been. There are some great employees here and Chipotle should be proud.

The place I go to for all of my chipotle needs!! What can I say about this place? Great location, clean, outdoor seating, and quick service even when the line is out the door. A little skimpy on the Guacamole but if you ask for a little more they are pretty good about that. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I think a lot of people would agree with me that this location is a go-to if you're in the area. It's nice to see a staff that always has a smile on their face after finishing the transaction.

Never going back to this sh*thole. While building a  burrito, I spotted charred, black & burnt pieces of chicken, when I pointed it out the employee just shrugged and mixed the burnt meat with the other unburnt pieces saying "we grill our food". I asked for the manager, who was on break, so I couldn't report this person. Serving burnt carcinogens to unsuspecting patrons!

Let me start with this- I am an avid Chipotle fan. During about a 7 year span, I ate at chipotle at least once per week. I just ate the worst burrito I have ever received. There were only two people in line, so I'm not sure what the rush was to finish my burrito, but the European gentleman who was helping me didn't seem to have a clue, though he was very nice. I asked for a steak burrito, which was looking good til I asked for lettuce- I asked for a pinch of lettuce- he grabbed possibly the largest handful I had ever seen. Ok, all seems well, first three bites- all lettuce. The first 3/4 of the burrito had 0 meat, literally just lettuce, rice, and a fat ball of cheese. I am disappointed and will not be returning to this chipotle.

Enjoyed our carnitas bowls. We always get double rice no beans because we like the cilantro rice so much. Reasonably healthy food very inexpensive. The servers we had tonight weren't very friendly & the cashier was more interested in cleaning up than ringing up which was nice but it was holding up the line. We usually go to this location as the wait is less than the El Monte location, more tables & not as gloomy.

I usually order online and pick up in store but since they seem to always get my order incorrect, I decided to walk in. The line was short, which was nice but the customer service was kinda blah. I hate establishments where employees don't seem to enjoy where they work,  makes the whole experience pretty junk. I hope this place gets it together soon.

Specialties

            Changing the way the world thinks about and eats fast food.  When Chipotle opened its first restaurant in 1993, the idea was simple: show that food served fast didn't have to be a "fast-food" experience. Using high-quality raw ingredients, classic cooking techniques, and distinctive interior design, we brought features from the realm of fine dining to the world of quick-service restaurants.  Over 20 years later, our devotion to finding the very best ingredients we can--with respect for animals, farmers, and the environment--is shown through our Food With Integrity commitment. And as we grow, our dedication to creating an exceptional experience for our customers is the natural result of cultivating a culture of genuine, rewarding opportunities for our employees.
        
History

                    Established in 1993.
            

                Steve Ells, founder, chairman and co-CEO, started Chipotle with the idea that food served fast did not have to be a typical fast food experience. Today, Chipotle continues to offer a focused menu of burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads made from fresh, high-quality raw ingredients, prepared using classic cooking methods and served in a distinctive atmosphere. Through our vision of Food with Integrity, Chipotle is seeking better food not only from using fresh ingredients, but ingredients that are sustainably grown and naturally raised with respect for the animals, the land, and the farmers who produce the food. Chipotle opened its first restaurant in 1993 and currently operates more than 1000 restaurants. For more information, visit our website today.

I just wanted to give kudos to the staff at this location. Far superior to the one at the Stanford Mall!

The order was done right, I paid quickly, and they even wrote my name in my native language even though none of them were actually ethnically Korean. It was a nice touch and made me smile. Great branch!

Do not come here!!!! Cars are getting baseball bats to windows of cars daily. 4 cars today. Chipotle knows that this happens daily for the last 2 years. My Uncle's car was smashed today. Police are here now.

Was here today Friday afternoon 430pm on 6/16/17
The customer service was great and so was portion sizes BUT as I was leaving I noticed 2 separate parking spaces with piles of broken car glass. There has to be some tweakers or car thieves who live in the neighborhood. PEOPLE DO NOT leave your worthy belongings in plain view always put them in the trunk.







Yum!

I tried Chipotle years ago and wasn't too happy about the inordinate amount of rice versus meat options, so never went back.

However, stopped by with the bf and tried one of their salad bowls and now I'm sold.  Without the starch and all the greens and beans/chicken/guac, I've met my match in mostly protein!  This is done cafeteria style so move along with your order.  I usually ask for the dressing on the side since it is oil-based but I usually get three meals out of one bowl.  

Quick, efficient, and the seating area is quite roomy and nice.  Just make sure you get there to beat the lunch crowd.  It gets packed quickly.







The staff literally gave me 4 pieces of veggies and 4 pieces of chicken as if they are doing me a favor. I had to ask multiple times to give me more but the guy continued picking piece by piece. I hope it's not a chipotle wide thing else people would just stop coming here. V rude!







Came here to take advantage of their BOGO deal for Veteran's Day. The food was good (it usually is always consistent in my book), but we decided to get a couple of their margaritas to try as well. I've never ordered a drink from Chipotle, and I was surprised that they actually whipped out their margarita shaker and actually made the drink right then and there. I was half expecting something to come out in a box. 

The drinks were only ok, they tasted watered down to me, but it was nice to have with our burrito bowls.







Hm, tried it again here, they seemed to have fixed their issues with the guac. Portion still varies from "No seriously, where is the meat" to "Eh, that's two meals!" I tip on the later.







The food is good, but compared to other chipotle places I've been they give you really small portions. Usually my bowl is packed but there was so much space and they charge for extra when it's not even extra. Disappointed :/







Only reason they are getting a one was because the cashier was the only friendly person there. We paid a visit to this chipotle today 10/16/16. We got in and really all the employees looked miserable. It was the sloppiest mess of food we have been ever served. They didn't drain any of the juices, I felt like I was in a mess hall, where they slap your food down and you move on. We finally got to the cashier, and he was the only one smiling and friendly. 

After I paid I asked for lemons, and they said they will get someone to cut up some lemons because they were all out. We asked again about 10 minutes later, and still no lemons. I gave up on my lemon slices. 

As my husband and I are our food, we noticed the rice was way undercooked. I literally started picking on my food to so I wouldn't have to cook the undercooked rice. My husband was a sport and ate it because they already messed up ok his burrito once. 

Probably won't be going back to this chipotle location. I'll try the Stanford Shopping Center one next time.







I always pass by this particular Chipotle on the way to my regular doctor visits. Was here once by my self, and there was nothing noteworthy about it.

It hasn't been until today, with my dad, that I noticed the great service that they provide. There are about 5 kinds of meats including chicken, beef, or pork. There are about 2 kinds of beans. There is cheese, corn, rice, brown rice, and salsa. 

During this trip, I ordered the burrito with brown rice, pinto beans, chicken, mild salsa, cheese, and corn. I shared this huge burrito with one other person, and that portion size was more than enough.

I will be back again. 4 stars because the service and food was good. Just wish the facility was cleaner, and there were more bathrooms.







I went to get a taco at this chipotle before it closed. When I FINISHED getting this taco asking for extra of ingredients. Some guy I assume the manager, proceeded to jump in and insist that he was suddenly going to charge me for a bowl, yes that's right chipotle the prices change at chipotle depending on who's ordering. At the end my taco is now a bowl??? I can get extra with anything else burritos, bowls...except on tacos... seriously I have never heard anyone tell me this at any chipotle ever. he insisted since it didn't fit on a tortilla I need to pay more (this is a new criteria) AND I need to be the person to make sure this doesn't happen. Who does that? singling me out and insisting that I pay more because you know he *feels* like it. That's really messed up. Do you really need to read yelp to find the manager is a "jerk" or portions are "skimpy"??







We were unfortunate enough to happen to be nearby this location for lunch so stopped by with no thoughts but found they had no vegetable mix left at all and didn't even have any in the queue. That's fine but the annoying part was they didn't even seem apologetic for it and were joking that it was gonna take another hour to be ready when i asked how long it was gonna take. Um what? Most skimpy a$$ burrito bowl I have EVER gotten at a chipotles.







I go to this Chipotle several times a month. The quality is always consistent no matter which location I visit, but the staff at this one in particular are extra friendly and efficient. Love love love chipotle.







I have no idea what's been happening here recently that merits reviews prior to this, but I can say that when I was there the portions were generous, the food was great, and the service was quick. What more than you ask for from a fast food chain? 

I ate here frequently over the summer, and always felt full and healthy afterwards.







Terrible service 

My friend  was getting a kids meal  and   they burnt his quesidilla 2 times!

Also the person taking my order was really mean







I love chipotle and rarely do I not eat what they give me; whether it be salty meat or super chunky guac, but uncooked rice is where I draw my line. How do you mess up rice??







Terrible attitude here. Employees seem miserable. Terrible portions, I hope you like the taste of sour cream! Customers are just as rude and out of it. I've had a bad experience every single time I have been to this location but somehow hope it will improve when I drop in every 6 months.







Do not come here!!!! Cars are getting baseball bats to windows of cars daily. 4 cars today. Chipotle knows that this happens daily for the last 2 years. My Uncle's car was smashed today. Police are here now.







We ordered here for our group at work, like more than 20 orders and they don't even give us any extra salsa and chips. Then when we got our orders and open it our orders is all messed up, some had salsa and beans although they put on the order sheet what they want. Is like they just guessing what to put in our order bowl. While my other co workers order a burrito bowl but they give them a burrito wrap what a big messed! Chipotle here is really had a poor service! Although we ordered ahead of time, they should have enough time to prepare it!







Worst Chipotle experience ever. Poor service,
No lettuce, no one at cashier. Manager was a jerk!!  I would avoid this location!!!







This is place is on point. I've been here several times and the quality, cleanliness, and speed has been superb. Will keep coming back!

DO NOT COME HERE!!!! Break into cars daily going on for the last 2 years. Baseball bat to the windows of 4 cars today and grabbed stuff from. Happened to me!! Chipotle knows that this is happening. What the helll?













I wish I had red this before going there last night.  Had my window smashed and backpack stolen, and was only in the restaurant for about five minutes.  These thieves apparently just camp out there every night waiting for quiet moment to strike.  The employees have said that they have requested additional security resources from Chipotle Corporate, but haven't gotten anything.  Until that happens, I would advise anyone with a car to stay far away.             Read less

Normally like it here, really hit or miss with portions, but you've lost a customer today with this new fake, watery, rubbery Costco guacamole. Bring back the guacamole with chunks of fresh avocado, and I'll return.  I thought Chipotle stood for fresh ingredients? I could get this green slop from Taco Bell; this is clearly over-processed and not quality. Worst part, they charged me extra for that stuff, AND overcharged me on top of that even. $11 for a sofritas salad with green stuff? Seems a couple dollars off.

I always pass by this particular Chipotle on the way to my regular doctor visits. Was here once by my self, and there was nothing noteworthy about it.It hasn't been until today, with my dad, that I noticed the great service that they provide. There are about 5 kinds of meats including chicken, beef, or pork. There are about 2 kinds of beans. There is cheese, corn, rice, brown rice, and salsa. During this trip, I ordered the burrito with brown rice, pinto beans, chicken, mild salsa, cheese, and corn. I shared this huge burrito with one other person, and that portion size was more than enough.I will be back again. 4 stars because the service and food was good. Just wish the facility was cleaner, and there were more bathrooms.

I went to get a taco at this chipotle before it closed. When I FINISHED getting this taco asking for extra of ingredients. Some guy I assume the manager, proceeded to jump in and insist that he was suddenly going to charge me for a bowl, yes that's right chipotle the prices change at chipotle depending on who's ordering. At the end my taco is now a bowl??? I can get extra with anything else burritos, bowls...except on tacos... seriously I have never heard anyone tell me this at any chipotle ever. he insisted since it didn't fit on a tortilla I need to pay more (this is a new criteria) AND I need to be the person to make sure this doesn't happen. Who does that? singling me out and insisting that I pay more because you know he *feels* like it. That's really messed up. Do you really need to read yelp to find the manager is a "jerk" or portions are "skimpy"??

We were unfortunate enough to happen to be nearby this location for lunch so stopped by with no thoughts but found they had no vegetable mix left at all and didn't even have any in the queue. That's fine but the annoying part was they didn't even seem apologetic for it and were joking that it was gonna take another hour to be ready when i asked how long it was gonna take. Um what? Most skimpy a$$ burrito bowl I have EVER gotten at a chipotles.

I go to this Chipotle several times a month. The quality is always consistent no matter which location I visit, but the staff at this one in particular are extra friendly and efficient. Love love love chipotle.

I have no idea what's been happening here recently that merits reviews prior to this, but I can say that when I was there the portions were generous, the food was great, and the service was quick. What more than you ask for from a fast food chain? I ate here frequently over the summer, and always felt full and healthy afterwards.

I love chipotle and rarely do I not eat what they give me; whether it be salty meat or super chunky guac, but uncooked rice is where I draw my line. How do you mess up rice??

Terrible attitude here. Employees seem miserable. Terrible portions, I hope you like the taste of sour cream! Customers are just as rude and out of it. I've had a bad experience every single time I have been to this location but somehow hope it will improve when I drop in every 6 months.

We ordered here for our group at work, like more than 20 orders and they don't even give us any extra salsa and chips. Then when we got our orders and open it our orders is all messed up, some had salsa and beans although they put on the order sheet what they want. Is like they just guessing what to put in our order bowl. While my other co workers order a burrito bowl but they give them a burrito wrap what a big messed! Chipotle here is really had a poor service! Although we ordered ahead of time, they should have enough time to prepare it!

Specialties

            Changing the way the world thinks about and eats fast food.  When Chipotle opened its first restaurant in 1993, the idea was simple: show that food served fast didn't have to be a "fast-food" experience. Using high-quality raw ingredients, classic cooking techniques, and distinctive interior design, we brought features from the realm of fine dining to the world of quick-service restaurants.  Over 20 years later, our devotion to finding the very best ingredients we can--with respect for animals, farmers, and the environment--is shown through our Food With Integrity commitment. And as we grow, our dedication to creating an exceptional experience for our customers is the natural result of cultivating a culture of genuine, rewarding opportunities for our employees.
        
History

                    Established in 1993.
            

                Steve Ells, founder, chairman and co-CEO, started Chipotle with the idea that food served fast did not have to be a typical fast food experience.

I only get the burrito bowls here, but they're enough for a meal, and a healthy one at that.

I like to get the barbacoa bowl or a sofritas if I'm not feelin meat. Seasoning's on point. Brown rice of course (soft here, which is great), pinto beans, with some salsa and lettuce. I get their veggies, even if they're always burnt. 

They seem to pack the bowls less and less with every visit. Contrary to popular opinion, I do like to eat. It may actually be that they anticipate me getting more options later on, but picky as I am, I only favor a few of them. 

Tip: order using their website for larger portions so they can give you more of what you like.







I don't like this place.  We came here maybe 12-18 months ago, didn't like it then, ate here again maybe 10 days ago, and my opinion hasn't changed.  But if anyone there cares, I'll explain exactly why.

1) Because I don't come here often enough, I just want to order, for example, a chicken taco.  Well, there is no such thing.  You have to tell them what tortilla you want, what beans you want, etc, etc, etc.  Fail.  I think they should have a *default* set of ingredients for a chicken taco, for a beef burrito, etc, Sometimes, I'm not interested in choosing each and every ingredient.  Yes, customization is a great thing.  But if I'm there with my wife and 2 kids, I don't necessarily want to take 10 minutes out of my life to choose all the ingredients for everything we want. 

2) We found out this the hard way.  You get a burrito with all the ingredients.  Well, they put all 3 salsas on it, and the thing was too spicy for my daughter.  Duh, if I want "everything" on my burrito, you should at least *ask* what spiciness of salsa to use.

3) Speaking of salsa.  Every other Mexican restaurant we go to, has the salsa's out for the public to choose themselves.  But not here.  Here, you have to go up the the counter and ask.  Fail.  Quit being so cheap with your salsa, and have it easily available to your customers.

4) Last one, when this place gets crowded, and I'm talking to a person 3 feet away, I can't hear what they're saying.  Why?  Because the inside of this place is all hard surfaces, with no carpeting, drapes, etc.  Reverb/echo city.  Can't hear who you're talking to.

5) Bonus item.  The last time we were here we got, 2 burritos, I think 5 tacos, and 2 sodas, for 4 people.  No chips.  How cheap is this place?  Similarly, every other Mexican place we go to, gives us chips, sort of like a complimentary appetizer while you wait for your food.  Not here.  Not at least the last time we were there (3/24 I believe).







We came here on a weekday lunch time. There were very few people. Got a parking spot right outside chipotle. Service is quick. I ordered burrito bowl with tofu. I love burrito bowl but hate it when they dont have any lemons available :(
They have variety of sauces to top your bowl with but that doesnt really take the place of what a lemon can do to my taste buds :D







This is one of the better Chipotles - there is plenty of seating, and it's clean. Food was fresh, and service was quick. 

The employees were by far the friendliest I've seen at any Chipotle, and the quality of food was better than I've gotten at other locations recently, too. 

The people in front of me were asking for extra of almost everything, and the servers didn't bat an eyelash; not the best news for corporate, but if double meat/etc. is your thing, this is your place.







I ordered a veggi bowl and there is nothing hard or crunchy I should have in my veggi bowl. I ordered to go since I was on lunch break and then while eating I found this in my mouth. Wth is this?!?!







4 stars for the awesome flamboyant guy who was serving me. I just got a bowl as I was desperately hungry and it was the only gluten free food in my route. I'm not a fan of fast food so this is my first and last time here. The chicken was a little fatty and I asked for salt and pepper and see photo they gave me 2 containers of the stuff maybe a months supply of salt and pepper how wasteful!!

The place tables could have been wiped down but I didn't eat in so it didn't bother me. Just wanted to review due to the strange salt and pepper request. Couldn't they just sprinkle it in for me instead of giving me 2 containers of it? I refused it and they warned me if I didn't take it they would throw it out. Now I'm going to try to recycle it into a shaker for my kid or something lol







No brown rice or grilled veggies at 950pm today. Won't come back around this time again. They also kicked my kids and I because "her shift ends at 1015pm". That's not my problem, that's your works problem. I should be able to eat where I order my food right? So my kids and I hadda eat outside in the cold. Thanks chipotle.







Was craving a burrito bowl and my meal hit the spot. I think Chipotle for the most part is pretty consistent and my food always comes out the way I expect it to. I would normally give a chain restaurant three stars for meeting expectations, but this place gets one extra because of two things: It was clean, and the service was better than at other Chipotle establishments I've been to. The girl coming around to sweep the floor was asking the people dining if they needed anything else, and even offered to clear our plates away if she saw we were done. And the guy that made my bowl was actually able to joke around with me versus acting like he hated his life, like I've seen from some other workers.







This is a great Chipotle. I just moved out to the Bay Area and have been here a couple times, and both experiences have been great.

The first time, what stood out to me was how a member of team went around to each table asking how their food was and if he could do/get anything for them. This is above and beyond for a fast food chain, and it really makes a difference.

The second time, I was struck by how quickly the assembly line worked behind the counter for my bowl. In many Chipotle locations, there have been multiple people behind the counter, and yet they seem to take as long as if only one person had been working on orders. This place is like a well-oiled machine, and it shows.

Definitely going to be a repeat customer, especially because of the Chipotopia rewards!







This location always fails and disappoints for several reasons: 
-Rice is always hard/ undercooked. How hard is it to mess up rice? 
-Portions are small. I asked for two scoops of corn, which is pretty much equivalent to one normal scoop of corn at other Chipotles. 
-Workers have no incentive to helping their customers, always joking around/talking to each other
-Fajitas are burnt/soggy. Aren't bell peppers suppose to have a "crunch" factor to it?

Meh, could definitely use some improvements. A lot actually.







I love chipotle but this ones just not great..

Their chips are always lacking in flavor and this visit THEY FORGOT MY GUACAMOLE!! Whuuuuut that's the best part  it's unforgiving, so I'll be holding a grudge from now on. 

I might be back just because it's close to my work.







I took a regular salad bowl. Because of the burnt fajita my whole bowl tasted awful. Employees here at this chipotle not even bothered to change the fajita.. 

Awful experience







I go here at least once or twice a month and they haven't failed me yet in terms of taste The portion really dictates on the employee who's scooping the ingredients, it's always a hit or miss. I guess it's like Panda, some employees are generous and not stingy.







Came here the other night.  No guac, the rice was uncooked and hard, and the servers were giving small portions.  I had to keep asking them to add a little more.

I love Chipotle in general but this place doesn't make me want to go back to this location.







Typical chipotle experience. Come here, get some grub, and come back again because it's cheap and good. I didn't get ecoli, so me and chipotle are still on good terms.







I went to this location for the first time. I ordered a chicken burrito, seems simple enough. When I got home and began to eat it....Something did taste funny. I think it was the rice it. it tasted a bit sour but like a moron; i still ate it. 3 hours pass by and now I feel sick to my stomach to the point that i feel like i will need to vomit to make myself feel better...ugh never going to this location again







Grumpy employees who act like robots, very different from most other chipotle locations I've been to. Out of fajitas before dinner time, no lemons. Worst chipotle experience I've had.







Food is fine by Chipotle standards, but customer service is sorely lacking. My family had an online to-go order, and they forgot the chips. Not worth going back over, so we called and asked them to refund us for the chips. We were told we would have to come back tonight (at 7 pm, in the always-insane Cherry Orchard plaza) if we wanted a refund. I've worked food service, so I know how easy it is to forget something, but we should not have to return to the restaurant to fix their mistake. 

Update: My mother went in the following day, and the manager apologized and processed her refund. Adjusting from one star to two, since this isn't the first time items have been left out of our order.







I had a long day at work and decided to stop at Chipotle on my was home to eat away the stress. The line was long because the staff was slow and inexperienced.

After waiting in the long line with no cell service, I got to the front and began my order. Steak burrito with black beans, white rice, corn, hot salsa, lettuce, guacamole and a little cheese. I'm not knocking the food. The food was delicious as always, but the staff did everything could to ruin it.

As I reached the end of the line I realized that the burrito was doomed as I watched an inexperienced burrito wrapper destroy my dreams. He botched the wrap job 4 times before a more experienced employee had to step in and then it only got worse. She brought a new tortilla in and dumped the contents into it. Then she threw away the old tortilla which was coated with the $2.95 Trump taxed guacamole that I paid for as well as other ingredients. 

Finally, I received my half sized burrito as I left Chipotle more stressed than I entered. 

W/e. I'm out.







Just came in to get something to eat.

Alex is the most friendliest person I've ever meet made me feel really welcome.
Best costumer service I've ever had.

I only get the burrito bowls here, but they're enough for a meal, and a healthy one at that.I like to get the barbacoa bowl or a sofritas if I'm not feelin meat. Seasoning's on point. Brown rice of course (soft here, which is great), pinto beans, with some salsa and lettuce. I get their veggies, even if they're always burnt. They seem to pack the bowls less and less with every visit. Contrary to popular opinion, I do like to eat. It may actually be that they anticipate me getting more options later on, but picky as I am, I only favor a few of them. Tip: order using their website for larger portions so they can give you more of what you like.

I don't like this place.  We came here maybe 12-18 months ago, didn't like it then, ate here again maybe 10 days ago, and my opinion hasn't changed.  But if anyone there cares, I'll explain exactly why.1) Because I don't come here often enough, I just want to order, for example, a chicken taco.  Well, there is no such thing.  You have to tell them what tortilla you want, what beans you want, etc, etc, etc.  Fail.  I think they should have a *default* set of ingredients for a chicken taco, for a beef burrito, etc, Sometimes, I'm not interested in choosing each and every ingredient.  Yes, customization is a great thing.  But if I'm there with my wife and 2 kids, I don't necessarily want to take 10 minutes out of my life to choose all the ingredients for everything we want. 2) We found out this the hard way.  You get a burrito with all the ingredients.  Well, they put all 3 salsas on it, and the thing was too spicy for my daughter.  Duh, if I want "everything" on my burrito, you should at least *ask* what spiciness of salsa to use.3) Speaking of salsa.  Every other Mexican restaurant we go to, has the salsa's out for the public to choose themselves.  But not here.  Here, you have to go up the the counter and ask.  Fail.  Quit being so cheap with your salsa, and have it easily available to your customers.4) Last one, when this place gets crowded, and I'm talking to a person 3 feet away, I can't hear what they're saying.  Why?  Because the inside of this place is all hard surfaces, with no carpeting, drapes, etc.  Reverb/echo city.  Can't hear who you're talking to.5) Bonus item.  The last time we were here we got, 2 burritos, I think 5 tacos, and 2 sodas, for 4 people.  No chips.  How cheap is this place?  Similarly, every other Mexican place we go to, gives us chips, sort of like a complimentary appetizer while you wait for your food.  Not here.  Not at least the last time we were there (3/24 I believe).

We came here on a weekday lunch time. There were very few people. Got a parking spot right outside chipotle. Service is quick. I ordered burrito bowl with tofu. I love burrito bowl but hate it when they dont have any lemons available :(They have variety of sauces to top your bowl with but that doesnt really take the place of what a lemon can do to my taste buds :D








Quick burrito bowl!

This is one of the better Chipotles - there is plenty of seating, and it's clean. Food was fresh, and service was quick. The employees were by far the friendliest I've seen at any Chipotle, and the quality of food was better than I've gotten at other locations recently, too. The people in front of me were asking for extra of almost everything, and the servers didn't bat an eyelash; not the best news for corporate, but if double meat/etc. is your thing, this is your place.

4 stars for the awesome flamboyant guy who was serving me. I just got a bowl as I was desperately hungry and it was the only gluten free food in my route. I'm not a fan of fast food so this is my first and last time here. The chicken was a little fatty and I asked for salt and pepper and see photo they gave me 2 containers of the stuff maybe a months supply of salt and pepper how wasteful!!The place tables could have been wiped down but I didn't eat in so it didn't bother me. Just wanted to review due to the strange salt and pepper request. Couldn't they just sprinkle it in for me instead of giving me 2 containers of it? I refused it and they warned me if I didn't take it they would throw it out. Now I'm going to try to recycle it into a shaker for my kid or something lol

No brown rice or grilled veggies at 950pm today. Won't come back around this time again. They also kicked my kids and I because "her shift ends at 1015pm". That's not my problem, that's your works problem. I should be able to eat where I order my food right? So my kids and I hadda eat outside in the cold. Thanks chipotle.

Was craving a burrito bowl and my meal hit the spot. I think Chipotle for the most part is pretty consistent and my food always comes out the way I expect it to. I would normally give a chain restaurant three stars for meeting expectations, but this place gets one extra because of two things: It was clean, and the service was better than at other Chipotle establishments I've been to. The girl coming around to sweep the floor was asking the people dining if they needed anything else, and even offered to clear our plates away if she saw we were done. And the guy that made my bowl was actually able to joke around with me versus acting like he hated his life, like I've seen from some other workers.

This is a great Chipotle. I just moved out to the Bay Area and have been here a couple times, and both experiences have been great.The first time, what stood out to me was how a member of team went around to each table asking how their food was and if he could do/get anything for them. This is above and beyond for a fast food chain, and it really makes a difference.The second time, I was struck by how quickly the assembly line worked behind the counter for my bowl. In many Chipotle locations, there have been multiple people behind the counter, and yet they seem to take as long as if only one person had been working on orders. This place is like a well-oiled machine, and it shows.Definitely going to be a repeat customer, especially because of the Chipotopia rewards!

This location always fails and disappoints for several reasons: -Rice is always hard/ undercooked. How hard is it to mess up rice? -Portions are small. I asked for two scoops of corn, which is pretty much equivalent to one normal scoop of corn at other Chipotles. -Workers have no incentive to helping their customers, always joking around/talking to each other-Fajitas are burnt/soggy. Aren't bell peppers suppose to have a "crunch" factor to it?Meh, could definitely use some improvements. A lot actually.

I love chipotle but this ones just not great..Their chips are always lacking in flavor and this visit THEY FORGOT MY GUACAMOLE!! Whuuuuut that's the best part  it's unforgiving, so I'll be holding a grudge from now on. I might be back just because it's close to my work.

I go here at least once or twice a month and they haven't failed me yet in terms of taste The portion really dictates on the employee who's scooping the ingredients, it's always a hit or miss. I guess it's like Panda, some employees are generous and not stingy.

Came here the other night.  No guac, the rice was uncooked and hard, and the servers were giving small portions.  I had to keep asking them to add a little more.I love Chipotle in general but this place doesn't make me want to go back to this location.

I give it a 2 star for decent food.  I don't order drinks cause it doubles the bill.  But I always write on poor service.  Lately, I don't know if the moon is tilted or the ocean is dry but these ladies behind the counter needs to stand upside down cause they have a frown that makes the joker look like Ronald.  So much attitude!! I just want a steak burrito please or por favor!  Stop thinking about your tattoo bf and get to work!!  They keep asking black or pinto beans.  I said NOOOO beans!!  They say WHICH BEANS!!!!!!!!  no beans....   WHICH BEANS!!!!!   u get the point

Typical chipotle experience. Come here, get some grub, and come back again because it's cheap and good. I didn't get ecoli, so me and chipotle are still on good terms.

I went to this location for the first time. I ordered a chicken burrito, seems simple enough. When I got home and began to eat it....Something did taste funny. I think it was the rice it. it tasted a bit sour but like a moron; i still ate it. 3 hours pass by and now I feel sick to my stomach to the point that i feel like i will need to vomit to make myself feel better...ugh never going to this location again

Grumpy employees who act like robots, very different from most other chipotle locations I've been to. Out of fajitas before dinner time, no lemons. Worst chipotle experience I've had.

Updated review



Food is fine by Chipotle standards, but customer service is sorely lacking. My family had an online to-go order, and they forgot the chips. Not worth going back over, so we called and asked them to refund us for the chips. We were told we would have to come back tonight (at 7 pm, in the always-insane Cherry Orchard plaza) if we wanted a refund. I've worked food service, so I know how easy it is to forget something, but we should not have to return to the restaurant to fix their mistake. Update: My mother went in the following day, and the manager apologized and processed her refund. Adjusting from one star to two, since this isn't the first time items have been left out of our order.

I had a long day at work and decided to stop at Chipotle on my was home to eat away the stress. The line was long because the staff was slow and inexperienced.After waiting in the long line with no cell service, I got to the front and began my order. Steak burrito with black beans, white rice, corn, hot salsa, lettuce, guacamole and a little cheese. I'm not knocking the food. The food was delicious as always, but the staff did everything could to ruin it.As I reached the end of the line I realized that the burrito was doomed as I watched an inexperienced burrito wrapper destroy my dreams. He botched the wrap job 4 times before a more experienced employee had to step in and then it only got worse. She brought a new tortilla in and dumped the contents into it. Then she threw away the old tortilla which was coated with the $2.95 Trump taxed guacamole that I paid for as well as other ingredients. Finally, I received my half sized burrito as I left Chipotle more stressed than I entered. W/e. I'm out.

Specialties

            Changing the way the world thinks about and eats fast food.  When Chipotle opened its first restaurant in 1993, the idea was simple: show that food served fast didn't have to be a "fast-food" experience. Using high-quality raw ingredients, classic cooking techniques, and distinctive interior design, we brought features from the realm of fine dining to the world of quick-service restaurants.  Over 20 years later, our devotion to finding the very best ingredients we can--with respect for animals, farmers, and the environment--is shown through our Food With Integrity commitment. And as we grow, our dedication to creating an exceptional experience for our customers is the natural result of cultivating a culture of genuine, rewarding opportunities for our employees.
        
History

                    Established in 1993.
            

                Steve Ells, founder, chairman and co-CEO, started Chipotle with the idea that food served fast did not have to be a typical fast food experience. Today, Chipotle continues to offer a focused menu of burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads made from fresh, high-quality raw ingredients, prepared using classic cooking methods and served in a distinctive atmosphere. Through our vision of Food with Integrity, Chipotle is seeking better food not only from using fresh ingredients, but ingredients that are sustainably grown and naturally raised with respect for the animals, the land, and the farmers who produce the food. Chipotle opened its first restaurant in 1993 and currently operates more than 1000 restaurants. For more information, visit our website today.

(NYSE:CMG) almost had Wall Street convinced that things had turned around. Almost. CMG stock had recovered some of its losses from more than a year’s worth of battering following a 2015 E. coli scandal, and management was enjoying a return of confidence in its ability to turn the ship around.Rats! Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG) Stock Is Falling Apart!MoreSource:  Mike Mozart Via FlickrAlmost.Recall that in 2015, Chipotle shares had soared to highs of more than $700. The company seemed unstoppable. The restaurant was opening up new locations left and right, and same-store growth was continuing mostly unabated. Customers were satisfied and believed they were getting a fresher, more sustainable product. Good for the environment meant good for customers meant good for shareholders.But a couple days ago, CMG stock reeled amid customer reports that they had been sickened with norovirus after eating at a location in Virginia — claims that have since been confirmed. And now, the stock is tanking yet again after diners complained of rats (actually mice) in the restaurant, with one customer claiming that her meal was “ruined by rodents falling from the ceiling.”Now come the questions. Has Chipotle done enough to ensure top standards in the supply chain? It’s hard to believe that, what with reports of 13 sick customers in Virginia, and a “structural gap” that allowed mice to get inside.  10 Value Traps to Avoid at All Costs  Meanwhile, investors really need to consider if a triple-digit earnings valuation on CMG stock is really worth it for a company that clearly has not put an end to its food-safety concerns.Is It Different This Time Around?After enough time has passed, consumers typically return to brands they historically used.Even after a horrific incident involving cyanide-laced capsules of Tylenol in the early 1980s that killed seven people, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) managed to restore consumer confidence after costly recalls. JNJ did the right thing, as far as consumers were concerned, and today, is a trusted brand for reducing fevers and pain.And Jack in the Box Inc. (NASDAQ:JACK) weathered the E. coli outbreak in 1993 after hundreds were struck ill four children died. That feels like a distant memory if a memory at all.But we live in a time with far more options and more selective consumers that live in a world where social media broadcasts your mistakes with lightning-fast speed, ensuring that everyone knows about it, quickly, and typically with enough salt to poison a lot of mental wells.Chipotle isn’t doing itself any favors by not having a perfect health record in the wake of its biggest disaster. Bottom Line on CMG StockEven backing out the chaos of the past few days, Chipotle is no longer on the same growth trajectory that it was in the mid-2000s, and traffic trends remain weak, though marketing spend ballooned in an effort to retain customers. While it has tapered off, from 2015 to 2016, the increase was almost 50%, to $103 million.And yet, during 2016, comparable-restaurant sales still declined more than 20%.  Did Amazon Just Save Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD) Stock? Nope.  Turnarounds do take time, and Chipotle was making tangible progress. But even if Chipotle hadn’t just suffered a pair of flare-ups in the past few days, CMG stock in its current state doesn’t deserve to trade at more than 100 times trailing earnings, or even the more palatable 30 times forward estimates. Peers including Del Taco Restaurants Inc (NASDAQ:TACO), JACK, and Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) all trade at forward P/Es around 20, and none of them are facing the same pressing questions into the cleanliness of their operations.Not to mention, none of them have thrust the same high bar upon themselves.One of the primary risks to Chipotle’s business, as outlined by the company itself, is that they “may not persuade customers of the benefits of paying [their] prices for higher-quality food.” Much of their success comes from customers believing in the value proposition.A bout of norovirus and rodents falling from the ceiling are likely to have an adverse effect on that belief.CMG stock is down double digits in less than a week, and those ripples should only continue as more doubt seeps in.As of this writing, Luce Emerson did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post Rats!

Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (/tʃᵻˈpoʊtleɪ/)[6] is an American chain of fast casual restaurants in the United States, United Kingdom,[7] Canada,[8][9] Germany,[10] and France,[11] specializing in tacos and Mission-style[12][13] burritos. Its name derives from chipotle, the Nahuatl name for a smoked and dried jalapeño chili pepper.[14] The company currently trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CMG.[15]
The company has released a mission statement called Food with Integrity, which highlights its efforts in using naturally-grown ingredients,[6] and serves more naturally raised meat than any other restaurant chain.[16] Chipotle is one of the first chains of fast casual dining establishments.[17] Competitors in the fast-casual Mexican market include Qdoba Mexican Grill, Moe's Southwest Grill, Rubio's Coastal Grill, Pancheros Mexican Grill, Freebirds World Burrito, and Baja Fresh.[18]
Founded by Steve Ells on July 13, 1993. Chipotle had 16 restaurants (all in Colorado) when McDonald's Corporation became a major investor in 1998. By the time McDonald's fully divested itself from Chipotle in 2006,[19] the chain had grown to over 500 locations.
With more than 2,000 locations,[2] Chipotle had a net income of US$475.6 million and a staff of more than 45,000 employees in 2015.[2]

History[edit]




The first Chipotle, near the campus of the University of Denver


Founder Steve Ells attended the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York. Afterward, he became a line cook for Jeremiah Tower at Stars in San Francisco.[20] There, Ells observed the popularity of the taquerías and San Francisco burritos in the Mission District. In 1993, Ells took what he learned in San Francisco[21] and opened the first Chipotle Mexican Grill in Denver, Colorado, in a former Dolly Madison Ice Cream store at 1644 East Evans Avenue,[22] near the University of Denver campus, using an $85,000 loan from his father.[19] Ells and his father calculated that the store would need to sell 107 burritos per day to be profitable. After one month, the original restaurant was selling over 1,000 burritos a day.[15] The second store opened in 1995 using Chipotle's cash flow, and the third was opened using an SBA loan. To fund more growth, Ells' father invested $1.5 million. Afterwards, Ells created a board of directors and business plan, raising an additional $1.8 million for the company.[23] Ells had originally planned to use funds from the first Chipotle to open a fine-dining restaurant, but instead focused on Chipotle Mexican Grill when the restaurants saw success.[24][25]
In 1998, the first restaurant outside of Colorado opened in Kansas City, Missouri.[26] The company opened its first location in Minnesota by opening near the campus of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis in March 1999.[27]
In 1998, McDonald's made an initial minority investment in the company. By 2001, the company had grown to be Chipotle's largest investor.[19] The investment from McDonald's allowed the firm to quickly expand, from 16 restaurants in 1998 to over 500 by 2005.[28] On January 26, 2006, Chipotle made its initial public offering (IPO) after increasing the share price twice due to high pre-IPO demand. In its first day as a public company, the stock rose exactly 100%, resulting in the best U.S.-based IPO in six years, and the second-best IPO for a restaurant after Boston Market. The money from the offering was then used to fund new store growth.[29]
In October 2006, McDonald's fully divested from Chipotle.[30] This was part of a larger initiative for McDonald's to divest all of its non-core business restaurants — Chipotle, Donatos Pizza, and Boston Market — so that it could focus on the main McDonald's chain.[31] McDonald's invested approximately $360 million into Chipotle, and took out $1.5 billion.[23] McDonald's had attempted to get Chipotle to add drive-through windows and a breakfast menu, which Ells resisted.[32][33] In 2008, Chipotle opened its first location outside of the United States in Toronto.[9]
In a list of fastest-growing restaurant chains in 2009, Chipotle was ranked eighth, based on increases in U.S. sales over the past year,[34] and in 2010 Chipotle was ranked third.[35] Consumer Reports ranked Chipotle as the best Mexican fast-food chain in 2011.[36] The company serves approximately 750,000 customers per day.[37]
In December 2010, Chipotle hired chef Nate Appleman to develop new cuisine. Appleman has won Rising Star Chef from the James Beard Foundation, was named "Best New Chef" by Food & Wine magazine, and competed on The Next Iron Chef.[38]
In 2010, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) audited Chipotle's Minneapolis restaurants, and found that some employees had been hired using fraudulent documents. In December, Chipotle fired 450 employees from its Minneapolis restaurants as a result of the audit, resulting in protests by local groups.[39][40] In February 2011, ICE expanded the audit to include 60 restaurants in Virginia and Washington, D.C.[41] which resulted in 40 workers being fired. In April 2011, the criminal division of the Attorney General's office in Washington, D.C., joined the case, and ICE agents began interviewing employees at 20 to 25 restaurants in other locations, such as Los Angeles and Atlanta.[42] In response to the government investigations, Chipotle hired former director of ICE Julie Myers Wood and high-profile attorneys Robert Luskin and Gregory B. Craig.[43]
Other restaurant expansion[edit]
In 2011, Steve Ells was a judge for the TV show America's Next Great Restaurant and investor of ANGR Holdings, the company that will be running the winning concept's restaurants. Chipotle has agreed to purchase Ells' investment in ANGR at his cost, provide support for ANGR operations, and invest a total of $2.3 million in cash contributions.[44]
In September 2011, Chipotle opened an Asian fast-casual concept restaurant named ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen in Washington, D.C.[45] The company has said the new restaurant "would follow the Chipotle service format and its focus on 'food with integrity' in ingredients."[46] Chipotle's plan was to start with only one store, and see how the restaurant works out before expanding the concept.[47]
On December 18, 2013, the company revealed that it had opened its first fast-food pizza chain in Denver back in May 2013. According to Associated Press, Chipotle partnered with a local full-service restaurant called Pizzeria Locale to create a fast-food version of the eatery, keeping its name. The company plans to open at least two more pizzerias in the Denver area.[48]
In April 2014, Chipotle announced an increase in menu prices for the first time in nearly three years, due to increasing costs for steak, avocados, and cheese. The price increase was expected to be rolled out from the end of second quarter of 2014 through the end of the third quarter.[49] In late 2015, Chipotle expanded its mobile strategy through delivery partnerships with tech startups like Tapingo, a delivery service that targets college campuses.[50]
On July 29, 2016, the company announced the opening of its first Tasty Made burger restaurant in the fall. Chipotle was still dealing with the various virus outbreaks with additional marketing. The company was also reducing the number of new stores for the year from 235 to 220.[51]
International[edit]




The second Chipotle Mexican Grill location in London, located on Baker Street


According to an article in The Motley Fool, Chipotle had 17 locations outside of the United States by October 2014 with the majority in Canada, and the UK was in the process of opening more locations.[52] The rate of overseas expansion was slower than expected.[53] Many of the press reviewers thought that the food was overpriced for their area.[11][54]
As of 2017 there are 26 locations outside of the United States with 11 locations in Canada (Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver), 6 locations in The United Kingdom (London), 3 in France (Paris), and 1 in Germany (Frankfurt).[better source needed][2] [55]
Canada[edit]
In August 2008, Chipotle opened its first location outside of the United States in Toronto.[9] The second location in Toronto–and in all of Canada–was not opened until 2010.[53]
The first Canadian location outside of the Toronto area was opened in Vancouver in December 2012.[56] A second Vancouver-area location was opened in Burnaby in October 2014[57] followed by a third in Surrey in January 2016[58] and a fourth in Langley in October 2016.[59]
The first location in the nation's capital of Ottawa was opened in February 2017 at the Rideau Centre.[60]
United Kingdom[edit]
Chipotle expanded to Europe with the first European restaurant opening in May 2010 in London.[7][61][62] A second location open in London in September 2011.[63] The following year, three additional locations were quickly opened in the London area.[64] After this growth spurt, the rate of further expansion in London slowed greatly with the sixth location appearing in 2013[65] and the seventh in June 2015.[66] Although Chipotle blames the slow growth in the United Kingdom on the British unfamiliarity with Mexican foods,[67] several locally owned burrito chains had opened locations across the United Kingdom during the same interval.[68]
France[edit]
The first location in France opened in Paris in May 2012.[11][69]
Expansion in France was much slower than that in the United Kingdom or Canada, with a second location in Paris opening in 2013[70] and a third location in 2014.[71] At 7,000 square feet, the restaurant at La Défense is, as of 2015[update], the largest Chipotle location in the world, while a typical Chipotle restaurant is usually between 2,200 and 2,500 square feet.[72] A fourth Parisian location was opened in Levallois-Perret in 2015[73] followed by a fifth[74] and a sixth[75] Parisian location in 2016, both in Saint-Germain-des-Prés.
Germany[edit]
The first and, so far, only location in Germany opened in Frankfurt in August 2013.[10][54]
Corporate management[edit]
Chipotle's team includes a residing corporate office of managers and its board of directors. Members of both teams are appointed to serve on committees: audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance.
The top management team consists of the Chief Executive Officers, Steve Ells; the Chief Financial Officer, Jack R. Hartung; the Chief Marketing and Development Officer, Mark Crumpacker.[76] The current board of directors consists of: Steve Ells, Patrick Flynn, Albert Baldocchi, Neil Flanzraich, Darlene Friedman, Stephen Gillet, Kimbal Musk and John Charlesworth.[77]
Founder Steve Ells serves as chairman and Chief executive officer,[78] and has a 1.25% stake in the company.[79] The labor-market research firm Glassdoor reported that Steve Ells earned $29 million in 2014, versus a median of $19,000 for Chipotle's workers, making the CEO-to-worker pay ratio 1522:1.[80]
Operation and distribution[edit]
All of Chipotle's restaurants are company-owned, rather than franchised.[81] As of December 2012[update], 1430 restaurants have since opened throughout the United States and Canada, with locations in 43 states, Ontario, British Columbia, and the District of Columbia.[82][83]
The field team are the employees who work closely with but not directly within specific restaurants. The field support system includes apprentice team leaders (step up from restaurateurs), team leaders or area managers, team directors and regional directors (not atypical for them to oversee more than fifty locations).[84] Because Chipotle does not franchise, all restaurants are corporately owned. Thus, whenever Chipotle is in the process of launching a new location, the field team hires a new general manager and trains them at a current location so that they will be ready for the new location when it opens for business. The corporate office takes care of finding and funding new locations as well.[85]
Menu[edit]

Chipotle's menu consists of four items: burritos, bowls, tacos, and salads. The price of each item is based on the choice of chicken, pork carnitas, barbacoa, steak, tofu-based "sofritas",[86][87] chorizo (chicken and pork), or vegetarian (with guacamole, which would be at an extra charge otherwise). Additional optional toppings are offered free of charge, including: rice, beans, four types of salsa, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce.[88][89] When asked in 2007 about expanding the menu, Steve Ells said, "[I]t's important to keep the menu focused, because if you just do a few things, you can ensure that you do them better than anybody else."[90] Chipotle also offers a children's menu.[91][92] Most restaurants sell beer and margaritas in addition to soft drinks and fruit drinks.[93]
The majority of food is prepared in each restaurant. Some exceptions are the beans and carnitas, which are prepared at a central kitchen in Chicago, Illinois.[94] None of the restaurants have freezers, microwave ovens, or can openers.[95]

The chain experimented with breakfast foods at two airports in the Washington (D.C.) metropolitan area but decided against expanding the menu in that direction.[96][97][98] Starting in 2009, selected restaurants had offered a pozole soup,[99][100][101] which has since been discontinued.
In June 2015, Chipotle began test marketing a pork and chicken chorizo-type sausage as a new protein option at selected locations in the Kansas City area.[102][103][104] Some food writers have expressed their health related concerns over the protein's relatively high sodium content since a 4-ounce serving contains 293 calories and 803 milligrams of sodium[105] while the American Heart Association’s recommended daily amount is less than 1,500 milligrams of sodium.[106] In contrast, the protein options with next highest sodium contents are Barbacoa with 530 milligrams and sofritas with 555 milligrams.[105] An earlier version on the Mexican sausage was tested in Denver and New York City in 2011,[107] but that test was terminated when that version of the sausage was perceived as looking too greasy.[108] As of fall 2016, chorizo is available nationwide.
Chipotle accepts fax orders, and in 2005 the company added the ability to order online from their website. For both online and fax orders, customers proceed to the front of the line to pay for pre-ordered food.[109] In 2009, Chipotle released an app for the iPhone that allows users to find nearby Chipotle locations, place an order, and prepay with a credit card.[110] In 2013, Chipotle released an Android app that allows users to locate nearby Chipotle locations, place an order, prepay with a credit or gift card, and access favorites and recent orders.[111][112]
Nutrition[edit]
In 2003, a Center for Science in the Public Interest report stated that Chipotle's burritos contain over 1,000 calories, which is nearly equivalent to two meals' worth of food.[113][114] MSNBC Health.com placed the burritos on their list of the "20 Worst Foods in America" because of their high caloric content and high sodium.[115] When a burrito with carnitas, rice, vegetables, cheese, guacamole, and salsa was compared with a typical Big Mac, the burrito had more fat, cholesterol, carbohydrates, and sodium than the Big Mac, but it also had more protein and fiber.[116] The restaurant has also received praise – Health.com included the restaurant in its list of the "Healthiest Fast Food Restaurants".[117]
Chipotle's vegetarian options include rice, black beans, fajita vegetables (onions and bell peppers), salsa, guacamole and cheese.[118] All items other than the meats, cheese, sour cream, and honey vinaigrette dressing are vegan.[118] As of late 2013, Chipotle developed a new cooking strategy for the pinto beans, eliminating the bacon and making them vegetarian and vegan-friendly.[119] The cheese is processed with vegetable-based rennet in order to be suitable for vegetarians.[118] In April 2010, Chipotle began testing a vegan "Garden Blend" option, which is a plant-based meat alternative marinated in chipotle adobo, at six locations in the U.S.[120][121] The flour tortillas used for the burritos and soft tacos are the only items that contain gluten.[118]
Food sourcing[edit]
In 1999, while looking for ways to improve the taste of the carnitas,[20] Steve Ells was prompted by an article written by Edward Behr to visit Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs).[122] Ells found the CAFOs "horrific", and began sourcing from open-range pork suppliers. This caused an increase in both the price and the sales of the carnitas burritos.[61]
In 2001, Chipotle released a mission statement called Food With Integrity, which highlighted Chipotle's efforts to increase their use of naturally raised meat, organic produce, and dairy without added hormones.[6] Chipotle only uses the leg and thigh meat from its chickens; the breast meat is sold to Panera Bread.[123]

Founder Steve Ells has testified before the United States Congress in support of the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act, which aims to reduce the amount of antibiotics given to farm animals.[61][124]
Since 2006, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW), a Floridian farmworker organization, has protested Chipotle’s refusal to sign a Fair Food agreement, which would commit the restaurant chain to pay a penny-per-pound premium on its Florida tomatoes to boost tomato harvesters’ wages, and to only buy Florida tomatoes from growers who comply with the Fair Food Code of Conduct.[125] In 2009, the creators of the documentary film Food, Inc. (along with 31 other leaders in the sustainable food movement) signed an open letter of support for the CIW’s campaign, stating that, “If Chipotle is sincere in its wishes to reform its supply chain, the time has come to work with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers as a true partner in the protection of farmworkers rights.”[126] In September 2009, Chipotle announced that it would sidestep partnership with the CIW and instead work directly with East Coast Growers and Packers to increase wages for its tomato pickers.[127] CEO Steve Ells has framed the dispute as a fundamental issue of control, stating that, “the CIW wants us to sign a contract that would let them control Chipotle's decisions regarding food in the future."[128] In October 2012, Chipotle Mexican Grill signed an agreement with the CIW and became the 11th company to join the organization's Fair Food Program.[129]
In January 2015, Chipotle pulled carnitas from its menu in a third of its restaurants; company officials cited animal welfare problems at one of the suppliers, found during a regular audit, as the reason.[130] Subsequently, a false rumor spread online claiming it was done to appease Muslims who consider pork to be unclean, leading to some protests on social media.[131] The company still uses antibiotic-free and hormone-free steak in its restaurants, despite being briefly forced to "serve beef that is not naturally raised" during the summer of 2013, posting an in-store notice each time that occurred.[132] Roberto Ferdman of The Washington Post opined that Chipotle's stated mission to sell "food with integrity" may be "untenable" if meat producers continue to breach Chipotle's ethical standards.[130]
Also in 2015, Chipotle stopped using genetically modified corn and soy beans in their foods, claiming to be the first nationwide restaurant to cook completely GMO free.[133] This was done in response to increasing consumer demand for GMO free products.
Food safety[edit]

 "How Chipotle made hundreds of people barf". Vox report dated January 6, 2016, explaining Chipotle's "food safety crisis".


Since 2008, a former Kansas State University food safety professor has accused Chipotle of confusing the public by using such terms as "naturally raised meats", "organic ingredients", and "locally sourced" and trying to equate those terms with food safety.[134] In rebuttal, a Chipotle spokesperson told The Daily Beast that "all of our practices have always been very much within industry norms. It's important to note that restaurant practices are regulated by health codes, and restaurants are routinely inspected by health officials. Everything we have done in our supply chain and in our restaurants has been within industry norms."[134] Yet, FiveThirtyEight pointed out that the 2015 norovirus outbreak appears to be unusual[135] and others are criticizing their food sourcing or handling practices.[136][137] MarketWatch wrote that the result of all of these outbreaks will be to force Chipotle to obtain their produce from larger corporate farms that can afford the more extensive microbial food-safety testing programs and to process vegetables at centralized locations instead of at the individual stores, both of which are industry-standard practices that the company had previously criticized.[138] The New York Times implied that the company's insistence on maintaining its long standing rhetoric about "food integrity" seemed to be quite opposite with the realities of recent current events and made it appear that the management was just ignoring their current problems.[139] It also has been pointed out that Chipotle's current record-keeping system is actually hindering the health authorities' investigation in locating the sources of the various infections.[139]
A writer for the magazine Popular Science pointed out that Chipotle had publicly acknowledged that they "may be at a higher risk for food-borne illness outbreaks than some competitors due to our use of fresh produce and meats rather than frozen, and our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation."[140][141][142] Henry I. Miller, a medical researcher and columnist and the founding director of the FDA's Office of Biotechnology, asked: "One wonders whether Chipotle’s "traditional methods" include employees' neglecting to wash their hands before preparing food, which is how norovirus is usually spread. And the fresh versus frozen dichotomy is nothing more than a snow-job. Freezing E. coli-contaminated food does not kill the pathogens; it preserves them."[143] Describing food poisoning outbreaks as "something of a Chipotle trademark; the recent ones are the fourth and fifth this year [2015], one of which was not disclosed to the public", Miller notes that "a particularly worrisome aspect of the company's serial deficiencies is that there have been at least three unrelated pathogens in the outbreaks – Salmonella and E. coli bacteria and norovirus. In other words, there has been more than a single glitch; suppliers and employees have found a variety of ways to contaminate what Chipotle cavalierly sells (at premium prices) to its customers."[143]
A writer for the North Carolina newspaper The News & Observer called Chipotle's "food with integrity" a "lucrative farce" and a "marketing ploy" by pointing out that organic food is "often grown with manure (an 'all-natural' fertilizer), which can certainly increase the risks of accidentally spreading fecal bacteria like E. coli."[144]
In December 2015, Seattle health officials closed a Seattle-area Chipotle for a day after it had repeatedly had small numbers of violations during recent consecutive inspections that previously would not have generated a closure order.[145] On December 10, 2015, CEO Steve Ells released a press statement apologizing for 2015 outbreaks and promised changes to minimize the risks of future outbreaks.[146]
March 2008 hepatitis outbreak[edit]
In March and April 2008, the Community Epidemiology Branch of the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency traced a hepatitis A outbreak in San Diego County to a single Chipotle restaurant located in La Mesa, California in which 22 customers were infected with the virus.[147][148]
April 2008 norovirus outbreak[edit]
In 2008, Chipotle was implicated in a norovirus outbreak in Kent, Ohio, where over 400 people became ill after eating at a Chipotle restaurant.[149] Officials at the Ohio Department of Health said that the outbreak was caused by Norovirus Genotype G2.[150] Many of the victims were students at Kent State University.[151] The initial source of the outbreak was never found.
February 2009 Campylobacter jejuni outbreak[edit]
In 2009, an investigation by the Minnesota Department of Health traced an outbreak of campylobacteriosis to a Chipotle Mexican Grill in Apple Valley, Minnesota.[152][153][154] The investigation found that chicken was sometimes served undercooked by the restaurant and determined that lettuce which had been cross-contaminated with raw or undercooked chicken was the vector for the outbreak.[155][156][third-party source needed]
July 2015 E. coli outbreak[edit]
In early November 2015, The Oregonian reported that there was a little-known E. coli outbreak that had occurred earlier in July in which five persons were infected with the O157:H7 strain of E. coli. The outbreak was traced to a single Chipotle location in Seattle and that the incident was not publicized at that time.[157][158] Seattle public health officials defended their actions at that time by saying that the outbreak was over by the time they made an association with Chipotle. Health officials were unable to trace the source of the July outbreak and said that the cause of the July outbreak is unrelated to the October/November outbreak.[157]
August 2015 norovirus outbreak[edit]
Another norovirus outbreak was confirmed to have occurred in August 2015 at a Simi Valley, California location in which 80 customers and 18 employees reported becoming ill.[159][160] Ventura County health inspectors found various health violations during two inspections following the outbreak report.[161] Despite those violations, the county health officials did not close the restaurant and allowed it to continue to operate.[159] In a January 2016 article, the New York Times reported that the number of victims involved in the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak was actually 207, twice the number that was reported earlier.[162]
In an unusual move, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California in conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration has gotten a federal grand jury to issue a subpoena in January 2016 as part of a criminal investigation seeking documents and information from Chipotle concerning the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak.[162][163] As of January 2016[update], it is too early to tell which organization is the actual target of the investigation. In most cases involving norovirus outbreaks that involved a single location, state and/or local authorities are the usual jurisdiction responsible in the investigation and prosecution of those type of cases. However, Ventura County officials had been criticized for their handling of parts of their investigation, and for allowing the restaurant to continue to operate after finding health violations during consecutive inspections.
Less than two weeks later, a federal class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California claiming that Chipotle knowingly allowed an ill kitchen manager to work for two days before sending that person home. Then, the restaurant actively deep-cleaned the restaurant to remove all traces of contamination prior to notifying the Ventura County Environmental Health Division of the existing outbreak, hindering their investigation. The lawsuit also claimed that the number of known victims was as high as 234 and estimates that the number of meals that the infected employee may have come in contact with could be as high 3,000.[164][165][166]
August 2015 Salmonella outbreak[edit]
At almost the same time as the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak, Minnesota health officials confirmed a Salmonella outbreak that affected 17 Minneapolis-area Chipotle restaurants in mid-August 2015. The source of the outbreak was traced back to contaminated tomatoes that were grown in Mexico.[167][168] The Minnesota Department of Health reported that samples from 45 victims were tested and found that their illness was caused by the Salmonella Newport bacterium as determined by DNA profiling.[169] Later, the state officials reported that the total of persons who became infected was increased to 64 and the number Chipotle locations in which they had acquired the bacterium was increased to 22, all located within the state of Minnesota.[170]
October 2015 E. coli outbreak[edit]
In October 2015, at least 22 persons were reported to have gotten sick after eating at several different Chipotle locations in the states of Washington and Oregon. At that time, an epidemiologist for the Washington Health Department said the culprit appeared to be a Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli bacterium, but they were still waiting the outcome of several laboratory tests before they can give a definitive result.[171][172][173] As a precaution, Chipotle had closed 43 stores in Washington and Oregon pending the results and recommendations of the involved health authorities. On November 5, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had reported that the number of persons reported ill had risen to 40 known cases and that the bacteria samples taken from 7 infected persons in Washington and 3 persons in Oregon states were confirmed to be infected by the same strain of E. coli, the Shiga toxin-producing STEC O26 strain, as determined by DNA profiling.[174] At least 12 persons required hospitalization, but no fatalities. As of November 2015, Health authorities were still trying to trace the exact source of the bacterial contamination, but suspected fresh produce.[175]
On November 12, the CDC increased the number of known cases to 50, the number of persons requiring hospitalization to 14, and the number of DNA fingerprint confirmations to 33.[176] Through a match via Pulsenet, the DNA fingerprint also matched a recent case in Minnesota, but the ill person did not eat at Chipotle. The source of the bacteria infection still had not yet been determined at the time of the report released by the CDC and the CDC is trying to use the more definitive, but more time consuming whole genome sequencing procedure to see if they are able to determine the relationships between all of the STEC O26 cases. In the meantime, Chipotle reopened the closed restaurants on November 11 after disposing all of the food within the closed facilities and deep cleaning those facilities.[177]
On November 20, the CDC reported that the number of STEC O26 cases, as determined by DNA fingerprinting, had increased to 45 with 16 persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to six.[178] Besides Oregon and Washington, new cases were reported in the states of Minnesota, California, New York, and Ohio.[179] 43 out of 45 of the affected individuals had reported that they had eaten at a Chipotle in the week before they had become sick.
On December 4, the CDC reported that the number of STEC O26 cases, as determined by DNA fingerprinting, had increased to 52 with 20 persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to nine.[180] New cases were reported in the states of California (1), Illinois (1), Maryland (1), Ohio (2), Pennsylvania (1), and Washington (1).[181]
The price of shares for Chipotle stock dropped a further 12% immediately after the CDC had issued their update on November 20.[182] Share prices had been dropping since the initial announcement of the E. coli outbreak in late October with investors unsure if the drop in share prices just a temporary aberration and that Chipotle management is handling the incident as well as they could. Chipotle has since hired a consultant to improve their food safety program and have their program reviewed by both the CDC and FDA.[183]
On February 1, 2016, the CDC official closed their investigations on the larger E. coli that started in Pacific Northwest in October 2015 and also the smaller outbreak that started in Kansas and Oklahoma in November since no new cases were reported since December 1.[184] In their final report, the CDC stated that 55 persons in 11 states were infected with the same strain of STEC O26 during the major outbreak with 21 of those persons requiring hospitalization. The five persons infected in the later outbreak were made ill by a generically different strain of STEC O26. The CDC also reported that federal and local health and food safety authorities were unable to detect traces of the microorganisms in any of the food samples taken from the suspected restaurants or from their supply chain. The CDC, FDA, and the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service were unable to determine a point source that was in common in the meals that were consumed by all the victims since some of the restaurants were located far apart and had obtained some of their ingredients from different suppliers while other consumers of the suspected suppliers were not affected.
November 2015 E. coli cases[edit]
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on December 21 that five more people became ill after eating at two Chipotle restaurants located in Kansas and Oklahoma in late November. Preliminary DNA fingerprinting results appear to indicated that the newer cases were caused by a different strain of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O26. Scientists are waiting for the results of the more definitive whole genome sequencing analyses to determine if the organisms responsible for this outbreak are genetically related to the E. coli that are responsible for causing the outbreak that had started in Oregon and Washington in late October and thus an extension of that outbreak. The agency has not yet determined which food is responsible for the outbreak.[185] The Food and Drug Administration reported that they are trying to determine how the bacteria in these cases, along with the earlier Oregon, Washington, and other multi-state cases, might have been propagated through the food supply chain.[186]
December 2015 norovirus outbreak[edit]




The closed restaurant on December 16, 2015


In December 2015, eighty students at Boston College were sickened after eating at a single Chipotle restaurant. Affected students had been tested for both E. coli and norovirus in order to determine the cause of the illnesses.[187] Although it would take as long as two days before the results of more definitive tests became known, public health investigators reported that preliminary tests pointed to the presence of norovirus.[188] The health inspectors for the City of Boston had since closed this particular location on December 7 for a number of health violations that included maintaining meats at a too low of a temperature on the serving line and for allowing a sick employee to work at the time of the inspection.[189]
On December 10, officials from the Boston Public Health Commission reported that tests had identified a single strain of norovirus that is responsible for this particular outbreak.[190] Boston Globe reported on December 10 that 141 persons were reported to have gotten ill and that some of the newer victims had not visited Chipotle before contracting the virus[191] and most likely became infected by being in close proximity to someone who had gotten ill at Chipotle, such as a roommate or dorm-mate.[190] Boston authorities traced the cause of the outbreak to a sick employee who was allowed to work on the day of the outbreak. Chipotle has since fired the employee and also the manager who knowingly allowed the ill worker to complete his shift instead of following health codes.[192]
Consequences[edit]
On February 8, 2016, Chipotle closed all of its eateries nationwide for a few hours during the morning for an all-staff meeting on food safety.[193] The company hired a new head of food safety, who instituted changes including having all employees wash hands every half hour, having two employees verify that produce like onions, jalapeños and avocados have been immersed in hot water for five seconds to kill germs on their exteriors, and using Pascalization to pre-treat food ingredients.[194]
Since the series of food-poisoning outbreaks in 2015 lowered trust in the product, Chipotle has tried to lure back its customers with free food and heavier advertising. Same-store sales increased 17.8% percent in the first quarter of 2017.[195]

Lawsuit[edit]
In November 2016, three men filed a class-action lawsuit against Chipotle alleging that a burrito was listed as containing only 300 calories, when in fact it contained more. They are seeking "unspecified damages and for an injunction against the company to prevent it from posting what it calls misleading information on its food."[196][197][198]
Advertising and publicity[edit]




People line up outside a Chipotle in East Lansing, Michigan during a "Free Burrito Day"


In the past, Chipotle mainly relied on billboards, radio ads, and word of mouth to advertise.[30] In 2012, Chipotle aired its first nationally televised commercial during the 54th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony.[199] In 2010, the company initiated an ad campaign that mocks advice given to Chipotle by advertising agencies.[200] Chipotle has run many promotions giving out free food to potential customers, especially when opening a new store. Stores also give out free burritos on certain holidays; for instance, on Halloween, some locations have had promotions in which free burritos are given to people who come dressed as a burrito. Chipotle gave away free burritos to reporters during the 1997 trial of Timothy McVeigh, which took place in Chipotle's hometown of Denver.[201] In addition, stores offered free burritos to those displaced by Hurricane Katrina.[202] Chipotle received attention when Ozzy Osbourne's reality show The Osbournes featured the company's burritos heavily.[29] For Halloween 2010, Chipotle announced that customers dressed as a processed food product would receive a burrito for $2. The event was part of a $1 million fundraiser for Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution called "Boorito 2010: The Horrors of Processed Food."[203] For "Boorito 2011", customers dressed in costumes "inspired by family farms" will receive a menu item for $2, with proceeds from the promotion going to The Chipotle Cultivate Foundation and Farm Aid. The promotion is aimed to increase awareness of family farms.[204] Also in support of family farms, Chipotle released music videos of Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Willie Nelson.[205] On September 12, 2013, Chipotle released an animated short called The Scarecrow, with a companion mobile video game; both feature a narrative heavily critical of industrial farming, but little in the way of direct marketing for the chain.[206] The short features a cover of "Pure Imagination" from Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, sung by Fiona Apple.[207] It was named one of the worst advertisements of 2013 by The Wall Street Journal.[208]
In 2011, Chipotle created the "Farm Team", which is a rewards program available only by invitation from restaurant managers. The Farm Team members have access to a special Chipotle website, where members can earn rewards, i.e. free food and T-shirts. The site offers members to, "learn where Chipotle’s food comes from, take quizzes and polls, play games and watch videos about the company".[209] In April 2014, the Farm Team program was shut down.[210]
Chipotle sponsors Team Garmin-Barracuda (formerly Team Garmin-Chipotle, Team Garmin-Slipstream, Team Garmin-Transitions and Team Garmin-Cervélo) of the International Cycling Union,[211][212] and is an official team partner of the Boston Celtics,[213] and the Boston Bruins.[214] In June 2009, Chipotle sponsored free screenings of Food, Inc., a film that criticizes the corporate food industry. Founder Steve Ells stated that he hoped the film would make customers appreciate Chipotle's Food With Integrity policy.[215] From May until September 2009, Chipotle ran a contest on mychipotle.com, a microsite which had a competition for the best user-created audio and video presentations about different combinations of ingredients.[216][217] In July 2010, Chipotle began a campaign to support healthier lunch alternatives for students, in which money will be donated to The Lunch Box program based on how many spam E-mails consumers forward to a company E-mail address.[218] For Chipotle's 18 year anniversary, the company began wrapping its burritos in gold foil as part of a larger promotion to draw attention to its Food With Integrity mantra.[219] Also as part of the gold foil campaign, Chipotle is offering prizes for customer-created pictures of items wrapped in gold foil. Chipotle hired comedian Amy Sedaris to create a comedic how-to video on wrapping with gold foil, and spread the video using Twitter.[220] In March 2013, Chipotle pulled its sponsorship of a Boy Scouts of America event, citing that organization's ban on LGBT members.[221]




Cup and bag from the "Cultivating Thought" series, featuring the work of Paulo Coelho and Augusten Burroughs


On December 16, 2015, Chipotle ran full page ads in both The Boston Globe and Boston Herald apologizing for the recent norovirus outbreak linked to Chipotle's Cleveland Circle location. The ad, containing a letter by Chipotle founder and co-CEO Steve Ells, affirmed the company's commitment to food safety.[222]
On March 14, 2016, a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) administrative law judge concluded that Chipotle’s social media policy, and more specifically its application towards an employee who posted tweets regarding wages and working conditions, violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).[223] A former Chipotle employee in Havertown, Pennsylvania, wrote a series of tweets from his personal account about hourly workers being required to work on snow days. Chipotle instructed the employee to delete the tweets. The NLRB judge determined that Chipotle’s request to delete the tweets violated the NLRA even though the employee was not disciplined as a result of his tweets.[224]
Architecture[edit]




The exterior of a Chipotle in Durham, North Carolina


Architecturally, all Chipotle restaurants are built using most of the same materials (plywood, corrugated metal, stainless steel, exposed ductwork), although each store is unique.[20][225] The interiors have been described as having an "industrial, sheet metal look".[226] Chipotle has built restaurants using white ceramic tile instead of stainless steel.[227] It costs the company approximately $850,000 to open a new restaurant.[228] When the first Chipotle opened, Steve Ells asked his friend, sculptor Bruce Gueswel, to design the chairs and a styled Mayan king whose face was loosely based on that of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., a personal inspiration of Gueswel, for the restaurant. Both items were made from wood and metal. Gueswel has continued to design and build the art and chairs for all subsequent Chipotle restaurants.[229]
Most Chipotle locations display a photograph of the original restaurant, which is near the University of Denver campus on Evans Avenue.[20] Instead of a photograph of itself, the original location has a photograph of the Dolly Madison Ice Cream that previously occupied the location. In 2010, Chipotle began opening "A Model" restaurants, which are smaller concept locations, citing the lower costs of development and occupancy.[230] Chipotle uses environmentally friendly packaging, with bowls made from recycled newsprint, unbleached tray liners, and napkins and cups made from postconsumer waste.[231]
Chipotle's architectural design team incorporates the principles of sustainable architecture in their projects. The "green" restaurant in Gurnee, Illinois features an on-site six kilowatt wind turbine, which generates about 10% of the restaurant's electrical needs. The Gurnee restaurant has received Platinum level LEED certification from U.S. Green Building Council.[232] A restaurant in Tulsa, Oklahoma, uses recycled drywall, low-VOC paint, and energy-efficient appliances.[233] A Chipotle restaurant in Austin, Texas was the first to receive a four-star rating from the city's Green Building Program.[234] Additionally, Chipotle has made arrangements to add solar panels to 75 of its restaurants.[232] Chipotle has contracted to clean its stores in New York City and Long Island, with "plant-based, environmentally preferable cleaning supplies and technologies." The cleansers are readily biodegradable and non-toxic to humans or aquatic life.[235]
Chipotle was the defendant in a lawsuit for failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Maurizio Antoninetti, a customer who used a wheelchair, claimed he was denied the "Chipotle Experience", because he was unable to see the food preparation. The case against the company was upheld in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,[236] and the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear Chipotle's appeal, leaving the Ninth Circuit's ruling intact.[237] Chipotle has "an official disability policy of bringing ingredients to the tables of diners with disabilities and doing tableside preparation." Chipotle is retrofitting restaurants affected by the ruling, replacing the walls in front of the food preparation area with lower ones or transparent panels. They are incorporating the new design elements into new restaurants.[236] The case was one of over twenty ADA-related lawsuits filed by Antoninetti, who died in 2011.[236][238]
Other restaurant units[edit]

Pizzeria Locale is a fast casual pizza restaurant formed as a partnership with Pizzeria Locale, a full-service pizza restaurant in Boulder, Colorado. The original Pizzeria Locale owners, Bobby Stuckey and Lachlan Mackinnon-Patterson, would continue to own their original location while Chipotle would increase its stake in the chain over time.[48] As of February 2017, the chain has seven locations.[51]
Tasty Made is a burger restaurant concept that Chipotle first opened in Lancaster, Ohio in October 2016.[239] On July 29, 2016, the company announced the opening of its first Tasty Made burger restaurant in the fall. The first location was revealed to be in Lancaster, Ohio. Ohio was selected as culinary manager Nate Appleman and national training director David Chrisman are both from the state and helped design the concept.[240] Tasty Made was announced to have a focused menu like early burger restaurants which were limited to burgers, fries and milkshakes.[51] Chipotle had trademarked Better Burger earlier in the year.


Defunct


Soul Daddy was a soul food fast casual restaurant that was owned by ANGR Holdings, LLC, and was managed by Chipotle after purchasing Ellis' stake in the company. The restaurant had three locations that had operated for less than 5 weeks in 2011 before closing.[241]
ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen was an Asian fast-casual concept restaurant that was opened by Chipotle in September 2011.[45] The company said that the new restaurant "would follow the Chipotle service format and its focus on 'food with integrity' in ingredients."[46] Chipotle's plan was to start with only one store, and see how the restaurant works out before expanding the concept.[47] By July 2016, the chain has 15 restaurants.[51] All ShopHouse locations were closed on March 17, 2017.[242]

Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (/tʃᵻˈpoʊtleɪ/)[6] is an American chain of fast casual restaurants in the United States, United Kingdom,[7] Canada,[8][9] Germany,[10] and France,[11] specializing in tacos and Mission-style[12][13] burritos. Its name derives from chipotle, the Nahuatl name for a smoked and dried jalapeño chili pepper.[14] The company currently trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CMG.[15]
The company has released a mission statement called Food with Integrity, which highlights its efforts in using naturally-grown ingredients,[6] and serves more naturally raised meat than any other restaurant chain.[16] Chipotle is one of the first chains of fast casual dining establishments.[17] Competitors in the fast-casual Mexican market include Qdoba Mexican Grill, Moe's Southwest Grill, Rubio's Coastal Grill, Pancheros Mexican Grill, Freebirds World Burrito, and Baja Fresh.[18]
Founded by Steve Ells on July 13, 1993. Chipotle had 16 restaurants (all in Colorado) when McDonald's Corporation became a major investor in 1998. By the time McDonald's fully divested itself from Chipotle in 2006,[19] the chain had grown to over 500 locations.
With more than 2,000 locations,[2] Chipotle had a net income of US$475.6 million and a staff of more than 45,000 employees in 2015.[2]

History[edit]




The first Chipotle, near the campus of the University of Denver


Founder Steve Ells attended the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York. Afterward, he became a line cook for Jeremiah Tower at Stars in San Francisco.[20] There, Ells observed the popularity of the taquerías and San Francisco burritos in the Mission District. In 1993, Ells took what he learned in San Francisco[21] and opened the first Chipotle Mexican Grill in Denver, Colorado, in a former Dolly Madison Ice Cream store at 1644 East Evans Avenue,[22] near the University of Denver campus, using an $85,000 loan from his father.[19] Ells and his father calculated that the store would need to sell 107 burritos per day to be profitable. After one month, the original restaurant was selling over 1,000 burritos a day.[15] The second store opened in 1995 using Chipotle's cash flow, and the third was opened using an SBA loan. To fund more growth, Ells' father invested $1.5 million. Afterwards, Ells created a board of directors and business plan, raising an additional $1.8 million for the company.[23] Ells had originally planned to use funds from the first Chipotle to open a fine-dining restaurant, but instead focused on Chipotle Mexican Grill when the restaurants saw success.[24][25]
In 1998, the first restaurant outside of Colorado opened in Kansas City, Missouri.[26] The company opened its first location in Minnesota by opening near the campus of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis in March 1999.[27]
In 1998, McDonald's made an initial minority investment in the company. By 2001, the company had grown to be Chipotle's largest investor.[19] The investment from McDonald's allowed the firm to quickly expand, from 16 restaurants in 1998 to over 500 by 2005.[28] On January 26, 2006, Chipotle made its initial public offering (IPO) after increasing the share price twice due to high pre-IPO demand. In its first day as a public company, the stock rose exactly 100%, resulting in the best U.S.-based IPO in six years, and the second-best IPO for a restaurant after Boston Market. The money from the offering was then used to fund new store growth.[29]
In October 2006, McDonald's fully divested from Chipotle.[30] This was part of a larger initiative for McDonald's to divest all of its non-core business restaurants — Chipotle, Donatos Pizza, and Boston Market — so that it could focus on the main McDonald's chain.[31] McDonald's invested approximately $360 million into Chipotle, and took out $1.5 billion.[23] McDonald's had attempted to get Chipotle to add drive-through windows and a breakfast menu, which Ells resisted.[32][33] In 2008, Chipotle opened its first location outside of the United States in Toronto.[9]
In a list of fastest-growing restaurant chains in 2009, Chipotle was ranked eighth, based on increases in U.S. sales over the past year,[34] and in 2010 Chipotle was ranked third.[35] Consumer Reports ranked Chipotle as the best Mexican fast-food chain in 2011.[36] The company serves approximately 750,000 customers per day.[37]
In December 2010, Chipotle hired chef Nate Appleman to develop new cuisine. Appleman has won Rising Star Chef from the James Beard Foundation, was named "Best New Chef" by Food & Wine magazine, and competed on The Next Iron Chef.[38]
In 2010, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) audited Chipotle's Minneapolis restaurants, and found that some employees had been hired using fraudulent documents. In December, Chipotle fired 450 employees from its Minneapolis restaurants as a result of the audit, resulting in protests by local groups.[39][40] In February 2011, ICE expanded the audit to include 60 restaurants in Virginia and Washington, D.C.[41] which resulted in 40 workers being fired. In April 2011, the criminal division of the Attorney General's office in Washington, D.C., joined the case, and ICE agents began interviewing employees at 20 to 25 restaurants in other locations, such as Los Angeles and Atlanta.[42] In response to the government investigations, Chipotle hired former director of ICE Julie Myers Wood and high-profile attorneys Robert Luskin and Gregory B. Craig.[43]
Other restaurant expansion[edit]
In 2011, Steve Ells was a judge for the TV show America's Next Great Restaurant and investor of ANGR Holdings, the company that will be running the winning concept's restaurants. Chipotle has agreed to purchase Ells' investment in ANGR at his cost, provide support for ANGR operations, and invest a total of $2.3 million in cash contributions.[44]
In September 2011, Chipotle opened an Asian fast-casual concept restaurant named ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen in Washington, D.C.[45] The company has said the new restaurant "would follow the Chipotle service format and its focus on 'food with integrity' in ingredients."[46] Chipotle's plan was to start with only one store, and see how the restaurant works out before expanding the concept.[47]
On December 18, 2013, the company revealed that it had opened its first fast-food pizza chain in Denver back in May 2013. According to Associated Press, Chipotle partnered with a local full-service restaurant called Pizzeria Locale to create a fast-food version of the eatery, keeping its name. The company plans to open at least two more pizzerias in the Denver area.[48]
In April 2014, Chipotle announced an increase in menu prices for the first time in nearly three years, due to increasing costs for steak, avocados, and cheese. The price increase was expected to be rolled out from the end of second quarter of 2014 through the end of the third quarter.[49] In late 2015, Chipotle expanded its mobile strategy through delivery partnerships with tech startups like Tapingo, a delivery service that targets college campuses.[50]
On July 29, 2016, the company announced the opening of its first Tasty Made burger restaurant in the fall. Chipotle was still dealing with the various virus outbreaks with additional marketing. The company was also reducing the number of new stores for the year from 235 to 220.[51]
International[edit]




The second Chipotle Mexican Grill location in London, located on Baker Street


According to an article in The Motley Fool, Chipotle had 17 locations outside of the United States by October 2014 with the majority in Canada, and the UK was in the process of opening more locations.[52] The rate of overseas expansion was slower than expected.[53] Many of the press reviewers thought that the food was overpriced for their area.[11][54]
As of 2017 there are 26 locations outside of the United States with 11 locations in Canada (Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver), 6 locations in The United Kingdom (London), 3 in France (Paris), and 1 in Germany (Frankfurt).[better source needed][2] [55]
Canada[edit]
In August 2008, Chipotle opened its first location outside of the United States in Toronto.[9] The second location in Toronto–and in all of Canada–was not opened until 2010.[53]
The first Canadian location outside of the Toronto area was opened in Vancouver in December 2012.[56] A second Vancouver-area location was opened in Burnaby in October 2014[57] followed by a third in Surrey in January 2016[58] and a fourth in Langley in October 2016.[59]
The first location in the nation's capital of Ottawa was opened in February 2017 at the Rideau Centre.[60]
United Kingdom[edit]
Chipotle expanded to Europe with the first European restaurant opening in May 2010 in London.[7][61][62] A second location open in London in September 2011.[63] The following year, three additional locations were quickly opened in the London area.[64] After this growth spurt, the rate of further expansion in London slowed greatly with the sixth location appearing in 2013[65] and the seventh in June 2015.[66] Although Chipotle blames the slow growth in the United Kingdom on the British unfamiliarity with Mexican foods,[67] several locally owned burrito chains had opened locations across the United Kingdom during the same interval.[68]
France[edit]
The first location in France opened in Paris in May 2012.[11][69]
Expansion in France was much slower than that in the United Kingdom or Canada, with a second location in Paris opening in 2013[70] and a third location in 2014.[71] At 7,000 square feet, the restaurant at La Défense is, as of 2015[update], the largest Chipotle location in the world, while a typical Chipotle restaurant is usually between 2,200 and 2,500 square feet.[72] A fourth Parisian location was opened in Levallois-Perret in 2015[73] followed by a fifth[74] and a sixth[75] Parisian location in 2016, both in Saint-Germain-des-Prés.
Germany[edit]
The first and, so far, only location in Germany opened in Frankfurt in August 2013.[10][54]
Corporate management[edit]
Chipotle's team includes a residing corporate office of managers and its board of directors. Members of both teams are appointed to serve on committees: audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance.
The top management team consists of the Chief Executive Officers, Steve Ells; the Chief Financial Officer, Jack R. Hartung; the Chief Marketing and Development Officer, Mark Crumpacker.[76] The current board of directors consists of: Steve Ells, Patrick Flynn, Albert Baldocchi, Neil Flanzraich, Darlene Friedman, Stephen Gillet, Kimbal Musk and John Charlesworth.[77]
Founder Steve Ells serves as chairman and Chief executive officer,[78] and has a 1.25% stake in the company.[79] The labor-market research firm Glassdoor reported that Steve Ells earned $29 million in 2014, versus a median of $19,000 for Chipotle's workers, making the CEO-to-worker pay ratio 1522:1.[80]
Operation and distribution[edit]
All of Chipotle's restaurants are company-owned, rather than franchised.[81] As of December 2012[update], 1430 restaurants have since opened throughout the United States and Canada, with locations in 43 states, Ontario, British Columbia, and the District of Columbia.[82][83]
The field team are the employees who work closely with but not directly within specific restaurants. The field support system includes apprentice team leaders (step up from restaurateurs), team leaders or area managers, team directors and regional directors (not atypical for them to oversee more than fifty locations).[84] Because Chipotle does not franchise, all restaurants are corporately owned. Thus, whenever Chipotle is in the process of launching a new location, the field team hires a new general manager and trains them at a current location so that they will be ready for the new location when it opens for business. The corporate office takes care of finding and funding new locations as well.[85]
Menu[edit]

Chipotle's menu consists of four items: burritos, bowls, tacos, and salads. The price of each item is based on the choice of chicken, pork carnitas, barbacoa, steak, tofu-based "sofritas",[86][87] chorizo (chicken and pork), or vegetarian (with guacamole, which would be at an extra charge otherwise). Additional optional toppings are offered free of charge, including: rice, beans, four types of salsa, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce.[88][89] When asked in 2007 about expanding the menu, Steve Ells said, "[I]t's important to keep the menu focused, because if you just do a few things, you can ensure that you do them better than anybody else."[90] Chipotle also offers a children's menu.[91][92] Most restaurants sell beer and margaritas in addition to soft drinks and fruit drinks.[93]
The majority of food is prepared in each restaurant. Some exceptions are the beans and carnitas, which are prepared at a central kitchen in Chicago, Illinois.[94] None of the restaurants have freezers, microwave ovens, or can openers.[95]




Chicken Burrito Bowl


The chain experimented with breakfast foods at two airports in the Washington (D.C.) metropolitan area but decided against expanding the menu in that direction.[96][97][98] Starting in 2009, selected restaurants had offered a pozole soup,[99][100][101] which has since been discontinued.
In June 2015, Chipotle began test marketing a pork and chicken chorizo-type sausage as a new protein option at selected locations in the Kansas City area.[102][103][104] Some food writers have expressed their health related concerns over the protein's relatively high sodium content since a 4-ounce serving contains 293 calories and 803 milligrams of sodium[105] while the American Heart Association’s recommended daily amount is less than 1,500 milligrams of sodium.[106] In contrast, the protein options with next highest sodium contents are Barbacoa with 530 milligrams and sofritas with 555 milligrams.[105] An earlier version on the Mexican sausage was tested in Denver and New York City in 2011,[107] but that test was terminated when that version of the sausage was perceived as looking too greasy.[108] As of fall 2016, chorizo is available nationwide.
Chipotle accepts fax orders, and in 2005 the company added the ability to order online from their website. For both online and fax orders, customers proceed to the front of the line to pay for pre-ordered food.[109] In 2009, Chipotle released an app for the iPhone that allows users to find nearby Chipotle locations, place an order, and prepay with a credit card.[110] In 2013, Chipotle released an Android app that allows users to locate nearby Chipotle locations, place an order, prepay with a credit or gift card, and access favorites and recent orders.[111][112]
Nutrition[edit]
In 2003, a Center for Science in the Public Interest report stated that Chipotle's burritos contain over 1,000 calories, which is nearly equivalent to two meals' worth of food.[113][114] MSNBC Health.com placed the burritos on their list of the "20 Worst Foods in America" because of their high caloric content and high sodium.[115] When a burrito with carnitas, rice, vegetables, cheese, guacamole, and salsa was compared with a typical Big Mac, the burrito had more fat, cholesterol, carbohydrates, and sodium than the Big Mac, but it also had more protein and fiber.[116] The restaurant has also received praise – Health.com included the restaurant in its list of the "Healthiest Fast Food Restaurants".[117]
Chipotle's vegetarian options include rice, black beans, fajita vegetables (onions and bell peppers), salsa, guacamole and cheese.[118] All items other than the meats, cheese, sour cream, and honey vinaigrette dressing are vegan.[118] As of late 2013, Chipotle developed a new cooking strategy for the pinto beans, eliminating the bacon and making them vegetarian and vegan-friendly.[119] The cheese is processed with vegetable-based rennet in order to be suitable for vegetarians.[118] In April 2010, Chipotle began testing a vegan "Garden Blend" option, which is a plant-based meat alternative marinated in chipotle adobo, at six locations in the U.S.[120][121] The flour tortillas used for the burritos and soft tacos are the only items that contain gluten.[118]
Food sourcing[edit]
In 1999, while looking for ways to improve the taste of the carnitas,[20] Steve Ells was prompted by an article written by Edward Behr to visit Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs).[122] Ells found the CAFOs "horrific", and began sourcing from open-range pork suppliers. This caused an increase in both the price and the sales of the carnitas burritos.[61]
In 2001, Chipotle released a mission statement called Food With Integrity, which highlighted Chipotle's efforts to increase their use of naturally raised meat, organic produce, and dairy without added hormones.[6] Chipotle only uses the leg and thigh meat from its chickens; the breast meat is sold to Panera Bread.[123]

Founder Steve Ells has testified before the United States Congress in support of the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act, which aims to reduce the amount of antibiotics given to farm animals.[61][124]
Since 2006, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW), a Floridian farmworker organization, has protested Chipotle’s refusal to sign a Fair Food agreement, which would commit the restaurant chain to pay a penny-per-pound premium on its Florida tomatoes to boost tomato harvesters’ wages, and to only buy Florida tomatoes from growers who comply with the Fair Food Code of Conduct.[125] In 2009, the creators of the documentary film Food, Inc. (along with 31 other leaders in the sustainable food movement) signed an open letter of support for the CIW’s campaign, stating that, “If Chipotle is sincere in its wishes to reform its supply chain, the time has come to work with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers as a true partner in the protection of farmworkers rights.”[126] In September 2009, Chipotle announced that it would sidestep partnership with the CIW and instead work directly with East Coast Growers and Packers to increase wages for its tomato pickers.[127] CEO Steve Ells has framed the dispute as a fundamental issue of control, stating that, “the CIW wants us to sign a contract that would let them control Chipotle's decisions regarding food in the future."[128] In October 2012, Chipotle Mexican Grill signed an agreement with the CIW and became the 11th company to join the organization's Fair Food Program.[129]
In January 2015, Chipotle pulled carnitas from its menu in a third of its restaurants; company officials cited animal welfare problems at one of the suppliers, found during a regular audit, as the reason.[130] Subsequently, a false rumor spread online claiming it was done to appease Muslims who consider pork to be unclean, leading to some protests on social media.[131] The company still uses antibiotic-free and hormone-free steak in its restaurants, despite being briefly forced to "serve beef that is not naturally raised" during the summer of 2013, posting an in-store notice each time that occurred.[132] Roberto Ferdman of The Washington Post opined that Chipotle's stated mission to sell "food with integrity" may be "untenable" if meat producers continue to breach Chipotle's ethical standards.[130]
Also in 2015, Chipotle stopped using genetically modified corn and soy beans in their foods, claiming to be the first nationwide restaurant to cook completely GMO free.[133] This was done in response to increasing consumer demand for GMO free products.
Food safety[edit]

 "How Chipotle made hundreds of people barf". Vox report dated January 6, 2016, explaining Chipotle's "food safety crisis".


Since 2008, a former Kansas State University food safety professor has accused Chipotle of confusing the public by using such terms as "naturally raised meats", "organic ingredients", and "locally sourced" and trying to equate those terms with food safety.[134] In rebuttal, a Chipotle spokesperson told The Daily Beast that "all of our practices have always been very much within industry norms. It's important to note that restaurant practices are regulated by health codes, and restaurants are routinely inspected by health officials. Everything we have done in our supply chain and in our restaurants has been within industry norms."[134] Yet, FiveThirtyEight pointed out that the 2015 norovirus outbreak appears to be unusual[135] and others are criticizing their food sourcing or handling practices.[136][137] MarketWatch wrote that the result of all of these outbreaks will be to force Chipotle to obtain their produce from larger corporate farms that can afford the more extensive microbial food-safety testing programs and to process vegetables at centralized locations instead of at the individual stores, both of which are industry-standard practices that the company had previously criticized.[138] The New York Times implied that the company's insistence on maintaining its long standing rhetoric about "food integrity" seemed to be quite opposite with the realities of recent current events and made it appear that the management was just ignoring their current problems.[139] It also has been pointed out that Chipotle's current record-keeping system is actually hindering the health authorities' investigation in locating the sources of the various infections.[139]
A writer for the magazine Popular Science pointed out that Chipotle had publicly acknowledged that they "may be at a higher risk for food-borne illness outbreaks than some competitors due to our use of fresh produce and meats rather than frozen, and our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation."[140][141][142] Henry I. Miller, a medical researcher and columnist and the founding director of the FDA's Office of Biotechnology, asked: "One wonders whether Chipotle’s "traditional methods" include employees' neglecting to wash their hands before preparing food, which is how norovirus is usually spread. And the fresh versus frozen dichotomy is nothing more than a snow-job. Freezing E. coli-contaminated food does not kill the pathogens; it preserves them."[143] Describing food poisoning outbreaks as "something of a Chipotle trademark; the recent ones are the fourth and fifth this year [2015], one of which was not disclosed to the public", Miller notes that "a particularly worrisome aspect of the company's serial deficiencies is that there have been at least three unrelated pathogens in the outbreaks – Salmonella and E. coli bacteria and norovirus. In other words, there has been more than a single glitch; suppliers and employees have found a variety of ways to contaminate what Chipotle cavalierly sells (at premium prices) to its customers."[143]
A writer for the North Carolina newspaper The News & Observer called Chipotle's "food with integrity" a "lucrative farce" and a "marketing ploy" by pointing out that organic food is "often grown with manure (an 'all-natural' fertilizer), which can certainly increase the risks of accidentally spreading fecal bacteria like E. coli."[144]
In December 2015, Seattle health officials closed a Seattle-area Chipotle for a day after it had repeatedly had small numbers of violations during recent consecutive inspections that previously would not have generated a closure order.[145] On December 10, 2015, CEO Steve Ells released a press statement apologizing for 2015 outbreaks and promised changes to minimize the risks of future outbreaks.[146]
March 2008 hepatitis outbreak[edit]
In March and April 2008, the Community Epidemiology Branch of the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency traced a hepatitis A outbreak in San Diego County to a single Chipotle restaurant located in La Mesa, California in which 22 customers were infected with the virus.[147][148]
April 2008 norovirus outbreak[edit]
In 2008, Chipotle was implicated in a norovirus outbreak in Kent, Ohio, where over 400 people became ill after eating at a Chipotle restaurant.[149] Officials at the Ohio Department of Health said that the outbreak was caused by Norovirus Genotype G2.[150] Many of the victims were students at Kent State University.[151] The initial source of the outbreak was never found.
February 2009 Campylobacter jejuni outbreak[edit]
In 2009, an investigation by the Minnesota Department of Health traced an outbreak of campylobacteriosis to a Chipotle Mexican Grill in Apple Valley, Minnesota.[152][153][154] The investigation found that chicken was sometimes served undercooked by the restaurant and determined that lettuce which had been cross-contaminated with raw or undercooked chicken was the vector for the outbreak.[155][156][third-party source needed]
July 2015 E. coli outbreak[edit]
In early November 2015, The Oregonian reported that there was a little-known E. coli outbreak that had occurred earlier in July in which five persons were infected with the O157:H7 strain of E. coli. The outbreak was traced to a single Chipotle location in Seattle and that the incident was not publicized at that time.[157][158] Seattle public health officials defended their actions at that time by saying that the outbreak was over by the time they made an association with Chipotle. Health officials were unable to trace the source of the July outbreak and said that the cause of the July outbreak is unrelated to the October/November outbreak.[157]
August 2015 norovirus outbreak[edit]
Another norovirus outbreak was confirmed to have occurred in August 2015 at a Simi Valley, California location in which 80 customers and 18 employees reported becoming ill.[159][160] Ventura County health inspectors found various health violations during two inspections following the outbreak report.[161] Despite those violations, the county health officials did not close the restaurant and allowed it to continue to operate.[159] In a January 2016 article, the New York Times reported that the number of victims involved in the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak was actually 207, twice the number that was reported earlier.[162]
In an unusual move, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California in conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration has gotten a federal grand jury to issue a subpoena in January 2016 as part of a criminal investigation seeking documents and information from Chipotle concerning the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak.[162][163] As of January 2016[update], it is too early to tell which organization is the actual target of the investigation. In most cases involving norovirus outbreaks that involved a single location, state and/or local authorities are the usual jurisdiction responsible in the investigation and prosecution of those type of cases. However, Ventura County officials had been criticized for their handling of parts of their investigation, and for allowing the restaurant to continue to operate after finding health violations during consecutive inspections.
Less than two weeks later, a federal class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California claiming that Chipotle knowingly allowed an ill kitchen manager to work for two days before sending that person home. Then, the restaurant actively deep-cleaned the restaurant to remove all traces of contamination prior to notifying the Ventura County Environmental Health Division of the existing outbreak, hindering their investigation. The lawsuit also claimed that the number of known victims was as high as 234 and estimates that the number of meals that the infected employee may have come in contact with could be as high 3,000.[164][165][166]
August 2015 Salmonella outbreak[edit]
At almost the same time as the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak, Minnesota health officials confirmed a Salmonella outbreak that affected 17 Minneapolis-area Chipotle restaurants in mid-August 2015. The source of the outbreak was traced back to contaminated tomatoes that were grown in Mexico.[167][168] The Minnesota Department of Health reported that samples from 45 victims were tested and found that their illness was caused by the Salmonella Newport bacterium as determined by DNA profiling.[169] Later, the state officials reported that the total of persons who became infected was increased to 64 and the number Chipotle locations in which they had acquired the bacterium was increased to 22, all located within the state of Minnesota.[170]
October 2015 E. coli outbreak[edit]
In October 2015, at least 22 persons were reported to have gotten sick after eating at several different Chipotle locations in the states of Washington and Oregon. At that time, an epidemiologist for the Washington Health Department said the culprit appeared to be a Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli bacterium, but they were still waiting the outcome of several laboratory tests before they can give a definitive result.[171][172][173] As a precaution, Chipotle had closed 43 stores in Washington and Oregon pending the results and recommendations of the involved health authorities. On November 5, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had reported that the number of persons reported ill had risen to 40 known cases and that the bacteria samples taken from 7 infected persons in Washington and 3 persons in Oregon states were confirmed to be infected by the same strain of E. coli, the Shiga toxin-producing STEC O26 strain, as determined by DNA profiling.[174] At least 12 persons required hospitalization, but no fatalities. As of November 2015, Health authorities were still trying to trace the exact source of the bacterial contamination, but suspected fresh produce.[175]
On November 12, the CDC increased the number of known cases to 50, the number of persons requiring hospitalization to 14, and the number of DNA fingerprint confirmations to 33.[176] Through a match via Pulsenet, the DNA fingerprint also matched a recent case in Minnesota, but the ill person did not eat at Chipotle. The source of the bacteria infection still had not yet been determined at the time of the report released by the CDC and the CDC is trying to use the more definitive, but more time consuming whole genome sequencing procedure to see if they are able to determine the relationships between all of the STEC O26 cases. In the meantime, Chipotle reopened the closed restaurants on November 11 after disposing all of the food within the closed facilities and deep cleaning those facilities.[177]
On November 20, the CDC reported that the number of STEC O26 cases, as determined by DNA fingerprinting, had increased to 45 with 16 persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to six.[178] Besides Oregon and Washington, new cases were reported in the states of Minnesota, California, New York, and Ohio.[179] 43 out of 45 of the affected individuals had reported that they had eaten at a Chipotle in the week before they had become sick.
On December 4, the CDC reported that the number of STEC O26 cases, as determined by DNA fingerprinting, had increased to 52 with 20 persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to nine.[180] New cases were reported in the states of California (1), Illinois (1), Maryland (1), Ohio (2), Pennsylvania (1), and Washington (1).[181]
The price of shares for Chipotle stock dropped a further 12% immediately after the CDC had issued their update on November 20.[182] Share prices had been dropping since the initial announcement of the E. coli outbreak in late October with investors unsure if the drop in share prices just a temporary aberration and that Chipotle management is handling the incident as well as they could. Chipotle has since hired a consultant to improve their food safety program and have their program reviewed by both the CDC and FDA.[183]
On February 1, 2016, the CDC official closed their investigations on the larger E. coli that started in Pacific Northwest in October 2015 and also the smaller outbreak that started in Kansas and Oklahoma in November since no new cases were reported since December 1.[184] In their final report, the CDC stated that 55 persons in 11 states were infected with the same strain of STEC O26 during the major outbreak with 21 of those persons requiring hospitalization. The five persons infected in the later outbreak were made ill by a generically different strain of STEC O26. The CDC also reported that federal and local health and food safety authorities were unable to detect traces of the microorganisms in any of the food samples taken from the suspected restaurants or from their supply chain. The CDC, FDA, and the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service were unable to determine a point source that was in common in the meals that were consumed by all the victims since some of the restaurants were located far apart and had obtained some of their ingredients from different suppliers while other consumers of the suspected suppliers were not affected.
November 2015 E. coli cases[edit]
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on December 21 that five more people became ill after eating at two Chipotle restaurants located in Kansas and Oklahoma in late November. Preliminary DNA fingerprinting results appear to indicated that the newer cases were caused by a different strain of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O26. Scientists are waiting for the results of the more definitive whole genome sequencing analyses to determine if the organisms responsible for this outbreak are genetically related to the E. coli that are responsible for causing the outbreak that had started in Oregon and Washington in late October and thus an extension of that outbreak. The agency has not yet determined which food is responsible for the outbreak.[185] The Food and Drug Administration reported that they are trying to determine how the bacteria in these cases, along with the earlier Oregon, Washington, and other multi-state cases, might have been propagated through the food supply chain.[186]
December 2015 norovirus outbreak[edit]




The closed restaurant on December 16, 2015


In December 2015, eighty students at Boston College were sickened after eating at a single Chipotle restaurant. Affected students had been tested for both E. coli and norovirus in order to determine the cause of the illnesses.[187] Although it would take as long as two days before the results of more definitive tests became known, public health investigators reported that preliminary tests pointed to the presence of norovirus.[188] The health inspectors for the City of Boston had since closed this particular location on December 7 for a number of health violations that included maintaining meats at a too low of a temperature on the serving line and for allowing a sick employee to work at the time of the inspection.[189]
On December 10, officials from the Boston Public Health Commission reported that tests had identified a single strain of norovirus that is responsible for this particular outbreak.[190] Boston Globe reported on December 10 that 141 persons were reported to have gotten ill and that some of the newer victims had not visited Chipotle before contracting the virus[191] and most likely became infected by being in close proximity to someone who had gotten ill at Chipotle, such as a roommate or dorm-mate.[190] Boston authorities traced the cause of the outbreak to a sick employee who was allowed to work on the day of the outbreak. Chipotle has since fired the employee and also the manager who knowingly allowed the ill worker to complete his shift instead of following health codes.[192]
Consequences[edit]
On February 8, 2016, Chipotle closed all of its eateries nationwide for a few hours during the morning for an all-staff meeting on food safety.[193] The company hired a new head of food safety, who instituted changes including having all employees wash hands every half hour, having two employees verify that produce like onions, jalapeños and avocados have been immersed in hot water for five seconds to kill germs on their exteriors, and using Pascalization to pre-treat food ingredients.[194]
Since the series of food-poisoning outbreaks in 2015 lowered trust in the product, Chipotle has tried to lure back its customers with free food and heavier advertising. Same-store sales increased 17.8% percent in the first quarter of 2017.[195]

Lawsuit[edit]
In November 2016, three men filed a class-action lawsuit against Chipotle alleging that a burrito was listed as containing only 300 calories, when in fact it contained more. They are seeking "unspecified damages and for an injunction against the company to prevent it from posting what it calls misleading information on its food."[196][197][198]
Advertising and publicity[edit]




People line up outside a Chipotle in East Lansing, Michigan during a "Free Burrito Day"


In the past, Chipotle mainly relied on billboards, radio ads, and word of mouth to advertise.[30] In 2012, Chipotle aired its first nationally televised commercial during the 54th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony.[199] In 2010, the company initiated an ad campaign that mocks advice given to Chipotle by advertising agencies.[200] Chipotle has run many promotions giving out free food to potential customers, especially when opening a new store. Stores also give out free burritos on certain holidays; for instance, on Halloween, some locations have had promotions in which free burritos are given to people who come dressed as a burrito. Chipotle gave away free burritos to reporters during the 1997 trial of Timothy McVeigh, which took place in Chipotle's hometown of Denver.[201] In addition, stores offered free burritos to those displaced by Hurricane Katrina.[202] Chipotle received attention when Ozzy Osbourne's reality show The Osbournes featured the company's burritos heavily.[29] For Halloween 2010, Chipotle announced that customers dressed as a processed food product would receive a burrito for $2. The event was part of a $1 million fundraiser for Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution called "Boorito 2010: The Horrors of Processed Food."[203] For "Boorito 2011", customers dressed in costumes "inspired by family farms" will receive a menu item for $2, with proceeds from the promotion going to The Chipotle Cultivate Foundation and Farm Aid. The promotion is aimed to increase awareness of family farms.[204] Also in support of family farms, Chipotle released music videos of Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Willie Nelson.[205] On September 12, 2013, Chipotle released an animated short called The Scarecrow, with a companion mobile video game; both feature a narrative heavily critical of industrial farming, but little in the way of direct marketing for the chain.[206] The short features a cover of "Pure Imagination" from Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, sung by Fiona Apple.[207] It was named one of the worst advertisements of 2013 by The Wall Street Journal.[208]
In 2011, Chipotle created the "Farm Team", which is a rewards program available only by invitation from restaurant managers. The Farm Team members have access to a special Chipotle website, where members can earn rewards, i.e. free food and T-shirts. The site offers members to, "learn where Chipotle’s food comes from, take quizzes and polls, play games and watch videos about the company".[209] In April 2014, the Farm Team program was shut down.[210]
Chipotle sponsors Team Garmin-Barracuda (formerly Team Garmin-Chipotle, Team Garmin-Slipstream, Team Garmin-Transitions and Team Garmin-Cervélo) of the International Cycling Union,[211][212] and is an official team partner of the Boston Celtics,[213] and the Boston Bruins.[214] In June 2009, Chipotle sponsored free screenings of Food, Inc., a film that criticizes the corporate food industry. Founder Steve Ells stated that he hoped the film would make customers appreciate Chipotle's Food With Integrity policy.[215] From May until September 2009, Chipotle ran a contest on mychipotle.com, a microsite which had a competition for the best user-created audio and video presentations about different combinations of ingredients.[216][217] In July 2010, Chipotle began a campaign to support healthier lunch alternatives for students, in which money will be donated to The Lunch Box program based on how many spam E-mails consumers forward to a company E-mail address.[218] For Chipotle's 18 year anniversary, the company began wrapping its burritos in gold foil as part of a larger promotion to draw attention to its Food With Integrity mantra.[219] Also as part of the gold foil campaign, Chipotle is offering prizes for customer-created pictures of items wrapped in gold foil. Chipotle hired comedian Amy Sedaris to create a comedic how-to video on wrapping with gold foil, and spread the video using Twitter.[220] In March 2013, Chipotle pulled its sponsorship of a Boy Scouts of America event, citing that organization's ban on LGBT members.[221]

On December 16, 2015, Chipotle ran full page ads in both The Boston Globe and Boston Herald apologizing for the recent norovirus outbreak linked to Chipotle's Cleveland Circle location. The ad, containing a letter by Chipotle founder and co-CEO Steve Ells, affirmed the company's commitment to food safety.[222]
On March 14, 2016, a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) administrative law judge concluded that Chipotle’s social media policy, and more specifically its application towards an employee who posted tweets regarding wages and working conditions, violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).[223] A former Chipotle employee in Havertown, Pennsylvania, wrote a series of tweets from his personal account about hourly workers being required to work on snow days. Chipotle instructed the employee to delete the tweets. The NLRB judge determined that Chipotle’s request to delete the tweets violated the NLRA even though the employee was not disciplined as a result of his tweets.[224]
Architecture[edit]




The exterior of a Chipotle in Durham, North Carolina


Architecturally, all Chipotle restaurants are built using most of the same materials (plywood, corrugated metal, stainless steel, exposed ductwork), although each store is unique.[20][225] The interiors have been described as having an "industrial, sheet metal look".[226] Chipotle has built restaurants using white ceramic tile instead of stainless steel.[227] It costs the company approximately $850,000 to open a new restaurant.[228] When the first Chipotle opened, Steve Ells asked his friend, sculptor Bruce Gueswel, to design the chairs and a styled Mayan king whose face was loosely based on that of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., a personal inspiration of Gueswel, for the restaurant. Both items were made from wood and metal. Gueswel has continued to design and build the art and chairs for all subsequent Chipotle restaurants.[229]
Most Chipotle locations display a photograph of the original restaurant, which is near the University of Denver campus on Evans Avenue.[20] Instead of a photograph of itself, the original location has a photograph of the Dolly Madison Ice Cream that previously occupied the location. In 2010, Chipotle began opening "A Model" restaurants, which are smaller concept locations, citing the lower costs of development and occupancy.[230] Chipotle uses environmentally friendly packaging, with bowls made from recycled newsprint, unbleached tray liners, and napkins and cups made from postconsumer waste.[231]
Chipotle's architectural design team incorporates the principles of sustainable architecture in their projects. The "green" restaurant in Gurnee, Illinois features an on-site six kilowatt wind turbine, which generates about 10% of the restaurant's electrical needs. The Gurnee restaurant has received Platinum level LEED certification from U.S. Green Building Council.[232] A restaurant in Tulsa, Oklahoma, uses recycled drywall, low-VOC paint, and energy-efficient appliances.[233] A Chipotle restaurant in Austin, Texas was the first to receive a four-star rating from the city's Green Building Program.[234] Additionally, Chipotle has made arrangements to add solar panels to 75 of its restaurants.[232] Chipotle has contracted to clean its stores in New York City and Long Island, with "plant-based, environmentally preferable cleaning supplies and technologies." The cleansers are readily biodegradable and non-toxic to humans or aquatic life.[235]
Chipotle was the defendant in a lawsuit for failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Maurizio Antoninetti, a customer who used a wheelchair, claimed he was denied the "Chipotle Experience", because he was unable to see the food preparation. The case against the company was upheld in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,[236] and the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear Chipotle's appeal, leaving the Ninth Circuit's ruling intact.[237] Chipotle has "an official disability policy of bringing ingredients to the tables of diners with disabilities and doing tableside preparation." Chipotle is retrofitting restaurants affected by the ruling, replacing the walls in front of the food preparation area with lower ones or transparent panels. They are incorporating the new design elements into new restaurants.[236] The case was one of over twenty ADA-related lawsuits filed by Antoninetti, who died in 2011.[236][238]
Other restaurant units[edit]

Pizzeria Locale is a fast casual pizza restaurant formed as a partnership with Pizzeria Locale, a full-service pizza restaurant in Boulder, Colorado. The original Pizzeria Locale owners, Bobby Stuckey and Lachlan Mackinnon-Patterson, would continue to own their original location while Chipotle would increase its stake in the chain over time.[48] As of February 2017, the chain has seven locations.[51]
Tasty Made is a burger restaurant concept that Chipotle first opened in Lancaster, Ohio in October 2016.[239] On July 29, 2016, the company announced the opening of its first Tasty Made burger restaurant in the fall. The first location was revealed to be in Lancaster, Ohio. Ohio was selected as culinary manager Nate Appleman and national training director David Chrisman are both from the state and helped design the concept.[240] Tasty Made was announced to have a focused menu like early burger restaurants which were limited to burgers, fries and milkshakes.[51] Chipotle had trademarked Better Burger earlier in the year.


Defunct


Soul Daddy was a soul food fast casual restaurant that was owned by ANGR Holdings, LLC, and was managed by Chipotle after purchasing Ellis' stake in the company. The restaurant had three locations that had operated for less than 5 weeks in 2011 before closing.[241]
ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen was an Asian fast-casual concept restaurant that was opened by Chipotle in September 2011.[45] The company said that the new restaurant "would follow the Chipotle service format and its focus on 'food with integrity' in ingredients."[46] Chipotle's plan was to start with only one store, and see how the restaurant works out before expanding the concept.[47] By July 2016, the chain has 15 restaurants.[51] All ShopHouse locations were closed on March 17, 2017.[242]

Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (/tʃᵻˈpoʊtleɪ/)[6] is an American chain of fast casual restaurants in the United States, United Kingdom,[7] Canada,[8][9] Germany,[10] and France,[11] specializing in tacos and Mission-style[12][13] burritos. Its name derives from chipotle, the Nahuatl name for a smoked and dried jalapeño chili pepper.[14] The company currently trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CMG.[15]
The company has released a mission statement called Food with Integrity, which highlights its efforts in using naturally-grown ingredients,[6] and serves more naturally raised meat than any other restaurant chain.[16] Chipotle is one of the first chains of fast casual dining establishments.[17] Competitors in the fast-casual Mexican market include Qdoba Mexican Grill, Moe's Southwest Grill, Rubio's Coastal Grill, Pancheros Mexican Grill, Freebirds World Burrito, and Baja Fresh.[18]
Founded by Steve Ells on July 13, 1993. Chipotle had 16 restaurants (all in Colorado) when McDonald's Corporation became a major investor in 1998. By the time McDonald's fully divested itself from Chipotle in 2006,[19] the chain had grown to over 500 locations.
With more than 2,000 locations,[2] Chipotle had a net income of US$475.6 million and a staff of more than 45,000 employees in 2015.[2]

History[edit]




The first Chipotle, near the campus of the University of Denver


Founder Steve Ells attended the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York. Afterward, he became a line cook for Jeremiah Tower at Stars in San Francisco.[20] There, Ells observed the popularity of the taquerías and San Francisco burritos in the Mission District. In 1993, Ells took what he learned in San Francisco[21] and opened the first Chipotle Mexican Grill in Denver, Colorado, in a former Dolly Madison Ice Cream store at 1644 East Evans Avenue,[22] near the University of Denver campus, using an $85,000 loan from his father.[19] Ells and his father calculated that the store would need to sell 107 burritos per day to be profitable. After one month, the original restaurant was selling over 1,000 burritos a day.[15] The second store opened in 1995 using Chipotle's cash flow, and the third was opened using an SBA loan. To fund more growth, Ells' father invested $1.5 million. Afterwards, Ells created a board of directors and business plan, raising an additional $1.8 million for the company.[23] Ells had originally planned to use funds from the first Chipotle to open a fine-dining restaurant, but instead focused on Chipotle Mexican Grill when the restaurants saw success.[24][25]
In 1998, the first restaurant outside of Colorado opened in Kansas City, Missouri.[26] The company opened its first location in Minnesota by opening near the campus of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis in March 1999.[27]
In 1998, McDonald's made an initial minority investment in the company. By 2001, the company had grown to be Chipotle's largest investor.[19] The investment from McDonald's allowed the firm to quickly expand, from 16 restaurants in 1998 to over 500 by 2005.[28] On January 26, 2006, Chipotle made its initial public offering (IPO) after increasing the share price twice due to high pre-IPO demand. In its first day as a public company, the stock rose exactly 100%, resulting in the best U.S.-based IPO in six years, and the second-best IPO for a restaurant after Boston Market. The money from the offering was then used to fund new store growth.[29]
In October 2006, McDonald's fully divested from Chipotle.[30] This was part of a larger initiative for McDonald's to divest all of its non-core business restaurants — Chipotle, Donatos Pizza, and Boston Market — so that it could focus on the main McDonald's chain.[31] McDonald's invested approximately $360 million into Chipotle, and took out $1.5 billion.[23] McDonald's had attempted to get Chipotle to add drive-through windows and a breakfast menu, which Ells resisted.[32][33] In 2008, Chipotle opened its first location outside of the United States in Toronto.[9]
In a list of fastest-growing restaurant chains in 2009, Chipotle was ranked eighth, based on increases in U.S. sales over the past year,[34] and in 2010 Chipotle was ranked third.[35] Consumer Reports ranked Chipotle as the best Mexican fast-food chain in 2011.[36] The company serves approximately 750,000 customers per day.[37]
In December 2010, Chipotle hired chef Nate Appleman to develop new cuisine. Appleman has won Rising Star Chef from the James Beard Foundation, was named "Best New Chef" by Food & Wine magazine, and competed on The Next Iron Chef.[38]
In 2010, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) audited Chipotle's Minneapolis restaurants, and found that some employees had been hired using fraudulent documents. In December, Chipotle fired 450 employees from its Minneapolis restaurants as a result of the audit, resulting in protests by local groups.[39][40] In February 2011, ICE expanded the audit to include 60 restaurants in Virginia and Washington, D.C.[41] which resulted in 40 workers being fired. In April 2011, the criminal division of the Attorney General's office in Washington, D.C., joined the case, and ICE agents began interviewing employees at 20 to 25 restaurants in other locations, such as Los Angeles and Atlanta.[42] In response to the government investigations, Chipotle hired former director of ICE Julie Myers Wood and high-profile attorneys Robert Luskin and Gregory B. Craig.[43]
Other restaurant expansion[edit]
In 2011, Steve Ells was a judge for the TV show America's Next Great Restaurant and investor of ANGR Holdings, the company that will be running the winning concept's restaurants. Chipotle has agreed to purchase Ells' investment in ANGR at his cost, provide support for ANGR operations, and invest a total of $2.3 million in cash contributions.[44]
In September 2011, Chipotle opened an Asian fast-casual concept restaurant named ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen in Washington, D.C.[45] The company has said the new restaurant "would follow the Chipotle service format and its focus on 'food with integrity' in ingredients."[46] Chipotle's plan was to start with only one store, and see how the restaurant works out before expanding the concept.[47]
On December 18, 2013, the company revealed that it had opened its first fast-food pizza chain in Denver back in May 2013. According to Associated Press, Chipotle partnered with a local full-service restaurant called Pizzeria Locale to create a fast-food version of the eatery, keeping its name. The company plans to open at least two more pizzerias in the Denver area.[48]
In April 2014, Chipotle announced an increase in menu prices for the first time in nearly three years, due to increasing costs for steak, avocados, and cheese. The price increase was expected to be rolled out from the end of second quarter of 2014 through the end of the third quarter.[49] In late 2015, Chipotle expanded its mobile strategy through delivery partnerships with tech startups like Tapingo, a delivery service that targets college campuses.[50]
On July 29, 2016, the company announced the opening of its first Tasty Made burger restaurant in the fall. Chipotle was still dealing with the various virus outbreaks with additional marketing. The company was also reducing the number of new stores for the year from 235 to 220.[51]
International[edit]




The second Chipotle Mexican Grill location in London, located on Baker Street


According to an article in The Motley Fool, Chipotle had 17 locations outside of the United States by October 2014 with the majority in Canada, and the UK was in the process of opening more locations.[52] The rate of overseas expansion was slower than expected.[53] Many of the press reviewers thought that the food was overpriced for their area.[11][54]
As of 2017 there are 26 locations outside of the United States with 11 locations in Canada (Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver), 6 locations in The United Kingdom (London), 3 in France (Paris), and 1 in Germany (Frankfurt).[better source needed][2] [55]
Canada[edit]
In August 2008, Chipotle opened its first location outside of the United States in Toronto.[9] The second location in Toronto–and in all of Canada–was not opened until 2010.[53]
The first Canadian location outside of the Toronto area was opened in Vancouver in December 2012.[56] A second Vancouver-area location was opened in Burnaby in October 2014[57] followed by a third in Surrey in January 2016[58] and a fourth in Langley in October 2016.[59]
The first location in the nation's capital of Ottawa was opened in February 2017 at the Rideau Centre.[60]
United Kingdom[edit]
Chipotle expanded to Europe with the first European restaurant opening in May 2010 in London.[7][61][62] A second location open in London in September 2011.[63] The following year, three additional locations were quickly opened in the London area.[64] After this growth spurt, the rate of further expansion in London slowed greatly with the sixth location appearing in 2013[65] and the seventh in June 2015.[66] Although Chipotle blames the slow growth in the United Kingdom on the British unfamiliarity with Mexican foods,[67] several locally owned burrito chains had opened locations across the United Kingdom during the same interval.[68]
France[edit]
The first location in France opened in Paris in May 2012.[11][69]
Expansion in France was much slower than that in the United Kingdom or Canada, with a second location in Paris opening in 2013[70] and a third location in 2014.[71] At 7,000 square feet, the restaurant at La Défense is, as of 2015[update], the largest Chipotle location in the world, while a typical Chipotle restaurant is usually between 2,200 and 2,500 square feet.[72] A fourth Parisian location was opened in Levallois-Perret in 2015[73] followed by a fifth[74] and a sixth[75] Parisian location in 2016, both in Saint-Germain-des-Prés.
Germany[edit]
The first and, so far, only location in Germany opened in Frankfurt in August 2013.[10][54]
Corporate management[edit]
Chipotle's team includes a residing corporate office of managers and its board of directors. Members of both teams are appointed to serve on committees: audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance.
The top management team consists of the Chief Executive Officers, Steve Ells; the Chief Financial Officer, Jack R. Hartung; the Chief Marketing and Development Officer, Mark Crumpacker.[76] The current board of directors consists of: Steve Ells, Patrick Flynn, Albert Baldocchi, Neil Flanzraich, Darlene Friedman, Stephen Gillet, Kimbal Musk and John Charlesworth.[77]
Founder Steve Ells serves as chairman and Chief executive officer,[78] and has a 1.25% stake in the company.[79] The labor-market research firm Glassdoor reported that Steve Ells earned $29 million in 2014, versus a median of $19,000 for Chipotle's workers, making the CEO-to-worker pay ratio 1522:1.[80]
Operation and distribution[edit]
All of Chipotle's restaurants are company-owned, rather than franchised.[81] As of December 2012[update], 1430 restaurants have since opened throughout the United States and Canada, with locations in 43 states, Ontario, British Columbia, and the District of Columbia.[82][83]
The field team are the employees who work closely with but not directly within specific restaurants. The field support system includes apprentice team leaders (step up from restaurateurs), team leaders or area managers, team directors and regional directors (not atypical for them to oversee more than fifty locations).[84] Because Chipotle does not franchise, all restaurants are corporately owned. Thus, whenever Chipotle is in the process of launching a new location, the field team hires a new general manager and trains them at a current location so that they will be ready for the new location when it opens for business. The corporate office takes care of finding and funding new locations as well.[85]
Menu[edit]




A Chipotle restaurant in Brandon, Florida, having the typical service-line layout with menu above


Chipotle's menu consists of four items: burritos, bowls, tacos, and salads. The price of each item is based on the choice of chicken, pork carnitas, barbacoa, steak, tofu-based "sofritas",[86][87] chorizo (chicken and pork), or vegetarian (with guacamole, which would be at an extra charge otherwise). Additional optional toppings are offered free of charge, including: rice, beans, four types of salsa, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce.[88][89] When asked in 2007 about expanding the menu, Steve Ells said, "[I]t's important to keep the menu focused, because if you just do a few things, you can ensure that you do them better than anybody else."[90] Chipotle also offers a children's menu.[91][92] Most restaurants sell beer and margaritas in addition to soft drinks and fruit drinks.[93]
The majority of food is prepared in each restaurant. Some exceptions are the beans and carnitas, which are prepared at a central kitchen in Chicago, Illinois.[94] None of the restaurants have freezers, microwave ovens, or can openers.[95]




Chicken Burrito Bowl


The chain experimented with breakfast foods at two airports in the Washington (D.C.) metropolitan area but decided against expanding the menu in that direction.[96][97][98] Starting in 2009, selected restaurants had offered a pozole soup,[99][100][101] which has since been discontinued.
In June 2015, Chipotle began test marketing a pork and chicken chorizo-type sausage as a new protein option at selected locations in the Kansas City area.[102][103][104] Some food writers have expressed their health related concerns over the protein's relatively high sodium content since a 4-ounce serving contains 293 calories and 803 milligrams of sodium[105] while the American Heart Association’s recommended daily amount is less than 1,500 milligrams of sodium.[106] In contrast, the protein options with next highest sodium contents are Barbacoa with 530 milligrams and sofritas with 555 milligrams.[105] An earlier version on the Mexican sausage was tested in Denver and New York City in 2011,[107] but that test was terminated when that version of the sausage was perceived as looking too greasy.[108] As of fall 2016, chorizo is available nationwide.
Chipotle accepts fax orders, and in 2005 the company added the ability to order online from their website. For both online and fax orders, customers proceed to the front of the line to pay for pre-ordered food.[109] In 2009, Chipotle released an app for the iPhone that allows users to find nearby Chipotle locations, place an order, and prepay with a credit card.[110] In 2013, Chipotle released an Android app that allows users to locate nearby Chipotle locations, place an order, prepay with a credit or gift card, and access favorites and recent orders.[111][112]
Nutrition[edit]
In 2003, a Center for Science in the Public Interest report stated that Chipotle's burritos contain over 1,000 calories, which is nearly equivalent to two meals' worth of food.[113][114] MSNBC Health.com placed the burritos on their list of the "20 Worst Foods in America" because of their high caloric content and high sodium.[115] When a burrito with carnitas, rice, vegetables, cheese, guacamole, and salsa was compared with a typical Big Mac, the burrito had more fat, cholesterol, carbohydrates, and sodium than the Big Mac, but it also had more protein and fiber.[116] The restaurant has also received praise – Health.com included the restaurant in its list of the "Healthiest Fast Food Restaurants".[117]
Chipotle's vegetarian options include rice, black beans, fajita vegetables (onions and bell peppers), salsa, guacamole and cheese.[118] All items other than the meats, cheese, sour cream, and honey vinaigrette dressing are vegan.[118] As of late 2013, Chipotle developed a new cooking strategy for the pinto beans, eliminating the bacon and making them vegetarian and vegan-friendly.[119] The cheese is processed with vegetable-based rennet in order to be suitable for vegetarians.[118] In April 2010, Chipotle began testing a vegan "Garden Blend" option, which is a plant-based meat alternative marinated in chipotle adobo, at six locations in the U.S.[120][121] The flour tortillas used for the burritos and soft tacos are the only items that contain gluten.[118]
Food sourcing[edit]
In 1999, while looking for ways to improve the taste of the carnitas,[20] Steve Ells was prompted by an article written by Edward Behr to visit Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs).[122] Ells found the CAFOs "horrific", and began sourcing from open-range pork suppliers. This caused an increase in both the price and the sales of the carnitas burritos.[61]
In 2001, Chipotle released a mission statement called Food With Integrity, which highlighted Chipotle's efforts to increase their use of naturally raised meat, organic produce, and dairy without added hormones.[6] Chipotle only uses the leg and thigh meat from its chickens; the breast meat is sold to Panera Bread.[123]

Founder Steve Ells has testified before the United States Congress in support of the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act, which aims to reduce the amount of antibiotics given to farm animals.[61][124]
Since 2006, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW), a Floridian farmworker organization, has protested Chipotle’s refusal to sign a Fair Food agreement, which would commit the restaurant chain to pay a penny-per-pound premium on its Florida tomatoes to boost tomato harvesters’ wages, and to only buy Florida tomatoes from growers who comply with the Fair Food Code of Conduct.[125] In 2009, the creators of the documentary film Food, Inc. (along with 31 other leaders in the sustainable food movement) signed an open letter of support for the CIW’s campaign, stating that, “If Chipotle is sincere in its wishes to reform its supply chain, the time has come to work with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers as a true partner in the protection of farmworkers rights.”[126] In September 2009, Chipotle announced that it would sidestep partnership with the CIW and instead work directly with East Coast Growers and Packers to increase wages for its tomato pickers.[127] CEO Steve Ells has framed the dispute as a fundamental issue of control, stating that, “the CIW wants us to sign a contract that would let them control Chipotle's decisions regarding food in the future."[128] In October 2012, Chipotle Mexican Grill signed an agreement with the CIW and became the 11th company to join the organization's Fair Food Program.[129]
In January 2015, Chipotle pulled carnitas from its menu in a third of its restaurants; company officials cited animal welfare problems at one of the suppliers, found during a regular audit, as the reason.[130] Subsequently, a false rumor spread online claiming it was done to appease Muslims who consider pork to be unclean, leading to some protests on social media.[131] The company still uses antibiotic-free and hormone-free steak in its restaurants, despite being briefly forced to "serve beef that is not naturally raised" during the summer of 2013, posting an in-store notice each time that occurred.[132] Roberto Ferdman of The Washington Post opined that Chipotle's stated mission to sell "food with integrity" may be "untenable" if meat producers continue to breach Chipotle's ethical standards.[130]
Also in 2015, Chipotle stopped using genetically modified corn and soy beans in their foods, claiming to be the first nationwide restaurant to cook completely GMO free.[133] This was done in response to increasing consumer demand for GMO free products.
Food safety[edit]

 "How Chipotle made hundreds of people barf". Vox report dated January 6, 2016, explaining Chipotle's "food safety crisis".


Since 2008, a former Kansas State University food safety professor has accused Chipotle of confusing the public by using such terms as "naturally raised meats", "organic ingredients", and "locally sourced" and trying to equate those terms with food safety.[134] In rebuttal, a Chipotle spokesperson told The Daily Beast that "all of our practices have always been very much within industry norms. It's important to note that restaurant practices are regulated by health codes, and restaurants are routinely inspected by health officials. Everything we have done in our supply chain and in our restaurants has been within industry norms."[134] Yet, FiveThirtyEight pointed out that the 2015 norovirus outbreak appears to be unusual[135] and others are criticizing their food sourcing or handling practices.[136][137] MarketWatch wrote that the result of all of these outbreaks will be to force Chipotle to obtain their produce from larger corporate farms that can afford the more extensive microbial food-safety testing programs and to process vegetables at centralized locations instead of at the individual stores, both of which are industry-standard practices that the company had previously criticized.[138] The New York Times implied that the company's insistence on maintaining its long standing rhetoric about "food integrity" seemed to be quite opposite with the realities of recent current events and made it appear that the management was just ignoring their current problems.[139] It also has been pointed out that Chipotle's current record-keeping system is actually hindering the health authorities' investigation in locating the sources of the various infections.[139]
A writer for the magazine Popular Science pointed out that Chipotle had publicly acknowledged that they "may be at a higher risk for food-borne illness outbreaks than some competitors due to our use of fresh produce and meats rather than frozen, and our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation."[140][141][142] Henry I. Miller, a medical researcher and columnist and the founding director of the FDA's Office of Biotechnology, asked: "One wonders whether Chipotle’s "traditional methods" include employees' neglecting to wash their hands before preparing food, which is how norovirus is usually spread. And the fresh versus frozen dichotomy is nothing more than a snow-job. Freezing E. coli-contaminated food does not kill the pathogens; it preserves them."[143] Describing food poisoning outbreaks as "something of a Chipotle trademark; the recent ones are the fourth and fifth this year [2015], one of which was not disclosed to the public", Miller notes that "a particularly worrisome aspect of the company's serial deficiencies is that there have been at least three unrelated pathogens in the outbreaks – Salmonella and E. coli bacteria and norovirus. In other words, there has been more than a single glitch; suppliers and employees have found a variety of ways to contaminate what Chipotle cavalierly sells (at premium prices) to its customers."[143]
A writer for the North Carolina newspaper The News & Observer called Chipotle's "food with integrity" a "lucrative farce" and a "marketing ploy" by pointing out that organic food is "often grown with manure (an 'all-natural' fertilizer), which can certainly increase the risks of accidentally spreading fecal bacteria like E. coli."[144]
In December 2015, Seattle health officials closed a Seattle-area Chipotle for a day after it had repeatedly had small numbers of violations during recent consecutive inspections that previously would not have generated a closure order.[145] On December 10, 2015, CEO Steve Ells released a press statement apologizing for 2015 outbreaks and promised changes to minimize the risks of future outbreaks.[146]
March 2008 hepatitis outbreak[edit]
In March and April 2008, the Community Epidemiology Branch of the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency traced a hepatitis A outbreak in San Diego County to a single Chipotle restaurant located in La Mesa, California in which 22 customers were infected with the virus.[147][148]
April 2008 norovirus outbreak[edit]
In 2008, Chipotle was implicated in a norovirus outbreak in Kent, Ohio, where over 400 people became ill after eating at a Chipotle restaurant.[149] Officials at the Ohio Department of Health said that the outbreak was caused by Norovirus Genotype G2.[150] Many of the victims were students at Kent State University.[151] The initial source of the outbreak was never found.
February 2009 Campylobacter jejuni outbreak[edit]
In 2009, an investigation by the Minnesota Department of Health traced an outbreak of campylobacteriosis to a Chipotle Mexican Grill in Apple Valley, Minnesota.[152][153][154] The investigation found that chicken was sometimes served undercooked by the restaurant and determined that lettuce which had been cross-contaminated with raw or undercooked chicken was the vector for the outbreak.[155][156][third-party source needed]
July 2015 E. coli outbreak[edit]
In early November 2015, The Oregonian reported that there was a little-known E. coli outbreak that had occurred earlier in July in which five persons were infected with the O157:H7 strain of E. coli. The outbreak was traced to a single Chipotle location in Seattle and that the incident was not publicized at that time.[157][158] Seattle public health officials defended their actions at that time by saying that the outbreak was over by the time they made an association with Chipotle. Health officials were unable to trace the source of the July outbreak and said that the cause of the July outbreak is unrelated to the October/November outbreak.[157]
August 2015 norovirus outbreak[edit]
Another norovirus outbreak was confirmed to have occurred in August 2015 at a Simi Valley, California location in which 80 customers and 18 employees reported becoming ill.[159][160] Ventura County health inspectors found various health violations during two inspections following the outbreak report.[161] Despite those violations, the county health officials did not close the restaurant and allowed it to continue to operate.[159] In a January 2016 article, the New York Times reported that the number of victims involved in the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak was actually 207, twice the number that was reported earlier.[162]
In an unusual move, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California in conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration has gotten a federal grand jury to issue a subpoena in January 2016 as part of a criminal investigation seeking documents and information from Chipotle concerning the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak.[162][163] As of January 2016[update], it is too early to tell which organization is the actual target of the investigation. In most cases involving norovirus outbreaks that involved a single location, state and/or local authorities are the usual jurisdiction responsible in the investigation and prosecution of those type of cases. However, Ventura County officials had been criticized for their handling of parts of their investigation, and for allowing the restaurant to continue to operate after finding health violations during consecutive inspections.
Less than two weeks later, a federal class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California claiming that Chipotle knowingly allowed an ill kitchen manager to work for two days before sending that person home. Then, the restaurant actively deep-cleaned the restaurant to remove all traces of contamination prior to notifying the Ventura County Environmental Health Division of the existing outbreak, hindering their investigation. The lawsuit also claimed that the number of known victims was as high as 234 and estimates that the number of meals that the infected employee may have come in contact with could be as high 3,000.[164][165][166]
August 2015 Salmonella outbreak[edit]
At almost the same time as the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak, Minnesota health officials confirmed a Salmonella outbreak that affected 17 Minneapolis-area Chipotle restaurants in mid-August 2015. The source of the outbreak was traced back to contaminated tomatoes that were grown in Mexico.[167][168] The Minnesota Department of Health reported that samples from 45 victims were tested and found that their illness was caused by the Salmonella Newport bacterium as determined by DNA profiling.[169] Later, the state officials reported that the total of persons who became infected was increased to 64 and the number Chipotle locations in which they had acquired the bacterium was increased to 22, all located within the state of Minnesota.[170]
October 2015 E. coli outbreak[edit]
In October 2015, at least 22 persons were reported to have gotten sick after eating at several different Chipotle locations in the states of Washington and Oregon. At that time, an epidemiologist for the Washington Health Department said the culprit appeared to be a Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli bacterium, but they were still waiting the outcome of several laboratory tests before they can give a definitive result.[171][172][173] As a precaution, Chipotle had closed 43 stores in Washington and Oregon pending the results and recommendations of the involved health authorities. On November 5, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had reported that the number of persons reported ill had risen to 40 known cases and that the bacteria samples taken from 7 infected persons in Washington and 3 persons in Oregon states were confirmed to be infected by the same strain of E. coli, the Shiga toxin-producing STEC O26 strain, as determined by DNA profiling.[174] At least 12 persons required hospitalization, but no fatalities. As of November 2015, Health authorities were still trying to trace the exact source of the bacterial contamination, but suspected fresh produce.[175]
On November 12, the CDC increased the number of known cases to 50, the number of persons requiring hospitalization to 14, and the number of DNA fingerprint confirmations to 33.[176] Through a match via Pulsenet, the DNA fingerprint also matched a recent case in Minnesota, but the ill person did not eat at Chipotle. The source of the bacteria infection still had not yet been determined at the time of the report released by the CDC and the CDC is trying to use the more definitive, but more time consuming whole genome sequencing procedure to see if they are able to determine the relationships between all of the STEC O26 cases. In the meantime, Chipotle reopened the closed restaurants on November 11 after disposing all of the food within the closed facilities and deep cleaning those facilities.[177]
On November 20, the CDC reported that the number of STEC O26 cases, as determined by DNA fingerprinting, had increased to 45 with 16 persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to six.[178] Besides Oregon and Washington, new cases were reported in the states of Minnesota, California, New York, and Ohio.[179] 43 out of 45 of the affected individuals had reported that they had eaten at a Chipotle in the week before they had become sick.
On December 4, the CDC reported that the number of STEC O26 cases, as determined by DNA fingerprinting, had increased to 52 with 20 persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to nine.[180] New cases were reported in the states of California (1), Illinois (1), Maryland (1), Ohio (2), Pennsylvania (1), and Washington (1).[181]
The price of shares for Chipotle stock dropped a further 12% immediately after the CDC had issued their update on November 20.[182] Share prices had been dropping since the initial announcement of the E. coli outbreak in late October with investors unsure if the drop in share prices just a temporary aberration and that Chipotle management is handling the incident as well as they could. Chipotle has since hired a consultant to improve their food safety program and have their program reviewed by both the CDC and FDA.[183]
On February 1, 2016, the CDC official closed their investigations on the larger E. coli that started in Pacific Northwest in October 2015 and also the smaller outbreak that started in Kansas and Oklahoma in November since no new cases were reported since December 1.[184] In their final report, the CDC stated that 55 persons in 11 states were infected with the same strain of STEC O26 during the major outbreak with 21 of those persons requiring hospitalization. The five persons infected in the later outbreak were made ill by a generically different strain of STEC O26. The CDC also reported that federal and local health and food safety authorities were unable to detect traces of the microorganisms in any of the food samples taken from the suspected restaurants or from their supply chain. The CDC, FDA, and the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service were unable to determine a point source that was in common in the meals that were consumed by all the victims since some of the restaurants were located far apart and had obtained some of their ingredients from different suppliers while other consumers of the suspected suppliers were not affected.
November 2015 E. coli cases[edit]
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on December 21 that five more people became ill after eating at two Chipotle restaurants located in Kansas and Oklahoma in late November. Preliminary DNA fingerprinting results appear to indicated that the newer cases were caused by a different strain of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O26. Scientists are waiting for the results of the more definitive whole genome sequencing analyses to determine if the organisms responsible for this outbreak are genetically related to the E. coli that are responsible for causing the outbreak that had started in Oregon and Washington in late October and thus an extension of that outbreak. The agency has not yet determined which food is responsible for the outbreak.[185] The Food and Drug Administration reported that they are trying to determine how the bacteria in these cases, along with the earlier Oregon, Washington, and other multi-state cases, might have been propagated through the food supply chain.[186]
December 2015 norovirus outbreak[edit]




The closed restaurant on December 16, 2015


In December 2015, eighty students at Boston College were sickened after eating at a single Chipotle restaurant. Affected students had been tested for both E. coli and norovirus in order to determine the cause of the illnesses.[187] Although it would take as long as two days before the results of more definitive tests became known, public health investigators reported that preliminary tests pointed to the presence of norovirus.[188] The health inspectors for the City of Boston had since closed this particular location on December 7 for a number of health violations that included maintaining meats at a too low of a temperature on the serving line and for allowing a sick employee to work at the time of the inspection.[189]
On December 10, officials from the Boston Public Health Commission reported that tests had identified a single strain of norovirus that is responsible for this particular outbreak.[190] Boston Globe reported on December 10 that 141 persons were reported to have gotten ill and that some of the newer victims had not visited Chipotle before contracting the virus[191] and most likely became infected by being in close proximity to someone who had gotten ill at Chipotle, such as a roommate or dorm-mate.[190] Boston authorities traced the cause of the outbreak to a sick employee who was allowed to work on the day of the outbreak. Chipotle has since fired the employee and also the manager who knowingly allowed the ill worker to complete his shift instead of following health codes.[192]
Consequences[edit]
On February 8, 2016, Chipotle closed all of its eateries nationwide for a few hours during the morning for an all-staff meeting on food safety.[193] The company hired a new head of food safety, who instituted changes including having all employees wash hands every half hour, having two employees verify that produce like onions, jalapeños and avocados have been immersed in hot water for five seconds to kill germs on their exteriors, and using Pascalization to pre-treat food ingredients.[194]
Since the series of food-poisoning outbreaks in 2015 lowered trust in the product, Chipotle has tried to lure back its customers with free food and heavier advertising. Same-store sales increased 17.8% percent in the first quarter of 2017.[195]

Lawsuit[edit]
In November 2016, three men filed a class-action lawsuit against Chipotle alleging that a burrito was listed as containing only 300 calories, when in fact it contained more. They are seeking "unspecified damages and for an injunction against the company to prevent it from posting what it calls misleading information on its food."[196][197][198]
Advertising and publicity[edit]

In the past, Chipotle mainly relied on billboards, radio ads, and word of mouth to advertise.[30] In 2012, Chipotle aired its first nationally televised commercial during the 54th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony.[199] In 2010, the company initiated an ad campaign that mocks advice given to Chipotle by advertising agencies.[200] Chipotle has run many promotions giving out free food to potential customers, especially when opening a new store. Stores also give out free burritos on certain holidays; for instance, on Halloween, some locations have had promotions in which free burritos are given to people who come dressed as a burrito. Chipotle gave away free burritos to reporters during the 1997 trial of Timothy McVeigh, which took place in Chipotle's hometown of Denver.[201] In addition, stores offered free burritos to those displaced by Hurricane Katrina.[202] Chipotle received attention when Ozzy Osbourne's reality show The Osbournes featured the company's burritos heavily.[29] For Halloween 2010, Chipotle announced that customers dressed as a processed food product would receive a burrito for $2. The event was part of a $1 million fundraiser for Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution called "Boorito 2010: The Horrors of Processed Food."[203] For "Boorito 2011", customers dressed in costumes "inspired by family farms" will receive a menu item for $2, with proceeds from the promotion going to The Chipotle Cultivate Foundation and Farm Aid. The promotion is aimed to increase awareness of family farms.[204] Also in support of family farms, Chipotle released music videos of Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Willie Nelson.[205] On September 12, 2013, Chipotle released an animated short called The Scarecrow, with a companion mobile video game; both feature a narrative heavily critical of industrial farming, but little in the way of direct marketing for the chain.[206] The short features a cover of "Pure Imagination" from Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, sung by Fiona Apple.[207] It was named one of the worst advertisements of 2013 by The Wall Street Journal.[208]
In 2011, Chipotle created the "Farm Team", which is a rewards program available only by invitation from restaurant managers. The Farm Team members have access to a special Chipotle website, where members can earn rewards, i.e. free food and T-shirts. The site offers members to, "learn where Chipotle’s food comes from, take quizzes and polls, play games and watch videos about the company".[209] In April 2014, the Farm Team program was shut down.[210]
Chipotle sponsors Team Garmin-Barracuda (formerly Team Garmin-Chipotle, Team Garmin-Slipstream, Team Garmin-Transitions and Team Garmin-Cervélo) of the International Cycling Union,[211][212] and is an official team partner of the Boston Celtics,[213] and the Boston Bruins.[214] In June 2009, Chipotle sponsored free screenings of Food, Inc., a film that criticizes the corporate food industry. Founder Steve Ells stated that he hoped the film would make customers appreciate Chipotle's Food With Integrity policy.[215] From May until September 2009, Chipotle ran a contest on mychipotle.com, a microsite which had a competition for the best user-created audio and video presentations about different combinations of ingredients.[216][217] In July 2010, Chipotle began a campaign to support healthier lunch alternatives for students, in which money will be donated to The Lunch Box program based on how many spam E-mails consumers forward to a company E-mail address.[218] For Chipotle's 18 year anniversary, the company began wrapping its burritos in gold foil as part of a larger promotion to draw attention to its Food With Integrity mantra.[219] Also as part of the gold foil campaign, Chipotle is offering prizes for customer-created pictures of items wrapped in gold foil. Chipotle hired comedian Amy Sedaris to create a comedic how-to video on wrapping with gold foil, and spread the video using Twitter.[220] In March 2013, Chipotle pulled its sponsorship of a Boy Scouts of America event, citing that organization's ban on LGBT members.[221]

On December 16, 2015, Chipotle ran full page ads in both The Boston Globe and Boston Herald apologizing for the recent norovirus outbreak linked to Chipotle's Cleveland Circle location. The ad, containing a letter by Chipotle founder and co-CEO Steve Ells, affirmed the company's commitment to food safety.[222]
On March 14, 2016, a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) administrative law judge concluded that Chipotle’s social media policy, and more specifically its application towards an employee who posted tweets regarding wages and working conditions, violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).[223] A former Chipotle employee in Havertown, Pennsylvania, wrote a series of tweets from his personal account about hourly workers being required to work on snow days. Chipotle instructed the employee to delete the tweets. The NLRB judge determined that Chipotle’s request to delete the tweets violated the NLRA even though the employee was not disciplined as a result of his tweets.[224]
Architecture[edit]




The exterior of a Chipotle in Durham, North Carolina


Architecturally, all Chipotle restaurants are built using most of the same materials (plywood, corrugated metal, stainless steel, exposed ductwork), although each store is unique.[20][225] The interiors have been described as having an "industrial, sheet metal look".[226] Chipotle has built restaurants using white ceramic tile instead of stainless steel.[227] It costs the company approximately $850,000 to open a new restaurant.[228] When the first Chipotle opened, Steve Ells asked his friend, sculptor Bruce Gueswel, to design the chairs and a styled Mayan king whose face was loosely based on that of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., a personal inspiration of Gueswel, for the restaurant. Both items were made from wood and metal. Gueswel has continued to design and build the art and chairs for all subsequent Chipotle restaurants.[229]
Most Chipotle locations display a photograph of the original restaurant, which is near the University of Denver campus on Evans Avenue.[20] Instead of a photograph of itself, the original location has a photograph of the Dolly Madison Ice Cream that previously occupied the location. In 2010, Chipotle began opening "A Model" restaurants, which are smaller concept locations, citing the lower costs of development and occupancy.[230] Chipotle uses environmentally friendly packaging, with bowls made from recycled newsprint, unbleached tray liners, and napkins and cups made from postconsumer waste.[231]
Chipotle's architectural design team incorporates the principles of sustainable architecture in their projects. The "green" restaurant in Gurnee, Illinois features an on-site six kilowatt wind turbine, which generates about 10% of the restaurant's electrical needs. The Gurnee restaurant has received Platinum level LEED certification from U.S. Green Building Council.[232] A restaurant in Tulsa, Oklahoma, uses recycled drywall, low-VOC paint, and energy-efficient appliances.[233] A Chipotle restaurant in Austin, Texas was the first to receive a four-star rating from the city's Green Building Program.[234] Additionally, Chipotle has made arrangements to add solar panels to 75 of its restaurants.[232] Chipotle has contracted to clean its stores in New York City and Long Island, with "plant-based, environmentally preferable cleaning supplies and technologies." The cleansers are readily biodegradable and non-toxic to humans or aquatic life.[235]
Chipotle was the defendant in a lawsuit for failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Maurizio Antoninetti, a customer who used a wheelchair, claimed he was denied the "Chipotle Experience", because he was unable to see the food preparation. The case against the company was upheld in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,[236] and the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear Chipotle's appeal, leaving the Ninth Circuit's ruling intact.[237] Chipotle has "an official disability policy of bringing ingredients to the tables of diners with disabilities and doing tableside preparation." Chipotle is retrofitting restaurants affected by the ruling, replacing the walls in front of the food preparation area with lower ones or transparent panels. They are incorporating the new design elements into new restaurants.[236] The case was one of over twenty ADA-related lawsuits filed by Antoninetti, who died in 2011.[236][238]
Other restaurant units[edit]

Pizzeria Locale is a fast casual pizza restaurant formed as a partnership with Pizzeria Locale, a full-service pizza restaurant in Boulder, Colorado. The original Pizzeria Locale owners, Bobby Stuckey and Lachlan Mackinnon-Patterson, would continue to own their original location while Chipotle would increase its stake in the chain over time.[48] As of February 2017, the chain has seven locations.[51]
Tasty Made is a burger restaurant concept that Chipotle first opened in Lancaster, Ohio in October 2016.[239] On July 29, 2016, the company announced the opening of its first Tasty Made burger restaurant in the fall. The first location was revealed to be in Lancaster, Ohio. Ohio was selected as culinary manager Nate Appleman and national training director David Chrisman are both from the state and helped design the concept.[240] Tasty Made was announced to have a focused menu like early burger restaurants which were limited to burgers, fries and milkshakes.[51] Chipotle had trademarked Better Burger earlier in the year.


Defunct


Soul Daddy was a soul food fast casual restaurant that was owned by ANGR Holdings, LLC, and was managed by Chipotle after purchasing Ellis' stake in the company. The restaurant had three locations that had operated for less than 5 weeks in 2011 before closing.[241]
ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen was an Asian fast-casual concept restaurant that was opened by Chipotle in September 2011.[45] The company said that the new restaurant "would follow the Chipotle service format and its focus on 'food with integrity' in ingredients."[46] Chipotle's plan was to start with only one store, and see how the restaurant works out before expanding the concept.[47] By July 2016, the chain has 15 restaurants.[51] All ShopHouse locations were closed on March 17, 2017.[242]

Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (/tʃᵻˈpoʊtleɪ/)[6] is an American chain of fast casual restaurants in the United States, United Kingdom,[7] Canada,[8][9] Germany,[10] and France,[11] specializing in tacos and Mission-style[12][13] burritos. Its name derives from chipotle, the Nahuatl name for a smoked and dried jalapeño chili pepper.[14] The company currently trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CMG.[15]
The company has released a mission statement called Food with Integrity, which highlights its efforts in using naturally-grown ingredients,[6] and serves more naturally raised meat than any other restaurant chain.[16] Chipotle is one of the first chains of fast casual dining establishments.[17] Competitors in the fast-casual Mexican market include Qdoba Mexican Grill, Moe's Southwest Grill, Rubio's Coastal Grill, Pancheros Mexican Grill, Freebirds World Burrito, and Baja Fresh.[18]
Founded by Steve Ells on July 13, 1993. Chipotle had 16 restaurants (all in Colorado) when McDonald's Corporation became a major investor in 1998. By the time McDonald's fully divested itself from Chipotle in 2006,[19] the chain had grown to over 500 locations.
With more than 2,000 locations,[2] Chipotle had a net income of US$475.6 million and a staff of more than 45,000 employees in 2015.[2]

History[edit]




The first Chipotle, near the campus of the University of Denver


Founder Steve Ells attended the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York. Afterward, he became a line cook for Jeremiah Tower at Stars in San Francisco.[20] There, Ells observed the popularity of the taquerías and San Francisco burritos in the Mission District. In 1993, Ells took what he learned in San Francisco[21] and opened the first Chipotle Mexican Grill in Denver, Colorado, in a former Dolly Madison Ice Cream store at 1644 East Evans Avenue,[22] near the University of Denver campus, using an $85,000 loan from his father.[19] Ells and his father calculated that the store would need to sell 107 burritos per day to be profitable. After one month, the original restaurant was selling over 1,000 burritos a day.[15] The second store opened in 1995 using Chipotle's cash flow, and the third was opened using an SBA loan. To fund more growth, Ells' father invested $1.5 million. Afterwards, Ells created a board of directors and business plan, raising an additional $1.8 million for the company.[23] Ells had originally planned to use funds from the first Chipotle to open a fine-dining restaurant, but instead focused on Chipotle Mexican Grill when the restaurants saw success.[24][25]
In 1998, the first restaurant outside of Colorado opened in Kansas City, Missouri.[26] The company opened its first location in Minnesota by opening near the campus of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis in March 1999.[27]
In 1998, McDonald's made an initial minority investment in the company. By 2001, the company had grown to be Chipotle's largest investor.[19] The investment from McDonald's allowed the firm to quickly expand, from 16 restaurants in 1998 to over 500 by 2005.[28] On January 26, 2006, Chipotle made its initial public offering (IPO) after increasing the share price twice due to high pre-IPO demand. In its first day as a public company, the stock rose exactly 100%, resulting in the best U.S.-based IPO in six years, and the second-best IPO for a restaurant after Boston Market. The money from the offering was then used to fund new store growth.[29]
In October 2006, McDonald's fully divested from Chipotle.[30] This was part of a larger initiative for McDonald's to divest all of its non-core business restaurants — Chipotle, Donatos Pizza, and Boston Market — so that it could focus on the main McDonald's chain.[31] McDonald's invested approximately $360 million into Chipotle, and took out $1.5 billion.[23] McDonald's had attempted to get Chipotle to add drive-through windows and a breakfast menu, which Ells resisted.[32][33] In 2008, Chipotle opened its first location outside of the United States in Toronto.[9]
In a list of fastest-growing restaurant chains in 2009, Chipotle was ranked eighth, based on increases in U.S. sales over the past year,[34] and in 2010 Chipotle was ranked third.[35] Consumer Reports ranked Chipotle as the best Mexican fast-food chain in 2011.[36] The company serves approximately 750,000 customers per day.[37]
In December 2010, Chipotle hired chef Nate Appleman to develop new cuisine. Appleman has won Rising Star Chef from the James Beard Foundation, was named "Best New Chef" by Food & Wine magazine, and competed on The Next Iron Chef.[38]
In 2010, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) audited Chipotle's Minneapolis restaurants, and found that some employees had been hired using fraudulent documents. In December, Chipotle fired 450 employees from its Minneapolis restaurants as a result of the audit, resulting in protests by local groups.[39][40] In February 2011, ICE expanded the audit to include 60 restaurants in Virginia and Washington, D.C.[41] which resulted in 40 workers being fired. In April 2011, the criminal division of the Attorney General's office in Washington, D.C., joined the case, and ICE agents began interviewing employees at 20 to 25 restaurants in other locations, such as Los Angeles and Atlanta.[42] In response to the government investigations, Chipotle hired former director of ICE Julie Myers Wood and high-profile attorneys Robert Luskin and Gregory B. Craig.[43]
Other restaurant expansion[edit]
In 2011, Steve Ells was a judge for the TV show America's Next Great Restaurant and investor of ANGR Holdings, the company that will be running the winning concept's restaurants. Chipotle has agreed to purchase Ells' investment in ANGR at his cost, provide support for ANGR operations, and invest a total of $2.3 million in cash contributions.[44]
In September 2011, Chipotle opened an Asian fast-casual concept restaurant named ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen in Washington, D.C.[45] The company has said the new restaurant "would follow the Chipotle service format and its focus on 'food with integrity' in ingredients."[46] Chipotle's plan was to start with only one store, and see how the restaurant works out before expanding the concept.[47]
On December 18, 2013, the company revealed that it had opened its first fast-food pizza chain in Denver back in May 2013. According to Associated Press, Chipotle partnered with a local full-service restaurant called Pizzeria Locale to create a fast-food version of the eatery, keeping its name. The company plans to open at least two more pizzerias in the Denver area.[48]
In April 2014, Chipotle announced an increase in menu prices for the first time in nearly three years, due to increasing costs for steak, avocados, and cheese. The price increase was expected to be rolled out from the end of second quarter of 2014 through the end of the third quarter.[49] In late 2015, Chipotle expanded its mobile strategy through delivery partnerships with tech startups like Tapingo, a delivery service that targets college campuses.[50]
On July 29, 2016, the company announced the opening of its first Tasty Made burger restaurant in the fall. Chipotle was still dealing with the various virus outbreaks with additional marketing. The company was also reducing the number of new stores for the year from 235 to 220.[51]
International[edit]




The second Chipotle Mexican Grill location in London, located on Baker Street


According to an article in The Motley Fool, Chipotle had 17 locations outside of the United States by October 2014 with the majority in Canada, and the UK was in the process of opening more locations.[52] The rate of overseas expansion was slower than expected.[53] Many of the press reviewers thought that the food was overpriced for their area.[11][54]
As of 2017 there are 26 locations outside of the United States with 11 locations in Canada (Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver), 6 locations in The United Kingdom (London), 3 in France (Paris), and 1 in Germany (Frankfurt).[better source needed][2] [55]
Canada[edit]
In August 2008, Chipotle opened its first location outside of the United States in Toronto.[9] The second location in Toronto–and in all of Canada–was not opened until 2010.[53]
The first Canadian location outside of the Toronto area was opened in Vancouver in December 2012.[56] A second Vancouver-area location was opened in Burnaby in October 2014[57] followed by a third in Surrey in January 2016[58] and a fourth in Langley in October 2016.[59]
The first location in the nation's capital of Ottawa was opened in February 2017 at the Rideau Centre.[60]
United Kingdom[edit]
Chipotle expanded to Europe with the first European restaurant opening in May 2010 in London.[7][61][62] A second location open in London in September 2011.[63] The following year, three additional locations were quickly opened in the London area.[64] After this growth spurt, the rate of further expansion in London slowed greatly with the sixth location appearing in 2013[65] and the seventh in June 2015.[66] Although Chipotle blames the slow growth in the United Kingdom on the British unfamiliarity with Mexican foods,[67] several locally owned burrito chains had opened locations across the United Kingdom during the same interval.[68]
France[edit]
The first location in France opened in Paris in May 2012.[11][69]
Expansion in France was much slower than that in the United Kingdom or Canada, with a second location in Paris opening in 2013[70] and a third location in 2014.[71] At 7,000 square feet, the restaurant at La Défense is, as of 2015[update], the largest Chipotle location in the world, while a typical Chipotle restaurant is usually between 2,200 and 2,500 square feet.[72] A fourth Parisian location was opened in Levallois-Perret in 2015[73] followed by a fifth[74] and a sixth[75] Parisian location in 2016, both in Saint-Germain-des-Prés.
Germany[edit]
The first and, so far, only location in Germany opened in Frankfurt in August 2013.[10][54]
Corporate management[edit]
Chipotle's team includes a residing corporate office of managers and its board of directors. Members of both teams are appointed to serve on committees: audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance.
The top management team consists of the Chief Executive Officers, Steve Ells; the Chief Financial Officer, Jack R. Hartung; the Chief Marketing and Development Officer, Mark Crumpacker.[76] The current board of directors consists of: Steve Ells, Patrick Flynn, Albert Baldocchi, Neil Flanzraich, Darlene Friedman, Stephen Gillet, Kimbal Musk and John Charlesworth.[77]
Founder Steve Ells serves as chairman and Chief executive officer,[78] and has a 1.25% stake in the company.[79] The labor-market research firm Glassdoor reported that Steve Ells earned $29 million in 2014, versus a median of $19,000 for Chipotle's workers, making the CEO-to-worker pay ratio 1522:1.[80]
Operation and distribution[edit]
All of Chipotle's restaurants are company-owned, rather than franchised.[81] As of December 2012[update], 1430 restaurants have since opened throughout the United States and Canada, with locations in 43 states, Ontario, British Columbia, and the District of Columbia.[82][83]
The field team are the employees who work closely with but not directly within specific restaurants. The field support system includes apprentice team leaders (step up from restaurateurs), team leaders or area managers, team directors and regional directors (not atypical for them to oversee more than fifty locations).[84] Because Chipotle does not franchise, all restaurants are corporately owned. Thus, whenever Chipotle is in the process of launching a new location, the field team hires a new general manager and trains them at a current location so that they will be ready for the new location when it opens for business. The corporate office takes care of finding and funding new locations as well.[85]
Menu[edit]




A Chipotle restaurant in Brandon, Florida, having the typical service-line layout with menu above


Chipotle's menu consists of four items: burritos, bowls, tacos, and salads. The price of each item is based on the choice of chicken, pork carnitas, barbacoa, steak, tofu-based "sofritas",[86][87] chorizo (chicken and pork), or vegetarian (with guacamole, which would be at an extra charge otherwise). Additional optional toppings are offered free of charge, including: rice, beans, four types of salsa, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce.[88][89] When asked in 2007 about expanding the menu, Steve Ells said, "[I]t's important to keep the menu focused, because if you just do a few things, you can ensure that you do them better than anybody else."[90] Chipotle also offers a children's menu.[91][92] Most restaurants sell beer and margaritas in addition to soft drinks and fruit drinks.[93]
The majority of food is prepared in each restaurant. Some exceptions are the beans and carnitas, which are prepared at a central kitchen in Chicago, Illinois.[94] None of the restaurants have freezers, microwave ovens, or can openers.[95]




Chicken Burrito Bowl


The chain experimented with breakfast foods at two airports in the Washington (D.C.) metropolitan area but decided against expanding the menu in that direction.[96][97][98] Starting in 2009, selected restaurants had offered a pozole soup,[99][100][101] which has since been discontinued.
In June 2015, Chipotle began test marketing a pork and chicken chorizo-type sausage as a new protein option at selected locations in the Kansas City area.[102][103][104] Some food writers have expressed their health related concerns over the protein's relatively high sodium content since a 4-ounce serving contains 293 calories and 803 milligrams of sodium[105] while the American Heart Association’s recommended daily amount is less than 1,500 milligrams of sodium.[106] In contrast, the protein options with next highest sodium contents are Barbacoa with 530 milligrams and sofritas with 555 milligrams.[105] An earlier version on the Mexican sausage was tested in Denver and New York City in 2011,[107] but that test was terminated when that version of the sausage was perceived as looking too greasy.[108] As of fall 2016, chorizo is available nationwide.
Chipotle accepts fax orders, and in 2005 the company added the ability to order online from their website. For both online and fax orders, customers proceed to the front of the line to pay for pre-ordered food.[109] In 2009, Chipotle released an app for the iPhone that allows users to find nearby Chipotle locations, place an order, and prepay with a credit card.[110] In 2013, Chipotle released an Android app that allows users to locate nearby Chipotle locations, place an order, prepay with a credit or gift card, and access favorites and recent orders.[111][112]
Nutrition[edit]
In 2003, a Center for Science in the Public Interest report stated that Chipotle's burritos contain over 1,000 calories, which is nearly equivalent to two meals' worth of food.[113][114] MSNBC Health.com placed the burritos on their list of the "20 Worst Foods in America" because of their high caloric content and high sodium.[115] When a burrito with carnitas, rice, vegetables, cheese, guacamole, and salsa was compared with a typical Big Mac, the burrito had more fat, cholesterol, carbohydrates, and sodium than the Big Mac, but it also had more protein and fiber.[116] The restaurant has also received praise – Health.com included the restaurant in its list of the "Healthiest Fast Food Restaurants".[117]
Chipotle's vegetarian options include rice, black beans, fajita vegetables (onions and bell peppers), salsa, guacamole and cheese.[118] All items other than the meats, cheese, sour cream, and honey vinaigrette dressing are vegan.[118] As of late 2013, Chipotle developed a new cooking strategy for the pinto beans, eliminating the bacon and making them vegetarian and vegan-friendly.[119] The cheese is processed with vegetable-based rennet in order to be suitable for vegetarians.[118] In April 2010, Chipotle began testing a vegan "Garden Blend" option, which is a plant-based meat alternative marinated in chipotle adobo, at six locations in the U.S.[120][121] The flour tortillas used for the burritos and soft tacos are the only items that contain gluten.[118]
Food sourcing[edit]
In 1999, while looking for ways to improve the taste of the carnitas,[20] Steve Ells was prompted by an article written by Edward Behr to visit Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs).[122] Ells found the CAFOs "horrific", and began sourcing from open-range pork suppliers. This caused an increase in both the price and the sales of the carnitas burritos.[61]
In 2001, Chipotle released a mission statement called Food With Integrity, which highlighted Chipotle's efforts to increase their use of naturally raised meat, organic produce, and dairy without added hormones.[6] Chipotle only uses the leg and thigh meat from its chickens; the breast meat is sold to Panera Bread.[123]




Customers at a Chipotle restaurant in Fredericksburg, Virginia


Founder Steve Ells has testified before the United States Congress in support of the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act, which aims to reduce the amount of antibiotics given to farm animals.[61][124]
Since 2006, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW), a Floridian farmworker organization, has protested Chipotle’s refusal to sign a Fair Food agreement, which would commit the restaurant chain to pay a penny-per-pound premium on its Florida tomatoes to boost tomato harvesters’ wages, and to only buy Florida tomatoes from growers who comply with the Fair Food Code of Conduct.[125] In 2009, the creators of the documentary film Food, Inc. (along with 31 other leaders in the sustainable food movement) signed an open letter of support for the CIW’s campaign, stating that, “If Chipotle is sincere in its wishes to reform its supply chain, the time has come to work with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers as a true partner in the protection of farmworkers rights.”[126] In September 2009, Chipotle announced that it would sidestep partnership with the CIW and instead work directly with East Coast Growers and Packers to increase wages for its tomato pickers.[127] CEO Steve Ells has framed the dispute as a fundamental issue of control, stating that, “the CIW wants us to sign a contract that would let them control Chipotle's decisions regarding food in the future."[128] In October 2012, Chipotle Mexican Grill signed an agreement with the CIW and became the 11th company to join the organization's Fair Food Program.[129]
In January 2015, Chipotle pulled carnitas from its menu in a third of its restaurants; company officials cited animal welfare problems at one of the suppliers, found during a regular audit, as the reason.[130] Subsequently, a false rumor spread online claiming it was done to appease Muslims who consider pork to be unclean, leading to some protests on social media.[131] The company still uses antibiotic-free and hormone-free steak in its restaurants, despite being briefly forced to "serve beef that is not naturally raised" during the summer of 2013, posting an in-store notice each time that occurred.[132] Roberto Ferdman of The Washington Post opined that Chipotle's stated mission to sell "food with integrity" may be "untenable" if meat producers continue to breach Chipotle's ethical standards.[130]
Also in 2015, Chipotle stopped using genetically modified corn and soy beans in their foods, claiming to be the first nationwide restaurant to cook completely GMO free.[133] This was done in response to increasing consumer demand for GMO free products.
Food safety[edit]

 "How Chipotle made hundreds of people barf". Vox report dated January 6, 2016, explaining Chipotle's "food safety crisis".


Since 2008, a former Kansas State University food safety professor has accused Chipotle of confusing the public by using such terms as "naturally raised meats", "organic ingredients", and "locally sourced" and trying to equate those terms with food safety.[134] In rebuttal, a Chipotle spokesperson told The Daily Beast that "all of our practices have always been very much within industry norms. It's important to note that restaurant practices are regulated by health codes, and restaurants are routinely inspected by health officials. Everything we have done in our supply chain and in our restaurants has been within industry norms."[134] Yet, FiveThirtyEight pointed out that the 2015 norovirus outbreak appears to be unusual[135] and others are criticizing their food sourcing or handling practices.[136][137] MarketWatch wrote that the result of all of these outbreaks will be to force Chipotle to obtain their produce from larger corporate farms that can afford the more extensive microbial food-safety testing programs and to process vegetables at centralized locations instead of at the individual stores, both of which are industry-standard practices that the company had previously criticized.[138] The New York Times implied that the company's insistence on maintaining its long standing rhetoric about "food integrity" seemed to be quite opposite with the realities of recent current events and made it appear that the management was just ignoring their current problems.[139] It also has been pointed out that Chipotle's current record-keeping system is actually hindering the health authorities' investigation in locating the sources of the various infections.[139]
A writer for the magazine Popular Science pointed out that Chipotle had publicly acknowledged that they "may be at a higher risk for food-borne illness outbreaks than some competitors due to our use of fresh produce and meats rather than frozen, and our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation."[140][141][142] Henry I. Miller, a medical researcher and columnist and the founding director of the FDA's Office of Biotechnology, asked: "One wonders whether Chipotle’s "traditional methods" include employees' neglecting to wash their hands before preparing food, which is how norovirus is usually spread. And the fresh versus frozen dichotomy is nothing more than a snow-job. Freezing E. coli-contaminated food does not kill the pathogens; it preserves them."[143] Describing food poisoning outbreaks as "something of a Chipotle trademark; the recent ones are the fourth and fifth this year [2015], one of which was not disclosed to the public", Miller notes that "a particularly worrisome aspect of the company's serial deficiencies is that there have been at least three unrelated pathogens in the outbreaks – Salmonella and E. coli bacteria and norovirus. In other words, there has been more than a single glitch; suppliers and employees have found a variety of ways to contaminate what Chipotle cavalierly sells (at premium prices) to its customers."[143]
A writer for the North Carolina newspaper The News & Observer called Chipotle's "food with integrity" a "lucrative farce" and a "marketing ploy" by pointing out that organic food is "often grown with manure (an 'all-natural' fertilizer), which can certainly increase the risks of accidentally spreading fecal bacteria like E. coli."[144]
In December 2015, Seattle health officials closed a Seattle-area Chipotle for a day after it had repeatedly had small numbers of violations during recent consecutive inspections that previously would not have generated a closure order.[145] On December 10, 2015, CEO Steve Ells released a press statement apologizing for 2015 outbreaks and promised changes to minimize the risks of future outbreaks.[146]
March 2008 hepatitis outbreak[edit]
In March and April 2008, the Community Epidemiology Branch of the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency traced a hepatitis A outbreak in San Diego County to a single Chipotle restaurant located in La Mesa, California in which 22 customers were infected with the virus.[147][148]
April 2008 norovirus outbreak[edit]
In 2008, Chipotle was implicated in a norovirus outbreak in Kent, Ohio, where over 400 people became ill after eating at a Chipotle restaurant.[149] Officials at the Ohio Department of Health said that the outbreak was caused by Norovirus Genotype G2.[150] Many of the victims were students at Kent State University.[151] The initial source of the outbreak was never found.
February 2009 Campylobacter jejuni outbreak[edit]
In 2009, an investigation by the Minnesota Department of Health traced an outbreak of campylobacteriosis to a Chipotle Mexican Grill in Apple Valley, Minnesota.[152][153][154] The investigation found that chicken was sometimes served undercooked by the restaurant and determined that lettuce which had been cross-contaminated with raw or undercooked chicken was the vector for the outbreak.[155][156][third-party source needed]
July 2015 E. coli outbreak[edit]
In early November 2015, The Oregonian reported that there was a little-known E. coli outbreak that had occurred earlier in July in which five persons were infected with the O157:H7 strain of E. coli. The outbreak was traced to a single Chipotle location in Seattle and that the incident was not publicized at that time.[157][158] Seattle public health officials defended their actions at that time by saying that the outbreak was over by the time they made an association with Chipotle. Health officials were unable to trace the source of the July outbreak and said that the cause of the July outbreak is unrelated to the October/November outbreak.[157]
August 2015 norovirus outbreak[edit]
Another norovirus outbreak was confirmed to have occurred in August 2015 at a Simi Valley, California location in which 80 customers and 18 employees reported becoming ill.[159][160] Ventura County health inspectors found various health violations during two inspections following the outbreak report.[161] Despite those violations, the county health officials did not close the restaurant and allowed it to continue to operate.[159] In a January 2016 article, the New York Times reported that the number of victims involved in the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak was actually 207, twice the number that was reported earlier.[162]
In an unusual move, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California in conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration has gotten a federal grand jury to issue a subpoena in January 2016 as part of a criminal investigation seeking documents and information from Chipotle concerning the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak.[162][163] As of January 2016[update], it is too early to tell which organization is the actual target of the investigation. In most cases involving norovirus outbreaks that involved a single location, state and/or local authorities are the usual jurisdiction responsible in the investigation and prosecution of those type of cases. However, Ventura County officials had been criticized for their handling of parts of their investigation, and for allowing the restaurant to continue to operate after finding health violations during consecutive inspections.
Less than two weeks later, a federal class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California claiming that Chipotle knowingly allowed an ill kitchen manager to work for two days before sending that person home. Then, the restaurant actively deep-cleaned the restaurant to remove all traces of contamination prior to notifying the Ventura County Environmental Health Division of the existing outbreak, hindering their investigation. The lawsuit also claimed that the number of known victims was as high as 234 and estimates that the number of meals that the infected employee may have come in contact with could be as high 3,000.[164][165][166]
August 2015 Salmonella outbreak[edit]
At almost the same time as the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak, Minnesota health officials confirmed a Salmonella outbreak that affected 17 Minneapolis-area Chipotle restaurants in mid-August 2015. The source of the outbreak was traced back to contaminated tomatoes that were grown in Mexico.[167][168] The Minnesota Department of Health reported that samples from 45 victims were tested and found that their illness was caused by the Salmonella Newport bacterium as determined by DNA profiling.[169] Later, the state officials reported that the total of persons who became infected was increased to 64 and the number Chipotle locations in which they had acquired the bacterium was increased to 22, all located within the state of Minnesota.[170]
October 2015 E. coli outbreak[edit]
In October 2015, at least 22 persons were reported to have gotten sick after eating at several different Chipotle locations in the states of Washington and Oregon. At that time, an epidemiologist for the Washington Health Department said the culprit appeared to be a Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli bacterium, but they were still waiting the outcome of several laboratory tests before they can give a definitive result.[171][172][173] As a precaution, Chipotle had closed 43 stores in Washington and Oregon pending the results and recommendations of the involved health authorities. On November 5, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had reported that the number of persons reported ill had risen to 40 known cases and that the bacteria samples taken from 7 infected persons in Washington and 3 persons in Oregon states were confirmed to be infected by the same strain of E. coli, the Shiga toxin-producing STEC O26 strain, as determined by DNA profiling.[174] At least 12 persons required hospitalization, but no fatalities. As of November 2015, Health authorities were still trying to trace the exact source of the bacterial contamination, but suspected fresh produce.[175]
On November 12, the CDC increased the number of known cases to 50, the number of persons requiring hospitalization to 14, and the number of DNA fingerprint confirmations to 33.[176] Through a match via Pulsenet, the DNA fingerprint also matched a recent case in Minnesota, but the ill person did not eat at Chipotle. The source of the bacteria infection still had not yet been determined at the time of the report released by the CDC and the CDC is trying to use the more definitive, but more time consuming whole genome sequencing procedure to see if they are able to determine the relationships between all of the STEC O26 cases. In the meantime, Chipotle reopened the closed restaurants on November 11 after disposing all of the food within the closed facilities and deep cleaning those facilities.[177]
On November 20, the CDC reported that the number of STEC O26 cases, as determined by DNA fingerprinting, had increased to 45 with 16 persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to six.[178] Besides Oregon and Washington, new cases were reported in the states of Minnesota, California, New York, and Ohio.[179] 43 out of 45 of the affected individuals had reported that they had eaten at a Chipotle in the week before they had become sick.
On December 4, the CDC reported that the number of STEC O26 cases, as determined by DNA fingerprinting, had increased to 52 with 20 persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to nine.[180] New cases were reported in the states of California (1), Illinois (1), Maryland (1), Ohio (2), Pennsylvania (1), and Washington (1).[181]
The price of shares for Chipotle stock dropped a further 12% immediately after the CDC had issued their update on November 20.[182] Share prices had been dropping since the initial announcement of the E. coli outbreak in late October with investors unsure if the drop in share prices just a temporary aberration and that Chipotle management is handling the incident as well as they could. Chipotle has since hired a consultant to improve their food safety program and have their program reviewed by both the CDC and FDA.[183]
On February 1, 2016, the CDC official closed their investigations on the larger E. coli that started in Pacific Northwest in October 2015 and also the smaller outbreak that started in Kansas and Oklahoma in November since no new cases were reported since December 1.[184] In their final report, the CDC stated that 55 persons in 11 states were infected with the same strain of STEC O26 during the major outbreak with 21 of those persons requiring hospitalization. The five persons infected in the later outbreak were made ill by a generically different strain of STEC O26. The CDC also reported that federal and local health and food safety authorities were unable to detect traces of the microorganisms in any of the food samples taken from the suspected restaurants or from their supply chain. The CDC, FDA, and the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service were unable to determine a point source that was in common in the meals that were consumed by all the victims since some of the restaurants were located far apart and had obtained some of their ingredients from different suppliers while other consumers of the suspected suppliers were not affected.
November 2015 E. coli cases[edit]
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on December 21 that five more people became ill after eating at two Chipotle restaurants located in Kansas and Oklahoma in late November. Preliminary DNA fingerprinting results appear to indicated that the newer cases were caused by a different strain of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O26. Scientists are waiting for the results of the more definitive whole genome sequencing analyses to determine if the organisms responsible for this outbreak are genetically related to the E. coli that are responsible for causing the outbreak that had started in Oregon and Washington in late October and thus an extension of that outbreak. The agency has not yet determined which food is responsible for the outbreak.[185] The Food and Drug Administration reported that they are trying to determine how the bacteria in these cases, along with the earlier Oregon, Washington, and other multi-state cases, might have been propagated through the food supply chain.[186]
December 2015 norovirus outbreak[edit]




The closed restaurant on December 16, 2015


In December 2015, eighty students at Boston College were sickened after eating at a single Chipotle restaurant. Affected students had been tested for both E. coli and norovirus in order to determine the cause of the illnesses.[187] Although it would take as long as two days before the results of more definitive tests became known, public health investigators reported that preliminary tests pointed to the presence of norovirus.[188] The health inspectors for the City of Boston had since closed this particular location on December 7 for a number of health violations that included maintaining meats at a too low of a temperature on the serving line and for allowing a sick employee to work at the time of the inspection.[189]
On December 10, officials from the Boston Public Health Commission reported that tests had identified a single strain of norovirus that is responsible for this particular outbreak.[190] Boston Globe reported on December 10 that 141 persons were reported to have gotten ill and that some of the newer victims had not visited Chipotle before contracting the virus[191] and most likely became infected by being in close proximity to someone who had gotten ill at Chipotle, such as a roommate or dorm-mate.[190] Boston authorities traced the cause of the outbreak to a sick employee who was allowed to work on the day of the outbreak. Chipotle has since fired the employee and also the manager who knowingly allowed the ill worker to complete his shift instead of following health codes.[192]
Consequences[edit]
On February 8, 2016, Chipotle closed all of its eateries nationwide for a few hours during the morning for an all-staff meeting on food safety.[193] The company hired a new head of food safety, who instituted changes including having all employees wash hands every half hour, having two employees verify that produce like onions, jalapeños and avocados have been immersed in hot water for five seconds to kill germs on their exteriors, and using Pascalization to pre-treat food ingredients.[194]
Since the series of food-poisoning outbreaks in 2015 lowered trust in the product, Chipotle has tried to lure back its customers with free food and heavier advertising. Same-store sales increased 17.8% percent in the first quarter of 2017.[195]

Lawsuit[edit]
In November 2016, three men filed a class-action lawsuit against Chipotle alleging that a burrito was listed as containing only 300 calories, when in fact it contained more. They are seeking "unspecified damages and for an injunction against the company to prevent it from posting what it calls misleading information on its food."[196][197][198]
Advertising and publicity[edit]




People line up outside a Chipotle in East Lansing, Michigan during a "Free Burrito Day"


In the past, Chipotle mainly relied on billboards, radio ads, and word of mouth to advertise.[30] In 2012, Chipotle aired its first nationally televised commercial during the 54th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony.[199] In 2010, the company initiated an ad campaign that mocks advice given to Chipotle by advertising agencies.[200] Chipotle has run many promotions giving out free food to potential customers, especially when opening a new store. Stores also give out free burritos on certain holidays; for instance, on Halloween, some locations have had promotions in which free burritos are given to people who come dressed as a burrito. Chipotle gave away free burritos to reporters during the 1997 trial of Timothy McVeigh, which took place in Chipotle's hometown of Denver.[201] In addition, stores offered free burritos to those displaced by Hurricane Katrina.[202] Chipotle received attention when Ozzy Osbourne's reality show The Osbournes featured the company's burritos heavily.[29] For Halloween 2010, Chipotle announced that customers dressed as a processed food product would receive a burrito for $2. The event was part of a $1 million fundraiser for Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution called "Boorito 2010: The Horrors of Processed Food."[203] For "Boorito 2011", customers dressed in costumes "inspired by family farms" will receive a menu item for $2, with proceeds from the promotion going to The Chipotle Cultivate Foundation and Farm Aid. The promotion is aimed to increase awareness of family farms.[204] Also in support of family farms, Chipotle released music videos of Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Willie Nelson.[205] On September 12, 2013, Chipotle released an animated short called The Scarecrow, with a companion mobile video game; both feature a narrative heavily critical of industrial farming, but little in the way of direct marketing for the chain.[206] The short features a cover of "Pure Imagination" from Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, sung by Fiona Apple.[207] It was named one of the worst advertisements of 2013 by The Wall Street Journal.[208]
In 2011, Chipotle created the "Farm Team", which is a rewards program available only by invitation from restaurant managers. The Farm Team members have access to a special Chipotle website, where members can earn rewards, i.e. free food and T-shirts. The site offers members to, "learn where Chipotle’s food comes from, take quizzes and polls, play games and watch videos about the company".[209] In April 2014, the Farm Team program was shut down.[210]
Chipotle sponsors Team Garmin-Barracuda (formerly Team Garmin-Chipotle, Team Garmin-Slipstream, Team Garmin-Transitions and Team Garmin-Cervélo) of the International Cycling Union,[211][212] and is an official team partner of the Boston Celtics,[213] and the Boston Bruins.[214] In June 2009, Chipotle sponsored free screenings of Food, Inc., a film that criticizes the corporate food industry. Founder Steve Ells stated that he hoped the film would make customers appreciate Chipotle's Food With Integrity policy.[215] From May until September 2009, Chipotle ran a contest on mychipotle.com, a microsite which had a competition for the best user-created audio and video presentations about different combinations of ingredients.[216][217] In July 2010, Chipotle began a campaign to support healthier lunch alternatives for students, in which money will be donated to The Lunch Box program based on how many spam E-mails consumers forward to a company E-mail address.[218] For Chipotle's 18 year anniversary, the company began wrapping its burritos in gold foil as part of a larger promotion to draw attention to its Food With Integrity mantra.[219] Also as part of the gold foil campaign, Chipotle is offering prizes for customer-created pictures of items wrapped in gold foil. Chipotle hired comedian Amy Sedaris to create a comedic how-to video on wrapping with gold foil, and spread the video using Twitter.[220] In March 2013, Chipotle pulled its sponsorship of a Boy Scouts of America event, citing that organization's ban on LGBT members.[221]




Cup and bag from the "Cultivating Thought" series, featuring the work of Paulo Coelho and Augusten Burroughs


On December 16, 2015, Chipotle ran full page ads in both The Boston Globe and Boston Herald apologizing for the recent norovirus outbreak linked to Chipotle's Cleveland Circle location. The ad, containing a letter by Chipotle founder and co-CEO Steve Ells, affirmed the company's commitment to food safety.[222]
On March 14, 2016, a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) administrative law judge concluded that Chipotle’s social media policy, and more specifically its application towards an employee who posted tweets regarding wages and working conditions, violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).[223] A former Chipotle employee in Havertown, Pennsylvania, wrote a series of tweets from his personal account about hourly workers being required to work on snow days. Chipotle instructed the employee to delete the tweets. The NLRB judge determined that Chipotle’s request to delete the tweets violated the NLRA even though the employee was not disciplined as a result of his tweets.[224]
Architecture[edit]




The exterior of a Chipotle in Durham, North Carolina


Architecturally, all Chipotle restaurants are built using most of the same materials (plywood, corrugated metal, stainless steel, exposed ductwork), although each store is unique.[20][225] The interiors have been described as having an "industrial, sheet metal look".[226] Chipotle has built restaurants using white ceramic tile instead of stainless steel.[227] It costs the company approximately $850,000 to open a new restaurant.[228] When the first Chipotle opened, Steve Ells asked his friend, sculptor Bruce Gueswel, to design the chairs and a styled Mayan king whose face was loosely based on that of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., a personal inspiration of Gueswel, for the restaurant. Both items were made from wood and metal. Gueswel has continued to design and build the art and chairs for all subsequent Chipotle restaurants.[229]
Most Chipotle locations display a photograph of the original restaurant, which is near the University of Denver campus on Evans Avenue.[20] Instead of a photograph of itself, the original location has a photograph of the Dolly Madison Ice Cream that previously occupied the location. In 2010, Chipotle began opening "A Model" restaurants, which are smaller concept locations, citing the lower costs of development and occupancy.[230] Chipotle uses environmentally friendly packaging, with bowls made from recycled newsprint, unbleached tray liners, and napkins and cups made from postconsumer waste.[231]
Chipotle's architectural design team incorporates the principles of sustainable architecture in their projects. The "green" restaurant in Gurnee, Illinois features an on-site six kilowatt wind turbine, which generates about 10% of the restaurant's electrical needs. The Gurnee restaurant has received Platinum level LEED certification from U.S. Green Building Council.[232] A restaurant in Tulsa, Oklahoma, uses recycled drywall, low-VOC paint, and energy-efficient appliances.[233] A Chipotle restaurant in Austin, Texas was the first to receive a four-star rating from the city's Green Building Program.[234] Additionally, Chipotle has made arrangements to add solar panels to 75 of its restaurants.[232] Chipotle has contracted to clean its stores in New York City and Long Island, with "plant-based, environmentally preferable cleaning supplies and technologies." The cleansers are readily biodegradable and non-toxic to humans or aquatic life.[235]
Chipotle was the defendant in a lawsuit for failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Maurizio Antoninetti, a customer who used a wheelchair, claimed he was denied the "Chipotle Experience", because he was unable to see the food preparation. The case against the company was upheld in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,[236] and the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear Chipotle's appeal, leaving the Ninth Circuit's ruling intact.[237] Chipotle has "an official disability policy of bringing ingredients to the tables of diners with disabilities and doing tableside preparation." Chipotle is retrofitting restaurants affected by the ruling, replacing the walls in front of the food preparation area with lower ones or transparent panels. They are incorporating the new design elements into new restaurants.[236] The case was one of over twenty ADA-related lawsuits filed by Antoninetti, who died in 2011.[236][238]
Other restaurant units[edit]

Pizzeria Locale is a fast casual pizza restaurant formed as a partnership with Pizzeria Locale, a full-service pizza restaurant in Boulder, Colorado. The original Pizzeria Locale owners, Bobby Stuckey and Lachlan Mackinnon-Patterson, would continue to own their original location while Chipotle would increase its stake in the chain over time.[48] As of February 2017, the chain has seven locations.[51]
Tasty Made is a burger restaurant concept that Chipotle first opened in Lancaster, Ohio in October 2016.[239] On July 29, 2016, the company announced the opening of its first Tasty Made burger restaurant in the fall. The first location was revealed to be in Lancaster, Ohio. Ohio was selected as culinary manager Nate Appleman and national training director David Chrisman are both from the state and helped design the concept.[240] Tasty Made was announced to have a focused menu like early burger restaurants which were limited to burgers, fries and milkshakes.[51] Chipotle had trademarked Better Burger earlier in the year.


Defunct


Soul Daddy was a soul food fast casual restaurant that was owned by ANGR Holdings, LLC, and was managed by Chipotle after purchasing Ellis' stake in the company. The restaurant had three locations that had operated for less than 5 weeks in 2011 before closing.[241]
ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen was an Asian fast-casual concept restaurant that was opened by Chipotle in September 2011.[45] The company said that the new restaurant "would follow the Chipotle service format and its focus on 'food with integrity' in ingredients."[46] Chipotle's plan was to start with only one store, and see how the restaurant works out before expanding the concept.[47] By July 2016, the chain has 15 restaurants.[51] All ShopHouse locations were closed on March 17, 2017.[242]

Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (/tʃᵻˈpoʊtleɪ/)[6] is an American chain of fast casual restaurants in the United States, United Kingdom,[7] Canada,[8][9] Germany,[10] and France,[11] specializing in tacos and Mission-style[12][13] burritos. Its name derives from chipotle, the Nahuatl name for a smoked and dried jalapeño chili pepper.[14] The company currently trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CMG.[15]
The company has released a mission statement called Food with Integrity, which highlights its efforts in using naturally-grown ingredients,[6] and serves more naturally raised meat than any other restaurant chain.[16] Chipotle is one of the first chains of fast casual dining establishments.[17] Competitors in the fast-casual Mexican market include Qdoba Mexican Grill, Moe's Southwest Grill, Rubio's Coastal Grill, Pancheros Mexican Grill, Freebirds World Burrito, and Baja Fresh.[18]
Founded by Steve Ells on July 13, 1993. Chipotle had 16 restaurants (all in Colorado) when McDonald's Corporation became a major investor in 1998. By the time McDonald's fully divested itself from Chipotle in 2006,[19] the chain had grown to over 500 locations.
With more than 2,000 locations,[2] Chipotle had a net income of US$475.6 million and a staff of more than 45,000 employees in 2015.[2]

History[edit]




The first Chipotle, near the campus of the University of Denver


Founder Steve Ells attended the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York. Afterward, he became a line cook for Jeremiah Tower at Stars in San Francisco.[20] There, Ells observed the popularity of the taquerías and San Francisco burritos in the Mission District. In 1993, Ells took what he learned in San Francisco[21] and opened the first Chipotle Mexican Grill in Denver, Colorado, in a former Dolly Madison Ice Cream store at 1644 East Evans Avenue,[22] near the University of Denver campus, using an $85,000 loan from his father.[19] Ells and his father calculated that the store would need to sell 107 burritos per day to be profitable. After one month, the original restaurant was selling over 1,000 burritos a day.[15] The second store opened in 1995 using Chipotle's cash flow, and the third was opened using an SBA loan. To fund more growth, Ells' father invested $1.5 million. Afterwards, Ells created a board of directors and business plan, raising an additional $1.8 million for the company.[23] Ells had originally planned to use funds from the first Chipotle to open a fine-dining restaurant, but instead focused on Chipotle Mexican Grill when the restaurants saw success.[24][25]
In 1998, the first restaurant outside of Colorado opened in Kansas City, Missouri.[26] The company opened its first location in Minnesota by opening near the campus of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis in March 1999.[27]
In 1998, McDonald's made an initial minority investment in the company. By 2001, the company had grown to be Chipotle's largest investor.[19] The investment from McDonald's allowed the firm to quickly expand, from 16 restaurants in 1998 to over 500 by 2005.[28] On January 26, 2006, Chipotle made its initial public offering (IPO) after increasing the share price twice due to high pre-IPO demand. In its first day as a public company, the stock rose exactly 100%, resulting in the best U.S.-based IPO in six years, and the second-best IPO for a restaurant after Boston Market. The money from the offering was then used to fund new store growth.[29]
In October 2006, McDonald's fully divested from Chipotle.[30] This was part of a larger initiative for McDonald's to divest all of its non-core business restaurants — Chipotle, Donatos Pizza, and Boston Market — so that it could focus on the main McDonald's chain.[31] McDonald's invested approximately $360 million into Chipotle, and took out $1.5 billion.[23] McDonald's had attempted to get Chipotle to add drive-through windows and a breakfast menu, which Ells resisted.[32][33] In 2008, Chipotle opened its first location outside of the United States in Toronto.[9]
In a list of fastest-growing restaurant chains in 2009, Chipotle was ranked eighth, based on increases in U.S. sales over the past year,[34] and in 2010 Chipotle was ranked third.[35] Consumer Reports ranked Chipotle as the best Mexican fast-food chain in 2011.[36] The company serves approximately 750,000 customers per day.[37]
In December 2010, Chipotle hired chef Nate Appleman to develop new cuisine. Appleman has won Rising Star Chef from the James Beard Foundation, was named "Best New Chef" by Food & Wine magazine, and competed on The Next Iron Chef.[38]
In 2010, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) audited Chipotle's Minneapolis restaurants, and found that some employees had been hired using fraudulent documents. In December, Chipotle fired 450 employees from its Minneapolis restaurants as a result of the audit, resulting in protests by local groups.[39][40] In February 2011, ICE expanded the audit to include 60 restaurants in Virginia and Washington, D.C.[41] which resulted in 40 workers being fired. In April 2011, the criminal division of the Attorney General's office in Washington, D.C., joined the case, and ICE agents began interviewing employees at 20 to 25 restaurants in other locations, such as Los Angeles and Atlanta.[42] In response to the government investigations, Chipotle hired former director of ICE Julie Myers Wood and high-profile attorneys Robert Luskin and Gregory B. Craig.[43]
Other restaurant expansion[edit]
In 2011, Steve Ells was a judge for the TV show America's Next Great Restaurant and investor of ANGR Holdings, the company that will be running the winning concept's restaurants. Chipotle has agreed to purchase Ells' investment in ANGR at his cost, provide support for ANGR operations, and invest a total of $2.3 million in cash contributions.[44]
In September 2011, Chipotle opened an Asian fast-casual concept restaurant named ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen in Washington, D.C.[45] The company has said the new restaurant "would follow the Chipotle service format and its focus on 'food with integrity' in ingredients."[46] Chipotle's plan was to start with only one store, and see how the restaurant works out before expanding the concept.[47]
On December 18, 2013, the company revealed that it had opened its first fast-food pizza chain in Denver back in May 2013. According to Associated Press, Chipotle partnered with a local full-service restaurant called Pizzeria Locale to create a fast-food version of the eatery, keeping its name. The company plans to open at least two more pizzerias in the Denver area.[48]
In April 2014, Chipotle announced an increase in menu prices for the first time in nearly three years, due to increasing costs for steak, avocados, and cheese. The price increase was expected to be rolled out from the end of second quarter of 2014 through the end of the third quarter.[49] In late 2015, Chipotle expanded its mobile strategy through delivery partnerships with tech startups like Tapingo, a delivery service that targets college campuses.[50]
On July 29, 2016, the company announced the opening of its first Tasty Made burger restaurant in the fall. Chipotle was still dealing with the various virus outbreaks with additional marketing. The company was also reducing the number of new stores for the year from 235 to 220.[51]
International[edit]




The second Chipotle Mexican Grill location in London, located on Baker Street


According to an article in The Motley Fool, Chipotle had 17 locations outside of the United States by October 2014 with the majority in Canada, and the UK was in the process of opening more locations.[52] The rate of overseas expansion was slower than expected.[53] Many of the press reviewers thought that the food was overpriced for their area.[11][54]
As of 2017 there are 26 locations outside of the United States with 11 locations in Canada (Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver), 6 locations in The United Kingdom (London), 3 in France (Paris), and 1 in Germany (Frankfurt).[better source needed][2] [55]
Canada[edit]
In August 2008, Chipotle opened its first location outside of the United States in Toronto.[9] The second location in Toronto–and in all of Canada–was not opened until 2010.[53]
The first Canadian location outside of the Toronto area was opened in Vancouver in December 2012.[56] A second Vancouver-area location was opened in Burnaby in October 2014[57] followed by a third in Surrey in January 2016[58] and a fourth in Langley in October 2016.[59]
The first location in the nation's capital of Ottawa was opened in February 2017 at the Rideau Centre.[60]
United Kingdom[edit]
Chipotle expanded to Europe with the first European restaurant opening in May 2010 in London.[7][61][62] A second location open in London in September 2011.[63] The following year, three additional locations were quickly opened in the London area.[64] After this growth spurt, the rate of further expansion in London slowed greatly with the sixth location appearing in 2013[65] and the seventh in June 2015.[66] Although Chipotle blames the slow growth in the United Kingdom on the British unfamiliarity with Mexican foods,[67] several locally owned burrito chains had opened locations across the United Kingdom during the same interval.[68]
France[edit]
The first location in France opened in Paris in May 2012.[11][69]
Expansion in France was much slower than that in the United Kingdom or Canada, with a second location in Paris opening in 2013[70] and a third location in 2014.[71] At 7,000 square feet, the restaurant at La Défense is, as of 2015[update], the largest Chipotle location in the world, while a typical Chipotle restaurant is usually between 2,200 and 2,500 square feet.[72] A fourth Parisian location was opened in Levallois-Perret in 2015[73] followed by a fifth[74] and a sixth[75] Parisian location in 2016, both in Saint-Germain-des-Prés.
Germany[edit]
The first and, so far, only location in Germany opened in Frankfurt in August 2013.[10][54]
Corporate management[edit]
Chipotle's team includes a residing corporate office of managers and its board of directors. Members of both teams are appointed to serve on committees: audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance.
The top management team consists of the Chief Executive Officers, Steve Ells; the Chief Financial Officer, Jack R. Hartung; the Chief Marketing and Development Officer, Mark Crumpacker.[76] The current board of directors consists of: Steve Ells, Patrick Flynn, Albert Baldocchi, Neil Flanzraich, Darlene Friedman, Stephen Gillet, Kimbal Musk and John Charlesworth.[77]
Founder Steve Ells serves as chairman and Chief executive officer,[78] and has a 1.25% stake in the company.[79] The labor-market research firm Glassdoor reported that Steve Ells earned $29 million in 2014, versus a median of $19,000 for Chipotle's workers, making the CEO-to-worker pay ratio 1522:1.[80]
Operation and distribution[edit]
All of Chipotle's restaurants are company-owned, rather than franchised.[81] As of December 2012[update], 1430 restaurants have since opened throughout the United States and Canada, with locations in 43 states, Ontario, British Columbia, and the District of Columbia.[82][83]
The field team are the employees who work closely with but not directly within specific restaurants. The field support system includes apprentice team leaders (step up from restaurateurs), team leaders or area managers, team directors and regional directors (not atypical for them to oversee more than fifty locations).[84] Because Chipotle does not franchise, all restaurants are corporately owned. Thus, whenever Chipotle is in the process of launching a new location, the field team hires a new general manager and trains them at a current location so that they will be ready for the new location when it opens for business. The corporate office takes care of finding and funding new locations as well.[85]
Menu[edit]




A Chipotle restaurant in Brandon, Florida, having the typical service-line layout with menu above


Chipotle's menu consists of four items: burritos, bowls, tacos, and salads. The price of each item is based on the choice of chicken, pork carnitas, barbacoa, steak, tofu-based "sofritas",[86][87] chorizo (chicken and pork), or vegetarian (with guacamole, which would be at an extra charge otherwise). Additional optional toppings are offered free of charge, including: rice, beans, four types of salsa, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce.[88][89] When asked in 2007 about expanding the menu, Steve Ells said, "[I]t's important to keep the menu focused, because if you just do a few things, you can ensure that you do them better than anybody else."[90] Chipotle also offers a children's menu.[91][92] Most restaurants sell beer and margaritas in addition to soft drinks and fruit drinks.[93]
The majority of food is prepared in each restaurant. Some exceptions are the beans and carnitas, which are prepared at a central kitchen in Chicago, Illinois.[94] None of the restaurants have freezers, microwave ovens, or can openers.[95]




Chicken Burrito Bowl


The chain experimented with breakfast foods at two airports in the Washington (D.C.) metropolitan area but decided against expanding the menu in that direction.[96][97][98] Starting in 2009, selected restaurants had offered a pozole soup,[99][100][101] which has since been discontinued.
In June 2015, Chipotle began test marketing a pork and chicken chorizo-type sausage as a new protein option at selected locations in the Kansas City area.[102][103][104] Some food writers have expressed their health related concerns over the protein's relatively high sodium content since a 4-ounce serving contains 293 calories and 803 milligrams of sodium[105] while the American Heart Association’s recommended daily amount is less than 1,500 milligrams of sodium.[106] In contrast, the protein options with next highest sodium contents are Barbacoa with 530 milligrams and sofritas with 555 milligrams.[105] An earlier version on the Mexican sausage was tested in Denver and New York City in 2011,[107] but that test was terminated when that version of the sausage was perceived as looking too greasy.[108] As of fall 2016, chorizo is available nationwide.
Chipotle accepts fax orders, and in 2005 the company added the ability to order online from their website. For both online and fax orders, customers proceed to the front of the line to pay for pre-ordered food.[109] In 2009, Chipotle released an app for the iPhone that allows users to find nearby Chipotle locations, place an order, and prepay with a credit card.[110] In 2013, Chipotle released an Android app that allows users to locate nearby Chipotle locations, place an order, prepay with a credit or gift card, and access favorites and recent orders.[111][112]
Nutrition[edit]
In 2003, a Center for Science in the Public Interest report stated that Chipotle's burritos contain over 1,000 calories, which is nearly equivalent to two meals' worth of food.[113][114] MSNBC Health.com placed the burritos on their list of the "20 Worst Foods in America" because of their high caloric content and high sodium.[115] When a burrito with carnitas, rice, vegetables, cheese, guacamole, and salsa was compared with a typical Big Mac, the burrito had more fat, cholesterol, carbohydrates, and sodium than the Big Mac, but it also had more protein and fiber.[116] The restaurant has also received praise – Health.com included the restaurant in its list of the "Healthiest Fast Food Restaurants".[117]
Chipotle's vegetarian options include rice, black beans, fajita vegetables (onions and bell peppers), salsa, guacamole and cheese.[118] All items other than the meats, cheese, sour cream, and honey vinaigrette dressing are vegan.[118] As of late 2013, Chipotle developed a new cooking strategy for the pinto beans, eliminating the bacon and making them vegetarian and vegan-friendly.[119] The cheese is processed with vegetable-based rennet in order to be suitable for vegetarians.[118] In April 2010, Chipotle began testing a vegan "Garden Blend" option, which is a plant-based meat alternative marinated in chipotle adobo, at six locations in the U.S.[120][121] The flour tortillas used for the burritos and soft tacos are the only items that contain gluten.[118]
Food sourcing[edit]
In 1999, while looking for ways to improve the taste of the carnitas,[20] Steve Ells was prompted by an article written by Edward Behr to visit Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs).[122] Ells found the CAFOs "horrific", and began sourcing from open-range pork suppliers. This caused an increase in both the price and the sales of the carnitas burritos.[61]
In 2001, Chipotle released a mission statement called Food With Integrity, which highlighted Chipotle's efforts to increase their use of naturally raised meat, organic produce, and dairy without added hormones.[6] Chipotle only uses the leg and thigh meat from its chickens; the breast meat is sold to Panera Bread.[123]




Customers at a Chipotle restaurant in Fredericksburg, Virginia


Founder Steve Ells has testified before the United States Congress in support of the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act, which aims to reduce the amount of antibiotics given to farm animals.[61][124]
Since 2006, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW), a Floridian farmworker organization, has protested Chipotle’s refusal to sign a Fair Food agreement, which would commit the restaurant chain to pay a penny-per-pound premium on its Florida tomatoes to boost tomato harvesters’ wages, and to only buy Florida tomatoes from growers who comply with the Fair Food Code of Conduct.[125] In 2009, the creators of the documentary film Food, Inc. (along with 31 other leaders in the sustainable food movement) signed an open letter of support for the CIW’s campaign, stating that, “If Chipotle is sincere in its wishes to reform its supply chain, the time has come to work with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers as a true partner in the protection of farmworkers rights.”[126] In September 2009, Chipotle announced that it would sidestep partnership with the CIW and instead work directly with East Coast Growers and Packers to increase wages for its tomato pickers.[127] CEO Steve Ells has framed the dispute as a fundamental issue of control, stating that, “the CIW wants us to sign a contract that would let them control Chipotle's decisions regarding food in the future."[128] In October 2012, Chipotle Mexican Grill signed an agreement with the CIW and became the 11th company to join the organization's Fair Food Program.[129]
In January 2015, Chipotle pulled carnitas from its menu in a third of its restaurants; company officials cited animal welfare problems at one of the suppliers, found during a regular audit, as the reason.[130] Subsequently, a false rumor spread online claiming it was done to appease Muslims who consider pork to be unclean, leading to some protests on social media.[131] The company still uses antibiotic-free and hormone-free steak in its restaurants, despite being briefly forced to "serve beef that is not naturally raised" during the summer of 2013, posting an in-store notice each time that occurred.[132] Roberto Ferdman of The Washington Post opined that Chipotle's stated mission to sell "food with integrity" may be "untenable" if meat producers continue to breach Chipotle's ethical standards.[130]
Also in 2015, Chipotle stopped using genetically modified corn and soy beans in their foods, claiming to be the first nationwide restaurant to cook completely GMO free.[133] This was done in response to increasing consumer demand for GMO free products.
Food safety[edit]

 "How Chipotle made hundreds of people barf". Vox report dated January 6, 2016, explaining Chipotle's "food safety crisis".


Since 2008, a former Kansas State University food safety professor has accused Chipotle of confusing the public by using such terms as "naturally raised meats", "organic ingredients", and "locally sourced" and trying to equate those terms with food safety.[134] In rebuttal, a Chipotle spokesperson told The Daily Beast that "all of our practices have always been very much within industry norms. It's important to note that restaurant practices are regulated by health codes, and restaurants are routinely inspected by health officials. Everything we have done in our supply chain and in our restaurants has been within industry norms."[134] Yet, FiveThirtyEight pointed out that the 2015 norovirus outbreak appears to be unusual[135] and others are criticizing their food sourcing or handling practices.[136][137] MarketWatch wrote that the result of all of these outbreaks will be to force Chipotle to obtain their produce from larger corporate farms that can afford the more extensive microbial food-safety testing programs and to process vegetables at centralized locations instead of at the individual stores, both of which are industry-standard practices that the company had previously criticized.[138] The New York Times implied that the company's insistence on maintaining its long standing rhetoric about "food integrity" seemed to be quite opposite with the realities of recent current events and made it appear that the management was just ignoring their current problems.[139] It also has been pointed out that Chipotle's current record-keeping system is actually hindering the health authorities' investigation in locating the sources of the various infections.[139]
A writer for the magazine Popular Science pointed out that Chipotle had publicly acknowledged that they "may be at a higher risk for food-borne illness outbreaks than some competitors due to our use of fresh produce and meats rather than frozen, and our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation."[140][141][142] Henry I. Miller, a medical researcher and columnist and the founding director of the FDA's Office of Biotechnology, asked: "One wonders whether Chipotle’s "traditional methods" include employees' neglecting to wash their hands before preparing food, which is how norovirus is usually spread. And the fresh versus frozen dichotomy is nothing more than a snow-job. Freezing E. coli-contaminated food does not kill the pathogens; it preserves them."[143] Describing food poisoning outbreaks as "something of a Chipotle trademark; the recent ones are the fourth and fifth this year [2015], one of which was not disclosed to the public", Miller notes that "a particularly worrisome aspect of the company's serial deficiencies is that there have been at least three unrelated pathogens in the outbreaks – Salmonella and E. coli bacteria and norovirus. In other words, there has been more than a single glitch; suppliers and employees have found a variety of ways to contaminate what Chipotle cavalierly sells (at premium prices) to its customers."[143]
A writer for the North Carolina newspaper The News & Observer called Chipotle's "food with integrity" a "lucrative farce" and a "marketing ploy" by pointing out that organic food is "often grown with manure (an 'all-natural' fertilizer), which can certainly increase the risks of accidentally spreading fecal bacteria like E. coli."[144]
In December 2015, Seattle health officials closed a Seattle-area Chipotle for a day after it had repeatedly had small numbers of violations during recent consecutive inspections that previously would not have generated a closure order.[145] On December 10, 2015, CEO Steve Ells released a press statement apologizing for 2015 outbreaks and promised changes to minimize the risks of future outbreaks.[146]
March 2008 hepatitis outbreak[edit]
In March and April 2008, the Community Epidemiology Branch of the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency traced a hepatitis A outbreak in San Diego County to a single Chipotle restaurant located in La Mesa, California in which 22 customers were infected with the virus.[147][148]
April 2008 norovirus outbreak[edit]
In 2008, Chipotle was implicated in a norovirus outbreak in Kent, Ohio, where over 400 people became ill after eating at a Chipotle restaurant.[149] Officials at the Ohio Department of Health said that the outbreak was caused by Norovirus Genotype G2.[150] Many of the victims were students at Kent State University.[151] The initial source of the outbreak was never found.
February 2009 Campylobacter jejuni outbreak[edit]
In 2009, an investigation by the Minnesota Department of Health traced an outbreak of campylobacteriosis to a Chipotle Mexican Grill in Apple Valley, Minnesota.[152][153][154] The investigation found that chicken was sometimes served undercooked by the restaurant and determined that lettuce which had been cross-contaminated with raw or undercooked chicken was the vector for the outbreak.[155][156][third-party source needed]
July 2015 E. coli outbreak[edit]
In early November 2015, The Oregonian reported that there was a little-known E. coli outbreak that had occurred earlier in July in which five persons were infected with the O157:H7 strain of E. coli. The outbreak was traced to a single Chipotle location in Seattle and that the incident was not publicized at that time.[157][158] Seattle public health officials defended their actions at that time by saying that the outbreak was over by the time they made an association with Chipotle. Health officials were unable to trace the source of the July outbreak and said that the cause of the July outbreak is unrelated to the October/November outbreak.[157]
August 2015 norovirus outbreak[edit]
Another norovirus outbreak was confirmed to have occurred in August 2015 at a Simi Valley, California location in which 80 customers and 18 employees reported becoming ill.[159][160] Ventura County health inspectors found various health violations during two inspections following the outbreak report.[161] Despite those violations, the county health officials did not close the restaurant and allowed it to continue to operate.[159] In a January 2016 article, the New York Times reported that the number of victims involved in the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak was actually 207, twice the number that was reported earlier.[162]
In an unusual move, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California in conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration has gotten a federal grand jury to issue a subpoena in January 2016 as part of a criminal investigation seeking documents and information from Chipotle concerning the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak.[162][163] As of January 2016[update], it is too early to tell which organization is the actual target of the investigation. In most cases involving norovirus outbreaks that involved a single location, state and/or local authorities are the usual jurisdiction responsible in the investigation and prosecution of those type of cases. However, Ventura County officials had been criticized for their handling of parts of their investigation, and for allowing the restaurant to continue to operate after finding health violations during consecutive inspections.
Less than two weeks later, a federal class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California claiming that Chipotle knowingly allowed an ill kitchen manager to work for two days before sending that person home. Then, the restaurant actively deep-cleaned the restaurant to remove all traces of contamination prior to notifying the Ventura County Environmental Health Division of the existing outbreak, hindering their investigation. The lawsuit also claimed that the number of known victims was as high as 234 and estimates that the number of meals that the infected employee may have come in contact with could be as high 3,000.[164][165][166]
August 2015 Salmonella outbreak[edit]
At almost the same time as the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak, Minnesota health officials confirmed a Salmonella outbreak that affected 17 Minneapolis-area Chipotle restaurants in mid-August 2015. The source of the outbreak was traced back to contaminated tomatoes that were grown in Mexico.[167][168] The Minnesota Department of Health reported that samples from 45 victims were tested and found that their illness was caused by the Salmonella Newport bacterium as determined by DNA profiling.[169] Later, the state officials reported that the total of persons who became infected was increased to 64 and the number Chipotle locations in which they had acquired the bacterium was increased to 22, all located within the state of Minnesota.[170]
October 2015 E. coli outbreak[edit]
In October 2015, at least 22 persons were reported to have gotten sick after eating at several different Chipotle locations in the states of Washington and Oregon. At that time, an epidemiologist for the Washington Health Department said the culprit appeared to be a Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli bacterium, but they were still waiting the outcome of several laboratory tests before they can give a definitive result.[171][172][173] As a precaution, Chipotle had closed 43 stores in Washington and Oregon pending the results and recommendations of the involved health authorities. On November 5, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had reported that the number of persons reported ill had risen to 40 known cases and that the bacteria samples taken from 7 infected persons in Washington and 3 persons in Oregon states were confirmed to be infected by the same strain of E. coli, the Shiga toxin-producing STEC O26 strain, as determined by DNA profiling.[174] At least 12 persons required hospitalization, but no fatalities. As of November 2015, Health authorities were still trying to trace the exact source of the bacterial contamination, but suspected fresh produce.[175]
On November 12, the CDC increased the number of known cases to 50, the number of persons requiring hospitalization to 14, and the number of DNA fingerprint confirmations to 33.[176] Through a match via Pulsenet, the DNA fingerprint also matched a recent case in Minnesota, but the ill person did not eat at Chipotle. The source of the bacteria infection still had not yet been determined at the time of the report released by the CDC and the CDC is trying to use the more definitive, but more time consuming whole genome sequencing procedure to see if they are able to determine the relationships between all of the STEC O26 cases. In the meantime, Chipotle reopened the closed restaurants on November 11 after disposing all of the food within the closed facilities and deep cleaning those facilities.[177]
On November 20, the CDC reported that the number of STEC O26 cases, as determined by DNA fingerprinting, had increased to 45 with 16 persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to six.[178] Besides Oregon and Washington, new cases were reported in the states of Minnesota, California, New York, and Ohio.[179] 43 out of 45 of the affected individuals had reported that they had eaten at a Chipotle in the week before they had become sick.
On December 4, the CDC reported that the number of STEC O26 cases, as determined by DNA fingerprinting, had increased to 52 with 20 persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to nine.[180] New cases were reported in the states of California (1), Illinois (1), Maryland (1), Ohio (2), Pennsylvania (1), and Washington (1).[181]
The price of shares for Chipotle stock dropped a further 12% immediately after the CDC had issued their update on November 20.[182] Share prices had been dropping since the initial announcement of the E. coli outbreak in late October with investors unsure if the drop in share prices just a temporary aberration and that Chipotle management is handling the incident as well as they could. Chipotle has since hired a consultant to improve their food safety program and have their program reviewed by both the CDC and FDA.[183]
On February 1, 2016, the CDC official closed their investigations on the larger E. coli that started in Pacific Northwest in October 2015 and also the smaller outbreak that started in Kansas and Oklahoma in November since no new cases were reported since December 1.[184] In their final report, the CDC stated that 55 persons in 11 states were infected with the same strain of STEC O26 during the major outbreak with 21 of those persons requiring hospitalization. The five persons infected in the later outbreak were made ill by a generically different strain of STEC O26. The CDC also reported that federal and local health and food safety authorities were unable to detect traces of the microorganisms in any of the food samples taken from the suspected restaurants or from their supply chain. The CDC, FDA, and the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service were unable to determine a point source that was in common in the meals that were consumed by all the victims since some of the restaurants were located far apart and had obtained some of their ingredients from different suppliers while other consumers of the suspected suppliers were not affected.
November 2015 E. coli cases[edit]
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on December 21 that five more people became ill after eating at two Chipotle restaurants located in Kansas and Oklahoma in late November. Preliminary DNA fingerprinting results appear to indicated that the newer cases were caused by a different strain of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O26. Scientists are waiting for the results of the more definitive whole genome sequencing analyses to determine if the organisms responsible for this outbreak are genetically related to the E. coli that are responsible for causing the outbreak that had started in Oregon and Washington in late October and thus an extension of that outbreak. The agency has not yet determined which food is responsible for the outbreak.[185] The Food and Drug Administration reported that they are trying to determine how the bacteria in these cases, along with the earlier Oregon, Washington, and other multi-state cases, might have been propagated through the food supply chain.[186]
December 2015 norovirus outbreak[edit]




The closed restaurant on December 16, 2015


In December 2015, eighty students at Boston College were sickened after eating at a single Chipotle restaurant. Affected students had been tested for both E. coli and norovirus in order to determine the cause of the illnesses.[187] Although it would take as long as two days before the results of more definitive tests became known, public health investigators reported that preliminary tests pointed to the presence of norovirus.[188] The health inspectors for the City of Boston had since closed this particular location on December 7 for a number of health violations that included maintaining meats at a too low of a temperature on the serving line and for allowing a sick employee to work at the time of the inspection.[189]
On December 10, officials from the Boston Public Health Commission reported that tests had identified a single strain of norovirus that is responsible for this particular outbreak.[190] Boston Globe reported on December 10 that 141 persons were reported to have gotten ill and that some of the newer victims had not visited Chipotle before contracting the virus[191] and most likely became infected by being in close proximity to someone who had gotten ill at Chipotle, such as a roommate or dorm-mate.[190] Boston authorities traced the cause of the outbreak to a sick employee who was allowed to work on the day of the outbreak. Chipotle has since fired the employee and also the manager who knowingly allowed the ill worker to complete his shift instead of following health codes.[192]
Consequences[edit]
On February 8, 2016, Chipotle closed all of its eateries nationwide for a few hours during the morning for an all-staff meeting on food safety.[193] The company hired a new head of food safety, who instituted changes including having all employees wash hands every half hour, having two employees verify that produce like onions, jalapeños and avocados have been immersed in hot water for five seconds to kill germs on their exteriors, and using Pascalization to pre-treat food ingredients.[194]
Since the series of food-poisoning outbreaks in 2015 lowered trust in the product, Chipotle has tried to lure back its customers with free food and heavier advertising. Same-store sales increased 17.8% percent in the first quarter of 2017.[195]

Lawsuit[edit]
In November 2016, three men filed a class-action lawsuit against Chipotle alleging that a burrito was listed as containing only 300 calories, when in fact it contained more. They are seeking "unspecified damages and for an injunction against the company to prevent it from posting what it calls misleading information on its food."[196][197][198]
Advertising and publicity[edit]




People line up outside a Chipotle in East Lansing, Michigan during a "Free Burrito Day"


In the past, Chipotle mainly relied on billboards, radio ads, and word of mouth to advertise.[30] In 2012, Chipotle aired its first nationally televised commercial during the 54th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony.[199] In 2010, the company initiated an ad campaign that mocks advice given to Chipotle by advertising agencies.[200] Chipotle has run many promotions giving out free food to potential customers, especially when opening a new store. Stores also give out free burritos on certain holidays; for instance, on Halloween, some locations have had promotions in which free burritos are given to people who come dressed as a burrito. Chipotle gave away free burritos to reporters during the 1997 trial of Timothy McVeigh, which took place in Chipotle's hometown of Denver.[201] In addition, stores offered free burritos to those displaced by Hurricane Katrina.[202] Chipotle received attention when Ozzy Osbourne's reality show The Osbournes featured the company's burritos heavily.[29] For Halloween 2010, Chipotle announced that customers dressed as a processed food product would receive a burrito for $2. The event was part of a $1 million fundraiser for Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution called "Boorito 2010: The Horrors of Processed Food."[203] For "Boorito 2011", customers dressed in costumes "inspired by family farms" will receive a menu item for $2, with proceeds from the promotion going to The Chipotle Cultivate Foundation and Farm Aid. The promotion is aimed to increase awareness of family farms.[204] Also in support of family farms, Chipotle released music videos of Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Willie Nelson.[205] On September 12, 2013, Chipotle released an animated short called The Scarecrow, with a companion mobile video game; both feature a narrative heavily critical of industrial farming, but little in the way of direct marketing for the chain.[206] The short features a cover of "Pure Imagination" from Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, sung by Fiona Apple.[207] It was named one of the worst advertisements of 2013 by The Wall Street Journal.[208]
In 2011, Chipotle created the "Farm Team", which is a rewards program available only by invitation from restaurant managers. The Farm Team members have access to a special Chipotle website, where members can earn rewards, i.e. free food and T-shirts. The site offers members to, "learn where Chipotle’s food comes from, take quizzes and polls, play games and watch videos about the company".[209] In April 2014, the Farm Team program was shut down.[210]
Chipotle sponsors Team Garmin-Barracuda (formerly Team Garmin-Chipotle, Team Garmin-Slipstream, Team Garmin-Transitions and Team Garmin-Cervélo) of the International Cycling Union,[211][212] and is an official team partner of the Boston Celtics,[213] and the Boston Bruins.[214] In June 2009, Chipotle sponsored free screenings of Food, Inc., a film that criticizes the corporate food industry. Founder Steve Ells stated that he hoped the film would make customers appreciate Chipotle's Food With Integrity policy.[215] From May until September 2009, Chipotle ran a contest on mychipotle.com, a microsite which had a competition for the best user-created audio and video presentations about different combinations of ingredients.[216][217] In July 2010, Chipotle began a campaign to support healthier lunch alternatives for students, in which money will be donated to The Lunch Box program based on how many spam E-mails consumers forward to a company E-mail address.[218] For Chipotle's 18 year anniversary, the company began wrapping its burritos in gold foil as part of a larger promotion to draw attention to its Food With Integrity mantra.[219] Also as part of the gold foil campaign, Chipotle is offering prizes for customer-created pictures of items wrapped in gold foil. Chipotle hired comedian Amy Sedaris to create a comedic how-to video on wrapping with gold foil, and spread the video using Twitter.[220] In March 2013, Chipotle pulled its sponsorship of a Boy Scouts of America event, citing that organization's ban on LGBT members.[221]

On December 16, 2015, Chipotle ran full page ads in both The Boston Globe and Boston Herald apologizing for the recent norovirus outbreak linked to Chipotle's Cleveland Circle location. The ad, containing a letter by Chipotle founder and co-CEO Steve Ells, affirmed the company's commitment to food safety.[222]
On March 14, 2016, a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) administrative law judge concluded that Chipotle’s social media policy, and more specifically its application towards an employee who posted tweets regarding wages and working conditions, violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).[223] A former Chipotle employee in Havertown, Pennsylvania, wrote a series of tweets from his personal account about hourly workers being required to work on snow days. Chipotle instructed the employee to delete the tweets. The NLRB judge determined that Chipotle’s request to delete the tweets violated the NLRA even though the employee was not disciplined as a result of his tweets.[224]
Architecture[edit]




The exterior of a Chipotle in Durham, North Carolina


Architecturally, all Chipotle restaurants are built using most of the same materials (plywood, corrugated metal, stainless steel, exposed ductwork), although each store is unique.[20][225] The interiors have been described as having an "industrial, sheet metal look".[226] Chipotle has built restaurants using white ceramic tile instead of stainless steel.[227] It costs the company approximately $850,000 to open a new restaurant.[228] When the first Chipotle opened, Steve Ells asked his friend, sculptor Bruce Gueswel, to design the chairs and a styled Mayan king whose face was loosely based on that of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., a personal inspiration of Gueswel, for the restaurant. Both items were made from wood and metal. Gueswel has continued to design and build the art and chairs for all subsequent Chipotle restaurants.[229]
Most Chipotle locations display a photograph of the original restaurant, which is near the University of Denver campus on Evans Avenue.[20] Instead of a photograph of itself, the original location has a photograph of the Dolly Madison Ice Cream that previously occupied the location. In 2010, Chipotle began opening "A Model" restaurants, which are smaller concept locations, citing the lower costs of development and occupancy.[230] Chipotle uses environmentally friendly packaging, with bowls made from recycled newsprint, unbleached tray liners, and napkins and cups made from postconsumer waste.[231]
Chipotle's architectural design team incorporates the principles of sustainable architecture in their projects. The "green" restaurant in Gurnee, Illinois features an on-site six kilowatt wind turbine, which generates about 10% of the restaurant's electrical needs. The Gurnee restaurant has received Platinum level LEED certification from U.S. Green Building Council.[232] A restaurant in Tulsa, Oklahoma, uses recycled drywall, low-VOC paint, and energy-efficient appliances.[233] A Chipotle restaurant in Austin, Texas was the first to receive a four-star rating from the city's Green Building Program.[234] Additionally, Chipotle has made arrangements to add solar panels to 75 of its restaurants.[232] Chipotle has contracted to clean its stores in New York City and Long Island, with "plant-based, environmentally preferable cleaning supplies and technologies." The cleansers are readily biodegradable and non-toxic to humans or aquatic life.[235]
Chipotle was the defendant in a lawsuit for failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Maurizio Antoninetti, a customer who used a wheelchair, claimed he was denied the "Chipotle Experience", because he was unable to see the food preparation. The case against the company was upheld in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,[236] and the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear Chipotle's appeal, leaving the Ninth Circuit's ruling intact.[237] Chipotle has "an official disability policy of bringing ingredients to the tables of diners with disabilities and doing tableside preparation." Chipotle is retrofitting restaurants affected by the ruling, replacing the walls in front of the food preparation area with lower ones or transparent panels. They are incorporating the new design elements into new restaurants.[236] The case was one of over twenty ADA-related lawsuits filed by Antoninetti, who died in 2011.[236][238]
Other restaurant units[edit]

Pizzeria Locale is a fast casual pizza restaurant formed as a partnership with Pizzeria Locale, a full-service pizza restaurant in Boulder, Colorado. The original Pizzeria Locale owners, Bobby Stuckey and Lachlan Mackinnon-Patterson, would continue to own their original location while Chipotle would increase its stake in the chain over time.[48] As of February 2017, the chain has seven locations.[51]
Tasty Made is a burger restaurant concept that Chipotle first opened in Lancaster, Ohio in October 2016.[239] On July 29, 2016, the company announced the opening of its first Tasty Made burger restaurant in the fall. The first location was revealed to be in Lancaster, Ohio. Ohio was selected as culinary manager Nate Appleman and national training director David Chrisman are both from the state and helped design the concept.[240] Tasty Made was announced to have a focused menu like early burger restaurants which were limited to burgers, fries and milkshakes.[51] Chipotle had trademarked Better Burger earlier in the year.


Defunct


Soul Daddy was a soul food fast casual restaurant that was owned by ANGR Holdings, LLC, and was managed by Chipotle after purchasing Ellis' stake in the company. The restaurant had three locations that had operated for less than 5 weeks in 2011 before closing.[241]
ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen was an Asian fast-casual concept restaurant that was opened by Chipotle in September 2011.[45] The company said that the new restaurant "would follow the Chipotle service format and its focus on 'food with integrity' in ingredients."[46] Chipotle's plan was to start with only one store, and see how the restaurant works out before expanding the concept.[47] By July 2016, the chain has 15 restaurants.[51] All ShopHouse locations were closed on March 17, 2017.[242]

Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (/tʃᵻˈpoʊtleɪ/)[6] is an American chain of fast casual restaurants in the United States, United Kingdom,[7] Canada,[8][9] Germany,[10] and France,[11] specializing in tacos and Mission-style[12][13] burritos. Its name derives from chipotle, the Nahuatl name for a smoked and dried jalapeño chili pepper.[14] The company currently trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CMG.[15]
The company has released a mission statement called Food with Integrity, which highlights its efforts in using naturally-grown ingredients,[6] and serves more naturally raised meat than any other restaurant chain.[16] Chipotle is one of the first chains of fast casual dining establishments.[17] Competitors in the fast-casual Mexican market include Qdoba Mexican Grill, Moe's Southwest Grill, Rubio's Coastal Grill, Pancheros Mexican Grill, Freebirds World Burrito, and Baja Fresh.[18]
Founded by Steve Ells on July 13, 1993. Chipotle had 16 restaurants (all in Colorado) when McDonald's Corporation became a major investor in 1998. By the time McDonald's fully divested itself from Chipotle in 2006,[19] the chain had grown to over 500 locations.
With more than 2,000 locations,[2] Chipotle had a net income of US$475.6 million and a staff of more than 45,000 employees in 2015.[2]

History[edit]




The first Chipotle, near the campus of the University of Denver


Founder Steve Ells attended the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York. Afterward, he became a line cook for Jeremiah Tower at Stars in San Francisco.[20] There, Ells observed the popularity of the taquerías and San Francisco burritos in the Mission District. In 1993, Ells took what he learned in San Francisco[21] and opened the first Chipotle Mexican Grill in Denver, Colorado, in a former Dolly Madison Ice Cream store at 1644 East Evans Avenue,[22] near the University of Denver campus, using an $85,000 loan from his father.[19] Ells and his father calculated that the store would need to sell 107 burritos per day to be profitable. After one month, the original restaurant was selling over 1,000 burritos a day.[15] The second store opened in 1995 using Chipotle's cash flow, and the third was opened using an SBA loan. To fund more growth, Ells' father invested $1.5 million. Afterwards, Ells created a board of directors and business plan, raising an additional $1.8 million for the company.[23] Ells had originally planned to use funds from the first Chipotle to open a fine-dining restaurant, but instead focused on Chipotle Mexican Grill when the restaurants saw success.[24][25]
In 1998, the first restaurant outside of Colorado opened in Kansas City, Missouri.[26] The company opened its first location in Minnesota by opening near the campus of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis in March 1999.[27]
In 1998, McDonald's made an initial minority investment in the company. By 2001, the company had grown to be Chipotle's largest investor.[19] The investment from McDonald's allowed the firm to quickly expand, from 16 restaurants in 1998 to over 500 by 2005.[28] On January 26, 2006, Chipotle made its initial public offering (IPO) after increasing the share price twice due to high pre-IPO demand. In its first day as a public company, the stock rose exactly 100%, resulting in the best U.S.-based IPO in six years, and the second-best IPO for a restaurant after Boston Market. The money from the offering was then used to fund new store growth.[29]
In October 2006, McDonald's fully divested from Chipotle.[30] This was part of a larger initiative for McDonald's to divest all of its non-core business restaurants — Chipotle, Donatos Pizza, and Boston Market — so that it could focus on the main McDonald's chain.[31] McDonald's invested approximately $360 million into Chipotle, and took out $1.5 billion.[23] McDonald's had attempted to get Chipotle to add drive-through windows and a breakfast menu, which Ells resisted.[32][33] In 2008, Chipotle opened its first location outside of the United States in Toronto.[9]
In a list of fastest-growing restaurant chains in 2009, Chipotle was ranked eighth, based on increases in U.S. sales over the past year,[34] and in 2010 Chipotle was ranked third.[35] Consumer Reports ranked Chipotle as the best Mexican fast-food chain in 2011.[36] The company serves approximately 750,000 customers per day.[37]
In December 2010, Chipotle hired chef Nate Appleman to develop new cuisine. Appleman has won Rising Star Chef from the James Beard Foundation, was named "Best New Chef" by Food & Wine magazine, and competed on The Next Iron Chef.[38]
In 2010, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) audited Chipotle's Minneapolis restaurants, and found that some employees had been hired using fraudulent documents. In December, Chipotle fired 450 employees from its Minneapolis restaurants as a result of the audit, resulting in protests by local groups.[39][40] In February 2011, ICE expanded the audit to include 60 restaurants in Virginia and Washington, D.C.[41] which resulted in 40 workers being fired. In April 2011, the criminal division of the Attorney General's office in Washington, D.C., joined the case, and ICE agents began interviewing employees at 20 to 25 restaurants in other locations, such as Los Angeles and Atlanta.[42] In response to the government investigations, Chipotle hired former director of ICE Julie Myers Wood and high-profile attorneys Robert Luskin and Gregory B. Craig.[43]
Other restaurant expansion[edit]
In 2011, Steve Ells was a judge for the TV show America's Next Great Restaurant and investor of ANGR Holdings, the company that will be running the winning concept's restaurants. Chipotle has agreed to purchase Ells' investment in ANGR at his cost, provide support for ANGR operations, and invest a total of $2.3 million in cash contributions.[44]
In September 2011, Chipotle opened an Asian fast-casual concept restaurant named ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen in Washington, D.C.[45] The company has said the new restaurant "would follow the Chipotle service format and its focus on 'food with integrity' in ingredients."[46] Chipotle's plan was to start with only one store, and see how the restaurant works out before expanding the concept.[47]
On December 18, 2013, the company revealed that it had opened its first fast-food pizza chain in Denver back in May 2013. According to Associated Press, Chipotle partnered with a local full-service restaurant called Pizzeria Locale to create a fast-food version of the eatery, keeping its name. The company plans to open at least two more pizzerias in the Denver area.[48]
In April 2014, Chipotle announced an increase in menu prices for the first time in nearly three years, due to increasing costs for steak, avocados, and cheese. The price increase was expected to be rolled out from the end of second quarter of 2014 through the end of the third quarter.[49] In late 2015, Chipotle expanded its mobile strategy through delivery partnerships with tech startups like Tapingo, a delivery service that targets college campuses.[50]
On July 29, 2016, the company announced the opening of its first Tasty Made burger restaurant in the fall. Chipotle was still dealing with the various virus outbreaks with additional marketing. The company was also reducing the number of new stores for the year from 235 to 220.[51]
International[edit]




The second Chipotle Mexican Grill location in London, located on Baker Street


According to an article in The Motley Fool, Chipotle had 17 locations outside of the United States by October 2014 with the majority in Canada, and the UK was in the process of opening more locations.[52] The rate of overseas expansion was slower than expected.[53] Many of the press reviewers thought that the food was overpriced for their area.[11][54]
As of 2017 there are 26 locations outside of the United States with 11 locations in Canada (Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver), 6 locations in The United Kingdom (London), 3 in France (Paris), and 1 in Germany (Frankfurt).[better source needed][2] [55]
Canada[edit]
In August 2008, Chipotle opened its first location outside of the United States in Toronto.[9] The second location in Toronto–and in all of Canada–was not opened until 2010.[53]
The first Canadian location outside of the Toronto area was opened in Vancouver in December 2012.[56] A second Vancouver-area location was opened in Burnaby in October 2014[57] followed by a third in Surrey in January 2016[58] and a fourth in Langley in October 2016.[59]
The first location in the nation's capital of Ottawa was opened in February 2017 at the Rideau Centre.[60]
United Kingdom[edit]
Chipotle expanded to Europe with the first European restaurant opening in May 2010 in London.[7][61][62] A second location open in London in September 2011.[63] The following year, three additional locations were quickly opened in the London area.[64] After this growth spurt, the rate of further expansion in London slowed greatly with the sixth location appearing in 2013[65] and the seventh in June 2015.[66] Although Chipotle blames the slow growth in the United Kingdom on the British unfamiliarity with Mexican foods,[67] several locally owned burrito chains had opened locations across the United Kingdom during the same interval.[68]
France[edit]
The first location in France opened in Paris in May 2012.[11][69]
Expansion in France was much slower than that in the United Kingdom or Canada, with a second location in Paris opening in 2013[70] and a third location in 2014.[71] At 7,000 square feet, the restaurant at La Défense is, as of 2015[update], the largest Chipotle location in the world, while a typical Chipotle restaurant is usually between 2,200 and 2,500 square feet.[72] A fourth Parisian location was opened in Levallois-Perret in 2015[73] followed by a fifth[74] and a sixth[75] Parisian location in 2016, both in Saint-Germain-des-Prés.
Germany[edit]
The first and, so far, only location in Germany opened in Frankfurt in August 2013.[10][54]
Corporate management[edit]
Chipotle's team includes a residing corporate office of managers and its board of directors. Members of both teams are appointed to serve on committees: audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance.
The top management team consists of the Chief Executive Officers, Steve Ells; the Chief Financial Officer, Jack R. Hartung; the Chief Marketing and Development Officer, Mark Crumpacker.[76] The current board of directors consists of: Steve Ells, Patrick Flynn, Albert Baldocchi, Neil Flanzraich, Darlene Friedman, Stephen Gillet, Kimbal Musk and John Charlesworth.[77]
Founder Steve Ells serves as chairman and Chief executive officer,[78] and has a 1.25% stake in the company.[79] The labor-market research firm Glassdoor reported that Steve Ells earned $29 million in 2014, versus a median of $19,000 for Chipotle's workers, making the CEO-to-worker pay ratio 1522:1.[80]
Operation and distribution[edit]
All of Chipotle's restaurants are company-owned, rather than franchised.[81] As of December 2012[update], 1430 restaurants have since opened throughout the United States and Canada, with locations in 43 states, Ontario, British Columbia, and the District of Columbia.[82][83]
The field team are the employees who work closely with but not directly within specific restaurants. The field support system includes apprentice team leaders (step up from restaurateurs), team leaders or area managers, team directors and regional directors (not atypical for them to oversee more than fifty locations).[84] Because Chipotle does not franchise, all restaurants are corporately owned. Thus, whenever Chipotle is in the process of launching a new location, the field team hires a new general manager and trains them at a current location so that they will be ready for the new location when it opens for business. The corporate office takes care of finding and funding new locations as well.[85]
Menu[edit]




A Chipotle restaurant in Brandon, Florida, having the typical service-line layout with menu above


Chipotle's menu consists of four items: burritos, bowls, tacos, and salads. The price of each item is based on the choice of chicken, pork carnitas, barbacoa, steak, tofu-based "sofritas",[86][87] chorizo (chicken and pork), or vegetarian (with guacamole, which would be at an extra charge otherwise). Additional optional toppings are offered free of charge, including: rice, beans, four types of salsa, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce.[88][89] When asked in 2007 about expanding the menu, Steve Ells said, "[I]t's important to keep the menu focused, because if you just do a few things, you can ensure that you do them better than anybody else."[90] Chipotle also offers a children's menu.[91][92] Most restaurants sell beer and margaritas in addition to soft drinks and fruit drinks.[93]
The majority of food is prepared in each restaurant. Some exceptions are the beans and carnitas, which are prepared at a central kitchen in Chicago, Illinois.[94] None of the restaurants have freezers, microwave ovens, or can openers.[95]




Chicken Burrito Bowl


The chain experimented with breakfast foods at two airports in the Washington (D.C.) metropolitan area but decided against expanding the menu in that direction.[96][97][98] Starting in 2009, selected restaurants had offered a pozole soup,[99][100][101] which has since been discontinued.
In June 2015, Chipotle began test marketing a pork and chicken chorizo-type sausage as a new protein option at selected locations in the Kansas City area.[102][103][104] Some food writers have expressed their health related concerns over the protein's relatively high sodium content since a 4-ounce serving contains 293 calories and 803 milligrams of sodium[105] while the American Heart Association’s recommended daily amount is less than 1,500 milligrams of sodium.[106] In contrast, the protein options with next highest sodium contents are Barbacoa with 530 milligrams and sofritas with 555 milligrams.[105] An earlier version on the Mexican sausage was tested in Denver and New York City in 2011,[107] but that test was terminated when that version of the sausage was perceived as looking too greasy.[108] As of fall 2016, chorizo is available nationwide.
Chipotle accepts fax orders, and in 2005 the company added the ability to order online from their website. For both online and fax orders, customers proceed to the front of the line to pay for pre-ordered food.[109] In 2009, Chipotle released an app for the iPhone that allows users to find nearby Chipotle locations, place an order, and prepay with a credit card.[110] In 2013, Chipotle released an Android app that allows users to locate nearby Chipotle locations, place an order, prepay with a credit or gift card, and access favorites and recent orders.[111][112]
Nutrition[edit]
In 2003, a Center for Science in the Public Interest report stated that Chipotle's burritos contain over 1,000 calories, which is nearly equivalent to two meals' worth of food.[113][114] MSNBC Health.com placed the burritos on their list of the "20 Worst Foods in America" because of their high caloric content and high sodium.[115] When a burrito with carnitas, rice, vegetables, cheese, guacamole, and salsa was compared with a typical Big Mac, the burrito had more fat, cholesterol, carbohydrates, and sodium than the Big Mac, but it also had more protein and fiber.[116] The restaurant has also received praise – Health.com included the restaurant in its list of the "Healthiest Fast Food Restaurants".[117]
Chipotle's vegetarian options include rice, black beans, fajita vegetables (onions and bell peppers), salsa, guacamole and cheese.[118] All items other than the meats, cheese, sour cream, and honey vinaigrette dressing are vegan.[118] As of late 2013, Chipotle developed a new cooking strategy for the pinto beans, eliminating the bacon and making them vegetarian and vegan-friendly.[119] The cheese is processed with vegetable-based rennet in order to be suitable for vegetarians.[118] In April 2010, Chipotle began testing a vegan "Garden Blend" option, which is a plant-based meat alternative marinated in chipotle adobo, at six locations in the U.S.[120][121] The flour tortillas used for the burritos and soft tacos are the only items that contain gluten.[118]
Food sourcing[edit]
In 1999, while looking for ways to improve the taste of the carnitas,[20] Steve Ells was prompted by an article written by Edward Behr to visit Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs).[122] Ells found the CAFOs "horrific", and began sourcing from open-range pork suppliers. This caused an increase in both the price and the sales of the carnitas burritos.[61]
In 2001, Chipotle released a mission statement called Food With Integrity, which highlighted Chipotle's efforts to increase their use of naturally raised meat, organic produce, and dairy without added hormones.[6] Chipotle only uses the leg and thigh meat from its chickens; the breast meat is sold to Panera Bread.[123]




Customers at a Chipotle restaurant in Fredericksburg, Virginia


Founder Steve Ells has testified before the United States Congress in support of the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act, which aims to reduce the amount of antibiotics given to farm animals.[61][124]
Since 2006, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW), a Floridian farmworker organization, has protested Chipotle’s refusal to sign a Fair Food agreement, which would commit the restaurant chain to pay a penny-per-pound premium on its Florida tomatoes to boost tomato harvesters’ wages, and to only buy Florida tomatoes from growers who comply with the Fair Food Code of Conduct.[125] In 2009, the creators of the documentary film Food, Inc. (along with 31 other leaders in the sustainable food movement) signed an open letter of support for the CIW’s campaign, stating that, “If Chipotle is sincere in its wishes to reform its supply chain, the time has come to work with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers as a true partner in the protection of farmworkers rights.”[126] In September 2009, Chipotle announced that it would sidestep partnership with the CIW and instead work directly with East Coast Growers and Packers to increase wages for its tomato pickers.[127] CEO Steve Ells has framed the dispute as a fundamental issue of control, stating that, “the CIW wants us to sign a contract that would let them control Chipotle's decisions regarding food in the future."[128] In October 2012, Chipotle Mexican Grill signed an agreement with the CIW and became the 11th company to join the organization's Fair Food Program.[129]
In January 2015, Chipotle pulled carnitas from its menu in a third of its restaurants; company officials cited animal welfare problems at one of the suppliers, found during a regular audit, as the reason.[130] Subsequently, a false rumor spread online claiming it was done to appease Muslims who consider pork to be unclean, leading to some protests on social media.[131] The company still uses antibiotic-free and hormone-free steak in its restaurants, despite being briefly forced to "serve beef that is not naturally raised" during the summer of 2013, posting an in-store notice each time that occurred.[132] Roberto Ferdman of The Washington Post opined that Chipotle's stated mission to sell "food with integrity" may be "untenable" if meat producers continue to breach Chipotle's ethical standards.[130]
Also in 2015, Chipotle stopped using genetically modified corn and soy beans in their foods, claiming to be the first nationwide restaurant to cook completely GMO free.[133] This was done in response to increasing consumer demand for GMO free products.
Food safety[edit]

 "How Chipotle made hundreds of people barf". Vox report dated January 6, 2016, explaining Chipotle's "food safety crisis".


Since 2008, a former Kansas State University food safety professor has accused Chipotle of confusing the public by using such terms as "naturally raised meats", "organic ingredients", and "locally sourced" and trying to equate those terms with food safety.[134] In rebuttal, a Chipotle spokesperson told The Daily Beast that "all of our practices have always been very much within industry norms. It's important to note that restaurant practices are regulated by health codes, and restaurants are routinely inspected by health officials. Everything we have done in our supply chain and in our restaurants has been within industry norms."[134] Yet, FiveThirtyEight pointed out that the 2015 norovirus outbreak appears to be unusual[135] and others are criticizing their food sourcing or handling practices.[136][137] MarketWatch wrote that the result of all of these outbreaks will be to force Chipotle to obtain their produce from larger corporate farms that can afford the more extensive microbial food-safety testing programs and to process vegetables at centralized locations instead of at the individual stores, both of which are industry-standard practices that the company had previously criticized.[138] The New York Times implied that the company's insistence on maintaining its long standing rhetoric about "food integrity" seemed to be quite opposite with the realities of recent current events and made it appear that the management was just ignoring their current problems.[139] It also has been pointed out that Chipotle's current record-keeping system is actually hindering the health authorities' investigation in locating the sources of the various infections.[139]
A writer for the magazine Popular Science pointed out that Chipotle had publicly acknowledged that they "may be at a higher risk for food-borne illness outbreaks than some competitors due to our use of fresh produce and meats rather than frozen, and our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation."[140][141][142] Henry I. Miller, a medical researcher and columnist and the founding director of the FDA's Office of Biotechnology, asked: "One wonders whether Chipotle’s "traditional methods" include employees' neglecting to wash their hands before preparing food, which is how norovirus is usually spread. And the fresh versus frozen dichotomy is nothing more than a snow-job. Freezing E. coli-contaminated food does not kill the pathogens; it preserves them."[143] Describing food poisoning outbreaks as "something of a Chipotle trademark; the recent ones are the fourth and fifth this year [2015], one of which was not disclosed to the public", Miller notes that "a particularly worrisome aspect of the company's serial deficiencies is that there have been at least three unrelated pathogens in the outbreaks – Salmonella and E. coli bacteria and norovirus. In other words, there has been more than a single glitch; suppliers and employees have found a variety of ways to contaminate what Chipotle cavalierly sells (at premium prices) to its customers."[143]
A writer for the North Carolina newspaper The News & Observer called Chipotle's "food with integrity" a "lucrative farce" and a "marketing ploy" by pointing out that organic food is "often grown with manure (an 'all-natural' fertilizer), which can certainly increase the risks of accidentally spreading fecal bacteria like E. coli."[144]
In December 2015, Seattle health officials closed a Seattle-area Chipotle for a day after it had repeatedly had small numbers of violations during recent consecutive inspections that previously would not have generated a closure order.[145] On December 10, 2015, CEO Steve Ells released a press statement apologizing for 2015 outbreaks and promised changes to minimize the risks of future outbreaks.[146]
March 2008 hepatitis outbreak[edit]
In March and April 2008, the Community Epidemiology Branch of the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency traced a hepatitis A outbreak in San Diego County to a single Chipotle restaurant located in La Mesa, California in which 22 customers were infected with the virus.[147][148]
April 2008 norovirus outbreak[edit]
In 2008, Chipotle was implicated in a norovirus outbreak in Kent, Ohio, where over 400 people became ill after eating at a Chipotle restaurant.[149] Officials at the Ohio Department of Health said that the outbreak was caused by Norovirus Genotype G2.[150] Many of the victims were students at Kent State University.[151] The initial source of the outbreak was never found.
February 2009 Campylobacter jejuni outbreak[edit]
In 2009, an investigation by the Minnesota Department of Health traced an outbreak of campylobacteriosis to a Chipotle Mexican Grill in Apple Valley, Minnesota.[152][153][154] The investigation found that chicken was sometimes served undercooked by the restaurant and determined that lettuce which had been cross-contaminated with raw or undercooked chicken was the vector for the outbreak.[155][156][third-party source needed]
July 2015 E. coli outbreak[edit]
In early November 2015, The Oregonian reported that there was a little-known E. coli outbreak that had occurred earlier in July in which five persons were infected with the O157:H7 strain of E. coli. The outbreak was traced to a single Chipotle location in Seattle and that the incident was not publicized at that time.[157][158] Seattle public health officials defended their actions at that time by saying that the outbreak was over by the time they made an association with Chipotle. Health officials were unable to trace the source of the July outbreak and said that the cause of the July outbreak is unrelated to the October/November outbreak.[157]
August 2015 norovirus outbreak[edit]
Another norovirus outbreak was confirmed to have occurred in August 2015 at a Simi Valley, California location in which 80 customers and 18 employees reported becoming ill.[159][160] Ventura County health inspectors found various health violations during two inspections following the outbreak report.[161] Despite those violations, the county health officials did not close the restaurant and allowed it to continue to operate.[159] In a January 2016 article, the New York Times reported that the number of victims involved in the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak was actually 207, twice the number that was reported earlier.[162]
In an unusual move, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California in conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration has gotten a federal grand jury to issue a subpoena in January 2016 as part of a criminal investigation seeking documents and information from Chipotle concerning the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak.[162][163] As of January 2016[update], it is too early to tell which organization is the actual target of the investigation. In most cases involving norovirus outbreaks that involved a single location, state and/or local authorities are the usual jurisdiction responsible in the investigation and prosecution of those type of cases. However, Ventura County officials had been criticized for their handling of parts of their investigation, and for allowing the restaurant to continue to operate after finding health violations during consecutive inspections.
Less than two weeks later, a federal class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California claiming that Chipotle knowingly allowed an ill kitchen manager to work for two days before sending that person home. Then, the restaurant actively deep-cleaned the restaurant to remove all traces of contamination prior to notifying the Ventura County Environmental Health Division of the existing outbreak, hindering their investigation. The lawsuit also claimed that the number of known victims was as high as 234 and estimates that the number of meals that the infected employee may have come in contact with could be as high 3,000.[164][165][166]
August 2015 Salmonella outbreak[edit]
At almost the same time as the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak, Minnesota health officials confirmed a Salmonella outbreak that affected 17 Minneapolis-area Chipotle restaurants in mid-August 2015. The source of the outbreak was traced back to contaminated tomatoes that were grown in Mexico.[167][168] The Minnesota Department of Health reported that samples from 45 victims were tested and found that their illness was caused by the Salmonella Newport bacterium as determined by DNA profiling.[169] Later, the state officials reported that the total of persons who became infected was increased to 64 and the number Chipotle locations in which they had acquired the bacterium was increased to 22, all located within the state of Minnesota.[170]
October 2015 E. coli outbreak[edit]
In October 2015, at least 22 persons were reported to have gotten sick after eating at several different Chipotle locations in the states of Washington and Oregon. At that time, an epidemiologist for the Washington Health Department said the culprit appeared to be a Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli bacterium, but they were still waiting the outcome of several laboratory tests before they can give a definitive result.[171][172][173] As a precaution, Chipotle had closed 43 stores in Washington and Oregon pending the results and recommendations of the involved health authorities. On November 5, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had reported that the number of persons reported ill had risen to 40 known cases and that the bacteria samples taken from 7 infected persons in Washington and 3 persons in Oregon states were confirmed to be infected by the same strain of E. coli, the Shiga toxin-producing STEC O26 strain, as determined by DNA profiling.[174] At least 12 persons required hospitalization, but no fatalities. As of November 2015, Health authorities were still trying to trace the exact source of the bacterial contamination, but suspected fresh produce.[175]
On November 12, the CDC increased the number of known cases to 50, the number of persons requiring hospitalization to 14, and the number of DNA fingerprint confirmations to 33.[176] Through a match via Pulsenet, the DNA fingerprint also matched a recent case in Minnesota, but the ill person did not eat at Chipotle. The source of the bacteria infection still had not yet been determined at the time of the report released by the CDC and the CDC is trying to use the more definitive, but more time consuming whole genome sequencing procedure to see if they are able to determine the relationships between all of the STEC O26 cases. In the meantime, Chipotle reopened the closed restaurants on November 11 after disposing all of the food within the closed facilities and deep cleaning those facilities.[177]
On November 20, the CDC reported that the number of STEC O26 cases, as determined by DNA fingerprinting, had increased to 45 with 16 persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to six.[178] Besides Oregon and Washington, new cases were reported in the states of Minnesota, California, New York, and Ohio.[179] 43 out of 45 of the affected individuals had reported that they had eaten at a Chipotle in the week before they had become sick.
On December 4, the CDC reported that the number of STEC O26 cases, as determined by DNA fingerprinting, had increased to 52 with 20 persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to nine.[180] New cases were reported in the states of California (1), Illinois (1), Maryland (1), Ohio (2), Pennsylvania (1), and Washington (1).[181]
The price of shares for Chipotle stock dropped a further 12% immediately after the CDC had issued their update on November 20.[182] Share prices had been dropping since the initial announcement of the E. coli outbreak in late October with investors unsure if the drop in share prices just a temporary aberration and that Chipotle management is handling the incident as well as they could. Chipotle has since hired a consultant to improve their food safety program and have their program reviewed by both the CDC and FDA.[183]
On February 1, 2016, the CDC official closed their investigations on the larger E. coli that started in Pacific Northwest in October 2015 and also the smaller outbreak that started in Kansas and Oklahoma in November since no new cases were reported since December 1.[184] In their final report, the CDC stated that 55 persons in 11 states were infected with the same strain of STEC O26 during the major outbreak with 21 of those persons requiring hospitalization. The five persons infected in the later outbreak were made ill by a generically different strain of STEC O26. The CDC also reported that federal and local health and food safety authorities were unable to detect traces of the microorganisms in any of the food samples taken from the suspected restaurants or from their supply chain. The CDC, FDA, and the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service were unable to determine a point source that was in common in the meals that were consumed by all the victims since some of the restaurants were located far apart and had obtained some of their ingredients from different suppliers while other consumers of the suspected suppliers were not affected.
November 2015 E. coli cases[edit]
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on December 21 that five more people became ill after eating at two Chipotle restaurants located in Kansas and Oklahoma in late November. Preliminary DNA fingerprinting results appear to indicated that the newer cases were caused by a different strain of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O26. Scientists are waiting for the results of the more definitive whole genome sequencing analyses to determine if the organisms responsible for this outbreak are genetically related to the E. coli that are responsible for causing the outbreak that had started in Oregon and Washington in late October and thus an extension of that outbreak. The agency has not yet determined which food is responsible for the outbreak.[185] The Food and Drug Administration reported that they are trying to determine how the bacteria in these cases, along with the earlier Oregon, Washington, and other multi-state cases, might have been propagated through the food supply chain.[186]
December 2015 norovirus outbreak[edit]




The closed restaurant on December 16, 2015


In December 2015, eighty students at Boston College were sickened after eating at a single Chipotle restaurant. Affected students had been tested for both E. coli and norovirus in order to determine the cause of the illnesses.[187] Although it would take as long as two days before the results of more definitive tests became known, public health investigators reported that preliminary tests pointed to the presence of norovirus.[188] The health inspectors for the City of Boston had since closed this particular location on December 7 for a number of health violations that included maintaining meats at a too low of a temperature on the serving line and for allowing a sick employee to work at the time of the inspection.[189]
On December 10, officials from the Boston Public Health Commission reported that tests had identified a single strain of norovirus that is responsible for this particular outbreak.[190] Boston Globe reported on December 10 that 141 persons were reported to have gotten ill and that some of the newer victims had not visited Chipotle before contracting the virus[191] and most likely became infected by being in close proximity to someone who had gotten ill at Chipotle, such as a roommate or dorm-mate.[190] Boston authorities traced the cause of the outbreak to a sick employee who was allowed to work on the day of the outbreak. Chipotle has since fired the employee and also the manager who knowingly allowed the ill worker to complete his shift instead of following health codes.[192]
Consequences[edit]
On February 8, 2016, Chipotle closed all of its eateries nationwide for a few hours during the morning for an all-staff meeting on food safety.[193] The company hired a new head of food safety, who instituted changes including having all employees wash hands every half hour, having two employees verify that produce like onions, jalapeños and avocados have been immersed in hot water for five seconds to kill germs on their exteriors, and using Pascalization to pre-treat food ingredients.[194]
Since the series of food-poisoning outbreaks in 2015 lowered trust in the product, Chipotle has tried to lure back its customers with free food and heavier advertising. Same-store sales increased 17.8% percent in the first quarter of 2017.[195]

Lawsuit[edit]
In November 2016, three men filed a class-action lawsuit against Chipotle alleging that a burrito was listed as containing only 300 calories, when in fact it contained more. They are seeking "unspecified damages and for an injunction against the company to prevent it from posting what it calls misleading information on its food."[196][197][198]
Advertising and publicity[edit]




People line up outside a Chipotle in East Lansing, Michigan during a "Free Burrito Day"


In the past, Chipotle mainly relied on billboards, radio ads, and word of mouth to advertise.[30] In 2012, Chipotle aired its first nationally televised commercial during the 54th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony.[199] In 2010, the company initiated an ad campaign that mocks advice given to Chipotle by advertising agencies.[200] Chipotle has run many promotions giving out free food to potential customers, especially when opening a new store. Stores also give out free burritos on certain holidays; for instance, on Halloween, some locations have had promotions in which free burritos are given to people who come dressed as a burrito. Chipotle gave away free burritos to reporters during the 1997 trial of Timothy McVeigh, which took place in Chipotle's hometown of Denver.[201] In addition, stores offered free burritos to those displaced by Hurricane Katrina.[202] Chipotle received attention when Ozzy Osbourne's reality show The Osbournes featured the company's burritos heavily.[29] For Halloween 2010, Chipotle announced that customers dressed as a processed food product would receive a burrito for $2. The event was part of a $1 million fundraiser for Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution called "Boorito 2010: The Horrors of Processed Food."[203] For "Boorito 2011", customers dressed in costumes "inspired by family farms" will receive a menu item for $2, with proceeds from the promotion going to The Chipotle Cultivate Foundation and Farm Aid. The promotion is aimed to increase awareness of family farms.[204] Also in support of family farms, Chipotle released music videos of Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Willie Nelson.[205] On September 12, 2013, Chipotle released an animated short called The Scarecrow, with a companion mobile video game; both feature a narrative heavily critical of industrial farming, but little in the way of direct marketing for the chain.[206] The short features a cover of "Pure Imagination" from Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, sung by Fiona Apple.[207] It was named one of the worst advertisements of 2013 by The Wall Street Journal.[208]
In 2011, Chipotle created the "Farm Team", which is a rewards program available only by invitation from restaurant managers. The Farm Team members have access to a special Chipotle website, where members can earn rewards, i.e. free food and T-shirts. The site offers members to, "learn where Chipotle’s food comes from, take quizzes and polls, play games and watch videos about the company".[209] In April 2014, the Farm Team program was shut down.[210]
Chipotle sponsors Team Garmin-Barracuda (formerly Team Garmin-Chipotle, Team Garmin-Slipstream, Team Garmin-Transitions and Team Garmin-Cervélo) of the International Cycling Union,[211][212] and is an official team partner of the Boston Celtics,[213] and the Boston Bruins.[214] In June 2009, Chipotle sponsored free screenings of Food, Inc., a film that criticizes the corporate food industry. Founder Steve Ells stated that he hoped the film would make customers appreciate Chipotle's Food With Integrity policy.[215] From May until September 2009, Chipotle ran a contest on mychipotle.com, a microsite which had a competition for the best user-created audio and video presentations about different combinations of ingredients.[216][217] In July 2010, Chipotle began a campaign to support healthier lunch alternatives for students, in which money will be donated to The Lunch Box program based on how many spam E-mails consumers forward to a company E-mail address.[218] For Chipotle's 18 year anniversary, the company began wrapping its burritos in gold foil as part of a larger promotion to draw attention to its Food With Integrity mantra.[219] Also as part of the gold foil campaign, Chipotle is offering prizes for customer-created pictures of items wrapped in gold foil. Chipotle hired comedian Amy Sedaris to create a comedic how-to video on wrapping with gold foil, and spread the video using Twitter.[220] In March 2013, Chipotle pulled its sponsorship of a Boy Scouts of America event, citing that organization's ban on LGBT members.[221]

On December 16, 2015, Chipotle ran full page ads in both The Boston Globe and Boston Herald apologizing for the recent norovirus outbreak linked to Chipotle's Cleveland Circle location. The ad, containing a letter by Chipotle founder and co-CEO Steve Ells, affirmed the company's commitment to food safety.[222]
On March 14, 2016, a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) administrative law judge concluded that Chipotle’s social media policy, and more specifically its application towards an employee who posted tweets regarding wages and working conditions, violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).[223] A former Chipotle employee in Havertown, Pennsylvania, wrote a series of tweets from his personal account about hourly workers being required to work on snow days. Chipotle instructed the employee to delete the tweets. The NLRB judge determined that Chipotle’s request to delete the tweets violated the NLRA even though the employee was not disciplined as a result of his tweets.[224]
Architecture[edit]




The exterior of a Chipotle in Durham, North Carolina


Architecturally, all Chipotle restaurants are built using most of the same materials (plywood, corrugated metal, stainless steel, exposed ductwork), although each store is unique.[20][225] The interiors have been described as having an "industrial, sheet metal look".[226] Chipotle has built restaurants using white ceramic tile instead of stainless steel.[227] It costs the company approximately $850,000 to open a new restaurant.[228] When the first Chipotle opened, Steve Ells asked his friend, sculptor Bruce Gueswel, to design the chairs and a styled Mayan king whose face was loosely based on that of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., a personal inspiration of Gueswel, for the restaurant. Both items were made from wood and metal. Gueswel has continued to design and build the art and chairs for all subsequent Chipotle restaurants.[229]
Most Chipotle locations display a photograph of the original restaurant, which is near the University of Denver campus on Evans Avenue.[20] Instead of a photograph of itself, the original location has a photograph of the Dolly Madison Ice Cream that previously occupied the location. In 2010, Chipotle began opening "A Model" restaurants, which are smaller concept locations, citing the lower costs of development and occupancy.[230] Chipotle uses environmentally friendly packaging, with bowls made from recycled newsprint, unbleached tray liners, and napkins and cups made from postconsumer waste.[231]
Chipotle's architectural design team incorporates the principles of sustainable architecture in their projects. The "green" restaurant in Gurnee, Illinois features an on-site six kilowatt wind turbine, which generates about 10% of the restaurant's electrical needs. The Gurnee restaurant has received Platinum level LEED certification from U.S. Green Building Council.[232] A restaurant in Tulsa, Oklahoma, uses recycled drywall, low-VOC paint, and energy-efficient appliances.[233] A Chipotle restaurant in Austin, Texas was the first to receive a four-star rating from the city's Green Building Program.[234] Additionally, Chipotle has made arrangements to add solar panels to 75 of its restaurants.[232] Chipotle has contracted to clean its stores in New York City and Long Island, with "plant-based, environmentally preferable cleaning supplies and technologies." The cleansers are readily biodegradable and non-toxic to humans or aquatic life.[235]
Chipotle was the defendant in a lawsuit for failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Maurizio Antoninetti, a customer who used a wheelchair, claimed he was denied the "Chipotle Experience", because he was unable to see the food preparation. The case against the company was upheld in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,[236] and the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear Chipotle's appeal, leaving the Ninth Circuit's ruling intact.[237] Chipotle has "an official disability policy of bringing ingredients to the tables of diners with disabilities and doing tableside preparation." Chipotle is retrofitting restaurants affected by the ruling, replacing the walls in front of the food preparation area with lower ones or transparent panels. They are incorporating the new design elements into new restaurants.[236] The case was one of over twenty ADA-related lawsuits filed by Antoninetti, who died in 2011.[236][238]
Other restaurant units[edit]

Pizzeria Locale is a fast casual pizza restaurant formed as a partnership with Pizzeria Locale, a full-service pizza restaurant in Boulder, Colorado. The original Pizzeria Locale owners, Bobby Stuckey and Lachlan Mackinnon-Patterson, would continue to own their original location while Chipotle would increase its stake in the chain over time.[48] As of February 2017, the chain has seven locations.[51]
Tasty Made is a burger restaurant concept that Chipotle first opened in Lancaster, Ohio in October 2016.[239] On July 29, 2016, the company announced the opening of its first Tasty Made burger restaurant in the fall. The first location was revealed to be in Lancaster, Ohio. Ohio was selected as culinary manager Nate Appleman and national training director David Chrisman are both from the state and helped design the concept.[240] Tasty Made was announced to have a focused menu like early burger restaurants which were limited to burgers, fries and milkshakes.[51] Chipotle had trademarked Better Burger earlier in the year.


Defunct


Soul Daddy was a soul food fast casual restaurant that was owned by ANGR Holdings, LLC, and was managed by Chipotle after purchasing Ellis' stake in the company. The restaurant had three locations that had operated for less than 5 weeks in 2011 before closing.[241]
ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen was an Asian fast-casual concept restaurant that was opened by Chipotle in September 2011.[45] The company said that the new restaurant "would follow the Chipotle service format and its focus on 'food with integrity' in ingredients."[46] Chipotle's plan was to start with only one store, and see how the restaurant works out before expanding the concept.[47] By July 2016, the chain has 15 restaurants.[51] All ShopHouse locations were closed on March 17, 2017.[242]

Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (/tʃᵻˈpoʊtleɪ/)[6] is an American chain of fast casual restaurants in the United States, United Kingdom,[7] Canada,[8][9] Germany,[10] and France,[11] specializing in tacos and Mission-style[12][13] burritos. Its name derives from chipotle, the Nahuatl name for a smoked and dried jalapeño chili pepper.[14] The company currently trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CMG.[15]
The company has released a mission statement called Food with Integrity, which highlights its efforts in using naturally-grown ingredients,[6] and serves more naturally raised meat than any other restaurant chain.[16] Chipotle is one of the first chains of fast casual dining establishments.[17] Competitors in the fast-casual Mexican market include Qdoba Mexican Grill, Moe's Southwest Grill, Rubio's Coastal Grill, Pancheros Mexican Grill, Freebirds World Burrito, and Baja Fresh.[18]
Founded by Steve Ells on July 13, 1993. Chipotle had 16 restaurants (all in Colorado) when McDonald's Corporation became a major investor in 1998. By the time McDonald's fully divested itself from Chipotle in 2006,[19] the chain had grown to over 500 locations.
With more than 2,000 locations,[2] Chipotle had a net income of US$475.6 million and a staff of more than 45,000 employees in 2015.[2]

History[edit]




The first Chipotle, near the campus of the University of Denver


Founder Steve Ells attended the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York. Afterward, he became a line cook for Jeremiah Tower at Stars in San Francisco.[20] There, Ells observed the popularity of the taquerías and San Francisco burritos in the Mission District. In 1993, Ells took what he learned in San Francisco[21] and opened the first Chipotle Mexican Grill in Denver, Colorado, in a former Dolly Madison Ice Cream store at 1644 East Evans Avenue,[22] near the University of Denver campus, using an $85,000 loan from his father.[19] Ells and his father calculated that the store would need to sell 107 burritos per day to be profitable. After one month, the original restaurant was selling over 1,000 burritos a day.[15] The second store opened in 1995 using Chipotle's cash flow, and the third was opened using an SBA loan. To fund more growth, Ells' father invested $1.5 million. Afterwards, Ells created a board of directors and business plan, raising an additional $1.8 million for the company.[23] Ells had originally planned to use funds from the first Chipotle to open a fine-dining restaurant, but instead focused on Chipotle Mexican Grill when the restaurants saw success.[24][25]
In 1998, the first restaurant outside of Colorado opened in Kansas City, Missouri.[26] The company opened its first location in Minnesota by opening near the campus of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis in March 1999.[27]
In 1998, McDonald's made an initial minority investment in the company. By 2001, the company had grown to be Chipotle's largest investor.[19] The investment from McDonald's allowed the firm to quickly expand, from 16 restaurants in 1998 to over 500 by 2005.[28] On January 26, 2006, Chipotle made its initial public offering (IPO) after increasing the share price twice due to high pre-IPO demand. In its first day as a public company, the stock rose exactly 100%, resulting in the best U.S.-based IPO in six years, and the second-best IPO for a restaurant after Boston Market. The money from the offering was then used to fund new store growth.[29]
In October 2006, McDonald's fully divested from Chipotle.[30] This was part of a larger initiative for McDonald's to divest all of its non-core business restaurants — Chipotle, Donatos Pizza, and Boston Market — so that it could focus on the main McDonald's chain.[31] McDonald's invested approximately $360 million into Chipotle, and took out $1.5 billion.[23] McDonald's had attempted to get Chipotle to add drive-through windows and a breakfast menu, which Ells resisted.[32][33] In 2008, Chipotle opened its first location outside of the United States in Toronto.[9]
In a list of fastest-growing restaurant chains in 2009, Chipotle was ranked eighth, based on increases in U.S. sales over the past year,[34] and in 2010 Chipotle was ranked third.[35] Consumer Reports ranked Chipotle as the best Mexican fast-food chain in 2011.[36] The company serves approximately 750,000 customers per day.[37]
In December 2010, Chipotle hired chef Nate Appleman to develop new cuisine. Appleman has won Rising Star Chef from the James Beard Foundation, was named "Best New Chef" by Food & Wine magazine, and competed on The Next Iron Chef.[38]
In 2010, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) audited Chipotle's Minneapolis restaurants, and found that some employees had been hired using fraudulent documents. In December, Chipotle fired 450 employees from its Minneapolis restaurants as a result of the audit, resulting in protests by local groups.[39][40] In February 2011, ICE expanded the audit to include 60 restaurants in Virginia and Washington, D.C.[41] which resulted in 40 workers being fired. In April 2011, the criminal division of the Attorney General's office in Washington, D.C., joined the case, and ICE agents began interviewing employees at 20 to 25 restaurants in other locations, such as Los Angeles and Atlanta.[42] In response to the government investigations, Chipotle hired former director of ICE Julie Myers Wood and high-profile attorneys Robert Luskin and Gregory B. Craig.[43]
Other restaurant expansion[edit]
In 2011, Steve Ells was a judge for the TV show America's Next Great Restaurant and investor of ANGR Holdings, the company that will be running the winning concept's restaurants. Chipotle has agreed to purchase Ells' investment in ANGR at his cost, provide support for ANGR operations, and invest a total of $2.3 million in cash contributions.[44]
In September 2011, Chipotle opened an Asian fast-casual concept restaurant named ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen in Washington, D.C.[45] The company has said the new restaurant "would follow the Chipotle service format and its focus on 'food with integrity' in ingredients."[46] Chipotle's plan was to start with only one store, and see how the restaurant works out before expanding the concept.[47]
On December 18, 2013, the company revealed that it had opened its first fast-food pizza chain in Denver back in May 2013. According to Associated Press, Chipotle partnered with a local full-service restaurant called Pizzeria Locale to create a fast-food version of the eatery, keeping its name. The company plans to open at least two more pizzerias in the Denver area.[48]
In April 2014, Chipotle announced an increase in menu prices for the first time in nearly three years, due to increasing costs for steak, avocados, and cheese. The price increase was expected to be rolled out from the end of second quarter of 2014 through the end of the third quarter.[49] In late 2015, Chipotle expanded its mobile strategy through delivery partnerships with tech startups like Tapingo, a delivery service that targets college campuses.[50]
On July 29, 2016, the company announced the opening of its first Tasty Made burger restaurant in the fall. Chipotle was still dealing with the various virus outbreaks with additional marketing. The company was also reducing the number of new stores for the year from 235 to 220.[51]
International[edit]




The second Chipotle Mexican Grill location in London, located on Baker Street


According to an article in The Motley Fool, Chipotle had 17 locations outside of the United States by October 2014 with the majority in Canada, and the UK was in the process of opening more locations.[52] The rate of overseas expansion was slower than expected.[53] Many of the press reviewers thought that the food was overpriced for their area.[11][54]
As of 2017 there are 26 locations outside of the United States with 11 locations in Canada (Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver), 6 locations in The United Kingdom (London), 3 in France (Paris), and 1 in Germany (Frankfurt).[better source needed][2] [55]
Canada[edit]
In August 2008, Chipotle opened its first location outside of the United States in Toronto.[9] The second location in Toronto–and in all of Canada–was not opened until 2010.[53]
The first Canadian location outside of the Toronto area was opened in Vancouver in December 2012.[56] A second Vancouver-area location was opened in Burnaby in October 2014[57] followed by a third in Surrey in January 2016[58] and a fourth in Langley in October 2016.[59]
The first location in the nation's capital of Ottawa was opened in February 2017 at the Rideau Centre.[60]
United Kingdom[edit]
Chipotle expanded to Europe with the first European restaurant opening in May 2010 in London.[7][61][62] A second location open in London in September 2011.[63] The following year, three additional locations were quickly opened in the London area.[64] After this growth spurt, the rate of further expansion in London slowed greatly with the sixth location appearing in 2013[65] and the seventh in June 2015.[66] Although Chipotle blames the slow growth in the United Kingdom on the British unfamiliarity with Mexican foods,[67] several locally owned burrito chains had opened locations across the United Kingdom during the same interval.[68]
France[edit]
The first location in France opened in Paris in May 2012.[11][69]
Expansion in France was much slower than that in the United Kingdom or Canada, with a second location in Paris opening in 2013[70] and a third location in 2014.[71] At 7,000 square feet, the restaurant at La Défense is, as of 2015[update], the largest Chipotle location in the world, while a typical Chipotle restaurant is usually between 2,200 and 2,500 square feet.[72] A fourth Parisian location was opened in Levallois-Perret in 2015[73] followed by a fifth[74] and a sixth[75] Parisian location in 2016, both in Saint-Germain-des-Prés.
Germany[edit]
The first and, so far, only location in Germany opened in Frankfurt in August 2013.[10][54]
Corporate management[edit]
Chipotle's team includes a residing corporate office of managers and its board of directors. Members of both teams are appointed to serve on committees: audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance.
The top management team consists of the Chief Executive Officers, Steve Ells; the Chief Financial Officer, Jack R. Hartung; the Chief Marketing and Development Officer, Mark Crumpacker.[76] The current board of directors consists of: Steve Ells, Patrick Flynn, Albert Baldocchi, Neil Flanzraich, Darlene Friedman, Stephen Gillet, Kimbal Musk and John Charlesworth.[77]
Founder Steve Ells serves as chairman and Chief executive officer,[78] and has a 1.25% stake in the company.[79] The labor-market research firm Glassdoor reported that Steve Ells earned $29 million in 2014, versus a median of $19,000 for Chipotle's workers, making the CEO-to-worker pay ratio 1522:1.[80]
Operation and distribution[edit]
All of Chipotle's restaurants are company-owned, rather than franchised.[81] As of December 2012[update], 1430 restaurants have since opened throughout the United States and Canada, with locations in 43 states, Ontario, British Columbia, and the District of Columbia.[82][83]
The field team are the employees who work closely with but not directly within specific restaurants. The field support system includes apprentice team leaders (step up from restaurateurs), team leaders or area managers, team directors and regional directors (not atypical for them to oversee more than fifty locations).[84] Because Chipotle does not franchise, all restaurants are corporately owned. Thus, whenever Chipotle is in the process of launching a new location, the field team hires a new general manager and trains them at a current location so that they will be ready for the new location when it opens for business. The corporate office takes care of finding and funding new locations as well.[85]
Menu[edit]




A Chipotle restaurant in Brandon, Florida, having the typical service-line layout with menu above


Chipotle's menu consists of four items: burritos, bowls, tacos, and salads. The price of each item is based on the choice of chicken, pork carnitas, barbacoa, steak, tofu-based "sofritas",[86][87] chorizo (chicken and pork), or vegetarian (with guacamole, which would be at an extra charge otherwise). Additional optional toppings are offered free of charge, including: rice, beans, four types of salsa, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce.[88][89] When asked in 2007 about expanding the menu, Steve Ells said, "[I]t's important to keep the menu focused, because if you just do a few things, you can ensure that you do them better than anybody else."[90] Chipotle also offers a children's menu.[91][92] Most restaurants sell beer and margaritas in addition to soft drinks and fruit drinks.[93]
The majority of food is prepared in each restaurant. Some exceptions are the beans and carnitas, which are prepared at a central kitchen in Chicago, Illinois.[94] None of the restaurants have freezers, microwave ovens, or can openers.[95]




Chicken Burrito Bowl


The chain experimented with breakfast foods at two airports in the Washington (D.C.) metropolitan area but decided against expanding the menu in that direction.[96][97][98] Starting in 2009, selected restaurants had offered a pozole soup,[99][100][101] which has since been discontinued.
In June 2015, Chipotle began test marketing a pork and chicken chorizo-type sausage as a new protein option at selected locations in the Kansas City area.[102][103][104] Some food writers have expressed their health related concerns over the protein's relatively high sodium content since a 4-ounce serving contains 293 calories and 803 milligrams of sodium[105] while the American Heart Association’s recommended daily amount is less than 1,500 milligrams of sodium.[106] In contrast, the protein options with next highest sodium contents are Barbacoa with 530 milligrams and sofritas with 555 milligrams.[105] An earlier version on the Mexican sausage was tested in Denver and New York City in 2011,[107] but that test was terminated when that version of the sausage was perceived as looking too greasy.[108] As of fall 2016, chorizo is available nationwide.
Chipotle accepts fax orders, and in 2005 the company added the ability to order online from their website. For both online and fax orders, customers proceed to the front of the line to pay for pre-ordered food.[109] In 2009, Chipotle released an app for the iPhone that allows users to find nearby Chipotle locations, place an order, and prepay with a credit card.[110] In 2013, Chipotle released an Android app that allows users to locate nearby Chipotle locations, place an order, prepay with a credit or gift card, and access favorites and recent orders.[111][112]

In 2003, a Center for Science in the Public Interest report stated that Chipotle's burritos contain over 1,000 calories, which is nearly equivalent to two meals' worth of food.[113][114] MSNBC Health.com placed the burritos on their list of the "20 Worst Foods in America" because of their high caloric content and high sodium.[115] When a burrito with carnitas, rice, vegetables, cheese, guacamole, and salsa was compared with a typical Big Mac, the burrito had more fat, cholesterol, carbohydrates, and sodium than the Big Mac, but it also had more protein and fiber.[116] The restaurant has also received praise – Health.com included the restaurant in its list of the "Healthiest Fast Food Restaurants".[117]
Chipotle's vegetarian options include rice, black beans, fajita vegetables (onions and bell peppers), salsa, guacamole and cheese.[118] All items other than the meats, cheese, sour cream, and honey vinaigrette dressing are vegan.[118] As of late 2013, Chipotle developed a new cooking strategy for the pinto beans, eliminating the bacon and making them vegetarian and vegan-friendly.[119] The cheese is processed with vegetable-based rennet in order to be suitable for vegetarians.[118] In April 2010, Chipotle began testing a vegan "Garden Blend" option, which is a plant-based meat alternative marinated in chipotle adobo, at six locations in the U.S.[120][121] The flour tortillas used for the burritos and soft tacos are the only items that contain gluten.[118]
Food sourcing[edit]
In 1999, while looking for ways to improve the taste of the carnitas,[20] Steve Ells was prompted by an article written by Edward Behr to visit Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs).[122] Ells found the CAFOs "horrific", and began sourcing from open-range pork suppliers. This caused an increase in both the price and the sales of the carnitas burritos.[61]
In 2001, Chipotle released a mission statement called Food With Integrity, which highlighted Chipotle's efforts to increase their use of naturally raised meat, organic produce, and dairy without added hormones.[6] Chipotle only uses the leg and thigh meat from its chickens; the breast meat is sold to Panera Bread.[123]

Founder Steve Ells has testified before the United States Congress in support of the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act, which aims to reduce the amount of antibiotics given to farm animals.[61][124]
Since 2006, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW), a Floridian farmworker organization, has protested Chipotle’s refusal to sign a Fair Food agreement, which would commit the restaurant chain to pay a penny-per-pound premium on its Florida tomatoes to boost tomato harvesters’ wages, and to only buy Florida tomatoes from growers who comply with the Fair Food Code of Conduct.[125] In 2009, the creators of the documentary film Food, Inc. (along with 31 other leaders in the sustainable food movement) signed an open letter of support for the CIW’s campaign, stating that, “If Chipotle is sincere in its wishes to reform its supply chain, the time has come to work with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers as a true partner in the protection of farmworkers rights.”[126] In September 2009, Chipotle announced that it would sidestep partnership with the CIW and instead work directly with East Coast Growers and Packers to increase wages for its tomato pickers.[127] CEO Steve Ells has framed the dispute as a fundamental issue of control, stating that, “the CIW wants us to sign a contract that would let them control Chipotle's decisions regarding food in the future."[128] In October 2012, Chipotle Mexican Grill signed an agreement with the CIW and became the 11th company to join the organization's Fair Food Program.[129]
In January 2015, Chipotle pulled carnitas from its menu in a third of its restaurants; company officials cited animal welfare problems at one of the suppliers, found during a regular audit, as the reason.[130] Subsequently, a false rumor spread online claiming it was done to appease Muslims who consider pork to be unclean, leading to some protests on social media.[131] The company still uses antibiotic-free and hormone-free steak in its restaurants, despite being briefly forced to "serve beef that is not naturally raised" during the summer of 2013, posting an in-store notice each time that occurred.[132] Roberto Ferdman of The Washington Post opined that Chipotle's stated mission to sell "food with integrity" may be "untenable" if meat producers continue to breach Chipotle's ethical standards.[130]
Also in 2015, Chipotle stopped using genetically modified corn and soy beans in their foods, claiming to be the first nationwide restaurant to cook completely GMO free.[133] This was done in response to increasing consumer demand for GMO free products.
Food safety[edit]

 "How Chipotle made hundreds of people barf". Vox report dated January 6, 2016, explaining Chipotle's "food safety crisis".


Since 2008, a former Kansas State University food safety professor has accused Chipotle of confusing the public by using such terms as "naturally raised meats", "organic ingredients", and "locally sourced" and trying to equate those terms with food safety.[134] In rebuttal, a Chipotle spokesperson told The Daily Beast that "all of our practices have always been very much within industry norms. It's important to note that restaurant practices are regulated by health codes, and restaurants are routinely inspected by health officials. Everything we have done in our supply chain and in our restaurants has been within industry norms."[134] Yet, FiveThirtyEight pointed out that the 2015 norovirus outbreak appears to be unusual[135] and others are criticizing their food sourcing or handling practices.[136][137] MarketWatch wrote that the result of all of these outbreaks will be to force Chipotle to obtain their produce from larger corporate farms that can afford the more extensive microbial food-safety testing programs and to process vegetables at centralized locations instead of at the individual stores, both of which are industry-standard practices that the company had previously criticized.[138] The New York Times implied that the company's insistence on maintaining its long standing rhetoric about "food integrity" seemed to be quite opposite with the realities of recent current events and made it appear that the management was just ignoring their current problems.[139] It also has been pointed out that Chipotle's current record-keeping system is actually hindering the health authorities' investigation in locating the sources of the various infections.[139]
A writer for the magazine Popular Science pointed out that Chipotle had publicly acknowledged that they "may be at a higher risk for food-borne illness outbreaks than some competitors due to our use of fresh produce and meats rather than frozen, and our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation."[140][141][142] Henry I. Miller, a medical researcher and columnist and the founding director of the FDA's Office of Biotechnology, asked: "One wonders whether Chipotle’s "traditional methods" include employees' neglecting to wash their hands before preparing food, which is how norovirus is usually spread. And the fresh versus frozen dichotomy is nothing more than a snow-job. Freezing E. coli-contaminated food does not kill the pathogens; it preserves them."[143] Describing food poisoning outbreaks as "something of a Chipotle trademark; the recent ones are the fourth and fifth this year [2015], one of which was not disclosed to the public", Miller notes that "a particularly worrisome aspect of the company's serial deficiencies is that there have been at least three unrelated pathogens in the outbreaks – Salmonella and E. coli bacteria and norovirus. In other words, there has been more than a single glitch; suppliers and employees have found a variety of ways to contaminate what Chipotle cavalierly sells (at premium prices) to its customers."[143]
A writer for the North Carolina newspaper The News & Observer called Chipotle's "food with integrity" a "lucrative farce" and a "marketing ploy" by pointing out that organic food is "often grown with manure (an 'all-natural' fertilizer), which can certainly increase the risks of accidentally spreading fecal bacteria like E. coli."[144]
In December 2015, Seattle health officials closed a Seattle-area Chipotle for a day after it had repeatedly had small numbers of violations during recent consecutive inspections that previously would not have generated a closure order.[145] On December 10, 2015, CEO Steve Ells released a press statement apologizing for 2015 outbreaks and promised changes to minimize the risks of future outbreaks.[146]
March 2008 hepatitis outbreak[edit]
In March and April 2008, the Community Epidemiology Branch of the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency traced a hepatitis A outbreak in San Diego County to a single Chipotle restaurant located in La Mesa, California in which 22 customers were infected with the virus.[147][148]
April 2008 norovirus outbreak[edit]
In 2008, Chipotle was implicated in a norovirus outbreak in Kent, Ohio, where over 400 people became ill after eating at a Chipotle restaurant.[149] Officials at the Ohio Department of Health said that the outbreak was caused by Norovirus Genotype G2.[150] Many of the victims were students at Kent State University.[151] The initial source of the outbreak was never found.
February 2009 Campylobacter jejuni outbreak[edit]
In 2009, an investigation by the Minnesota Department of Health traced an outbreak of campylobacteriosis to a Chipotle Mexican Grill in Apple Valley, Minnesota.[152][153][154] The investigation found that chicken was sometimes served undercooked by the restaurant and determined that lettuce which had been cross-contaminated with raw or undercooked chicken was the vector for the outbreak.[155][156][third-party source needed]
July 2015 E. coli outbreak[edit]
In early November 2015, The Oregonian reported that there was a little-known E. coli outbreak that had occurred earlier in July in which five persons were infected with the O157:H7 strain of E. coli. The outbreak was traced to a single Chipotle location in Seattle and that the incident was not publicized at that time.[157][158] Seattle public health officials defended their actions at that time by saying that the outbreak was over by the time they made an association with Chipotle. Health officials were unable to trace the source of the July outbreak and said that the cause of the July outbreak is unrelated to the October/November outbreak.[157]
August 2015 norovirus outbreak[edit]
Another norovirus outbreak was confirmed to have occurred in August 2015 at a Simi Valley, California location in which 80 customers and 18 employees reported becoming ill.[159][160] Ventura County health inspectors found various health violations during two inspections following the outbreak report.[161] Despite those violations, the county health officials did not close the restaurant and allowed it to continue to operate.[159] In a January 2016 article, the New York Times reported that the number of victims involved in the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak was actually 207, twice the number that was reported earlier.[162]
In an unusual move, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California in conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration has gotten a federal grand jury to issue a subpoena in January 2016 as part of a criminal investigation seeking documents and information from Chipotle concerning the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak.[162][163] As of January 2016[update], it is too early to tell which organization is the actual target of the investigation. In most cases involving norovirus outbreaks that involved a single location, state and/or local authorities are the usual jurisdiction responsible in the investigation and prosecution of those type of cases. However, Ventura County officials had been criticized for their handling of parts of their investigation, and for allowing the restaurant to continue to operate after finding health violations during consecutive inspections.
Less than two weeks later, a federal class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California claiming that Chipotle knowingly allowed an ill kitchen manager to work for two days before sending that person home. Then, the restaurant actively deep-cleaned the restaurant to remove all traces of contamination prior to notifying the Ventura County Environmental Health Division of the existing outbreak, hindering their investigation. The lawsuit also claimed that the number of known victims was as high as 234 and estimates that the number of meals that the infected employee may have come in contact with could be as high 3,000.[164][165][166]
August 2015 Salmonella outbreak[edit]
At almost the same time as the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak, Minnesota health officials confirmed a Salmonella outbreak that affected 17 Minneapolis-area Chipotle restaurants in mid-August 2015. The source of the outbreak was traced back to contaminated tomatoes that were grown in Mexico.[167][168] The Minnesota Department of Health reported that samples from 45 victims were tested and found that their illness was caused by the Salmonella Newport bacterium as determined by DNA profiling.[169] Later, the state officials reported that the total of persons who became infected was increased to 64 and the number Chipotle locations in which they had acquired the bacterium was increased to 22, all located within the state of Minnesota.[170]
October 2015 E. coli outbreak[edit]
In October 2015, at least 22 persons were reported to have gotten sick after eating at several different Chipotle locations in the states of Washington and Oregon. At that time, an epidemiologist for the Washington Health Department said the culprit appeared to be a Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli bacterium, but they were still waiting the outcome of several laboratory tests before they can give a definitive result.[171][172][173] As a precaution, Chipotle had closed 43 stores in Washington and Oregon pending the results and recommendations of the involved health authorities. On November 5, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had reported that the number of persons reported ill had risen to 40 known cases and that the bacteria samples taken from 7 infected persons in Washington and 3 persons in Oregon states were confirmed to be infected by the same strain of E. coli, the Shiga toxin-producing STEC O26 strain, as determined by DNA profiling.[174] At least 12 persons required hospitalization, but no fatalities. As of November 2015, Health authorities were still trying to trace the exact source of the bacterial contamination, but suspected fresh produce.[175]
On November 12, the CDC increased the number of known cases to 50, the number of persons requiring hospitalization to 14, and the number of DNA fingerprint confirmations to 33.[176] Through a match via Pulsenet, the DNA fingerprint also matched a recent case in Minnesota, but the ill person did not eat at Chipotle. The source of the bacteria infection still had not yet been determined at the time of the report released by the CDC and the CDC is trying to use the more definitive, but more time consuming whole genome sequencing procedure to see if they are able to determine the relationships between all of the STEC O26 cases. In the meantime, Chipotle reopened the closed restaurants on November 11 after disposing all of the food within the closed facilities and deep cleaning those facilities.[177]
On November 20, the CDC reported that the number of STEC O26 cases, as determined by DNA fingerprinting, had increased to 45 with 16 persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to six.[178] Besides Oregon and Washington, new cases were reported in the states of Minnesota, California, New York, and Ohio.[179] 43 out of 45 of the affected individuals had reported that they had eaten at a Chipotle in the week before they had become sick.
On December 4, the CDC reported that the number of STEC O26 cases, as determined by DNA fingerprinting, had increased to 52 with 20 persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to nine.[180] New cases were reported in the states of California (1), Illinois (1), Maryland (1), Ohio (2), Pennsylvania (1), and Washington (1).[181]
The price of shares for Chipotle stock dropped a further 12% immediately after the CDC had issued their update on November 20.[182] Share prices had been dropping since the initial announcement of the E. coli outbreak in late October with investors unsure if the drop in share prices just a temporary aberration and that Chipotle management is handling the incident as well as they could. Chipotle has since hired a consultant to improve their food safety program and have their program reviewed by both the CDC and FDA.[183]
On February 1, 2016, the CDC official closed their investigations on the larger E. coli that started in Pacific Northwest in October 2015 and also the smaller outbreak that started in Kansas and Oklahoma in November since no new cases were reported since December 1.[184] In their final report, the CDC stated that 55 persons in 11 states were infected with the same strain of STEC O26 during the major outbreak with 21 of those persons requiring hospitalization. The five persons infected in the later outbreak were made ill by a generically different strain of STEC O26. The CDC also reported that federal and local health and food safety authorities were unable to detect traces of the microorganisms in any of the food samples taken from the suspected restaurants or from their supply chain. The CDC, FDA, and the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service were unable to determine a point source that was in common in the meals that were consumed by all the victims since some of the restaurants were located far apart and had obtained some of their ingredients from different suppliers while other consumers of the suspected suppliers were not affected.
November 2015 E. coli cases[edit]
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on December 21 that five more people became ill after eating at two Chipotle restaurants located in Kansas and Oklahoma in late November. Preliminary DNA fingerprinting results appear to indicated that the newer cases were caused by a different strain of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O26. Scientists are waiting for the results of the more definitive whole genome sequencing analyses to determine if the organisms responsible for this outbreak are genetically related to the E. coli that are responsible for causing the outbreak that had started in Oregon and Washington in late October and thus an extension of that outbreak. The agency has not yet determined which food is responsible for the outbreak.[185] The Food and Drug Administration reported that they are trying to determine how the bacteria in these cases, along with the earlier Oregon, Washington, and other multi-state cases, might have been propagated through the food supply chain.[186]
December 2015 norovirus outbreak[edit]




The closed restaurant on December 16, 2015


In December 2015, eighty students at Boston College were sickened after eating at a single Chipotle restaurant. Affected students had been tested for both E. coli and norovirus in order to determine the cause of the illnesses.[187] Although it would take as long as two days before the results of more definitive tests became known, public health investigators reported that preliminary tests pointed to the presence of norovirus.[188] The health inspectors for the City of Boston had since closed this particular location on December 7 for a number of health violations that included maintaining meats at a too low of a temperature on the serving line and for allowing a sick employee to work at the time of the inspection.[189]
On December 10, officials from the Boston Public Health Commission reported that tests had identified a single strain of norovirus that is responsible for this particular outbreak.[190] Boston Globe reported on December 10 that 141 persons were reported to have gotten ill and that some of the newer victims had not visited Chipotle before contracting the virus[191] and most likely became infected by being in close proximity to someone who had gotten ill at Chipotle, such as a roommate or dorm-mate.[190] Boston authorities traced the cause of the outbreak to a sick employee who was allowed to work on the day of the outbreak. Chipotle has since fired the employee and also the manager who knowingly allowed the ill worker to complete his shift instead of following health codes.[192]
Consequences[edit]
On February 8, 2016, Chipotle closed all of its eateries nationwide for a few hours during the morning for an all-staff meeting on food safety.[193] The company hired a new head of food safety, who instituted changes including having all employees wash hands every half hour, having two employees verify that produce like onions, jalapeños and avocados have been immersed in hot water for five seconds to kill germs on their exteriors, and using Pascalization to pre-treat food ingredients.[194]
Since the series of food-poisoning outbreaks in 2015 lowered trust in the product, Chipotle has tried to lure back its customers with free food and heavier advertising. Same-store sales increased 17.8% percent in the first quarter of 2017.[195]

Lawsuit[edit]
In November 2016, three men filed a class-action lawsuit against Chipotle alleging that a burrito was listed as containing only 300 calories, when in fact it contained more. They are seeking "unspecified damages and for an injunction against the company to prevent it from posting what it calls misleading information on its food."[196][197][198]
Advertising and publicity[edit]

In the past, Chipotle mainly relied on billboards, radio ads, and word of mouth to advertise.[30] In 2012, Chipotle aired its first nationally televised commercial during the 54th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony.[199] In 2010, the company initiated an ad campaign that mocks advice given to Chipotle by advertising agencies.[200] Chipotle has run many promotions giving out free food to potential customers, especially when opening a new store. Stores also give out free burritos on certain holidays; for instance, on Halloween, some locations have had promotions in which free burritos are given to people who come dressed as a burrito. Chipotle gave away free burritos to reporters during the 1997 trial of Timothy McVeigh, which took place in Chipotle's hometown of Denver.[201] In addition, stores offered free burritos to those displaced by Hurricane Katrina.[202] Chipotle received attention when Ozzy Osbourne's reality show The Osbournes featured the company's burritos heavily.[29] For Halloween 2010, Chipotle announced that customers dressed as a processed food product would receive a burrito for $2. The event was part of a $1 million fundraiser for Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution called "Boorito 2010: The Horrors of Processed Food."[203] For "Boorito 2011", customers dressed in costumes "inspired by family farms" will receive a menu item for $2, with proceeds from the promotion going to The Chipotle Cultivate Foundation and Farm Aid. The promotion is aimed to increase awareness of family farms.[204] Also in support of family farms, Chipotle released music videos of Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Willie Nelson.[205] On September 12, 2013, Chipotle released an animated short called The Scarecrow, with a companion mobile video game; both feature a narrative heavily critical of industrial farming, but little in the way of direct marketing for the chain.[206] The short features a cover of "Pure Imagination" from Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, sung by Fiona Apple.[207] It was named one of the worst advertisements of 2013 by The Wall Street Journal.[208]
In 2011, Chipotle created the "Farm Team", which is a rewards program available only by invitation from restaurant managers. The Farm Team members have access to a special Chipotle website, where members can earn rewards, i.e. free food and T-shirts. The site offers members to, "learn where Chipotle’s food comes from, take quizzes and polls, play games and watch videos about the company".[209] In April 2014, the Farm Team program was shut down.[210]
Chipotle sponsors Team Garmin-Barracuda (formerly Team Garmin-Chipotle, Team Garmin-Slipstream, Team Garmin-Transitions and Team Garmin-Cervélo) of the International Cycling Union,[211][212] and is an official team partner of the Boston Celtics,[213] and the Boston Bruins.[214] In June 2009, Chipotle sponsored free screenings of Food, Inc., a film that criticizes the corporate food industry. Founder Steve Ells stated that he hoped the film would make customers appreciate Chipotle's Food With Integrity policy.[215] From May until September 2009, Chipotle ran a contest on mychipotle.com, a microsite which had a competition for the best user-created audio and video presentations about different combinations of ingredients.[216][217] In July 2010, Chipotle began a campaign to support healthier lunch alternatives for students, in which money will be donated to The Lunch Box program based on how many spam E-mails consumers forward to a company E-mail address.[218] For Chipotle's 18 year anniversary, the company began wrapping its burritos in gold foil as part of a larger promotion to draw attention to its Food With Integrity mantra.[219] Also as part of the gold foil campaign, Chipotle is offering prizes for customer-created pictures of items wrapped in gold foil. Chipotle hired comedian Amy Sedaris to create a comedic how-to video on wrapping with gold foil, and spread the video using Twitter.[220] In March 2013, Chipotle pulled its sponsorship of a Boy Scouts of America event, citing that organization's ban on LGBT members.[221]

On December 16, 2015, Chipotle ran full page ads in both The Boston Globe and Boston Herald apologizing for the recent norovirus outbreak linked to Chipotle's Cleveland Circle location. The ad, containing a letter by Chipotle founder and co-CEO Steve Ells, affirmed the company's commitment to food safety.[222]
On March 14, 2016, a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) administrative law judge concluded that Chipotle’s social media policy, and more specifically its application towards an employee who posted tweets regarding wages and working conditions, violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).[223] A former Chipotle employee in Havertown, Pennsylvania, wrote a series of tweets from his personal account about hourly workers being required to work on snow days. Chipotle instructed the employee to delete the tweets. The NLRB judge determined that Chipotle’s request to delete the tweets violated the NLRA even though the employee was not disciplined as a result of his tweets.[224]
Architecture[edit]




The exterior of a Chipotle in Durham, North Carolina


Architecturally, all Chipotle restaurants are built using most of the same materials (plywood, corrugated metal, stainless steel, exposed ductwork), although each store is unique.[20][225] The interiors have been described as having an "industrial, sheet metal look".[226] Chipotle has built restaurants using white ceramic tile instead of stainless steel.[227] It costs the company approximately $850,000 to open a new restaurant.[228] When the first Chipotle opened, Steve Ells asked his friend, sculptor Bruce Gueswel, to design the chairs and a styled Mayan king whose face was loosely based on that of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., a personal inspiration of Gueswel, for the restaurant. Both items were made from wood and metal. Gueswel has continued to design and build the art and chairs for all subsequent Chipotle restaurants.[229]
Most Chipotle locations display a photograph of the original restaurant, which is near the University of Denver campus on Evans Avenue.[20] Instead of a photograph of itself, the original location has a photograph of the Dolly Madison Ice Cream that previously occupied the location. In 2010, Chipotle began opening "A Model" restaurants, which are smaller concept locations, citing the lower costs of development and occupancy.[230] Chipotle uses environmentally friendly packaging, with bowls made from recycled newsprint, unbleached tray liners, and napkins and cups made from postconsumer waste.[231]
Chipotle's architectural design team incorporates the principles of sustainable architecture in their projects. The "green" restaurant in Gurnee, Illinois features an on-site six kilowatt wind turbine, which generates about 10% of the restaurant's electrical needs. The Gurnee restaurant has received Platinum level LEED certification from U.S. Green Building Council.[232] A restaurant in Tulsa, Oklahoma, uses recycled drywall, low-VOC paint, and energy-efficient appliances.[233] A Chipotle restaurant in Austin, Texas was the first to receive a four-star rating from the city's Green Building Program.[234] Additionally, Chipotle has made arrangements to add solar panels to 75 of its restaurants.[232] Chipotle has contracted to clean its stores in New York City and Long Island, with "plant-based, environmentally preferable cleaning supplies and technologies." The cleansers are readily biodegradable and non-toxic to humans or aquatic life.[235]
Chipotle was the defendant in a lawsuit for failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Maurizio Antoninetti, a customer who used a wheelchair, claimed he was denied the "Chipotle Experience", because he was unable to see the food preparation. The case against the company was upheld in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,[236] and the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear Chipotle's appeal, leaving the Ninth Circuit's ruling intact.[237] Chipotle has "an official disability policy of bringing ingredients to the tables of diners with disabilities and doing tableside preparation." Chipotle is retrofitting restaurants affected by the ruling, replacing the walls in front of the food preparation area with lower ones or transparent panels. They are incorporating the new design elements into new restaurants.[236] The case was one of over twenty ADA-related lawsuits filed by Antoninetti, who died in 2011.[236][238]
Other restaurant units[edit]

Pizzeria Locale is a fast casual pizza restaurant formed as a partnership with Pizzeria Locale, a full-service pizza restaurant in Boulder, Colorado. The original Pizzeria Locale owners, Bobby Stuckey and Lachlan Mackinnon-Patterson, would continue to own their original location while Chipotle would increase its stake in the chain over time.[48] As of February 2017, the chain has seven locations.[51]
Tasty Made is a burger restaurant concept that Chipotle first opened in Lancaster, Ohio in October 2016.[239] On July 29, 2016, the company announced the opening of its first Tasty Made burger restaurant in the fall. The first location was revealed to be in Lancaster, Ohio. Ohio was selected as culinary manager Nate Appleman and national training director David Chrisman are both from the state and helped design the concept.[240] Tasty Made was announced to have a focused menu like early burger restaurants which were limited to burgers, fries and milkshakes.[51] Chipotle had trademarked Better Burger earlier in the year.


Defunct


Soul Daddy was a soul food fast casual restaurant that was owned by ANGR Holdings, LLC, and was managed by Chipotle after purchasing Ellis' stake in the company. The restaurant had three locations that had operated for less than 5 weeks in 2011 before closing.[241]
ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen was an Asian fast-casual concept restaurant that was opened by Chipotle in September 2011.[45] The company said that the new restaurant "would follow the Chipotle service format and its focus on 'food with integrity' in ingredients."[46] Chipotle's plan was to start with only one store, and see how the restaurant works out before expanding the concept.[47] By July 2016, the chain has 15 restaurants.[51] All ShopHouse locations were closed on March 17, 2017.[242]

(CMG) Stock and Hold Your NoseKyle WoodleyInvestorPlaceJuly 21, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) screwed up, and it screwed up bad. We’re talking “getting caught cheating on your girlfriend for the second time” bad — you have no reasonable expectation of forgiveness, you just have to wait and see, if you even care about hanging around anymore at all. And CMG stock is rightfully paying a dear price.View photosSource:  Mike Mozart Via FlickrChipotle shares are now down more than 10% since Tuesday following a pair of reports that put its year-plus retribution attempts into question.CMG — which already was flailing in the wake of a disappointing full-year outlook issued in late June — has fully given back all of its rebound gains since bottoming out in the wake of the big E. coli scare in 2015 that helped spark its biggest selloff.At the moment, shares now sit at lows last seen in 2013.How Chipotle’s Snowball Started RollingThe damage started on Tuesday after several news outlets reported that numerous customers had complained about getting sick at a Chipotle location in Sterling, Virginia. The illness, which later was confirmed as a norovirus outbreak, sparked immediate intraday selling in CMG stock.Chipotle’s trust was already thin following the wide outbreak of E. coli in October, but also another E. coli batch in July, as well as norovirus and salmonella outbreaks in the latter half of the year — but was put further into doubt amid a much different health concern.Over the next couple days, reports began to surface about rodents being seen at one of Chipotle’s Dallas-area locations, with diners later producing video of rodents crawling on the floors and walls.  7 Top Stocks That Would Survive an Apocalypse  While Chipotle said this was “an extremely isolated and rare incident,” continued selling through the end of the week indicates that investors feel otherwise.But the question now becomes one of whether you can ever go long CMG stock again with any confidence. The tired ol’ adage “Buy when there’s blood in the streets” immediately comes to mind, but when it’s a river of plasma … it’s probably worth at least waiting a little bit.Still, there are a few reasons to at least consider buying Chipotle … at some point, if not now.ManagementThe first actually came more than half a year back, when Chipotle ditched is co-CEO structure and Bill Ackman was able to push new directors — thick with restaurant experience — on the board. The argument then was these directors would help push innovation and ensure that the company toed a healthier line. While that latter argument is chipped, it’s not broken; I want to give this team time to see how they react to Chipotle’s first major crisis under their watch.One problem: Chipotle’s insistence on using the freshest, most all-natural ingredients involves a more complicated supply chain than many other restaurants, and is partly why food sickness might always be an issue.“(Chipotle’s) food sourcing is a laudable effort—and it’s what customers want. But they’re probably walking a fine line between offering fresh, local ingredients and decentralized food preparation and the risk of introducing foodborne pathogens because it is such a complicated food chain,” Melinda Wilkins, director of the online master of science in food safety at Michigan State University, told Wired last year.However, while it’s doubtful the chain will ever look as simple as, say, McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), the board has been working on solving this complexity. Now, investors need to watch to see how management responds on this front.Willingness to ExpandChipotle features one of the most limited menus in the fast-food world, setting up its buffett line to pump out a couple of products customizable with just a handful of veggies, meats and cheese. That’s why investors should take heart at the company’s willingness (under Ackman’s new board members) to branch out to new areas.Read More Last year, Chipotle debuted chorizo — its first menu change since 2014, when the company rolled out tofu sofritas. And this summer, the reports that the company would add queso to the menu added a dollop of optimism from the analyst camp.Said Maxim Group’s Stephen Anderson earlier this week:“We believe CMG’s queso is differentiated enough to be not only a potential traffic driver in its own right, but also take market share from immediate rivals, including Qdoba.”This only can drive customers if they’re willing to forgive Chipotle. While that seems like a tall order just days removed from two more flare-ups, remember: CMG has had numerous food-safety issues throughout its history, and even after the 2015 E. coli breakout, eventually, some customers did return.  Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Is Value You Can Bank On  A Quick Bounce in CMG Stock?Reality check: While Chipotle is wounded, this isn’t a bankruptcy concern, and there’s no imminent collapse of the business. This week’s events were bad, not fatal.With that in mind, let’s look at the chart.View photosCMG stock chartMoreChipotle’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is at its lowest readings since early 2016, when the dip in CMG stock was reaching its end. Sellers eventually became exhausted, and what followed was an oversold bounce of roughly 25%.That’s not an argument for a long-term buy here, but there’s a powerful case for trading bullish options for a quick profit. CMG stock hasn’t managed to go any higher than it did after this technical bounce — and that’s despite a couple quarters’ worth of earnings reports that showed a clear signs of fundamental improvement.And what about buy-and-hold investors?Chipotle has broken trust for the umpteenth time, and more food sickness outbreaks are simply going to happen, if not tomorrow, then next month, or next year. That’s the risk Chipotle takes for the experience it’s trying to deliver to its customers.The first step comes after the bell Tuesday, July 25, when Chipotle reports its quarterly earnings, when we get both an idea of where the restaurant was before this flare-up, and potentially some guidance for the current quarter, which likely will be affected by this week’s events. If we don’t receive any guidance, then it’s a waiting game of absorbing industry reports and any tidbits that CMG decides to dole out over the next three months until its Q3 report — when we’re certain to find out just how bad the damage was.In short, CMG stock isn’t a safe long-term play for at least another few months. But if you’re aggressive and quick on the trading front, you might be able to squeeze out some profits on the long side.Kyle Woodley is the Managing Editor of InvestorPlace.com.

The Recovery Looks Real at Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.
The burrito restaurant delivered big improvements in traffic, revenue, and profits. 











                Jason Hall
            

                (TMFVelvetHammer)



            
            Apr 26, 2017 at 9:04AM
            
            





Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) reported first-quarter financial and operating results on April 25, delivering improvements in just about every operating and financial metric, and not only as compared to the year-ago quarter. Chipotle improved its business results across the board on a sequential basis as well. 
In short, this seems like a real bounce-back quarter driven in no small part by a big increase in customers coming back, after more than a year of declining same-restaurant sales. Let's take a peek at how much better Chipotle's results were to start 2017.

A closer look at the financial results
Here's a comparison between the year-ago period and the first quarter:

Revenue and net income in millions. Data source: Chipotle.
As you can see, a big 17.8% increase in sales at restaurants open at least 13 months (comps) played a significant role in driving revenue 28% higher versus last year, while also helping Chipotle deliver its biggest quarterly profit since 2015. 
More importantly, it's not just the year-over-year comparison that's much improved. The company continues to deliver on its recent trend of sequential sales recovery. Here's a comparison to the fourth quarter of 2016:

Revenue and net income in millions. Data source: Chipotle.
Chipotle was able to drive a significant amount of its sequential revenue increase to the bottom line, both as a product of operating leverage, as well as some gains in efficiency in the quarter. 
Key metrics that Chipotle improved on
A significant part of the company's profit recovery in the quarter was simply a product of higher sales, since a major portion of its cost structure is relatively fixed, such as property leases and other occupancy expenses. The company has also maintained high levels of staffing throughout the past several quarters, prioritizing fast, high-quality service over cutting costs to meet short-term profit goals, potentially to the detriment of the customer experience. 
Chipotle was able to spread those costs out over a much bigger revenue number this quarter.  As a result, the following operating metrics improved:

Food and packaging expense was 33.8% of sales, a 150-basis-point improvement sequentially. 
Labor was 26.9% of sales, a 60-basis-point improvement sequentially. 
Occupancy and other operating costs were 21.5% of sales, a 220-basis-point improvement sequentially. 
These, along with sales growth, improved restaurant-level operating margin to 17.7%, up from 6.8% year over year and 13.5% sequentially. 

Finally, this improved cash flows to a great extent. Cash from operations was $151 million, more than double the $62 million from the year-ago quarter. 





Still work to do, but solid progress on regaining customers 
It's clear that Chipotle has made huge strides with its customers, as this quarter's big comps growth showed. But traffic and revenue per store is still down from peak levels. The company said that the average Chipotle generated $1.93 million in sales in the quarter, a level still far below the $2.5 million-plus peak before the E. coli scare. 
As Founder, CEO and Chairman Steve Ells said about the company's progress so far:

By simplifying the focus in our restaurants to only those elements that lead to a great guest experience, our operations have improved every single month, which gives us confidence that we are on our way to achieve our mission to ensure that great food made with whole unprocessed ingredients is accessible to everyone.

Chipotle also opened 57 new restaurants in the quarter, finishing with 2,291, after closing all Shophouse locations and one Chipotle. That's 225 more than it had open at the end of the first quarter in 2016. Ells also said that the company would start testing its first-ever dessert item -- bunuelos -- in the near future, a popular Mexican pastry that requires the addition of only a couple of new ingredients at each restaurant. 
Looking ahead
Even with a solid bounce-back quarter under its belt, management continues to provide only very general guidance, with expectations for comps growth in the "high single digits" and plans to open 195-210 new restaurants.  
If customers continue to come back at the pace we have seen since December, the company has a good shot at doing better than just high-single-digit comps. If that turns out to be the case, shareholders will have reason to celebrate -- maybe with a margarita and a plate of bunuelos at their neighborhood Chipotle.

Our Company





 
 



The business of good food
 



When Chipotle opened its first restaurant in 1993, the idea was simple: show that food served fast didn't have to be a “fast-food” experience. Using high-quality raw ingredients, classic cooking techniques, and distinctive interior design, we brought features from the realm of fine dining to the world of quick-service restaurants. 
 
 


Over 23 years later, our devotion to seeking out the very best ingredients we can--raised with respect for animals, farmers, and the environment--remains at the core of our commitment to Food With Integrity. And as we've grown, our mission has expanded to ensuring that better food is accessible to everyone.

Along the way, we’ve realized that our commitment to serving Food With Integrity could extend beyond burritos and tacos. We’ve built on our vision for the future of fast food by bringing Chipotle’s service format and food philosophy to the culinary traditions of Southeast Asia and Naples, Italy.

Essay on Marketing Opportunity: Chipotle Mexican Grill

1030 Words
5 Pages

1.1 Brief History
	Chipotle Mexican Grill originated in Denver, Colorado in 1993.  In 1998, McDonald’s became the majority shareholder; however, in 2006, McDonald’s divested its controlling interest.  Chipotle became a public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2006.  It currently has 1,083 locations across the United States and Canada.  In May 2010, Chipotle expanded into Europe, opening their first restaurant in the United Kingdom. (Form 10-K Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 2011)
1.2 Product Offering
	Chipotle’s cuisine is Mexican.  Their menu consists of burritos, tacos, burrito bowls, and salads prepared with fresh ingredients employing classic cooking methods.  The customer proceeds down an assembly line choosing the

                                A growth of 3.9% for 2011 is forecasted for the restaurant industry; however, the fast casual segment is expected to outperform the average with a 4.3% growth rate (Consumers still thrift when dining out, 2011).  In 2010, Chipotle showed an increase of 20.9% increase in revenue over 2009, opening 129 new restaurants.  Chipotle is planning to open 135-145 new restaurants in 2011 (Form 10-K Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 2011).
2.2 Market Needs
	Diners are becoming increasingly aware of how foods are prepared and inquiring on where the foods originated.  Locally sourced meats, locally grown produce, sustainable seafood, and healthy children’s meals are the top menu trends for 2011 (National Restaurant Association reveals hottest menu trends in 2011, 2010).  Chipotle is at the forefront of these trends with their “Food with Integrity” philosophy (Form 10-K Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 2011).   The pork served at their restaurants is naturally raised, 80% of the restaurants serve naturally raised beef, and 86% of the restaurants serve naturally raised chickens.  
3.0 Environmental Factors
3.1 Political-Legal
	New immigration laws may have an adverse impact to Chipotle.  These may lead to additional costs to ensure compliance.  Additional impacts include reduction in available workforce and risks in future audits of current employees (Form 10-K…

Also there is the risk that the franchises may not maintain the culture of CMG and this may change the perception of Chipotle to customers. This would have a negative effect on the corporate branches.  Even though CMG will have the right to terminate franchisee operations that do not follow the system it may have already caused damage. Also by not franchising CMG does not…

Chipotle Mexican Grill as a company is not immune to these issues and has its own fair share of challenges.
The first and most important challenge facing Chipotle is the sourcing of their food ingredients. When the company first came into existence, it sourced its ingredients from every and all available sources just like all other fast food companies. This changed in 1999 after Founder Steve Ells visited a Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation (CAFOs). He was not too impressed and changed his company’s…

minimal amounts of expenses relating to marketing and other advertising expenses.

Financial Analysis
	Fast food is known for low quality and low prices. Alternatively, the dine-in experience offers high quality with a higher price. Some restaurants seek a low-cost dine in experience but this is done with a deteriorated food quality. Therefore, it would make sense that Chipotle’s philosophy of high quality has a hard time maintaining a low price. Chipotle makes this work by charging slightly higher…

Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (/tʃᵻˈpoʊtleɪ/)[6] is an American chain of fast casual restaurants in the United States, United Kingdom,[7] Canada,[8][9] Germany,[10] and France,[11] specializing in tacos and Mission-style[12][13] burritos. Its name derives from chipotle, the Nahuatl name for a smoked and dried jalapeño chili pepper.[14] The company currently trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CMG.[15]
The company has released a mission statement called Food with Integrity, which highlights its efforts in using naturally-grown ingredients,[6] and serves more naturally raised meat than any other restaurant chain.[16] Chipotle is one of the first chains of fast casual dining establishments.[17] Competitors in the fast-casual Mexican market include Qdoba Mexican Grill, Moe's Southwest Grill, Rubio's Coastal Grill, Pancheros Mexican Grill, Freebirds World Burrito, and Baja Fresh.[18]
Founded by Steve Ells on July 13, 1993. Chipotle had 16 restaurants (all in Colorado) when McDonald's Corporation became a major investor in 1998. By the time McDonald's fully divested itself from Chipotle in 2006,[19] the chain had grown to over 500 locations.
With more than 2,000 locations,[2] Chipotle had a net income of US$475.6 million and a staff of more than 45,000 employees in 2015.[2]

History[edit]




The first Chipotle, near the campus of the University of Denver


Founder Steve Ells attended the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York. Afterward, he became a line cook for Jeremiah Tower at Stars in San Francisco.[20] There, Ells observed the popularity of the taquerías and San Francisco burritos in the Mission District. In 1993, Ells took what he learned in San Francisco[21] and opened the first Chipotle Mexican Grill in Denver, Colorado, in a former Dolly Madison Ice Cream store at 1644 East Evans Avenue,[22] near the University of Denver campus, using an $85,000 loan from his father.[19] Ells and his father calculated that the store would need to sell 107 burritos per day to be profitable. After one month, the original restaurant was selling over 1,000 burritos a day.[15] The second store opened in 1995 using Chipotle's cash flow, and the third was opened using an SBA loan. To fund more growth, Ells' father invested $1.5 million. Afterwards, Ells created a board of directors and business plan, raising an additional $1.8 million for the company.[23] Ells had originally planned to use funds from the first Chipotle to open a fine-dining restaurant, but instead focused on Chipotle Mexican Grill when the restaurants saw success.[24][25]
In 1998, the first restaurant outside of Colorado opened in Kansas City, Missouri.[26] The company opened its first location in Minnesota by opening near the campus of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis in March 1999.[27]
In 1998, McDonald's made an initial minority investment in the company. By 2001, the company had grown to be Chipotle's largest investor.[19] The investment from McDonald's allowed the firm to quickly expand, from 16 restaurants in 1998 to over 500 by 2005.[28] On January 26, 2006, Chipotle made its initial public offering (IPO) after increasing the share price twice due to high pre-IPO demand. In its first day as a public company, the stock rose exactly 100%, resulting in the best U.S.-based IPO in six years, and the second-best IPO for a restaurant after Boston Market. The money from the offering was then used to fund new store growth.[29]
In October 2006, McDonald's fully divested from Chipotle.[30] This was part of a larger initiative for McDonald's to divest all of its non-core business restaurants — Chipotle, Donatos Pizza, and Boston Market — so that it could focus on the main McDonald's chain.[31] McDonald's invested approximately $360 million into Chipotle, and took out $1.5 billion.[23] McDonald's had attempted to get Chipotle to add drive-through windows and a breakfast menu, which Ells resisted.[32][33] In 2008, Chipotle opened its first location outside of the United States in Toronto.[9]
In a list of fastest-growing restaurant chains in 2009, Chipotle was ranked eighth, based on increases in U.S. sales over the past year,[34] and in 2010 Chipotle was ranked third.[35] Consumer Reports ranked Chipotle as the best Mexican fast-food chain in 2011.[36] The company serves approximately 750,000 customers per day.[37]
In December 2010, Chipotle hired chef Nate Appleman to develop new cuisine. Appleman has won Rising Star Chef from the James Beard Foundation, was named "Best New Chef" by Food & Wine magazine, and competed on The Next Iron Chef.[38]
In 2010, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) audited Chipotle's Minneapolis restaurants, and found that some employees had been hired using fraudulent documents. In December, Chipotle fired 450 employees from its Minneapolis restaurants as a result of the audit, resulting in protests by local groups.[39][40] In February 2011, ICE expanded the audit to include 60 restaurants in Virginia and Washington, D.C.[41] which resulted in 40 workers being fired. In April 2011, the criminal division of the Attorney General's office in Washington, D.C., joined the case, and ICE agents began interviewing employees at 20 to 25 restaurants in other locations, such as Los Angeles and Atlanta.[42] In response to the government investigations, Chipotle hired former director of ICE Julie Myers Wood and high-profile attorneys Robert Luskin and Gregory B. Craig.[43]
Other restaurant expansion[edit]
In 2011, Steve Ells was a judge for the TV show America's Next Great Restaurant and investor of ANGR Holdings, the company that will be running the winning concept's restaurants. Chipotle has agreed to purchase Ells' investment in ANGR at his cost, provide support for ANGR operations, and invest a total of $2.3 million in cash contributions.[44]
In September 2011, Chipotle opened an Asian fast-casual concept restaurant named ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen in Washington, D.C.[45] The company has said the new restaurant "would follow the Chipotle service format and its focus on 'food with integrity' in ingredients."[46] Chipotle's plan was to start with only one store, and see how the restaurant works out before expanding the concept.[47]
On December 18, 2013, the company revealed that it had opened its first fast-food pizza chain in Denver back in May 2013. According to Associated Press, Chipotle partnered with a local full-service restaurant called Pizzeria Locale to create a fast-food version of the eatery, keeping its name. The company plans to open at least two more pizzerias in the Denver area.[48]
In April 2014, Chipotle announced an increase in menu prices for the first time in nearly three years, due to increasing costs for steak, avocados, and cheese. The price increase was expected to be rolled out from the end of second quarter of 2014 through the end of the third quarter.[49] In late 2015, Chipotle expanded its mobile strategy through delivery partnerships with tech startups like Tapingo, a delivery service that targets college campuses.[50]
On July 29, 2016, the company announced the opening of its first Tasty Made burger restaurant in the fall. Chipotle was still dealing with the various virus outbreaks with additional marketing. The company was also reducing the number of new stores for the year from 235 to 220.[51]
International[edit]




The second Chipotle Mexican Grill location in London, located on Baker Street


According to an article in The Motley Fool, Chipotle had 17 locations outside of the United States by October 2014 with the majority in Canada, and the UK was in the process of opening more locations.[52] The rate of overseas expansion was slower than expected.[53] Many of the press reviewers thought that the food was overpriced for their area.[11][54]
As of 2017 there are 26 locations outside of the United States with 11 locations in Canada (Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver), 6 locations in The United Kingdom (London), 3 in France (Paris), and 1 in Germany (Frankfurt).[better source needed][2] [55]
Canada[edit]
In August 2008, Chipotle opened its first location outside of the United States in Toronto.[9] The second location in Toronto–and in all of Canada–was not opened until 2010.[53]
The first Canadian location outside of the Toronto area was opened in Vancouver in December 2012.[56] A second Vancouver-area location was opened in Burnaby in October 2014[57] followed by a third in Surrey in January 2016[58] and a fourth in Langley in October 2016.[59]
The first location in the nation's capital of Ottawa was opened in February 2017 at the Rideau Centre.[60]
United Kingdom[edit]
Chipotle expanded to Europe with the first European restaurant opening in May 2010 in London.[7][61][62] A second location open in London in September 2011.[63] The following year, three additional locations were quickly opened in the London area.[64] After this growth spurt, the rate of further expansion in London slowed greatly with the sixth location appearing in 2013[65] and the seventh in June 2015.[66] Although Chipotle blames the slow growth in the United Kingdom on the British unfamiliarity with Mexican foods,[67] several locally owned burrito chains had opened locations across the United Kingdom during the same interval.[68]
France[edit]
The first location in France opened in Paris in May 2012.[11][69]
Expansion in France was much slower than that in the United Kingdom or Canada, with a second location in Paris opening in 2013[70] and a third location in 2014.[71] At 7,000 square feet, the restaurant at La Défense is, as of 2015[update], the largest Chipotle location in the world, while a typical Chipotle restaurant is usually between 2,200 and 2,500 square feet.[72] A fourth Parisian location was opened in Levallois-Perret in 2015[73] followed by a fifth[74] and a sixth[75] Parisian location in 2016, both in Saint-Germain-des-Prés.
Germany[edit]
The first and, so far, only location in Germany opened in Frankfurt in August 2013.[10][54]
Corporate management[edit]
Chipotle's team includes a residing corporate office of managers and its board of directors. Members of both teams are appointed to serve on committees: audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance.
The top management team consists of the Chief Executive Officers, Steve Ells; the Chief Financial Officer, Jack R. Hartung; the Chief Marketing and Development Officer, Mark Crumpacker.[76] The current board of directors consists of: Steve Ells, Patrick Flynn, Albert Baldocchi, Neil Flanzraich, Darlene Friedman, Stephen Gillet, Kimbal Musk and John Charlesworth.[77]
Founder Steve Ells serves as chairman and Chief executive officer,[78] and has a 1.25% stake in the company.[79] The labor-market research firm Glassdoor reported that Steve Ells earned $29 million in 2014, versus a median of $19,000 for Chipotle's workers, making the CEO-to-worker pay ratio 1522:1.[80]
Operation and distribution[edit]
All of Chipotle's restaurants are company-owned, rather than franchised.[81] As of December 2012[update], 1430 restaurants have since opened throughout the United States and Canada, with locations in 43 states, Ontario, British Columbia, and the District of Columbia.[82][83]
The field team are the employees who work closely with but not directly within specific restaurants. The field support system includes apprentice team leaders (step up from restaurateurs), team leaders or area managers, team directors and regional directors (not atypical for them to oversee more than fifty locations).[84] Because Chipotle does not franchise, all restaurants are corporately owned. Thus, whenever Chipotle is in the process of launching a new location, the field team hires a new general manager and trains them at a current location so that they will be ready for the new location when it opens for business. The corporate office takes care of finding and funding new locations as well.[85]
Menu[edit]




A Chipotle restaurant in Brandon, Florida, having the typical service-line layout with menu above


Chipotle's menu consists of four items: burritos, bowls, tacos, and salads. The price of each item is based on the choice of chicken, pork carnitas, barbacoa, steak, tofu-based "sofritas",[86][87] chorizo (chicken and pork), or vegetarian (with guacamole, which would be at an extra charge otherwise). Additional optional toppings are offered free of charge, including: rice, beans, four types of salsa, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce.[88][89] When asked in 2007 about expanding the menu, Steve Ells said, "[I]t's important to keep the menu focused, because if you just do a few things, you can ensure that you do them better than anybody else."[90] Chipotle also offers a children's menu.[91][92] Most restaurants sell beer and margaritas in addition to soft drinks and fruit drinks.[93]
The majority of food is prepared in each restaurant. Some exceptions are the beans and carnitas, which are prepared at a central kitchen in Chicago, Illinois.[94] None of the restaurants have freezers, microwave ovens, or can openers.[95]




Chicken Burrito Bowl


The chain experimented with breakfast foods at two airports in the Washington (D.C.) metropolitan area but decided against expanding the menu in that direction.[96][97][98] Starting in 2009, selected restaurants had offered a pozole soup,[99][100][101] which has since been discontinued.
In June 2015, Chipotle began test marketing a pork and chicken chorizo-type sausage as a new protein option at selected locations in the Kansas City area.[102][103][104] Some food writers have expressed their health related concerns over the protein's relatively high sodium content since a 4-ounce serving contains 293 calories and 803 milligrams of sodium[105] while the American Heart Association’s recommended daily amount is less than 1,500 milligrams of sodium.[106] In contrast, the protein options with next highest sodium contents are Barbacoa with 530 milligrams and sofritas with 555 milligrams.[105] An earlier version on the Mexican sausage was tested in Denver and New York City in 2011,[107] but that test was terminated when that version of the sausage was perceived as looking too greasy.[108] As of fall 2016, chorizo is available nationwide.
Chipotle accepts fax orders, and in 2005 the company added the ability to order online from their website. For both online and fax orders, customers proceed to the front of the line to pay for pre-ordered food.[109] In 2009, Chipotle released an app for the iPhone that allows users to find nearby Chipotle locations, place an order, and prepay with a credit card.[110] In 2013, Chipotle released an Android app that allows users to locate nearby Chipotle locations, place an order, prepay with a credit or gift card, and access favorites and recent orders.[111][112]
Nutrition[edit]
In 2003, a Center for Science in the Public Interest report stated that Chipotle's burritos contain over 1,000 calories, which is nearly equivalent to two meals' worth of food.[113][114] MSNBC Health.com placed the burritos on their list of the "20 Worst Foods in America" because of their high caloric content and high sodium.[115] When a burrito with carnitas, rice, vegetables, cheese, guacamole, and salsa was compared with a typical Big Mac, the burrito had more fat, cholesterol, carbohydrates, and sodium than the Big Mac, but it also had more protein and fiber.[116] The restaurant has also received praise – Health.com included the restaurant in its list of the "Healthiest Fast Food Restaurants".[117]
Chipotle's vegetarian options include rice, black beans, fajita vegetables (onions and bell peppers), salsa, guacamole and cheese.[118] All items other than the meats, cheese, sour cream, and honey vinaigrette dressing are vegan.[118] As of late 2013, Chipotle developed a new cooking strategy for the pinto beans, eliminating the bacon and making them vegetarian and vegan-friendly.[119] The cheese is processed with vegetable-based rennet in order to be suitable for vegetarians.[118] In April 2010, Chipotle began testing a vegan "Garden Blend" option, which is a plant-based meat alternative marinated in chipotle adobo, at six locations in the U.S.[120][121] The flour tortillas used for the burritos and soft tacos are the only items that contain gluten.[118]
Food sourcing[edit]
In 1999, while looking for ways to improve the taste of the carnitas,[20] Steve Ells was prompted by an article written by Edward Behr to visit Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs).[122] Ells found the CAFOs "horrific", and began sourcing from open-range pork suppliers. This caused an increase in both the price and the sales of the carnitas burritos.[61]
In 2001, Chipotle released a mission statement called Food With Integrity, which highlighted Chipotle's efforts to increase their use of naturally raised meat, organic produce, and dairy without added hormones.[6] Chipotle only uses the leg and thigh meat from its chickens; the breast meat is sold to Panera Bread.[123]

Founder Steve Ells has testified before the United States Congress in support of the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act, which aims to reduce the amount of antibiotics given to farm animals.[61][124]
Since 2006, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW), a Floridian farmworker organization, has protested Chipotle’s refusal to sign a Fair Food agreement, which would commit the restaurant chain to pay a penny-per-pound premium on its Florida tomatoes to boost tomato harvesters’ wages, and to only buy Florida tomatoes from growers who comply with the Fair Food Code of Conduct.[125] In 2009, the creators of the documentary film Food, Inc. (along with 31 other leaders in the sustainable food movement) signed an open letter of support for the CIW’s campaign, stating that, “If Chipotle is sincere in its wishes to reform its supply chain, the time has come to work with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers as a true partner in the protection of farmworkers rights.”[126] In September 2009, Chipotle announced that it would sidestep partnership with the CIW and instead work directly with East Coast Growers and Packers to increase wages for its tomato pickers.[127] CEO Steve Ells has framed the dispute as a fundamental issue of control, stating that, “the CIW wants us to sign a contract that would let them control Chipotle's decisions regarding food in the future."[128] In October 2012, Chipotle Mexican Grill signed an agreement with the CIW and became the 11th company to join the organization's Fair Food Program.[129]
In January 2015, Chipotle pulled carnitas from its menu in a third of its restaurants; company officials cited animal welfare problems at one of the suppliers, found during a regular audit, as the reason.[130] Subsequently, a false rumor spread online claiming it was done to appease Muslims who consider pork to be unclean, leading to some protests on social media.[131] The company still uses antibiotic-free and hormone-free steak in its restaurants, despite being briefly forced to "serve beef that is not naturally raised" during the summer of 2013, posting an in-store notice each time that occurred.[132] Roberto Ferdman of The Washington Post opined that Chipotle's stated mission to sell "food with integrity" may be "untenable" if meat producers continue to breach Chipotle's ethical standards.[130]
Also in 2015, Chipotle stopped using genetically modified corn and soy beans in their foods, claiming to be the first nationwide restaurant to cook completely GMO free.[133] This was done in response to increasing consumer demand for GMO free products.
Food safety[edit]

 "How Chipotle made hundreds of people barf". Vox report dated January 6, 2016, explaining Chipotle's "food safety crisis".


Since 2008, a former Kansas State University food safety professor has accused Chipotle of confusing the public by using such terms as "naturally raised meats", "organic ingredients", and "locally sourced" and trying to equate those terms with food safety.[134] In rebuttal, a Chipotle spokesperson told The Daily Beast that "all of our practices have always been very much within industry norms. It's important to note that restaurant practices are regulated by health codes, and restaurants are routinely inspected by health officials. Everything we have done in our supply chain and in our restaurants has been within industry norms."[134] Yet, FiveThirtyEight pointed out that the 2015 norovirus outbreak appears to be unusual[135] and others are criticizing their food sourcing or handling practices.[136][137] MarketWatch wrote that the result of all of these outbreaks will be to force Chipotle to obtain their produce from larger corporate farms that can afford the more extensive microbial food-safety testing programs and to process vegetables at centralized locations instead of at the individual stores, both of which are industry-standard practices that the company had previously criticized.[138] The New York Times implied that the company's insistence on maintaining its long standing rhetoric about "food integrity" seemed to be quite opposite with the realities of recent current events and made it appear that the management was just ignoring their current problems.[139] It also has been pointed out that Chipotle's current record-keeping system is actually hindering the health authorities' investigation in locating the sources of the various infections.[139]
A writer for the magazine Popular Science pointed out that Chipotle had publicly acknowledged that they "may be at a higher risk for food-borne illness outbreaks than some competitors due to our use of fresh produce and meats rather than frozen, and our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation."[140][141][142] Henry I. Miller, a medical researcher and columnist and the founding director of the FDA's Office of Biotechnology, asked: "One wonders whether Chipotle’s "traditional methods" include employees' neglecting to wash their hands before preparing food, which is how norovirus is usually spread. And the fresh versus frozen dichotomy is nothing more than a snow-job. Freezing E. coli-contaminated food does not kill the pathogens; it preserves them."[143] Describing food poisoning outbreaks as "something of a Chipotle trademark; the recent ones are the fourth and fifth this year [2015], one of which was not disclosed to the public", Miller notes that "a particularly worrisome aspect of the company's serial deficiencies is that there have been at least three unrelated pathogens in the outbreaks – Salmonella and E. coli bacteria and norovirus. In other words, there has been more than a single glitch; suppliers and employees have found a variety of ways to contaminate what Chipotle cavalierly sells (at premium prices) to its customers."[143]
A writer for the North Carolina newspaper The News & Observer called Chipotle's "food with integrity" a "lucrative farce" and a "marketing ploy" by pointing out that organic food is "often grown with manure (an 'all-natural' fertilizer), which can certainly increase the risks of accidentally spreading fecal bacteria like E. coli."[144]
In December 2015, Seattle health officials closed a Seattle-area Chipotle for a day after it had repeatedly had small numbers of violations during recent consecutive inspections that previously would not have generated a closure order.[145] On December 10, 2015, CEO Steve Ells released a press statement apologizing for 2015 outbreaks and promised changes to minimize the risks of future outbreaks.[146]
March 2008 hepatitis outbreak[edit]
In March and April 2008, the Community Epidemiology Branch of the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency traced a hepatitis A outbreak in San Diego County to a single Chipotle restaurant located in La Mesa, California in which 22 customers were infected with the virus.[147][148]
April 2008 norovirus outbreak[edit]
In 2008, Chipotle was implicated in a norovirus outbreak in Kent, Ohio, where over 400 people became ill after eating at a Chipotle restaurant.[149] Officials at the Ohio Department of Health said that the outbreak was caused by Norovirus Genotype G2.[150] Many of the victims were students at Kent State University.[151] The initial source of the outbreak was never found.
February 2009 Campylobacter jejuni outbreak[edit]
In 2009, an investigation by the Minnesota Department of Health traced an outbreak of campylobacteriosis to a Chipotle Mexican Grill in Apple Valley, Minnesota.[152][153][154] The investigation found that chicken was sometimes served undercooked by the restaurant and determined that lettuce which had been cross-contaminated with raw or undercooked chicken was the vector for the outbreak.[155][156][third-party source needed]
July 2015 E. coli outbreak[edit]
In early November 2015, The Oregonian reported that there was a little-known E. coli outbreak that had occurred earlier in July in which five persons were infected with the O157:H7 strain of E. coli. The outbreak was traced to a single Chipotle location in Seattle and that the incident was not publicized at that time.[157][158] Seattle public health officials defended their actions at that time by saying that the outbreak was over by the time they made an association with Chipotle. Health officials were unable to trace the source of the July outbreak and said that the cause of the July outbreak is unrelated to the October/November outbreak.[157]
August 2015 norovirus outbreak[edit]
Another norovirus outbreak was confirmed to have occurred in August 2015 at a Simi Valley, California location in which 80 customers and 18 employees reported becoming ill.[159][160] Ventura County health inspectors found various health violations during two inspections following the outbreak report.[161] Despite those violations, the county health officials did not close the restaurant and allowed it to continue to operate.[159] In a January 2016 article, the New York Times reported that the number of victims involved in the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak was actually 207, twice the number that was reported earlier.[162]
In an unusual move, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California in conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration has gotten a federal grand jury to issue a subpoena in January 2016 as part of a criminal investigation seeking documents and information from Chipotle concerning the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak.[162][163] As of January 2016[update], it is too early to tell which organization is the actual target of the investigation. In most cases involving norovirus outbreaks that involved a single location, state and/or local authorities are the usual jurisdiction responsible in the investigation and prosecution of those type of cases. However, Ventura County officials had been criticized for their handling of parts of their investigation, and for allowing the restaurant to continue to operate after finding health violations during consecutive inspections.
Less than two weeks later, a federal class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California claiming that Chipotle knowingly allowed an ill kitchen manager to work for two days before sending that person home. Then, the restaurant actively deep-cleaned the restaurant to remove all traces of contamination prior to notifying the Ventura County Environmental Health Division of the existing outbreak, hindering their investigation. The lawsuit also claimed that the number of known victims was as high as 234 and estimates that the number of meals that the infected employee may have come in contact with could be as high 3,000.[164][165][166]
August 2015 Salmonella outbreak[edit]
At almost the same time as the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak, Minnesota health officials confirmed a Salmonella outbreak that affected 17 Minneapolis-area Chipotle restaurants in mid-August 2015. The source of the outbreak was traced back to contaminated tomatoes that were grown in Mexico.[167][168] The Minnesota Department of Health reported that samples from 45 victims were tested and found that their illness was caused by the Salmonella Newport bacterium as determined by DNA profiling.[169] Later, the state officials reported that the total of persons who became infected was increased to 64 and the number Chipotle locations in which they had acquired the bacterium was increased to 22, all located within the state of Minnesota.[170]
October 2015 E. coli outbreak[edit]
In October 2015, at least 22 persons were reported to have gotten sick after eating at several different Chipotle locations in the states of Washington and Oregon. At that time, an epidemiologist for the Washington Health Department said the culprit appeared to be a Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli bacterium, but they were still waiting the outcome of several laboratory tests before they can give a definitive result.[171][172][173] As a precaution, Chipotle had closed 43 stores in Washington and Oregon pending the results and recommendations of the involved health authorities. On November 5, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had reported that the number of persons reported ill had risen to 40 known cases and that the bacteria samples taken from 7 infected persons in Washington and 3 persons in Oregon states were confirmed to be infected by the same strain of E. coli, the Shiga toxin-producing STEC O26 strain, as determined by DNA profiling.[174] At least 12 persons required hospitalization, but no fatalities. As of November 2015, Health authorities were still trying to trace the exact source of the bacterial contamination, but suspected fresh produce.[175]
On November 12, the CDC increased the number of known cases to 50, the number of persons requiring hospitalization to 14, and the number of DNA fingerprint confirmations to 33.[176] Through a match via Pulsenet, the DNA fingerprint also matched a recent case in Minnesota, but the ill person did not eat at Chipotle. The source of the bacteria infection still had not yet been determined at the time of the report released by the CDC and the CDC is trying to use the more definitive, but more time consuming whole genome sequencing procedure to see if they are able to determine the relationships between all of the STEC O26 cases. In the meantime, Chipotle reopened the closed restaurants on November 11 after disposing all of the food within the closed facilities and deep cleaning those facilities.[177]
On November 20, the CDC reported that the number of STEC O26 cases, as determined by DNA fingerprinting, had increased to 45 with 16 persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to six.[178] Besides Oregon and Washington, new cases were reported in the states of Minnesota, California, New York, and Ohio.[179] 43 out of 45 of the affected individuals had reported that they had eaten at a Chipotle in the week before they had become sick.
On December 4, the CDC reported that the number of STEC O26 cases, as determined by DNA fingerprinting, had increased to 52 with 20 persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to nine.[180] New cases were reported in the states of California (1), Illinois (1), Maryland (1), Ohio (2), Pennsylvania (1), and Washington (1).[181]
The price of shares for Chipotle stock dropped a further 12% immediately after the CDC had issued their update on November 20.[182] Share prices had been dropping since the initial announcement of the E. coli outbreak in late October with investors unsure if the drop in share prices just a temporary aberration and that Chipotle management is handling the incident as well as they could. Chipotle has since hired a consultant to improve their food safety program and have their program reviewed by both the CDC and FDA.[183]
On February 1, 2016, the CDC official closed their investigations on the larger E. coli that started in Pacific Northwest in October 2015 and also the smaller outbreak that started in Kansas and Oklahoma in November since no new cases were reported since December 1.[184] In their final report, the CDC stated that 55 persons in 11 states were infected with the same strain of STEC O26 during the major outbreak with 21 of those persons requiring hospitalization. The five persons infected in the later outbreak were made ill by a generically different strain of STEC O26. The CDC also reported that federal and local health and food safety authorities were unable to detect traces of the microorganisms in any of the food samples taken from the suspected restaurants or from their supply chain. The CDC, FDA, and the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service were unable to determine a point source that was in common in the meals that were consumed by all the victims since some of the restaurants were located far apart and had obtained some of their ingredients from different suppliers while other consumers of the suspected suppliers were not affected.
November 2015 E. coli cases[edit]
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on December 21 that five more people became ill after eating at two Chipotle restaurants located in Kansas and Oklahoma in late November. Preliminary DNA fingerprinting results appear to indicated that the newer cases were caused by a different strain of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O26. Scientists are waiting for the results of the more definitive whole genome sequencing analyses to determine if the organisms responsible for this outbreak are genetically related to the E. coli that are responsible for causing the outbreak that had started in Oregon and Washington in late October and thus an extension of that outbreak. The agency has not yet determined which food is responsible for the outbreak.[185] The Food and Drug Administration reported that they are trying to determine how the bacteria in these cases, along with the earlier Oregon, Washington, and other multi-state cases, might have been propagated through the food supply chain.[186]
December 2015 norovirus outbreak[edit]




The closed restaurant on December 16, 2015


In December 2015, eighty students at Boston College were sickened after eating at a single Chipotle restaurant. Affected students had been tested for both E. coli and norovirus in order to determine the cause of the illnesses.[187] Although it would take as long as two days before the results of more definitive tests became known, public health investigators reported that preliminary tests pointed to the presence of norovirus.[188] The health inspectors for the City of Boston had since closed this particular location on December 7 for a number of health violations that included maintaining meats at a too low of a temperature on the serving line and for allowing a sick employee to work at the time of the inspection.[189]
On December 10, officials from the Boston Public Health Commission reported that tests had identified a single strain of norovirus that is responsible for this particular outbreak.[190] Boston Globe reported on December 10 that 141 persons were reported to have gotten ill and that some of the newer victims had not visited Chipotle before contracting the virus[191] and most likely became infected by being in close proximity to someone who had gotten ill at Chipotle, such as a roommate or dorm-mate.[190] Boston authorities traced the cause of the outbreak to a sick employee who was allowed to work on the day of the outbreak. Chipotle has since fired the employee and also the manager who knowingly allowed the ill worker to complete his shift instead of following health codes.[192]
Consequences[edit]
On February 8, 2016, Chipotle closed all of its eateries nationwide for a few hours during the morning for an all-staff meeting on food safety.[193] The company hired a new head of food safety, who instituted changes including having all employees wash hands every half hour, having two employees verify that produce like onions, jalapeños and avocados have been immersed in hot water for five seconds to kill germs on their exteriors, and using Pascalization to pre-treat food ingredients.[194]
Since the series of food-poisoning outbreaks in 2015 lowered trust in the product, Chipotle has tried to lure back its customers with free food and heavier advertising. Same-store sales increased 17.8% percent in the first quarter of 2017.[195]

Lawsuit[edit]
In November 2016, three men filed a class-action lawsuit against Chipotle alleging that a burrito was listed as containing only 300 calories, when in fact it contained more. They are seeking "unspecified damages and for an injunction against the company to prevent it from posting what it calls misleading information on its food."[196][197][198]
Advertising and publicity[edit]




People line up outside a Chipotle in East Lansing, Michigan during a "Free Burrito Day"


In the past, Chipotle mainly relied on billboards, radio ads, and word of mouth to advertise.[30] In 2012, Chipotle aired its first nationally televised commercial during the 54th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony.[199] In 2010, the company initiated an ad campaign that mocks advice given to Chipotle by advertising agencies.[200] Chipotle has run many promotions giving out free food to potential customers, especially when opening a new store. Stores also give out free burritos on certain holidays; for instance, on Halloween, some locations have had promotions in which free burritos are given to people who come dressed as a burrito. Chipotle gave away free burritos to reporters during the 1997 trial of Timothy McVeigh, which took place in Chipotle's hometown of Denver.[201] In addition, stores offered free burritos to those displaced by Hurricane Katrina.[202] Chipotle received attention when Ozzy Osbourne's reality show The Osbournes featured the company's burritos heavily.[29] For Halloween 2010, Chipotle announced that customers dressed as a processed food product would receive a burrito for $2. The event was part of a $1 million fundraiser for Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution called "Boorito 2010: The Horrors of Processed Food."[203] For "Boorito 2011", customers dressed in costumes "inspired by family farms" will receive a menu item for $2, with proceeds from the promotion going to The Chipotle Cultivate Foundation and Farm Aid. The promotion is aimed to increase awareness of family farms.[204] Also in support of family farms, Chipotle released music videos of Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Willie Nelson.[205] On September 12, 2013, Chipotle released an animated short called The Scarecrow, with a companion mobile video game; both feature a narrative heavily critical of industrial farming, but little in the way of direct marketing for the chain.[206] The short features a cover of "Pure Imagination" from Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, sung by Fiona Apple.[207] It was named one of the worst advertisements of 2013 by The Wall Street Journal.[208]
In 2011, Chipotle created the "Farm Team", which is a rewards program available only by invitation from restaurant managers. The Farm Team members have access to a special Chipotle website, where members can earn rewards, i.e. free food and T-shirts. The site offers members to, "learn where Chipotle’s food comes from, take quizzes and polls, play games and watch videos about the company".[209] In April 2014, the Farm Team program was shut down.[210]
Chipotle sponsors Team Garmin-Barracuda (formerly Team Garmin-Chipotle, Team Garmin-Slipstream, Team Garmin-Transitions and Team Garmin-Cervélo) of the International Cycling Union,[211][212] and is an official team partner of the Boston Celtics,[213] and the Boston Bruins.[214] In June 2009, Chipotle sponsored free screenings of Food, Inc., a film that criticizes the corporate food industry. Founder Steve Ells stated that he hoped the film would make customers appreciate Chipotle's Food With Integrity policy.[215] From May until September 2009, Chipotle ran a contest on mychipotle.com, a microsite which had a competition for the best user-created audio and video presentations about different combinations of ingredients.[216][217] In July 2010, Chipotle began a campaign to support healthier lunch alternatives for students, in which money will be donated to The Lunch Box program based on how many spam E-mails consumers forward to a company E-mail address.[218] For Chipotle's 18 year anniversary, the company began wrapping its burritos in gold foil as part of a larger promotion to draw attention to its Food With Integrity mantra.[219] Also as part of the gold foil campaign, Chipotle is offering prizes for customer-created pictures of items wrapped in gold foil. Chipotle hired comedian Amy Sedaris to create a comedic how-to video on wrapping with gold foil, and spread the video using Twitter.[220] In March 2013, Chipotle pulled its sponsorship of a Boy Scouts of America event, citing that organization's ban on LGBT members.[221]

On December 16, 2015, Chipotle ran full page ads in both The Boston Globe and Boston Herald apologizing for the recent norovirus outbreak linked to Chipotle's Cleveland Circle location. The ad, containing a letter by Chipotle founder and co-CEO Steve Ells, affirmed the company's commitment to food safety.[222]
On March 14, 2016, a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) administrative law judge concluded that Chipotle’s social media policy, and more specifically its application towards an employee who posted tweets regarding wages and working conditions, violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).[223] A former Chipotle employee in Havertown, Pennsylvania, wrote a series of tweets from his personal account about hourly workers being required to work on snow days. Chipotle instructed the employee to delete the tweets. The NLRB judge determined that Chipotle’s request to delete the tweets violated the NLRA even though the employee was not disciplined as a result of his tweets.[224]
Architecture[edit]




The exterior of a Chipotle in Durham, North Carolina


Architecturally, all Chipotle restaurants are built using most of the same materials (plywood, corrugated metal, stainless steel, exposed ductwork), although each store is unique.[20][225] The interiors have been described as having an "industrial, sheet metal look".[226] Chipotle has built restaurants using white ceramic tile instead of stainless steel.[227] It costs the company approximately $850,000 to open a new restaurant.[228] When the first Chipotle opened, Steve Ells asked his friend, sculptor Bruce Gueswel, to design the chairs and a styled Mayan king whose face was loosely based on that of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., a personal inspiration of Gueswel, for the restaurant. Both items were made from wood and metal. Gueswel has continued to design and build the art and chairs for all subsequent Chipotle restaurants.[229]
Most Chipotle locations display a photograph of the original restaurant, which is near the University of Denver campus on Evans Avenue.[20] Instead of a photograph of itself, the original location has a photograph of the Dolly Madison Ice Cream that previously occupied the location. In 2010, Chipotle began opening "A Model" restaurants, which are smaller concept locations, citing the lower costs of development and occupancy.[230] Chipotle uses environmentally friendly packaging, with bowls made from recycled newsprint, unbleached tray liners, and napkins and cups made from postconsumer waste.[231]
Chipotle's architectural design team incorporates the principles of sustainable architecture in their projects. The "green" restaurant in Gurnee, Illinois features an on-site six kilowatt wind turbine, which generates about 10% of the restaurant's electrical needs. The Gurnee restaurant has received Platinum level LEED certification from U.S. Green Building Council.[232] A restaurant in Tulsa, Oklahoma, uses recycled drywall, low-VOC paint, and energy-efficient appliances.[233] A Chipotle restaurant in Austin, Texas was the first to receive a four-star rating from the city's Green Building Program.[234] Additionally, Chipotle has made arrangements to add solar panels to 75 of its restaurants.[232] Chipotle has contracted to clean its stores in New York City and Long Island, with "plant-based, environmentally preferable cleaning supplies and technologies." The cleansers are readily biodegradable and non-toxic to humans or aquatic life.[235]
Chipotle was the defendant in a lawsuit for failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Maurizio Antoninetti, a customer who used a wheelchair, claimed he was denied the "Chipotle Experience", because he was unable to see the food preparation. The case against the company was upheld in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,[236] and the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear Chipotle's appeal, leaving the Ninth Circuit's ruling intact.[237] Chipotle has "an official disability policy of bringing ingredients to the tables of diners with disabilities and doing tableside preparation." Chipotle is retrofitting restaurants affected by the ruling, replacing the walls in front of the food preparation area with lower ones or transparent panels. They are incorporating the new design elements into new restaurants.[236] The case was one of over twenty ADA-related lawsuits filed by Antoninetti, who died in 2011.[236][238]
Other restaurant units[edit]

Pizzeria Locale is a fast casual pizza restaurant formed as a partnership with Pizzeria Locale, a full-service pizza restaurant in Boulder, Colorado. The original Pizzeria Locale owners, Bobby Stuckey and Lachlan Mackinnon-Patterson, would continue to own their original location while Chipotle would increase its stake in the chain over time.[48] As of February 2017, the chain has seven locations.[51]
Tasty Made is a burger restaurant concept that Chipotle first opened in Lancaster, Ohio in October 2016.[239] On July 29, 2016, the company announced the opening of its first Tasty Made burger restaurant in the fall. The first location was revealed to be in Lancaster, Ohio. Ohio was selected as culinary manager Nate Appleman and national training director David Chrisman are both from the state and helped design the concept.[240] Tasty Made was announced to have a focused menu like early burger restaurants which were limited to burgers, fries and milkshakes.[51] Chipotle had trademarked Better Burger earlier in the year.


Defunct


Soul Daddy was a soul food fast casual restaurant that was owned by ANGR Holdings, LLC, and was managed by Chipotle after purchasing Ellis' stake in the company. The restaurant had three locations that had operated for less than 5 weeks in 2011 before closing.[241]
ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen was an Asian fast-casual concept restaurant that was opened by Chipotle in September 2011.[45] The company said that the new restaurant "would follow the Chipotle service format and its focus on 'food with integrity' in ingredients."[46] Chipotle's plan was to start with only one store, and see how the restaurant works out before expanding the concept.[47] By July 2016, the chain has 15 restaurants.[51] All ShopHouse locations were closed on March 17, 2017.[242]

Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (/tʃᵻˈpoʊtleɪ/)[6] is an American chain of fast casual restaurants in the United States, United Kingdom,[7] Canada,[8][9] Germany,[10] and France,[11] specializing in tacos and Mission-style[12][13] burritos. Its name derives from chipotle, the Nahuatl name for a smoked and dried jalapeño chili pepper.[14] The company currently trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CMG.[15]
The company has released a mission statement called Food with Integrity, which highlights its efforts in using naturally-grown ingredients,[6] and serves more naturally raised meat than any other restaurant chain.[16] Chipotle is one of the first chains of fast casual dining establishments.[17] Competitors in the fast-casual Mexican market include Qdoba Mexican Grill, Moe's Southwest Grill, Rubio's Coastal Grill, Pancheros Mexican Grill, Freebirds World Burrito, and Baja Fresh.[18]
Founded by Steve Ells on July 13, 1993. Chipotle had 16 restaurants (all in Colorado) when McDonald's Corporation became a major investor in 1998. By the time McDonald's fully divested itself from Chipotle in 2006,[19] the chain had grown to over 500 locations.
With more than 2,000 locations,[2] Chipotle had a net income of US$475.6 million and a staff of more than 45,000 employees in 2015.[2]

History[edit]




The first Chipotle, near the campus of the University of Denver


Founder Steve Ells attended the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York. Afterward, he became a line cook for Jeremiah Tower at Stars in San Francisco.[20] There, Ells observed the popularity of the taquerías and San Francisco burritos in the Mission District. In 1993, Ells took what he learned in San Francisco[21] and opened the first Chipotle Mexican Grill in Denver, Colorado, in a former Dolly Madison Ice Cream store at 1644 East Evans Avenue,[22] near the University of Denver campus, using an $85,000 loan from his father.[19] Ells and his father calculated that the store would need to sell 107 burritos per day to be profitable. After one month, the original restaurant was selling over 1,000 burritos a day.[15] The second store opened in 1995 using Chipotle's cash flow, and the third was opened using an SBA loan. To fund more growth, Ells' father invested $1.5 million. Afterwards, Ells created a board of directors and business plan, raising an additional $1.8 million for the company.[23] Ells had originally planned to use funds from the first Chipotle to open a fine-dining restaurant, but instead focused on Chipotle Mexican Grill when the restaurants saw success.[24][25]
In 1998, the first restaurant outside of Colorado opened in Kansas City, Missouri.[26] The company opened its first location in Minnesota by opening near the campus of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis in March 1999.[27]
In 1998, McDonald's made an initial minority investment in the company. By 2001, the company had grown to be Chipotle's largest investor.[19] The investment from McDonald's allowed the firm to quickly expand, from 16 restaurants in 1998 to over 500 by 2005.[28] On January 26, 2006, Chipotle made its initial public offering (IPO) after increasing the share price twice due to high pre-IPO demand. In its first day as a public company, the stock rose exactly 100%, resulting in the best U.S.-based IPO in six years, and the second-best IPO for a restaurant after Boston Market. The money from the offering was then used to fund new store growth.[29]
In October 2006, McDonald's fully divested from Chipotle.[30] This was part of a larger initiative for McDonald's to divest all of its non-core business restaurants — Chipotle, Donatos Pizza, and Boston Market — so that it could focus on the main McDonald's chain.[31] McDonald's invested approximately $360 million into Chipotle, and took out $1.5 billion.[23] McDonald's had attempted to get Chipotle to add drive-through windows and a breakfast menu, which Ells resisted.[32][33] In 2008, Chipotle opened its first location outside of the United States in Toronto.[9]
In a list of fastest-growing restaurant chains in 2009, Chipotle was ranked eighth, based on increases in U.S. sales over the past year,[34] and in 2010 Chipotle was ranked third.[35] Consumer Reports ranked Chipotle as the best Mexican fast-food chain in 2011.[36] The company serves approximately 750,000 customers per day.[37]
In December 2010, Chipotle hired chef Nate Appleman to develop new cuisine. Appleman has won Rising Star Chef from the James Beard Foundation, was named "Best New Chef" by Food & Wine magazine, and competed on The Next Iron Chef.[38]
In 2010, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) audited Chipotle's Minneapolis restaurants, and found that some employees had been hired using fraudulent documents. In December, Chipotle fired 450 employees from its Minneapolis restaurants as a result of the audit, resulting in protests by local groups.[39][40] In February 2011, ICE expanded the audit to include 60 restaurants in Virginia and Washington, D.C.[41] which resulted in 40 workers being fired. In April 2011, the criminal division of the Attorney General's office in Washington, D.C., joined the case, and ICE agents began interviewing employees at 20 to 25 restaurants in other locations, such as Los Angeles and Atlanta.[42] In response to the government investigations, Chipotle hired former director of ICE Julie Myers Wood and high-profile attorneys Robert Luskin and Gregory B. Craig.[43]
Other restaurant expansion[edit]
In 2011, Steve Ells was a judge for the TV show America's Next Great Restaurant and investor of ANGR Holdings, the company that will be running the winning concept's restaurants. Chipotle has agreed to purchase Ells' investment in ANGR at his cost, provide support for ANGR operations, and invest a total of $2.3 million in cash contributions.[44]
In September 2011, Chipotle opened an Asian fast-casual concept restaurant named ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen in Washington, D.C.[45] The company has said the new restaurant "would follow the Chipotle service format and its focus on 'food with integrity' in ingredients."[46] Chipotle's plan was to start with only one store, and see how the restaurant works out before expanding the concept.[47]
On December 18, 2013, the company revealed that it had opened its first fast-food pizza chain in Denver back in May 2013. According to Associated Press, Chipotle partnered with a local full-service restaurant called Pizzeria Locale to create a fast-food version of the eatery, keeping its name. The company plans to open at least two more pizzerias in the Denver area.[48]
In April 2014, Chipotle announced an increase in menu prices for the first time in nearly three years, due to increasing costs for steak, avocados, and cheese. The price increase was expected to be rolled out from the end of second quarter of 2014 through the end of the third quarter.[49] In late 2015, Chipotle expanded its mobile strategy through delivery partnerships with tech startups like Tapingo, a delivery service that targets college campuses.[50]
On July 29, 2016, the company announced the opening of its first Tasty Made burger restaurant in the fall. Chipotle was still dealing with the various virus outbreaks with additional marketing. The company was also reducing the number of new stores for the year from 235 to 220.[51]
International[edit]




The second Chipotle Mexican Grill location in London, located on Baker Street


According to an article in The Motley Fool, Chipotle had 17 locations outside of the United States by October 2014 with the majority in Canada, and the UK was in the process of opening more locations.[52] The rate of overseas expansion was slower than expected.[53] Many of the press reviewers thought that the food was overpriced for their area.[11][54]
As of 2017 there are 26 locations outside of the United States with 11 locations in Canada (Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver), 6 locations in The United Kingdom (London), 3 in France (Paris), and 1 in Germany (Frankfurt).[better source needed][2] [55]
Canada[edit]
In August 2008, Chipotle opened its first location outside of the United States in Toronto.[9] The second location in Toronto–and in all of Canada–was not opened until 2010.[53]
The first Canadian location outside of the Toronto area was opened in Vancouver in December 2012.[56] A second Vancouver-area location was opened in Burnaby in October 2014[57] followed by a third in Surrey in January 2016[58] and a fourth in Langley in October 2016.[59]
The first location in the nation's capital of Ottawa was opened in February 2017 at the Rideau Centre.[60]
United Kingdom[edit]
Chipotle expanded to Europe with the first European restaurant opening in May 2010 in London.[7][61][62] A second location open in London in September 2011.[63] The following year, three additional locations were quickly opened in the London area.[64] After this growth spurt, the rate of further expansion in London slowed greatly with the sixth location appearing in 2013[65] and the seventh in June 2015.[66] Although Chipotle blames the slow growth in the United Kingdom on the British unfamiliarity with Mexican foods,[67] several locally owned burrito chains had opened locations across the United Kingdom during the same interval.[68]
France[edit]
The first location in France opened in Paris in May 2012.[11][69]
Expansion in France was much slower than that in the United Kingdom or Canada, with a second location in Paris opening in 2013[70] and a third location in 2014.[71] At 7,000 square feet, the restaurant at La Défense is, as of 2015[update], the largest Chipotle location in the world, while a typical Chipotle restaurant is usually between 2,200 and 2,500 square feet.[72] A fourth Parisian location was opened in Levallois-Perret in 2015[73] followed by a fifth[74] and a sixth[75] Parisian location in 2016, both in Saint-Germain-des-Prés.
Germany[edit]
The first and, so far, only location in Germany opened in Frankfurt in August 2013.[10][54]
Corporate management[edit]
Chipotle's team includes a residing corporate office of managers and its board of directors. Members of both teams are appointed to serve on committees: audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance.
The top management team consists of the Chief Executive Officers, Steve Ells; the Chief Financial Officer, Jack R. Hartung; the Chief Marketing and Development Officer, Mark Crumpacker.[76] The current board of directors consists of: Steve Ells, Patrick Flynn, Albert Baldocchi, Neil Flanzraich, Darlene Friedman, Stephen Gillet, Kimbal Musk and John Charlesworth.[77]
Founder Steve Ells serves as chairman and Chief executive officer,[78] and has a 1.25% stake in the company.[79] The labor-market research firm Glassdoor reported that Steve Ells earned $29 million in 2014, versus a median of $19,000 for Chipotle's workers, making the CEO-to-worker pay ratio 1522:1.[80]
Operation and distribution[edit]
All of Chipotle's restaurants are company-owned, rather than franchised.[81] As of December 2012[update], 1430 restaurants have since opened throughout the United States and Canada, with locations in 43 states, Ontario, British Columbia, and the District of Columbia.[82][83]
The field team are the employees who work closely with but not directly within specific restaurants. The field support system includes apprentice team leaders (step up from restaurateurs), team leaders or area managers, team directors and regional directors (not atypical for them to oversee more than fifty locations).[84] Because Chipotle does not franchise, all restaurants are corporately owned. Thus, whenever Chipotle is in the process of launching a new location, the field team hires a new general manager and trains them at a current location so that they will be ready for the new location when it opens for business. The corporate office takes care of finding and funding new locations as well.[85]
Menu[edit]




A Chipotle restaurant in Brandon, Florida, having the typical service-line layout with menu above


Chipotle's menu consists of four items: burritos, bowls, tacos, and salads. The price of each item is based on the choice of chicken, pork carnitas, barbacoa, steak, tofu-based "sofritas",[86][87] chorizo (chicken and pork), or vegetarian (with guacamole, which would be at an extra charge otherwise). Additional optional toppings are offered free of charge, including: rice, beans, four types of salsa, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce.[88][89] When asked in 2007 about expanding the menu, Steve Ells said, "[I]t's important to keep the menu focused, because if you just do a few things, you can ensure that you do them better than anybody else."[90] Chipotle also offers a children's menu.[91][92] Most restaurants sell beer and margaritas in addition to soft drinks and fruit drinks.[93]
The majority of food is prepared in each restaurant. Some exceptions are the beans and carnitas, which are prepared at a central kitchen in Chicago, Illinois.[94] None of the restaurants have freezers, microwave ovens, or can openers.[95]




Chicken Burrito Bowl


The chain experimented with breakfast foods at two airports in the Washington (D.C.) metropolitan area but decided against expanding the menu in that direction.[96][97][98] Starting in 2009, selected restaurants had offered a pozole soup,[99][100][101] which has since been discontinued.
In June 2015, Chipotle began test marketing a pork and chicken chorizo-type sausage as a new protein option at selected locations in the Kansas City area.[102][103][104] Some food writers have expressed their health related concerns over the protein's relatively high sodium content since a 4-ounce serving contains 293 calories and 803 milligrams of sodium[105] while the American Heart Association’s recommended daily amount is less than 1,500 milligrams of sodium.[106] In contrast, the protein options with next highest sodium contents are Barbacoa with 530 milligrams and sofritas with 555 milligrams.[105] An earlier version on the Mexican sausage was tested in Denver and New York City in 2011,[107] but that test was terminated when that version of the sausage was perceived as looking too greasy.[108] As of fall 2016, chorizo is available nationwide.
Chipotle accepts fax orders, and in 2005 the company added the ability to order online from their website. For both online and fax orders, customers proceed to the front of the line to pay for pre-ordered food.[109] In 2009, Chipotle released an app for the iPhone that allows users to find nearby Chipotle locations, place an order, and prepay with a credit card.[110] In 2013, Chipotle released an Android app that allows users to locate nearby Chipotle locations, place an order, prepay with a credit or gift card, and access favorites and recent orders.[111][112]
Nutrition[edit]
In 2003, a Center for Science in the Public Interest report stated that Chipotle's burritos contain over 1,000 calories, which is nearly equivalent to two meals' worth of food.[113][114] MSNBC Health.com placed the burritos on their list of the "20 Worst Foods in America" because of their high caloric content and high sodium.[115] When a burrito with carnitas, rice, vegetables, cheese, guacamole, and salsa was compared with a typical Big Mac, the burrito had more fat, cholesterol, carbohydrates, and sodium than the Big Mac, but it also had more protein and fiber.[116] The restaurant has also received praise – Health.com included the restaurant in its list of the "Healthiest Fast Food Restaurants".[117]
Chipotle's vegetarian options include rice, black beans, fajita vegetables (onions and bell peppers), salsa, guacamole and cheese.[118] All items other than the meats, cheese, sour cream, and honey vinaigrette dressing are vegan.[118] As of late 2013, Chipotle developed a new cooking strategy for the pinto beans, eliminating the bacon and making them vegetarian and vegan-friendly.[119] The cheese is processed with vegetable-based rennet in order to be suitable for vegetarians.[118] In April 2010, Chipotle began testing a vegan "Garden Blend" option, which is a plant-based meat alternative marinated in chipotle adobo, at six locations in the U.S.[120][121] The flour tortillas used for the burritos and soft tacos are the only items that contain gluten.[118]
Food sourcing[edit]
In 1999, while looking for ways to improve the taste of the carnitas,[20] Steve Ells was prompted by an article written by Edward Behr to visit Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs).[122] Ells found the CAFOs "horrific", and began sourcing from open-range pork suppliers. This caused an increase in both the price and the sales of the carnitas burritos.[61]
In 2001, Chipotle released a mission statement called Food With Integrity, which highlighted Chipotle's efforts to increase their use of naturally raised meat, organic produce, and dairy without added hormones.[6] Chipotle only uses the leg and thigh meat from its chickens; the breast meat is sold to Panera Bread.[123]

Founder Steve Ells has testified before the United States Congress in support of the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act, which aims to reduce the amount of antibiotics given to farm animals.[61][124]
Since 2006, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW), a Floridian farmworker organization, has protested Chipotle’s refusal to sign a Fair Food agreement, which would commit the restaurant chain to pay a penny-per-pound premium on its Florida tomatoes to boost tomato harvesters’ wages, and to only buy Florida tomatoes from growers who comply with the Fair Food Code of Conduct.[125] In 2009, the creators of the documentary film Food, Inc. (along with 31 other leaders in the sustainable food movement) signed an open letter of support for the CIW’s campaign, stating that, “If Chipotle is sincere in its wishes to reform its supply chain, the time has come to work with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers as a true partner in the protection of farmworkers rights.”[126] In September 2009, Chipotle announced that it would sidestep partnership with the CIW and instead work directly with East Coast Growers and Packers to increase wages for its tomato pickers.[127] CEO Steve Ells has framed the dispute as a fundamental issue of control, stating that, “the CIW wants us to sign a contract that would let them control Chipotle's decisions regarding food in the future."[128] In October 2012, Chipotle Mexican Grill signed an agreement with the CIW and became the 11th company to join the organization's Fair Food Program.[129]
In January 2015, Chipotle pulled carnitas from its menu in a third of its restaurants; company officials cited animal welfare problems at one of the suppliers, found during a regular audit, as the reason.[130] Subsequently, a false rumor spread online claiming it was done to appease Muslims who consider pork to be unclean, leading to some protests on social media.[131] The company still uses antibiotic-free and hormone-free steak in its restaurants, despite being briefly forced to "serve beef that is not naturally raised" during the summer of 2013, posting an in-store notice each time that occurred.[132] Roberto Ferdman of The Washington Post opined that Chipotle's stated mission to sell "food with integrity" may be "untenable" if meat producers continue to breach Chipotle's ethical standards.[130]
Also in 2015, Chipotle stopped using genetically modified corn and soy beans in their foods, claiming to be the first nationwide restaurant to cook completely GMO free.[133] This was done in response to increasing consumer demand for GMO free products.
Food safety[edit]

 "How Chipotle made hundreds of people barf". Vox report dated January 6, 2016, explaining Chipotle's "food safety crisis".


Since 2008, a former Kansas State University food safety professor has accused Chipotle of confusing the public by using such terms as "naturally raised meats", "organic ingredients", and "locally sourced" and trying to equate those terms with food safety.[134] In rebuttal, a Chipotle spokesperson told The Daily Beast that "all of our practices have always been very much within industry norms. It's important to note that restaurant practices are regulated by health codes, and restaurants are routinely inspected by health officials. Everything we have done in our supply chain and in our restaurants has been within industry norms."[134] Yet, FiveThirtyEight pointed out that the 2015 norovirus outbreak appears to be unusual[135] and others are criticizing their food sourcing or handling practices.[136][137] MarketWatch wrote that the result of all of these outbreaks will be to force Chipotle to obtain their produce from larger corporate farms that can afford the more extensive microbial food-safety testing programs and to process vegetables at centralized locations instead of at the individual stores, both of which are industry-standard practices that the company had previously criticized.[138] The New York Times implied that the company's insistence on maintaining its long standing rhetoric about "food integrity" seemed to be quite opposite with the realities of recent current events and made it appear that the management was just ignoring their current problems.[139] It also has been pointed out that Chipotle's current record-keeping system is actually hindering the health authorities' investigation in locating the sources of the various infections.[139]
A writer for the magazine Popular Science pointed out that Chipotle had publicly acknowledged that they "may be at a higher risk for food-borne illness outbreaks than some competitors due to our use of fresh produce and meats rather than frozen, and our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation."[140][141][142] Henry I. Miller, a medical researcher and columnist and the founding director of the FDA's Office of Biotechnology, asked: "One wonders whether Chipotle’s "traditional methods" include employees' neglecting to wash their hands before preparing food, which is how norovirus is usually spread. And the fresh versus frozen dichotomy is nothing more than a snow-job. Freezing E. coli-contaminated food does not kill the pathogens; it preserves them."[143] Describing food poisoning outbreaks as "something of a Chipotle trademark; the recent ones are the fourth and fifth this year [2015], one of which was not disclosed to the public", Miller notes that "a particularly worrisome aspect of the company's serial deficiencies is that there have been at least three unrelated pathogens in the outbreaks – Salmonella and E. coli bacteria and norovirus. In other words, there has been more than a single glitch; suppliers and employees have found a variety of ways to contaminate what Chipotle cavalierly sells (at premium prices) to its customers."[143]
A writer for the North Carolina newspaper The News & Observer called Chipotle's "food with integrity" a "lucrative farce" and a "marketing ploy" by pointing out that organic food is "often grown with manure (an 'all-natural' fertilizer), which can certainly increase the risks of accidentally spreading fecal bacteria like E. coli."[144]
In December 2015, Seattle health officials closed a Seattle-area Chipotle for a day after it had repeatedly had small numbers of violations during recent consecutive inspections that previously would not have generated a closure order.[145] On December 10, 2015, CEO Steve Ells released a press statement apologizing for 2015 outbreaks and promised changes to minimize the risks of future outbreaks.[146]
March 2008 hepatitis outbreak[edit]
In March and April 2008, the Community Epidemiology Branch of the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency traced a hepatitis A outbreak in San Diego County to a single Chipotle restaurant located in La Mesa, California in which 22 customers were infected with the virus.[147][148]
April 2008 norovirus outbreak[edit]
In 2008, Chipotle was implicated in a norovirus outbreak in Kent, Ohio, where over 400 people became ill after eating at a Chipotle restaurant.[149] Officials at the Ohio Department of Health said that the outbreak was caused by Norovirus Genotype G2.[150] Many of the victims were students at Kent State University.[151] The initial source of the outbreak was never found.
February 2009 Campylobacter jejuni outbreak[edit]
In 2009, an investigation by the Minnesota Department of Health traced an outbreak of campylobacteriosis to a Chipotle Mexican Grill in Apple Valley, Minnesota.[152][153][154] The investigation found that chicken was sometimes served undercooked by the restaurant and determined that lettuce which had been cross-contaminated with raw or undercooked chicken was the vector for the outbreak.[155][156][third-party source needed]
July 2015 E. coli outbreak[edit]
In early November 2015, The Oregonian reported that there was a little-known E. coli outbreak that had occurred earlier in July in which five persons were infected with the O157:H7 strain of E. coli. The outbreak was traced to a single Chipotle location in Seattle and that the incident was not publicized at that time.[157][158] Seattle public health officials defended their actions at that time by saying that the outbreak was over by the time they made an association with Chipotle. Health officials were unable to trace the source of the July outbreak and said that the cause of the July outbreak is unrelated to the October/November outbreak.[157]
August 2015 norovirus outbreak[edit]
Another norovirus outbreak was confirmed to have occurred in August 2015 at a Simi Valley, California location in which 80 customers and 18 employees reported becoming ill.[159][160] Ventura County health inspectors found various health violations during two inspections following the outbreak report.[161] Despite those violations, the county health officials did not close the restaurant and allowed it to continue to operate.[159] In a January 2016 article, the New York Times reported that the number of victims involved in the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak was actually 207, twice the number that was reported earlier.[162]
In an unusual move, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California in conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration has gotten a federal grand jury to issue a subpoena in January 2016 as part of a criminal investigation seeking documents and information from Chipotle concerning the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak.[162][163] As of January 2016[update], it is too early to tell which organization is the actual target of the investigation. In most cases involving norovirus outbreaks that involved a single location, state and/or local authorities are the usual jurisdiction responsible in the investigation and prosecution of those type of cases. However, Ventura County officials had been criticized for their handling of parts of their investigation, and for allowing the restaurant to continue to operate after finding health violations during consecutive inspections.
Less than two weeks later, a federal class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California claiming that Chipotle knowingly allowed an ill kitchen manager to work for two days before sending that person home. Then, the restaurant actively deep-cleaned the restaurant to remove all traces of contamination prior to notifying the Ventura County Environmental Health Division of the existing outbreak, hindering their investigation. The lawsuit also claimed that the number of known victims was as high as 234 and estimates that the number of meals that the infected employee may have come in contact with could be as high 3,000.[164][165][166]
August 2015 Salmonella outbreak[edit]
At almost the same time as the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak, Minnesota health officials confirmed a Salmonella outbreak that affected 17 Minneapolis-area Chipotle restaurants in mid-August 2015. The source of the outbreak was traced back to contaminated tomatoes that were grown in Mexico.[167][168] The Minnesota Department of Health reported that samples from 45 victims were tested and found that their illness was caused by the Salmonella Newport bacterium as determined by DNA profiling.[169] Later, the state officials reported that the total of persons who became infected was increased to 64 and the number Chipotle locations in which they had acquired the bacterium was increased to 22, all located within the state of Minnesota.[170]
October 2015 E. coli outbreak[edit]
In October 2015, at least 22 persons were reported to have gotten sick after eating at several different Chipotle locations in the states of Washington and Oregon. At that time, an epidemiologist for the Washington Health Department said the culprit appeared to be a Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli bacterium, but they were still waiting the outcome of several laboratory tests before they can give a definitive result.[171][172][173] As a precaution, Chipotle had closed 43 stores in Washington and Oregon pending the results and recommendations of the involved health authorities. On November 5, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had reported that the number of persons reported ill had risen to 40 known cases and that the bacteria samples taken from 7 infected persons in Washington and 3 persons in Oregon states were confirmed to be infected by the same strain of E. coli, the Shiga toxin-producing STEC O26 strain, as determined by DNA profiling.[174] At least 12 persons required hospitalization, but no fatalities. As of November 2015, Health authorities were still trying to trace the exact source of the bacterial contamination, but suspected fresh produce.[175]
On November 12, the CDC increased the number of known cases to 50, the number of persons requiring hospitalization to 14, and the number of DNA fingerprint confirmations to 33.[176] Through a match via Pulsenet, the DNA fingerprint also matched a recent case in Minnesota, but the ill person did not eat at Chipotle. The source of the bacteria infection still had not yet been determined at the time of the report released by the CDC and the CDC is trying to use the more definitive, but more time consuming whole genome sequencing procedure to see if they are able to determine the relationships between all of the STEC O26 cases. In the meantime, Chipotle reopened the closed restaurants on November 11 after disposing all of the food within the closed facilities and deep cleaning those facilities.[177]
On November 20, the CDC reported that the number of STEC O26 cases, as determined by DNA fingerprinting, had increased to 45 with 16 persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to six.[178] Besides Oregon and Washington, new cases were reported in the states of Minnesota, California, New York, and Ohio.[179] 43 out of 45 of the affected individuals had reported that they had eaten at a Chipotle in the week before they had become sick.
On December 4, the CDC reported that the number of STEC O26 cases, as determined by DNA fingerprinting, had increased to 52 with 20 persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to nine.[180] New cases were reported in the states of California (1), Illinois (1), Maryland (1), Ohio (2), Pennsylvania (1), and Washington (1).[181]
The price of shares for Chipotle stock dropped a further 12% immediately after the CDC had issued their update on November 20.[182] Share prices had been dropping since the initial announcement of the E. coli outbreak in late October with investors unsure if the drop in share prices just a temporary aberration and that Chipotle management is handling the incident as well as they could. Chipotle has since hired a consultant to improve their food safety program and have their program reviewed by both the CDC and FDA.[183]
On February 1, 2016, the CDC official closed their investigations on the larger E. coli that started in Pacific Northwest in October 2015 and also the smaller outbreak that started in Kansas and Oklahoma in November since no new cases were reported since December 1.[184] In their final report, the CDC stated that 55 persons in 11 states were infected with the same strain of STEC O26 during the major outbreak with 21 of those persons requiring hospitalization. The five persons infected in the later outbreak were made ill by a generically different strain of STEC O26. The CDC also reported that federal and local health and food safety authorities were unable to detect traces of the microorganisms in any of the food samples taken from the suspected restaurants or from their supply chain. The CDC, FDA, and the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service were unable to determine a point source that was in common in the meals that were consumed by all the victims since some of the restaurants were located far apart and had obtained some of their ingredients from different suppliers while other consumers of the suspected suppliers were not affected.
November 2015 E. coli cases[edit]
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on December 21 that five more people became ill after eating at two Chipotle restaurants located in Kansas and Oklahoma in late November. Preliminary DNA fingerprinting results appear to indicated that the newer cases were caused by a different strain of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O26. Scientists are waiting for the results of the more definitive whole genome sequencing analyses to determine if the organisms responsible for this outbreak are genetically related to the E. coli that are responsible for causing the outbreak that had started in Oregon and Washington in late October and thus an extension of that outbreak. The agency has not yet determined which food is responsible for the outbreak.[185] The Food and Drug Administration reported that they are trying to determine how the bacteria in these cases, along with the earlier Oregon, Washington, and other multi-state cases, might have been propagated through the food supply chain.[186]
December 2015 norovirus outbreak[edit]




The closed restaurant on December 16, 2015


In December 2015, eighty students at Boston College were sickened after eating at a single Chipotle restaurant. Affected students had been tested for both E. coli and norovirus in order to determine the cause of the illnesses.[187] Although it would take as long as two days before the results of more definitive tests became known, public health investigators reported that preliminary tests pointed to the presence of norovirus.[188] The health inspectors for the City of Boston had since closed this particular location on December 7 for a number of health violations that included maintaining meats at a too low of a temperature on the serving line and for allowing a sick employee to work at the time of the inspection.[189]
On December 10, officials from the Boston Public Health Commission reported that tests had identified a single strain of norovirus that is responsible for this particular outbreak.[190] Boston Globe reported on December 10 that 141 persons were reported to have gotten ill and that some of the newer victims had not visited Chipotle before contracting the virus[191] and most likely became infected by being in close proximity to someone who had gotten ill at Chipotle, such as a roommate or dorm-mate.[190] Boston authorities traced the cause of the outbreak to a sick employee who was allowed to work on the day of the outbreak. Chipotle has since fired the employee and also the manager who knowingly allowed the ill worker to complete his shift instead of following health codes.[192]
Consequences[edit]
On February 8, 2016, Chipotle closed all of its eateries nationwide for a few hours during the morning for an all-staff meeting on food safety.[193] The company hired a new head of food safety, who instituted changes including having all employees wash hands every half hour, having two employees verify that produce like onions, jalapeños and avocados have been immersed in hot water for five seconds to kill germs on their exteriors, and using Pascalization to pre-treat food ingredients.[194]
Since the series of food-poisoning outbreaks in 2015 lowered trust in the product, Chipotle has tried to lure back its customers with free food and heavier advertising. Same-store sales increased 17.8% percent in the first quarter of 2017.[195]

Lawsuit[edit]
In November 2016, three men filed a class-action lawsuit against Chipotle alleging that a burrito was listed as containing only 300 calories, when in fact it contained more. They are seeking "unspecified damages and for an injunction against the company to prevent it from posting what it calls misleading information on its food."[196][197][198]
Advertising and publicity[edit]

In the past, Chipotle mainly relied on billboards, radio ads, and word of mouth to advertise.[30] In 2012, Chipotle aired its first nationally televised commercial during the 54th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony.[199] In 2010, the company initiated an ad campaign that mocks advice given to Chipotle by advertising agencies.[200] Chipotle has run many promotions giving out free food to potential customers, especially when opening a new store. Stores also give out free burritos on certain holidays; for instance, on Halloween, some locations have had promotions in which free burritos are given to people who come dressed as a burrito. Chipotle gave away free burritos to reporters during the 1997 trial of Timothy McVeigh, which took place in Chipotle's hometown of Denver.[201] In addition, stores offered free burritos to those displaced by Hurricane Katrina.[202] Chipotle received attention when Ozzy Osbourne's reality show The Osbournes featured the company's burritos heavily.[29] For Halloween 2010, Chipotle announced that customers dressed as a processed food product would receive a burrito for $2. The event was part of a $1 million fundraiser for Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution called "Boorito 2010: The Horrors of Processed Food."[203] For "Boorito 2011", customers dressed in costumes "inspired by family farms" will receive a menu item for $2, with proceeds from the promotion going to The Chipotle Cultivate Foundation and Farm Aid. The promotion is aimed to increase awareness of family farms.[204] Also in support of family farms, Chipotle released music videos of Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Willie Nelson.[205] On September 12, 2013, Chipotle released an animated short called The Scarecrow, with a companion mobile video game; both feature a narrative heavily critical of industrial farming, but little in the way of direct marketing for the chain.[206] The short features a cover of "Pure Imagination" from Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, sung by Fiona Apple.[207] It was named one of the worst advertisements of 2013 by The Wall Street Journal.[208]
In 2011, Chipotle created the "Farm Team", which is a rewards program available only by invitation from restaurant managers. The Farm Team members have access to a special Chipotle website, where members can earn rewards, i.e. free food and T-shirts. The site offers members to, "learn where Chipotle’s food comes from, take quizzes and polls, play games and watch videos about the company".[209] In April 2014, the Farm Team program was shut down.[210]
Chipotle sponsors Team Garmin-Barracuda (formerly Team Garmin-Chipotle, Team Garmin-Slipstream, Team Garmin-Transitions and Team Garmin-Cervélo) of the International Cycling Union,[211][212] and is an official team partner of the Boston Celtics,[213] and the Boston Bruins.[214] In June 2009, Chipotle sponsored free screenings of Food, Inc., a film that criticizes the corporate food industry. Founder Steve Ells stated that he hoped the film would make customers appreciate Chipotle's Food With Integrity policy.[215] From May until September 2009, Chipotle ran a contest on mychipotle.com, a microsite which had a competition for the best user-created audio and video presentations about different combinations of ingredients.[216][217] In July 2010, Chipotle began a campaign to support healthier lunch alternatives for students, in which money will be donated to The Lunch Box program based on how many spam E-mails consumers forward to a company E-mail address.[218] For Chipotle's 18 year anniversary, the company began wrapping its burritos in gold foil as part of a larger promotion to draw attention to its Food With Integrity mantra.[219] Also as part of the gold foil campaign, Chipotle is offering prizes for customer-created pictures of items wrapped in gold foil. Chipotle hired comedian Amy Sedaris to create a comedic how-to video on wrapping with gold foil, and spread the video using Twitter.[220] In March 2013, Chipotle pulled its sponsorship of a Boy Scouts of America event, citing that organization's ban on LGBT members.[221]

On December 16, 2015, Chipotle ran full page ads in both The Boston Globe and Boston Herald apologizing for the recent norovirus outbreak linked to Chipotle's Cleveland Circle location. The ad, containing a letter by Chipotle founder and co-CEO Steve Ells, affirmed the company's commitment to food safety.[222]
On March 14, 2016, a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) administrative law judge concluded that Chipotle’s social media policy, and more specifically its application towards an employee who posted tweets regarding wages and working conditions, violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).[223] A former Chipotle employee in Havertown, Pennsylvania, wrote a series of tweets from his personal account about hourly workers being required to work on snow days. Chipotle instructed the employee to delete the tweets. The NLRB judge determined that Chipotle’s request to delete the tweets violated the NLRA even though the employee was not disciplined as a result of his tweets.[224]
Architecture[edit]




The exterior of a Chipotle in Durham, North Carolina


Architecturally, all Chipotle restaurants are built using most of the same materials (plywood, corrugated metal, stainless steel, exposed ductwork), although each store is unique.[20][225] The interiors have been described as having an "industrial, sheet metal look".[226] Chipotle has built restaurants using white ceramic tile instead of stainless steel.[227] It costs the company approximately $850,000 to open a new restaurant.[228] When the first Chipotle opened, Steve Ells asked his friend, sculptor Bruce Gueswel, to design the chairs and a styled Mayan king whose face was loosely based on that of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., a personal inspiration of Gueswel, for the restaurant. Both items were made from wood and metal. Gueswel has continued to design and build the art and chairs for all subsequent Chipotle restaurants.[229]
Most Chipotle locations display a photograph of the original restaurant, which is near the University of Denver campus on Evans Avenue.[20] Instead of a photograph of itself, the original location has a photograph of the Dolly Madison Ice Cream that previously occupied the location. In 2010, Chipotle began opening "A Model" restaurants, which are smaller concept locations, citing the lower costs of development and occupancy.[230] Chipotle uses environmentally friendly packaging, with bowls made from recycled newsprint, unbleached tray liners, and napkins and cups made from postconsumer waste.[231]
Chipotle's architectural design team incorporates the principles of sustainable architecture in their projects. The "green" restaurant in Gurnee, Illinois features an on-site six kilowatt wind turbine, which generates about 10% of the restaurant's electrical needs. The Gurnee restaurant has received Platinum level LEED certification from U.S. Green Building Council.[232] A restaurant in Tulsa, Oklahoma, uses recycled drywall, low-VOC paint, and energy-efficient appliances.[233] A Chipotle restaurant in Austin, Texas was the first to receive a four-star rating from the city's Green Building Program.[234] Additionally, Chipotle has made arrangements to add solar panels to 75 of its restaurants.[232] Chipotle has contracted to clean its stores in New York City and Long Island, with "plant-based, environmentally preferable cleaning supplies and technologies." The cleansers are readily biodegradable and non-toxic to humans or aquatic life.[235]
Chipotle was the defendant in a lawsuit for failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Maurizio Antoninetti, a customer who used a wheelchair, claimed he was denied the "Chipotle Experience", because he was unable to see the food preparation. The case against the company was upheld in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,[236] and the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear Chipotle's appeal, leaving the Ninth Circuit's ruling intact.[237] Chipotle has "an official disability policy of bringing ingredients to the tables of diners with disabilities and doing tableside preparation." Chipotle is retrofitting restaurants affected by the ruling, replacing the walls in front of the food preparation area with lower ones or transparent panels. They are incorporating the new design elements into new restaurants.[236] The case was one of over twenty ADA-related lawsuits filed by Antoninetti, who died in 2011.[236][238]
Other restaurant units[edit]

Pizzeria Locale is a fast casual pizza restaurant formed as a partnership with Pizzeria Locale, a full-service pizza restaurant in Boulder, Colorado. The original Pizzeria Locale owners, Bobby Stuckey and Lachlan Mackinnon-Patterson, would continue to own their original location while Chipotle would increase its stake in the chain over time.[48] As of February 2017, the chain has seven locations.[51]
Tasty Made is a burger restaurant concept that Chipotle first opened in Lancaster, Ohio in October 2016.[239] On July 29, 2016, the company announced the opening of its first Tasty Made burger restaurant in the fall. The first location was revealed to be in Lancaster, Ohio. Ohio was selected as culinary manager Nate Appleman and national training director David Chrisman are both from the state and helped design the concept.[240] Tasty Made was announced to have a focused menu like early burger restaurants which were limited to burgers, fries and milkshakes.[51] Chipotle had trademarked Better Burger earlier in the year.


Defunct


Soul Daddy was a soul food fast casual restaurant that was owned by ANGR Holdings, LLC, and was managed by Chipotle after purchasing Ellis' stake in the company. The restaurant had three locations that had operated for less than 5 weeks in 2011 before closing.[241]
ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen was an Asian fast-casual concept restaurant that was opened by Chipotle in September 2011.[45] The company said that the new restaurant "would follow the Chipotle service format and its focus on 'food with integrity' in ingredients."[46] Chipotle's plan was to start with only one store, and see how the restaurant works out before expanding the concept.[47] By July 2016, the chain has 15 restaurants.[51] All ShopHouse locations were closed on March 17, 2017.[242]

Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (/tʃᵻˈpoʊtleɪ/)[6] is an American chain of fast casual restaurants in the United States, United Kingdom,[7] Canada,[8][9] Germany,[10] and France,[11] specializing in tacos and Mission-style[12][13] burritos. Its name derives from chipotle, the Nahuatl name for a smoked and dried jalapeño chili pepper.[14] The company currently trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CMG.[15]
The company has released a mission statement called Food with Integrity, which highlights its efforts in using naturally-grown ingredients,[6] and serves more naturally raised meat than any other restaurant chain.[16] Chipotle is one of the first chains of fast casual dining establishments.[17] Competitors in the fast-casual Mexican market include Qdoba Mexican Grill, Moe's Southwest Grill, Rubio's Coastal Grill, Pancheros Mexican Grill, Freebirds World Burrito, and Baja Fresh.[18]
Founded by Steve Ells on July 13, 1993. Chipotle had 16 restaurants (all in Colorado) when McDonald's Corporation became a major investor in 1998. By the time McDonald's fully divested itself from Chipotle in 2006,[19] the chain had grown to over 500 locations.
With more than 2,000 locations,[2] Chipotle had a net income of US$475.6 million and a staff of more than 45,000 employees in 2015.[2]

History[edit]




The first Chipotle, near the campus of the University of Denver


Founder Steve Ells attended the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York. Afterward, he became a line cook for Jeremiah Tower at Stars in San Francisco.[20] There, Ells observed the popularity of the taquerías and San Francisco burritos in the Mission District. In 1993, Ells took what he learned in San Francisco[21] and opened the first Chipotle Mexican Grill in Denver, Colorado, in a former Dolly Madison Ice Cream store at 1644 East Evans Avenue,[22] near the University of Denver campus, using an $85,000 loan from his father.[19] Ells and his father calculated that the store would need to sell 107 burritos per day to be profitable. After one month, the original restaurant was selling over 1,000 burritos a day.[15] The second store opened in 1995 using Chipotle's cash flow, and the third was opened using an SBA loan. To fund more growth, Ells' father invested $1.5 million. Afterwards, Ells created a board of directors and business plan, raising an additional $1.8 million for the company.[23] Ells had originally planned to use funds from the first Chipotle to open a fine-dining restaurant, but instead focused on Chipotle Mexican Grill when the restaurants saw success.[24][25]
In 1998, the first restaurant outside of Colorado opened in Kansas City, Missouri.[26] The company opened its first location in Minnesota by opening near the campus of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis in March 1999.[27]
In 1998, McDonald's made an initial minority investment in the company. By 2001, the company had grown to be Chipotle's largest investor.[19] The investment from McDonald's allowed the firm to quickly expand, from 16 restaurants in 1998 to over 500 by 2005.[28] On January 26, 2006, Chipotle made its initial public offering (IPO) after increasing the share price twice due to high pre-IPO demand. In its first day as a public company, the stock rose exactly 100%, resulting in the best U.S.-based IPO in six years, and the second-best IPO for a restaurant after Boston Market. The money from the offering was then used to fund new store growth.[29]
In October 2006, McDonald's fully divested from Chipotle.[30] This was part of a larger initiative for McDonald's to divest all of its non-core business restaurants — Chipotle, Donatos Pizza, and Boston Market — so that it could focus on the main McDonald's chain.[31] McDonald's invested approximately $360 million into Chipotle, and took out $1.5 billion.[23] McDonald's had attempted to get Chipotle to add drive-through windows and a breakfast menu, which Ells resisted.[32][33] In 2008, Chipotle opened its first location outside of the United States in Toronto.[9]
In a list of fastest-growing restaurant chains in 2009, Chipotle was ranked eighth, based on increases in U.S. sales over the past year,[34] and in 2010 Chipotle was ranked third.[35] Consumer Reports ranked Chipotle as the best Mexican fast-food chain in 2011.[36] The company serves approximately 750,000 customers per day.[37]
In December 2010, Chipotle hired chef Nate Appleman to develop new cuisine. Appleman has won Rising Star Chef from the James Beard Foundation, was named "Best New Chef" by Food & Wine magazine, and competed on The Next Iron Chef.[38]
In 2010, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) audited Chipotle's Minneapolis restaurants, and found that some employees had been hired using fraudulent documents. In December, Chipotle fired 450 employees from its Minneapolis restaurants as a result of the audit, resulting in protests by local groups.[39][40] In February 2011, ICE expanded the audit to include 60 restaurants in Virginia and Washington, D.C.[41] which resulted in 40 workers being fired. In April 2011, the criminal division of the Attorney General's office in Washington, D.C., joined the case, and ICE agents began interviewing employees at 20 to 25 restaurants in other locations, such as Los Angeles and Atlanta.[42] In response to the government investigations, Chipotle hired former director of ICE Julie Myers Wood and high-profile attorneys Robert Luskin and Gregory B. Craig.[43]
Other restaurant expansion[edit]
In 2011, Steve Ells was a judge for the TV show America's Next Great Restaurant and investor of ANGR Holdings, the company that will be running the winning concept's restaurants. Chipotle has agreed to purchase Ells' investment in ANGR at his cost, provide support for ANGR operations, and invest a total of $2.3 million in cash contributions.[44]
In September 2011, Chipotle opened an Asian fast-casual concept restaurant named ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen in Washington, D.C.[45] The company has said the new restaurant "would follow the Chipotle service format and its focus on 'food with integrity' in ingredients."[46] Chipotle's plan was to start with only one store, and see how the restaurant works out before expanding the concept.[47]
On December 18, 2013, the company revealed that it had opened its first fast-food pizza chain in Denver back in May 2013. According to Associated Press, Chipotle partnered with a local full-service restaurant called Pizzeria Locale to create a fast-food version of the eatery, keeping its name. The company plans to open at least two more pizzerias in the Denver area.[48]
In April 2014, Chipotle announced an increase in menu prices for the first time in nearly three years, due to increasing costs for steak, avocados, and cheese. The price increase was expected to be rolled out from the end of second quarter of 2014 through the end of the third quarter.[49] In late 2015, Chipotle expanded its mobile strategy through delivery partnerships with tech startups like Tapingo, a delivery service that targets college campuses.[50]
On July 29, 2016, the company announced the opening of its first Tasty Made burger restaurant in the fall. Chipotle was still dealing with the various virus outbreaks with additional marketing. The company was also reducing the number of new stores for the year from 235 to 220.[51]
International[edit]




The second Chipotle Mexican Grill location in London, located on Baker Street


According to an article in The Motley Fool, Chipotle had 17 locations outside of the United States by October 2014 with the majority in Canada, and the UK was in the process of opening more locations.[52] The rate of overseas expansion was slower than expected.[53] Many of the press reviewers thought that the food was overpriced for their area.[11][54]
As of 2017 there are 26 locations outside of the United States with 11 locations in Canada (Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver), 6 locations in The United Kingdom (London), 3 in France (Paris), and 1 in Germany (Frankfurt).[better source needed][2] [55]
Canada[edit]
In August 2008, Chipotle opened its first location outside of the United States in Toronto.[9] The second location in Toronto–and in all of Canada–was not opened until 2010.[53]
The first Canadian location outside of the Toronto area was opened in Vancouver in December 2012.[56] A second Vancouver-area location was opened in Burnaby in October 2014[57] followed by a third in Surrey in January 2016[58] and a fourth in Langley in October 2016.[59]
The first location in the nation's capital of Ottawa was opened in February 2017 at the Rideau Centre.[60]
United Kingdom[edit]
Chipotle expanded to Europe with the first European restaurant opening in May 2010 in London.[7][61][62] A second location open in London in September 2011.[63] The following year, three additional locations were quickly opened in the London area.[64] After this growth spurt, the rate of further expansion in London slowed greatly with the sixth location appearing in 2013[65] and the seventh in June 2015.[66] Although Chipotle blames the slow growth in the United Kingdom on the British unfamiliarity with Mexican foods,[67] several locally owned burrito chains had opened locations across the United Kingdom during the same interval.[68]
France[edit]
The first location in France opened in Paris in May 2012.[11][69]
Expansion in France was much slower than that in the United Kingdom or Canada, with a second location in Paris opening in 2013[70] and a third location in 2014.[71] At 7,000 square feet, the restaurant at La Défense is, as of 2015[update], the largest Chipotle location in the world, while a typical Chipotle restaurant is usually between 2,200 and 2,500 square feet.[72] A fourth Parisian location was opened in Levallois-Perret in 2015[73] followed by a fifth[74] and a sixth[75] Parisian location in 2016, both in Saint-Germain-des-Prés.
Germany[edit]
The first and, so far, only location in Germany opened in Frankfurt in August 2013.[10][54]
Corporate management[edit]
Chipotle's team includes a residing corporate office of managers and its board of directors. Members of both teams are appointed to serve on committees: audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance.
The top management team consists of the Chief Executive Officers, Steve Ells; the Chief Financial Officer, Jack R. Hartung; the Chief Marketing and Development Officer, Mark Crumpacker.[76] The current board of directors consists of: Steve Ells, Patrick Flynn, Albert Baldocchi, Neil Flanzraich, Darlene Friedman, Stephen Gillet, Kimbal Musk and John Charlesworth.[77]
Founder Steve Ells serves as chairman and Chief executive officer,[78] and has a 1.25% stake in the company.[79] The labor-market research firm Glassdoor reported that Steve Ells earned $29 million in 2014, versus a median of $19,000 for Chipotle's workers, making the CEO-to-worker pay ratio 1522:1.[80]
Operation and distribution[edit]
All of Chipotle's restaurants are company-owned, rather than franchised.[81] As of December 2012[update], 1430 restaurants have since opened throughout the United States and Canada, with locations in 43 states, Ontario, British Columbia, and the District of Columbia.[82][83]
The field team are the employees who work closely with but not directly within specific restaurants. The field support system includes apprentice team leaders (step up from restaurateurs), team leaders or area managers, team directors and regional directors (not atypical for them to oversee more than fifty locations).[84] Because Chipotle does not franchise, all restaurants are corporately owned. Thus, whenever Chipotle is in the process of launching a new location, the field team hires a new general manager and trains them at a current location so that they will be ready for the new location when it opens for business. The corporate office takes care of finding and funding new locations as well.[85]
Menu[edit]

Chipotle's menu consists of four items: burritos, bowls, tacos, and salads. The price of each item is based on the choice of chicken, pork carnitas, barbacoa, steak, tofu-based "sofritas",[86][87] chorizo (chicken and pork), or vegetarian (with guacamole, which would be at an extra charge otherwise). Additional optional toppings are offered free of charge, including: rice, beans, four types of salsa, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce.[88][89] When asked in 2007 about expanding the menu, Steve Ells said, "[I]t's important to keep the menu focused, because if you just do a few things, you can ensure that you do them better than anybody else."[90] Chipotle also offers a children's menu.[91][92] Most restaurants sell beer and margaritas in addition to soft drinks and fruit drinks.[93]
The majority of food is prepared in each restaurant. Some exceptions are the beans and carnitas, which are prepared at a central kitchen in Chicago, Illinois.[94] None of the restaurants have freezers, microwave ovens, or can openers.[95]




Chicken Burrito Bowl


The chain experimented with breakfast foods at two airports in the Washington (D.C.) metropolitan area but decided against expanding the menu in that direction.[96][97][98] Starting in 2009, selected restaurants had offered a pozole soup,[99][100][101] which has since been discontinued.
In June 2015, Chipotle began test marketing a pork and chicken chorizo-type sausage as a new protein option at selected locations in the Kansas City area.[102][103][104] Some food writers have expressed their health related concerns over the protein's relatively high sodium content since a 4-ounce serving contains 293 calories and 803 milligrams of sodium[105] while the American Heart Association’s recommended daily amount is less than 1,500 milligrams of sodium.[106] In contrast, the protein options with next highest sodium contents are Barbacoa with 530 milligrams and sofritas with 555 milligrams.[105] An earlier version on the Mexican sausage was tested in Denver and New York City in 2011,[107] but that test was terminated when that version of the sausage was perceived as looking too greasy.[108] As of fall 2016, chorizo is available nationwide.
Chipotle accepts fax orders, and in 2005 the company added the ability to order online from their website. For both online and fax orders, customers proceed to the front of the line to pay for pre-ordered food.[109] In 2009, Chipotle released an app for the iPhone that allows users to find nearby Chipotle locations, place an order, and prepay with a credit card.[110] In 2013, Chipotle released an Android app that allows users to locate nearby Chipotle locations, place an order, prepay with a credit or gift card, and access favorites and recent orders.[111][112]
Nutrition[edit]
In 2003, a Center for Science in the Public Interest report stated that Chipotle's burritos contain over 1,000 calories, which is nearly equivalent to two meals' worth of food.[113][114] MSNBC Health.com placed the burritos on their list of the "20 Worst Foods in America" because of their high caloric content and high sodium.[115] When a burrito with carnitas, rice, vegetables, cheese, guacamole, and salsa was compared with a typical Big Mac, the burrito had more fat, cholesterol, carbohydrates, and sodium than the Big Mac, but it also had more protein and fiber.[116] The restaurant has also received praise – Health.com included the restaurant in its list of the "Healthiest Fast Food Restaurants".[117]
Chipotle's vegetarian options include rice, black beans, fajita vegetables (onions and bell peppers), salsa, guacamole and cheese.[118] All items other than the meats, cheese, sour cream, and honey vinaigrette dressing are vegan.[118] As of late 2013, Chipotle developed a new cooking strategy for the pinto beans, eliminating the bacon and making them vegetarian and vegan-friendly.[119] The cheese is processed with vegetable-based rennet in order to be suitable for vegetarians.[118] In April 2010, Chipotle began testing a vegan "Garden Blend" option, which is a plant-based meat alternative marinated in chipotle adobo, at six locations in the U.S.[120][121] The flour tortillas used for the burritos and soft tacos are the only items that contain gluten.[118]
Food sourcing[edit]
In 1999, while looking for ways to improve the taste of the carnitas,[20] Steve Ells was prompted by an article written by Edward Behr to visit Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs).[122] Ells found the CAFOs "horrific", and began sourcing from open-range pork suppliers. This caused an increase in both the price and the sales of the carnitas burritos.[61]
In 2001, Chipotle released a mission statement called Food With Integrity, which highlighted Chipotle's efforts to increase their use of naturally raised meat, organic produce, and dairy without added hormones.[6] Chipotle only uses the leg and thigh meat from its chickens; the breast meat is sold to Panera Bread.[123]

Founder Steve Ells has testified before the United States Congress in support of the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act, which aims to reduce the amount of antibiotics given to farm animals.[61][124]
Since 2006, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW), a Floridian farmworker organization, has protested Chipotle’s refusal to sign a Fair Food agreement, which would commit the restaurant chain to pay a penny-per-pound premium on its Florida tomatoes to boost tomato harvesters’ wages, and to only buy Florida tomatoes from growers who comply with the Fair Food Code of Conduct.[125] In 2009, the creators of the documentary film Food, Inc. (along with 31 other leaders in the sustainable food movement) signed an open letter of support for the CIW’s campaign, stating that, “If Chipotle is sincere in its wishes to reform its supply chain, the time has come to work with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers as a true partner in the protection of farmworkers rights.”[126] In September 2009, Chipotle announced that it would sidestep partnership with the CIW and instead work directly with East Coast Growers and Packers to increase wages for its tomato pickers.[127] CEO Steve Ells has framed the dispute as a fundamental issue of control, stating that, “the CIW wants us to sign a contract that would let them control Chipotle's decisions regarding food in the future."[128] In October 2012, Chipotle Mexican Grill signed an agreement with the CIW and became the 11th company to join the organization's Fair Food Program.[129]
In January 2015, Chipotle pulled carnitas from its menu in a third of its restaurants; company officials cited animal welfare problems at one of the suppliers, found during a regular audit, as the reason.[130] Subsequently, a false rumor spread online claiming it was done to appease Muslims who consider pork to be unclean, leading to some protests on social media.[131] The company still uses antibiotic-free and hormone-free steak in its restaurants, despite being briefly forced to "serve beef that is not naturally raised" during the summer of 2013, posting an in-store notice each time that occurred.[132] Roberto Ferdman of The Washington Post opined that Chipotle's stated mission to sell "food with integrity" may be "untenable" if meat producers continue to breach Chipotle's ethical standards.[130]
Also in 2015, Chipotle stopped using genetically modified corn and soy beans in their foods, claiming to be the first nationwide restaurant to cook completely GMO free.[133] This was done in response to increasing consumer demand for GMO free products.
Food safety[edit]

 "How Chipotle made hundreds of people barf". Vox report dated January 6, 2016, explaining Chipotle's "food safety crisis".


Since 2008, a former Kansas State University food safety professor has accused Chipotle of confusing the public by using such terms as "naturally raised meats", "organic ingredients", and "locally sourced" and trying to equate those terms with food safety.[134] In rebuttal, a Chipotle spokesperson told The Daily Beast that "all of our practices have always been very much within industry norms. It's important to note that restaurant practices are regulated by health codes, and restaurants are routinely inspected by health officials. Everything we have done in our supply chain and in our restaurants has been within industry norms."[134] Yet, FiveThirtyEight pointed out that the 2015 norovirus outbreak appears to be unusual[135] and others are criticizing their food sourcing or handling practices.[136][137] MarketWatch wrote that the result of all of these outbreaks will be to force Chipotle to obtain their produce from larger corporate farms that can afford the more extensive microbial food-safety testing programs and to process vegetables at centralized locations instead of at the individual stores, both of which are industry-standard practices that the company had previously criticized.[138] The New York Times implied that the company's insistence on maintaining its long standing rhetoric about "food integrity" seemed to be quite opposite with the realities of recent current events and made it appear that the management was just ignoring their current problems.[139] It also has been pointed out that Chipotle's current record-keeping system is actually hindering the health authorities' investigation in locating the sources of the various infections.[139]
A writer for the magazine Popular Science pointed out that Chipotle had publicly acknowledged that they "may be at a higher risk for food-borne illness outbreaks than some competitors due to our use of fresh produce and meats rather than frozen, and our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation."[140][141][142] Henry I. Miller, a medical researcher and columnist and the founding director of the FDA's Office of Biotechnology, asked: "One wonders whether Chipotle’s "traditional methods" include employees' neglecting to wash their hands before preparing food, which is how norovirus is usually spread. And the fresh versus frozen dichotomy is nothing more than a snow-job. Freezing E. coli-contaminated food does not kill the pathogens; it preserves them."[143] Describing food poisoning outbreaks as "something of a Chipotle trademark; the recent ones are the fourth and fifth this year [2015], one of which was not disclosed to the public", Miller notes that "a particularly worrisome aspect of the company's serial deficiencies is that there have been at least three unrelated pathogens in the outbreaks – Salmonella and E. coli bacteria and norovirus. In other words, there has been more than a single glitch; suppliers and employees have found a variety of ways to contaminate what Chipotle cavalierly sells (at premium prices) to its customers."[143]
A writer for the North Carolina newspaper The News & Observer called Chipotle's "food with integrity" a "lucrative farce" and a "marketing ploy" by pointing out that organic food is "often grown with manure (an 'all-natural' fertilizer), which can certainly increase the risks of accidentally spreading fecal bacteria like E. coli."[144]
In December 2015, Seattle health officials closed a Seattle-area Chipotle for a day after it had repeatedly had small numbers of violations during recent consecutive inspections that previously would not have generated a closure order.[145] On December 10, 2015, CEO Steve Ells released a press statement apologizing for 2015 outbreaks and promised changes to minimize the risks of future outbreaks.[146]
March 2008 hepatitis outbreak[edit]
In March and April 2008, the Community Epidemiology Branch of the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency traced a hepatitis A outbreak in San Diego County to a single Chipotle restaurant located in La Mesa, California in which 22 customers were infected with the virus.[147][148]
April 2008 norovirus outbreak[edit]
In 2008, Chipotle was implicated in a norovirus outbreak in Kent, Ohio, where over 400 people became ill after eating at a Chipotle restaurant.[149] Officials at the Ohio Department of Health said that the outbreak was caused by Norovirus Genotype G2.[150] Many of the victims were students at Kent State University.[151] The initial source of the outbreak was never found.
February 2009 Campylobacter jejuni outbreak[edit]
In 2009, an investigation by the Minnesota Department of Health traced an outbreak of campylobacteriosis to a Chipotle Mexican Grill in Apple Valley, Minnesota.[152][153][154] The investigation found that chicken was sometimes served undercooked by the restaurant and determined that lettuce which had been cross-contaminated with raw or undercooked chicken was the vector for the outbreak.[155][156][third-party source needed]
July 2015 E. coli outbreak[edit]
In early November 2015, The Oregonian reported that there was a little-known E. coli outbreak that had occurred earlier in July in which five persons were infected with the O157:H7 strain of E. coli. The outbreak was traced to a single Chipotle location in Seattle and that the incident was not publicized at that time.[157][158] Seattle public health officials defended their actions at that time by saying that the outbreak was over by the time they made an association with Chipotle. Health officials were unable to trace the source of the July outbreak and said that the cause of the July outbreak is unrelated to the October/November outbreak.[157]
August 2015 norovirus outbreak[edit]
Another norovirus outbreak was confirmed to have occurred in August 2015 at a Simi Valley, California location in which 80 customers and 18 employees reported becoming ill.[159][160] Ventura County health inspectors found various health violations during two inspections following the outbreak report.[161] Despite those violations, the county health officials did not close the restaurant and allowed it to continue to operate.[159] In a January 2016 article, the New York Times reported that the number of victims involved in the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak was actually 207, twice the number that was reported earlier.[162]
In an unusual move, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California in conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration has gotten a federal grand jury to issue a subpoena in January 2016 as part of a criminal investigation seeking documents and information from Chipotle concerning the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak.[162][163] As of January 2016[update], it is too early to tell which organization is the actual target of the investigation. In most cases involving norovirus outbreaks that involved a single location, state and/or local authorities are the usual jurisdiction responsible in the investigation and prosecution of those type of cases. However, Ventura County officials had been criticized for their handling of parts of their investigation, and for allowing the restaurant to continue to operate after finding health violations during consecutive inspections.
Less than two weeks later, a federal class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California claiming that Chipotle knowingly allowed an ill kitchen manager to work for two days before sending that person home. Then, the restaurant actively deep-cleaned the restaurant to remove all traces of contamination prior to notifying the Ventura County Environmental Health Division of the existing outbreak, hindering their investigation. The lawsuit also claimed that the number of known victims was as high as 234 and estimates that the number of meals that the infected employee may have come in contact with could be as high 3,000.[164][165][166]
August 2015 Salmonella outbreak[edit]
At almost the same time as the Simi Valley norovirus outbreak, Minnesota health officials confirmed a Salmonella outbreak that affected 17 Minneapolis-area Chipotle restaurants in mid-August 2015. The source of the outbreak was traced back to contaminated tomatoes that were grown in Mexico.[167][168] The Minnesota Department of Health reported that samples from 45 victims were tested and found that their illness was caused by the Salmonella Newport bacterium as determined by DNA profiling.[169] Later, the state officials reported that the total of persons who became infected was increased to 64 and the number Chipotle locations in which they had acquired the bacterium was increased to 22, all located within the state of Minnesota.[170]
October 2015 E. coli outbreak[edit]
In October 2015, at least 22 persons were reported to have gotten sick after eating at several different Chipotle locations in the states of Washington and Oregon. At that time, an epidemiologist for the Washington Health Department said the culprit appeared to be a Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli bacterium, but they were still waiting the outcome of several laboratory tests before they can give a definitive result.[171][172][173] As a precaution, Chipotle had closed 43 stores in Washington and Oregon pending the results and recommendations of the involved health authorities. On November 5, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had reported that the number of persons reported ill had risen to 40 known cases and that the bacteria samples taken from 7 infected persons in Washington and 3 persons in Oregon states were confirmed to be infected by the same strain of E. coli, the Shiga toxin-producing STEC O26 strain, as determined by DNA profiling.[174] At least 12 persons required hospitalization, but no fatalities. As of November 2015, Health authorities were still trying to trace the exact source of the bacterial contamination, but suspected fresh produce.[175]
On November 12, the CDC increased the number of known cases to 50, the number of persons requiring hospitalization to 14, and the number of DNA fingerprint confirmations to 33.[176] Through a match via Pulsenet, the DNA fingerprint also matched a recent case in Minnesota, but the ill person did not eat at Chipotle. The source of the bacteria infection still had not yet been determined at the time of the report released by the CDC and the CDC is trying to use the more definitive, but more time consuming whole genome sequencing procedure to see if they are able to determine the relationships between all of the STEC O26 cases. In the meantime, Chipotle reopened the closed restaurants on November 11 after disposing all of the food within the closed facilities and deep cleaning those facilities.[177]
On November 20, the CDC reported that the number of STEC O26 cases, as determined by DNA fingerprinting, had increased to 45 with 16 persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to six.[178] Besides Oregon and Washington, new cases were reported in the states of Minnesota, California, New York, and Ohio.[179] 43 out of 45 of the affected individuals had reported that they had eaten at a Chipotle in the week before they had become sick.
On December 4, the CDC reported that the number of STEC O26 cases, as determined by DNA fingerprinting, had increased to 52 with 20 persons requiring hospitalization and the total number states being affected had increased to nine.[180] New cases were reported in the states of California (1), Illinois (1), Maryland (1), Ohio (2), Pennsylvania (1), and Washington (1).[181]
The price of shares for Chipotle stock dropped a further 12% immediately after the CDC had issued their update on November 20.[182] Share prices had been dropping since the initial announcement of the E. coli outbreak in late October with investors unsure if the drop in share prices just a temporary aberration and that Chipotle management is handling the incident as well as they could. Chipotle has since hired a consultant to improve their food safety program and have their program reviewed by both the CDC and FDA.[183]
On February 1, 2016, the CDC official closed their investigations on the larger E. coli that started in Pacific Northwest in October 2015 and also the smaller outbreak that started in Kansas and Oklahoma in November since no new cases were reported since December 1.[184] In their final report, the CDC stated that 55 persons in 11 states were infected with the same strain of STEC O26 during the major outbreak with 21 of those persons requiring hospitalization. The five persons infected in the later outbreak were made ill by a generically different strain of STEC O26. The CDC also reported that federal and local health and food safety authorities were unable to detect traces of the microorganisms in any of the food samples taken from the suspected restaurants or from their supply chain. The CDC, FDA, and the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service were unable to determine a point source that was in common in the meals that were consumed by all the victims since some of the restaurants were located far apart and had obtained some of their ingredients from different suppliers while other consumers of the suspected suppliers were not affected.
November 2015 E. coli cases[edit]
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on December 21 that five more people became ill after eating at two Chipotle restaurants located in Kansas and Oklahoma in late November. Preliminary DNA fingerprinting results appear to indicated that the newer cases were caused by a different strain of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O26. Scientists are waiting for the results of the more definitive whole genome sequencing analyses to determine if the organisms responsible for this outbreak are genetically related to the E. coli that are responsible for causing the outbreak that had started in Oregon and Washington in late October and thus an extension of that outbreak. The agency has not yet determined which food is responsible for the outbreak.[185] The Food and Drug Administration reported that they are trying to determine how the bacteria in these cases, along with the earlier Oregon, Washington, and other multi-state cases, might have been propagated through the food supply chain.[186]
December 2015 norovirus outbreak[edit]




The closed restaurant on December 16, 2015


In December 2015, eighty students at Boston College were sickened after eating at a single Chipotle restaurant. Affected students had been tested for both E. coli and norovirus in order to determine the cause of the illnesses.[187] Although it would take as long as two days before the results of more definitive tests became known, public health investigators reported that preliminary tests pointed to the presence of norovirus.[188] The health inspectors for the City of Boston had since closed this particular location on December 7 for a number of health violations that included maintaining meats at a too low of a temperature on the serving line and for allowing a sick employee to work at the time of the inspection.[189]
On December 10, officials from the Boston Public Health Commission reported that tests had identified a single strain of norovirus that is responsible for this particular outbreak.[190] Boston Globe reported on December 10 that 141 persons were reported to have gotten ill and that some of the newer victims had not visited Chipotle before contracting the virus[191] and most likely became infected by being in close proximity to someone who had gotten ill at Chipotle, such as a roommate or dorm-mate.[190] Boston authorities traced the cause of the outbreak to a sick employee who was allowed to work on the day of the outbreak. Chipotle has since fired the employee and also the manager who knowingly allowed the ill worker to complete his shift instead of following health codes.[192]
Consequences[edit]
On February 8, 2016, Chipotle closed all of its eateries nationwide for a few hours during the morning for an all-staff meeting on food safety.[193] The company hired a new head of food safety, who instituted changes including having all employees wash hands every half hour, having two employees verify that produce like onions, jalapeños and avocados have been immersed in hot water for five seconds to kill germs on their exteriors, and using Pascalization to pre-treat food ingredients.[194]
Since the series of food-poisoning outbreaks in 2015 lowered trust in the product, Chipotle has tried to lure back its customers with free food and heavier advertising. Same-store sales increased 17.8% percent in the first quarter of 2017.[195]

Lawsuit[edit]
In November 2016, three men filed a class-action lawsuit against Chipotle alleging that a burrito was listed as containing only 300 calories, when in fact it contained more. They are seeking "unspecified damages and for an injunction against the company to prevent it from posting what it calls misleading information on its food."[196][197][198]
Advertising and publicity[edit]




People line up outside a Chipotle in East Lansing, Michigan during a "Free Burrito Day"


In the past, Chipotle mainly relied on billboards, radio ads, and word of mouth to advertise.[30] In 2012, Chipotle aired its first nationally televised commercial during the 54th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony.[199] In 2010, the company initiated an ad campaign that mocks advice given to Chipotle by advertising agencies.[200] Chipotle has run many promotions giving out free food to potential customers, especially when opening a new store. Stores also give out free burritos on certain holidays; for instance, on Halloween, some locations have had promotions in which free burritos are given to people who come dressed as a burrito. Chipotle gave away free burritos to reporters during the 1997 trial of Timothy McVeigh, which took place in Chipotle's hometown of Denver.[201] In addition, stores offered free burritos to those displaced by Hurricane Katrina.[202] Chipotle received attention when Ozzy Osbourne's reality show The Osbournes featured the company's burritos heavily.[29] For Halloween 2010, Chipotle announced that customers dressed as a processed food product would receive a burrito for $2. The event was part of a $1 million fundraiser for Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution called "Boorito 2010: The Horrors of Processed Food."[203] For "Boorito 2011", customers dressed in costumes "inspired by family farms" will receive a menu item for $2, with proceeds from the promotion going to The Chipotle Cultivate Foundation and Farm Aid. The promotion is aimed to increase awareness of family farms.[204] Also in support of family farms, Chipotle released music videos of Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Willie Nelson.[205] On September 12, 2013, Chipotle released an animated short called The Scarecrow, with a companion mobile video game; both feature a narrative heavily critical of industrial farming, but little in the way of direct marketing for the chain.[206] The short features a cover of "Pure Imagination" from Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, sung by Fiona Apple.[207] It was named one of the worst advertisements of 2013 by The Wall Street Journal.[208]
In 2011, Chipotle created the "Farm Team", which is a rewards program available only by invitation from restaurant managers. The Farm Team members have access to a special Chipotle website, where members can earn rewards, i.e. free food and T-shirts. The site offers members to, "learn where Chipotle’s food comes from, take quizzes and polls, play games and watch videos about the company".[209] In April 2014, the Farm Team program was shut down.[210]
Chipotle sponsors Team Garmin-Barracuda (formerly Team Garmin-Chipotle, Team Garmin-Slipstream, Team Garmin-Transitions and Team Garmin-Cervélo) of the International Cycling Union,[211][212] and is an official team partner of the Boston Celtics,[213] and the Boston Bruins.[214] In June 2009, Chipotle sponsored free screenings of Food, Inc., a film that criticizes the corporate food industry. Founder Steve Ells stated that he hoped the film would make customers appreciate Chipotle's Food With Integrity policy.[215] From May until September 2009, Chipotle ran a contest on mychipotle.com, a microsite which had a competition for the best user-created audio and video presentations about different combinations of ingredients.[216][217] In July 2010, Chipotle began a campaign to support healthier lunch alternatives for students, in which money will be donated to The Lunch Box program based on how many spam E-mails consumers forward to a company E-mail address.[218] For Chipotle's 18 year anniversary, the company began wrapping its burritos in gold foil as part of a larger promotion to draw attention to its Food With Integrity mantra.[219] Also as part of the gold foil campaign, Chipotle is offering prizes for customer-created pictures of items wrapped in gold foil. Chipotle hired comedian Amy Sedaris to create a comedic how-to video on wrapping with gold foil, and spread the video using Twitter.[220] In March 2013, Chipotle pulled its sponsorship of a Boy Scouts of America event, citing that organization's ban on LGBT members.[221]

On December 16, 2015, Chipotle ran full page ads in both The Boston Globe and Boston Herald apologizing for the recent norovirus outbreak linked to Chipotle's Cleveland Circle location. The ad, containing a letter by Chipotle founder and co-CEO Steve Ells, affirmed the company's commitment to food safety.[222]
On March 14, 2016, a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) administrative law judge concluded that Chipotle’s social media policy, and more specifically its application towards an employee who posted tweets regarding wages and working conditions, violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).[223] A former Chipotle employee in Havertown, Pennsylvania, wrote a series of tweets from his personal account about hourly workers being required to work on snow days. Chipotle instructed the employee to delete the tweets. The NLRB judge determined that Chipotle’s request to delete the tweets violated the NLRA even though the employee was not disciplined as a result of his tweets.[224]
Architecture[edit]




The exterior of a Chipotle in Durham, North Carolina


Architecturally, all Chipotle restaurants are built using most of the same materials (plywood, corrugated metal, stainless steel, exposed ductwork), although each store is unique.[20][225] The interiors have been described as having an "industrial, sheet metal look".[226] Chipotle has built restaurants using white ceramic tile instead of stainless steel.[227] It costs the company approximately $850,000 to open a new restaurant.[228] When the first Chipotle opened, Steve Ells asked his friend, sculptor Bruce Gueswel, to design the chairs and a styled Mayan king whose face was loosely based on that of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., a personal inspiration of Gueswel, for the restaurant. Both items were made from wood and metal. Gueswel has continued to design and build the art and chairs for all subsequent Chipotle restaurants.[229]
Most Chipotle locations display a photograph of the original restaurant, which is near the University of Denver campus on Evans Avenue.[20] Instead of a photograph of itself, the original location has a photograph of the Dolly Madison Ice Cream that previously occupied the location. In 2010, Chipotle began opening "A Model" restaurants, which are smaller concept locations, citing the lower costs of development and occupancy.[230] Chipotle uses environmentally friendly packaging, with bowls made from recycled newsprint, unbleached tray liners, and napkins and cups made from postconsumer waste.[231]
Chipotle's architectural design team incorporates the principles of sustainable architecture in their projects. The "green" restaurant in Gurnee, Illinois features an on-site six kilowatt wind turbine, which generates about 10% of the restaurant's electrical needs. The Gurnee restaurant has received Platinum level LEED certification from U.S. Green Building Council.[232] A restaurant in Tulsa, Oklahoma, uses recycled drywall, low-VOC paint, and energy-efficient appliances.[233] A Chipotle restaurant in Austin, Texas was the first to receive a four-star rating from the city's Green Building Program.[234] Additionally, Chipotle has made arrangements to add solar panels to 75 of its restaurants.[232] Chipotle has contracted to clean its stores in New York City and Long Island, with "plant-based, environmentally preferable cleaning supplies and technologies." The cleansers are readily biodegradable and non-toxic to humans or aquatic life.[235]
Chipotle was the defendant in a lawsuit for failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Maurizio Antoninetti, a customer who used a wheelchair, claimed he was denied the "Chipotle Experience", because he was unable to see the food preparation. The case against the company was upheld in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,[236] and the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear Chipotle's appeal, leaving the Ninth Circuit's ruling intact.[237] Chipotle has "an official disability policy of bringing ingredients to the tables of diners with disabilities and doing tableside preparation." Chipotle is retrofitting restaurants affected by the ruling, replacing the walls in front of the food preparation area with lower ones or transparent panels. They are incorporating the new design elements into new restaurants.[236] The case was one of over twenty ADA-related lawsuits filed by Antoninetti, who died in 2011.[236][238]

Pizzeria Locale is a fast casual pizza restaurant formed as a partnership with Pizzeria Locale, a full-service pizza restaurant in Boulder, Colorado. The original Pizzeria Locale owners, Bobby Stuckey and Lachlan Mackinnon-Patterson, would continue to own their original location while Chipotle would increase its stake in the chain over time.[48] As of February 2017, the chain has seven locations.[51]
Tasty Made is a burger restaurant concept that Chipotle first opened in Lancaster, Ohio in October 2016.[239] On July 29, 2016, the company announced the opening of its first Tasty Made burger restaurant in the fall. The first location was revealed to be in Lancaster, Ohio. Ohio was selected as culinary manager Nate Appleman and national training director David Chrisman are both from the state and helped design the concept.[240] Tasty Made was announced to have a focused menu like early burger restaurants which were limited to burgers, fries and milkshakes.[51] Chipotle had trademarked Better Burger earlier in the year.

Soul Daddy was a soul food fast casual restaurant that was owned by ANGR Holdings, LLC, and was managed by Chipotle after purchasing Ellis' stake in the company. The restaurant had three locations that had operated for less than 5 weeks in 2011 before closing.[241]
ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen was an Asian fast-casual concept restaurant that was opened by Chipotle in September 2011.[45] The company said that the new restaurant "would follow the Chipotle service format and its focus on 'food with integrity' in ingredients."[46] Chipotle's plan was to start with only one store, and see how the restaurant works out before expanding the concept.[47] By July 2016, the chain has 15 restaurants.[51] All ShopHouse locations were closed on March 17, 2017.[242]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
