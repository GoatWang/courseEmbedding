News Details
D. Christian Koch to Be Named Carlisle Companies CEO Effective January 1, 2016; David A. Roberts Continues as Chairman


12/11/2015

Download this Press Release (PDF 46 KB)

 CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Carlisle Companies Incorporated (NYSE:CSL) announced today that the
      Company’s Board of Directors has further implemented its ongoing
      succession plan and appointed D. Christian Koch (“Chris”) Chief
      Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors, both effective
      January 1, 2016. David A. Roberts, Carlisle’s current Chairman and Chief
      Executive officer, will become Executive Chairman on January 1, 2016 and
      remain a board member and an officer of the Company.
    

      Mr. Koch joined Carlisle in 2008. In 2014, he was elected President and
      Chief Operating Officer as part of the Board’s executive succession
      plan. Prior to then, Mr. Koch served as Group President of Carlisle
      Brake & Friction, Carlisle Foodservice Products, and, prior to its sale,
      Carlisle Transportation Products. In 2015, Mr. Koch led the acquisition
      and integration of the Company’s $600 million purchase of the Finishing
      Brands business from Graco, Inc. Finishing Brands now operates as a
      separate segment, Carlisle Fluid Technologies.
    

      Prior to joining Carlisle, Mr. Koch was the Vice President and General
      Manager of Asia Operations at Graco, Inc. Mr. Koch serves as a Director
      on the Arctic Cat Incorporated (NASDAQ:ACAT) board of directors.
    

      Mr. Roberts stated, “The appointment of Chris Koch as CEO culminates a
      nearly four year planned transition of senior leadership at Carlisle.
      Instrumental in this transition was the Board’s appointment of Chris as
      President and COO in 2014, which provided the opportunity for me to work
      closely with Chris the past eighteen months laying the ground work for a
      seamless change in leadership.
    

      “Chris and I have worked together at Carlisle since 2008 and, before
      that, for many years at Graco, Inc. He has been tried in difficult
      situations and has continually demonstrated the ability to successfully
      take on larger leadership responsibilities. Chris is the right person to
      build Carlisle for the future. He has been crucial to the many successes
      we have achieved at Carlisle in executing our growth strategy,
      implementing the Carlisle Operating System and transforming Carlisle
      into a portfolio of businesses that generates higher returns. I couldn't
      be more pleased that the Board has elected to put the future of Carlisle
      in Chris' hands, as I know he will continue to implement our strategic
      plan and improve our operations. He has my complete support and I look
      forward to working with Chris in my role as Executive Chairman."
    

      Mr. Koch commented, “I am humbled and honored to become Carlisle’s next
      CEO and to continue our strategy to bring excellence to our customers
      and drive value to our shareholders. I’m looking forward to working with
      our executive team and our worldwide team of dedicated professionals who
      come to work every day to find ways to add value to Carlisle. The
      opportunity to work with Dave Roberts these many years is a privilege
      very few are afforded, and I am thankful that he will continue to be an
      important part of the on-going success story at Carlisle.”
    

      Mr. Roberts will become Executive Chairman on January 1, 2016 after
      serving over 8 years as Carlisle’s Chairman and CEO. Since joining
      Carlisle as CEO in 2007, Mr. Roberts has led Carlisle through a period
      of significant growth and transformation. In 2007, under Mr. Roberts,
      Carlisle implemented its “5-15-30-15-15 Strategy” focused on improving
      shareholder returns. Critical to the success of this strategy was Mr.
      Roberts’ formation of the “Carlisle Operating System,” or COS, in 2008.
      COS has become the standard of excellence through which Carlisle
      businesses pursue continuous improvement, increased productivity and
      world class quality. Under Mr. Roberts’ leadership, Carlisle has been
      transformed from a collection of 9 businesses generating operating
      margins of below 10% to its current portfolio of 5 businesses that
      operate in more specialized end markets and generate margins in the 14%
      range. From June 2007 through the end of November 2015, Carlisle’s
      market capitalization has more than doubled to $5.8 billion and
      shareholder returns have exceeded the S&P 500 Index by 54 percentage
      points.

      expectations concerning the future. It is possible that our
      future performance may differ materially from current expectations
      expressed in these forward-looking statements, due to a variety of
      factors such as: increasing price and product/service competition by

      developments and changes; the ability to continue to introduce
      competitive new products and services on a timely, cost-effective basis;
      our mix of products/services; increases in raw material costs which
      cannot be recovered in product pricing; domestic and foreign
      governmental and public policy changes including environmental and
      industry regulations; threats associated with and efforts to combat
      terrorism; protection and validity of patent and other intellectual
      property rights; the successful integration and identification of our
      strategic acquisitions; the cyclical nature of our businesses; and the
      outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings.
      In addition, such statements could be affected by general industry and
      market conditions and growth rates, the condition of the financial and
      credit markets, and general domestic and international economic
      conditions including interest rate and currency exchange rate
      fluctuations. Further, any conflict in the international arena
      may adversely affect general market conditions and our future
      performance. We refer you to the documents we file from time to
      time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as our reports on
      Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K, for a discussion of these and other
      risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ
      materially from our current expectations and from the forward-looking
      statements contained in this press release. We undertake no
      obligation to update any forward-looking statement.
