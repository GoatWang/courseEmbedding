Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1863 edition. Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. Original Publisher: Macon, Ga. : Published for the trade by Burke, Boykin & Co. ; Greensboro', Ala. : J. Russell 24 pages.  Bookseller Inventory # 453297653

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Hardcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1863 edition. Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This hardcover book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of hardcover binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal hardcovers. This book is printed on demand on acid-free paper.

OverviewSpeaking & WritingOutside Nexsen Pruet 






Overview

My principal practice is in complex business litigation. I have been with Nexsen Pruet for thirty years - 23 as a partner. My clients include investors, health care providers, and manufacturers involved in antitrust, breach of fiduciary duty, reimbursement, and contract disputes.
For the last twelve years I've worked extensively on class action cases in various industries. Most recently, I was co-lead counsel in In re International Textile Group Merger Litigation. The case was against private equity financier Wilbur Ross and his investment company relating to a merger of two companies that he controlled. We alleged that Mr. Ross and his colleagues on the board violated their fiduciary duties to the company and to the minority shareholders, and that the merger ratio was not fair under Delaware law. We represented both the company in a derivative action and the minority shareholders in a class action. I was in charge of expert discovery concerning business valuations and econometric damages modeling. The issues involved discounted cash flow modeling, the application of real option pricing theory to the sale of a business, and statistical modeling related to stock market prices for a thinly traded public company. Ultimately, the consolidated cases settled the week before trial for $36 million in cash and nearly $300 million in debt forgiveness and cancellation of preferred shares.
More In addition, I helped defend a nationwide monopolization claim against Monsanto involving Roundup and Roundup Ready products. I then worked with the Nexsen Pruet antitrust team as plaintiffâs lead counsel in Crane v. International Paper and Canal Wood, a class action case alleging a monopsony price fixing conspiracy in the timber industry. The case ultimately settled for $12.4 million. Thereafter, I worked closely with lead counsel in In re Endosurgical Products, an indirect purchaser nationwide class action alleging monopoly bundling in the sutures and endosurgical markets.
These cases typically involve discovery of millions of pages of documents and email, and over the years I have worked with and managed teams of lawyers in electronic discovery using various litigation software platforms.
I have tried over twenty-five cases in state and federal court, and have handled numerous appeals to the South Carolina Supreme Court and Court of Appeals, and to the Fourth and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeal.

I am originally from Arlington, Virginia, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of VirginiaÂ (with high distinction), as well as the University of Virginia School of Law. Upon graduating from law school, I worked closely with Harold Jacobs for more than fifteen years. He taught me how to try cases, but still retain a sense of humor.Â

Details

In this, the liveliest and most accessible one-volume life of Edmund Burke, Russell Kirk ingeniously combines into a living whole the private and the public Burke. He gives us a fresh assessment of the great statesman, who enjoys even greater influence today than in his own time.
Russell Kirk was a leading figure in the post-World War II revival of American interest in Edmund Burke. Today, no one who takes seriously the problems of society dares remain indifferent to "the first conservative of our time of troubles." In Russell Kirkâs words: "Burkeâs ideas interest anyone nowadays, including men bitterly dissenting from his conclusions. If conservatives would know what they defend, Burke is their touchstone; and if radicals wish to test the temper of their opposition, they should turn to Burke."
Kirk lucidly unfolds Burkeâs philosophy, showing how it revealed itself in concrete historical situations during the eighteenth century and how Burke, through his philosophy, "speaks to our age." This volume makes vivid the four great struggles in the life of Burke: his efforts to reconcile England with the American colonies; his involvements in cutting down the domestic power of George III; his prosecution of Warren Hastings, the Governor General of India; and his resistance to Jacobinism, the French Revolutionâs "armed doctrine." In each of these great phases of his public life, Burke fought with passionate eloquence and relentless logic for justice and for the proper balance of order and freedom. With sure instinct born of his sympathy and understanding, Kirk gives us the incisive quotation, the illuminating highlight, the moving, all-too-human elements that bring Burke and his age to vivid life.
Thanks to Russell Kirkâs skillful evocations, Edmund Burke in these pages becomes our contemporary. "Because corruption and fanaticism assail our era as
sorely as they did Burkeâs time, the resonance of Burke's voice still is heard amidst the howl of our winds of abstract doctrine."

What They're Saying...
"If you are not a Burke scholarâ¦Edmund Burke: A Genius Reconsidered must be read first."âThe World & I"This is the liveliest and most accessible one-volume biography of Edmund Burke."âThe BookwatchâKirkâs scholarship is wide-ranging . . . and of course he brings to bear his close knowledge of the vast array of modern Burke scholarship. [His] . . . book is both elegant and eloquent, and it helps to fill a real need. ââJeffrey Hart,, National Review â[T]he book serves as a good short introduction to Burkeâs life and throught.ââLibrary JournalâNo one knows more about Burke or writes of him with as much authority as did Russell Kirk.ââM.D. Aeschliman,, The WandererâEdmund Burke is the very book for the non-specialist and the very book that no specialist will want to be without. It is at once a general introduction to the essence of Burkeâs thought and a major reassessment of Burke in the light of the vast body of scholarship now available on him.ââG.B. Tennyson,, University BookmanâOnly a man of Kirkâs provenance and ambiance would have been appropriate for the jobâto reassert, by way of Burke, âthe natural law tradition [against] the positivism, nominalism and scientific materialism of modern liberal thought,â as Carl Cone has put it.ââC.P. Ives,, Modern Age

A Contribution to Predictive Engine Calibration Based on Vehicle Drive Cycle Performance


2003-03-03



Technical Paper




2003-01-0225
Reinhard Burk, Frederic Jacquelin, Russell Wakeman
Both the automotive and truck industry are facing further regulated emissions legislation in the near future. Understanding the emissions and fuel consumption attributes of an engine/vehicle application during a drive cycle early in an engine development program is a critical step to steer the engine development program to a successful final product. The generally accepted approach is to calibrate an engine on a dynamometer and to adjust the operation of the engine to meet performance targets. With the current build and test approach, these adjustments may not be made until well into the development program, and this calibration is a costly and time consuming step in the engine development process.








Cam Phaser Actuation Rate Performance Impact on Fuel Consumption and NOx Emissions Over the FTP-75 Drive Cycle


2003-03-03



Technical Paper




2003-01-0023
FrÃ©dÃ©ric Jacquelin, Reinhard Burk, Russell J. Wakeman
Variable valve timing technology allows more flexibility for modern engines to meet peak performance, fuel economy and low emissions targets while providing good driveability. The most common device to achieve such improvement and comply with new emissions legislation is the oil pressure actuated cam phaser. Calibration for variable valve timing using dynamometer testing at steady state is the base for mapping the intake and exhaust valves phasing positions for the range of engine speed and load. Calibration is aimed at improving fuel economy and emissions levels while avoiding combustion instabilities. During a transient however, the actuation rate limitations of the cam phasing device, which depends on available oil pressure, cause the phaser to not meet the ECU timing map request. This lag alters the engine optimum operation. A proposed solution, the Cam Torque Actuated phaser or CTA, uses available cam torque energy to sustain high actuation rates independently of oil pressure.
