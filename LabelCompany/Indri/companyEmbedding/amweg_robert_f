About Wealthminder



Wealthminder was created for one simple reason:
To help people get the financial assistance they need to achieve their long-term financial goals.


Wealthminder is a database of every Investment Advisor Representative in the country.
We work hard to collect and provide you the information you need to find a financial advisor who’s right for you.


If you are looking for a specific financial advisor and you can’t find them on Wealthminder,
it’s likely that they are either exclusively a broker or are unlicensed - please
contact us
and we’ll try to help!



Finding a Financial Advisor through Wealthminder



Historically finding and hiring a financial advisor was hard.
Wealthminder was built to make the process much easier.


The best way to use Wealthminder is to take advantage of our free proposal system.
All you have to do is take a few minutes of your time to describe your situation and the assistance you are looking for.


Wealthminder then sends your request to our network of
prescreened financial advisors.
If a financial advisor is interested in your business, they will submit a proposal to you.


You review the proposals you receive and decide if you’d like to have a follow-up call with one or more of the financial advisors.


Throughout the process, you maintain control. We only share your contact information with a financial advisor once you ask for an introduction.
