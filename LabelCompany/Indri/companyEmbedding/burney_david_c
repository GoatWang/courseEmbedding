https://lnkd.in/eYAM7bT David sharedhttps://lnkd.in/ekC-Y2xDavid sharedhttps://lnkd.in/bJGCmcWDavid sharedSummaryDavid Burney is a designer and a pioneer in the modern design thinking movement. He has nearly 35 years experience building and leading creative services organizations. Prior to founding New Kind, David served for 4 1/2 years as Vice President of Brand Communications and Design at Red Hat, one of the most disruptive technology brands in the world. David led the company’s overall brand communications strategy, including all creative and cultural communications functions.While at Red Hat, David created an internal innovation program to drive the power of design thinking throughout the company. One of the first corporate examples of design thinking being leveraged throughout an entire organization, the program was released globally throughout the company, and used to create departmental and individual goals that aligned with annual corporate business objectives.Prior to his time at Red Hat, David was the owner of Burney Design, partner and Chief Creative Officer at Capstrat, and Chief Designer at the NC Museum of Art.More than thirty years ago David was a founding member of the Raleigh AIGA chapter where he later served as President. His work has been recognized with nearly 200 design awards, and in 2009 he was recognized with the AIGA Fellows Award for “significant contribution to raising the standards of excellence in practice” of the design industry. A decade ago he served as the Chair of the AIGA National President’s Council.http://newkind.com/coaching/ExperienceCEONew Kind2009  –  Present (8 years)New Kind helps organizations build powerful brands using design thinking, open sourcing and and the artful employment of relevant media.

You can credit him with communicating Red Hat's real, relevant, and daring brand, consistently over a period of years. Inside the company, I worked with him on many occasions to launch new projects or spread design thinking techniques, and was always better off for it. I'm told he plays music as well...See moreSee lessDavid is one of the impactful figures in my life. He has taught me, challenged me, inspired me. He's a mentor in all senses of the word. From the moment we met, David became the person I wanted to be when I grew up. He's sharp, fun, successful. He's always one step ahead and his "big picture" thinking keeps you on your toes. His creative genius is both entertaining and awe inspiring. David is a visionary who understands that the strategic implications of design go beyond mere artifact. He's a catalyst for change and a true innovator. 

David always leads by example. Through his direction, we built a program for inspiring collaboration and creativity across a global corporation. I learned so much -- which has become the foundation for my professional journey. It was difficult to leave Red Hat, mainly because of the guidance I knew I was losing. Fortunately for me, David continues to be a role model and support as I continue my career. He remains a good friend and someone I continue to learn from.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended DavidGroupsPower of OpenNCSU Social Entrepreneurship InitiativeOpen SourceNC State University College of DesignIndustrial DesignFront End of InnovationCustomer Experience Management ProfessionalsSee 4 moreDesign Thinking GroupDESIGN THINKING NETWORKOpen Source Professionals and AdvocatesGMU LCOP Class 11See lessView David’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact David directlyView David’s Full ProfileNot the David you’re looking for?

Summer Clearance – Savings up to 75% OFF!

 


















															Welcome!									

In 1979 F David Barney made his dream a reality and opened his own clothing store, with the philosophy of dressing the discerning gentleman. Today - 35 years later - these tenets still hold true. Our founding comittment of offering high quality gentleman's clothing and providing great customer service are still the cornerstone of F David Barney Clothiers. It is refreshing in today's world to have your personal clothier more interested in your wardobe and how you look than the styles that are short lived, or prices that really are too good to be true.
Each season our buyers travel to bring back exclusive merchadise and fabrics from around the world. Stylish products that our clients won't find in most stores - from vendors that have the same commitment to quality that F David Barney Clothiers stands for. All of these combine to make this store a truly measurable difference.
















A measurable difference.
