Product Description▼▲
Anderson approaches the Book of 2 Samuel, the story of  Israel's great king, David, as a central book in Scripture.  This commentary is well-researched and well presented. The critical issues of the book are presented well and he does a good job of presenting his own moderately critical perspective. He provides a very good treatment of the text-critical issues of the book. Arnold  Anderson is a graduate of Oxford University and London University and is Honorary Fellow in the Faculty of Theology at the University of Manchester in England.

Publisher's Description▼▲
The Book of2 Samuel, which tells the story of David, Israel's greatest king, declares A. A. Anderson, is a central book in Scripture. It has served as a direct source for or influence on the books of Kings and Chronicles, the Prophets, and the Psalms, as well as the New Testament, and references to David can even be found in Gen. 49:10 and Num. 24:17, as Anderson has documented. Although 2 Samuel begins with the death of his predecessor, Saul, and follows through to David's old age, the so-called Succession Narrative comprises most of the story in the book, telling how David built his kingdom and survived all threats to its continuity. It culminates in the final act of placing Solomon on the throne, which spills over into 1 Kings 1-2.  Anderson considers the Succession Narrative to be an apology-an official interpretation of significant events, not a eulogy written to the greater glory of either David or Solomon. Rather, it was intended to show that David, in spite of a series of near disasters, was not under a curse; and it maintains that Solomon was the rightful heir to David's throne, even though popular expectations as well as Solomon's youth and parentage apparently led many contemporaries to question that judgment.  The issue was not "Who of David's sons will be king?" the author points out, but more likely " Is there any of David's sons fit to sit on the throne of David?"  The commentary offers a full general bibliography with additional specialized listings of up-to-date bibliographies at the beginning of each chapter and of each section of the Introduction. The Introduction discusses:  The literary history of2 Samuel Samuel's relation to the books of Joshua, Judges, and Kings The Succession Narrative The text of2 Samuel and its research The use of2 Samuel in the Scriptures.  The volume provides a fresh translation with detailed explanatory notes concerning original word choices. Carefully evaluating textual evidence from the Masoretic Text, the Septuagint, Qumran texts, the Targums, and Latin texts, Anderson holds that no one of these has a monopoly as "the best witness" to the original text. Each variation is thus evaluated for the contribution it can make.

Striking at the Heels - The Reptile Plaintiff's Approach
Mar 3, 2016  |   
Reasonable Medical Expenses
Mar 3, 2016  |   

Yesterday the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (“PCAST“) released a final Report finding that many of the forensic science techniques used to prosecute criminal cases do not meet scientific standards.  Specifically, the Report raised issues with the use of tool-mark analysis (ballistics), bite mark, hair, footwear and other evidence used in criminal cases all over the country.  This is yet another critical look at the state of forensic science and the way it is used to convict people at a staggering rate.
The Report said:




PCAST concluded that there are two important gaps: (1) the need for clarity about the scientific standards for the validity and reliability of forensic methods and (2) the need to evaluate specific forensic methods to determine whether they have been scientifically established to be valid and reliable. Our study aimed to help close these gaps for a number of forensic “feature-comparison” methods—specifically, methods for comparing DNA samples, bitemarks, latent fingerprints, firearm marks, footwear, and hair.

Despite the Report’s recommendations, the Attorney General stated that the Department of Justice will not adopt the recommendations in relation to the admissibility of forensic science as evidence at trial.  This comes only a few days after DOJ issued a Memorandum addressing certain changes in their policy towards forensic evidence and releasing a code of professional conduct for forensic analysts.

The ongoing struggle of the validity of forensic science in the courtroom and ways to improve the reliability of the science is ongoing.  This is an incredibly important topic in terms of criminal defense because of the likelihood that a jury will believe “scientific” evidence over other potentially more reliable evidence because they are told that it is, in fact, science.  If you have been charged with a crime and the evidence includes any kind of forensic evidence it is important to contact an attorney that is familiar with the challenges of forensic evidence.

ANDERSON, S.J.





  



ANDERSON, Samuel J., ex-chief of the
Harrisburg police force, was born in Cumberland county, Pa., April 16, 1850. He
is a son of John E. and Sarah W. (Malone) Anderson, both natives of this State,
the former of Scotch and the latter of Irish ancestry. His parents had born to
them twelve children, six of whom are living: William K., a general agent at
Mechanicsburg, Pa.; Bella H., wife of Willis G. Kauffman, of Harrisburg; Annie
E., wife of Rev. Adam A. Wolfe, residing at Keithburg, Ill.; Samuel J.; Parker
D., residing at Harrisburg; and Ida M., wife of Joseph Gephart, residing at
Philipsburg, Kan.
Samuel J. received his education in the schools of his native town. He
learned the trade of millwright, and followed this occupation until 1870. I n
this year he came to Harrisburg and became chief lumber inspector for the
Harrisburg Car Manufacturing Company, holding the position for three years. For
the next two years he was not engaged in any special vocation. In 1875 he was
appointed special police officer for the city of Harrisburg, and occupied the
position fo four years. In 1879 he was appointed county detective, under Eli
Hullinger, who was at that time district attorney. He served in this capacity
until January 1, 1881, when he resigned this position. For the following
thirteen years he conducted a private detective bureau. On January 1, 1894, he
was appointed to the position of chief of police.
Mr. Anderson has been twice married. His first wife was Miss Zell, to whom he
was united in marriage at Holly, Pa. She died at Harrisburg, April 11, 1872. The
only child of this marriage is Charles E., born August 13, 1871. He was married
again in August, 1875, to Catherine Lutz. There are no children by this marraige.
Mr. Anderson has also served as marshal of the Eastern district of
Pennsylvania, with headquarters at Philadelphia. He is a member of City Lodge,
No. 301, I. O. O. F., and Encampment No. 301. In political views he affiliates
with the Democrats. The family attend the Presbyterian church.
Mr. Anderson was careful, faithful and just in his duties as an officer and
popular with the men on the force, as well as with the citizens, who regarded
him as a courageous and courteous officer and a worthy man.
