Life[edit]
The Great Depression forced Robert Crandall's father to leave Rhode Island to work selling life insurance, which resulted in multiple relocations. Crandall ended attending 13 schools before his high school graduation.[2] He graduated from the University of Rhode Island, and from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, with an MBA.[3]
In 1966, he joined TWA, where he worked for six years. In 1972, he left to become a senior financial officer at Bloomingdale's Department Stores, but he returned to the airline industry in 1973, as senior financial vice president of American.[3]
Before the passing of the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act, Crandall was one of the act's loudest opponents. In 1982, he had a famous conversation with Braniff CEO Howard D. Putnam, in which he told Putnam that if Braniff raised their prices, American would too. Crandall has publicly expressed embarrassment over that conversation. That same year, Crandall became American's president. In 1985, Crandall succeeded Albert Casey as American's chairman and CEO.[4]
During the latter period of Crandall's tenure as CEO, investor concern over airline bankruptcies and falling stock prices caused Crandall to remind his employees about the dangers of investing in airline stocks. Known for his candor, Crandall later told an interviewer, "I've never invested in any airline. I'm an airline manager. I don't invest in airlines. And I always said to the employees of American, 'This is not an appropriate investment. It's a great place to work and it's a great company that does important work. But airlines are not an investment.'" Crandall noted that since the airline deregulation of the 1970s, some 150 airlines had gone out of business. "A lot of people came into the airline business. Most of them promptly exited, minus their money," he said.[5][6]
In 1997, Crandall received the Horatio Alger award. In 1998, he retired from American and he went on to work as director of many other companies, including Celestica, Haliburton, and Anixter. He is the 2001 recipient of the Tony Jannus Award for outstanding leadership in the commercial aviation industry.[7]
Crandall is credited with creating the first frequent flyer program in the airline industry, the AAdvantage program, as well as pioneering modern reservations systems through the creation of Sabre. He is also credited with pioneering yield management.[8] Crandall also serves as a senior adviser and sits on the board of AirCell, an in-flight telephony company which won the larger of two licenses for air-ground data service that provide in-flight broadband service.[9]
Since airline deregulation in 1978, a number of factors which define the airline industry in the USA have plummeted. Subsequently, by 2010, every major airline had filed for bankruptcy at least once, except American Airlines.[10] When asked to comment on the situation in June 2008, Crandall stated,


“
The consequences of deregulation have been very adverse. Our airlines, once world leaders, are now laggards in every category, including fleet age, service quality and international reputation. Fewer and fewer flights are on time. Airport congestion has become a staple of late-night comedy shows. An even higher percentage of bags are lost or misplaced. Last-minute seats are harder and harder to find. Passenger complaints have skyrocketed. Airline service, by any standard, has become unacceptable.[11]
”


Finally, on November 29, 2011, AMR Corporation (American Airlines Holding Company) joined the rest and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[12][13] In 2015, American Airlines completed a merger with US Airways, the last remaining legacy carriers to do so.
Reputation for cost-cutting[edit]
While at American Airlines in the 1980s, Crandall was famed for his focus on cost-cutting. One story that has been frequently retold since is that he came up with the idea to remove one olive from every salad served to passengers. No one would notice and the airline would save $40,000 a year.[14][15]

Robert Crandall - Wikipedia




















 






Robert Crandall

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Robert Lloyd "Bob" Crandall (born December 6, 1935 in Westerly, Rhode Island) is an American businessman who is the former president and chairman of American Airlines. Called an industry legend by airline industry observers, Crandall has been the subject of several books and is a member of the Hall of Honor of the Conrad Hilton college.[1]

Life[edit]
The Great Depression forced Robert Crandall's father to leave Rhode Island to work selling life insurance, which resulted in multiple relocations. Crandall ended attending 13 schools before his high school graduation.[2] He graduated from the University of Rhode Island, and from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, with an MBA.[3]
In 1966, he joined TWA, where he worked for six years. In 1972, he left to become a senior financial officer at Bloomingdale's Department Stores, but he returned to the airline industry in 1973, as senior financial vice president of American.[3]
Before the passing of the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act, Crandall was one of the act's loudest opponents. In 1982, he had a famous conversation with Braniff CEO Howard D. Putnam, in which he told Putnam that if Braniff raised their prices, American would too. Crandall has publicly expressed embarrassment over that conversation. That same year, Crandall became American's president. In 1985, Crandall succeeded Albert Casey as American's chairman and CEO.[4]
During the latter period of Crandall's tenure as CEO, investor concern over airline bankruptcies and falling stock prices caused Crandall to remind his employees about the dangers of investing in airline stocks. Known for his candor, Crandall later told an interviewer, "I've never invested in any airline. I'm an airline manager. I don't invest in airlines. And I always said to the employees of American, 'This is not an appropriate investment. It's a great place to work and it's a great company that does important work. But airlines are not an investment.'" Crandall noted that since the airline deregulation of the 1970s, some 150 airlines had gone out of business. "A lot of people came into the airline business. Most of them promptly exited, minus their money," he said.[5][6]
In 1997, Crandall received the Horatio Alger award. In 1998, he retired from American and he went on to work as director of many other companies, including Celestica, Haliburton, and Anixter. He is the 2001 recipient of the Tony Jannus Award for outstanding leadership in the commercial aviation industry.[7]
Crandall is credited with creating the first frequent flyer program in the airline industry, the AAdvantage program, as well as pioneering modern reservations systems through the creation of Sabre. He is also credited with pioneering yield management.[8] Crandall also serves as a senior adviser and sits on the board of AirCell, an in-flight telephony company which won the larger of two licenses for air-ground data service that provide in-flight broadband service.[9]
Since airline deregulation in 1978, a number of factors which define the airline industry in the USA have plummeted. Subsequently, by 2010, every major airline had filed for bankruptcy at least once, except American Airlines.[10] When asked to comment on the situation in June 2008, Crandall stated,


“
The consequences of deregulation have been very adverse. Our airlines, once world leaders, are now laggards in every category, including fleet age, service quality and international reputation. Fewer and fewer flights are on time. Airport congestion has become a staple of late-night comedy shows. An even higher percentage of bags are lost or misplaced. Last-minute seats are harder and harder to find. Passenger complaints have skyrocketed. Airline service, by any standard, has become unacceptable.[11]
”


Finally, on November 29, 2011, AMR Corporation (American Airlines Holding Company) joined the rest and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[12][13] In 2015, American Airlines completed a merger with US Airways, the last remaining legacy carriers to do so.
Reputation for cost-cutting[edit]
While at American Airlines in the 1980s, Crandall was famed for his focus on cost-cutting. One story that has been frequently retold since is that he came up with the idea to remove one olive from every salad served to passengers. No one would notice and the airline would save $40,000 a year.[14][15]
Honors[edit]

Hall of Honor of the Conrad Hilton college.[1]

Awards[edit]

Horatio Alger award, 1997.
Tony Jannus Award for outstanding leadership in the commercial aviation industry, 2001.[7]
L. Welch Pogue Award for Lifetime Achievement in Aviation, 2004.
Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy from the National Aeronautic Association, 2006.

When one thinks about the really big personalities of the airline industry for the past 25 years, Robert L. Crandall has to be right there at the top, along with Herb Kelleher and, for a decade, Gordon Bethune. It was my fortune to cover all three, Crandall and Kelleher more so than Bethune.Bob Crandall was president of American Airlines for 15 years, from 1980 to 1995, and chief executive officer for 13 years, from 1985 to 1998.I covered him for the last eight years of his time at American. It was not the best eight years for him or American, particularly from 1990 through 1993.Consider that before I began covering aviation on Oct. 1, 1990, American under Crandall had: Initiated the AAdvantage frequent-flier program, an industry-leading program that everyone else had to copy. Created revenue management systems to extract the maximum from each ticket sold, an industry-leading program that everyone else had to copy. Created the “B-scale,” a lower pay scale for new pilots that helped fund more growth and a strategy that a number of airlines had to copy. Embarked on the “growth plan,” that saw American more than double in size between 1984 and 1990. Added hubs in Nashville, Tenn.; San Jose, Calif.; Miami, Fla.; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Raleigh-Durham, N.C. Bought California-based Air Cal to boost its West Coast performance and presence. Piled up seven straight years of profits from 1983 through 1989 and was profitable through the first nine months of 1990. For that period from 1983 through Sept. 30, 1990: $2.4 billion in net income.That’s quite a list of accomplishments. After I arrived, though: The airline posted $1.5 billion in net losses from fourth quarter 1990 through 1993, worst in the airline’s history to that point. It closed its just-opened hubs in Nashville, San Jose and Raleigh-Durham. Everyone else closed the gap or caught up on revenue management. It abandoned the growth plan and over time was forced by its unions to do away with the B-Scale pay rates. American’s simplified system of fares called “Value Pricing” flopped terribly after their April 1992 introduction and helped worsen the industry losses that year. Northwest Airlines and Continental Airlines sued American over Value Pricing and its aftermath. (American Airlines won the case.) The carrier endured a five-day strike by flight attendants in 1993 and a 30-minute strike by pilots in 1997. American and its Sabre unit had to abandon a reservations project, Confirm RS, with several car rental firms and hotel companies in 1992, enduring both embarrassment and losses that eventually exceeded $200 million related to the project and ensuring litigation.So if Crandall wasn’t in a good mood many of the times I saw him, it was understandable. By the time that Crandall retired in 1998, the ship had been righted and American was five years into the most profitable period in its history from 1994 through 2000.Crandall had to have been the most driven person I’ve covered. And he gladly admitted that he was driven. He summed up his approach to life as he talked to a group of travel executives at a Dallas conference in 2011.“In times past, reporters sometimes would say to me, ‘Have you had a balanced life?’ I said, no. I haven’t had a balanced life, and I didn’t want a balanced life. I wanted a successful life. I had a wife who took care of the balance of life,” Crandall said.“I went to work early and I got home late and I worked most weekends. That’s what I wanted to do because I really wanted to be successful. And I was pretty brave, I said things that needed to be said and I got very, very angry if I ever lost.”On weekends, he’d go to work and leave notes on other executives’ desks, along the lines of “I was here. Where were you?”In his 1994 book Hard Landing, journalist Tom Petzinger called Crandall “the most feared and powerful man in the global airline industry. His very appearance intimidated people.”Crandall embraced a concept of “competitive anger” in his management at AMR and American, an idea he explained in a 2000 deposition that was part of a U.S. Justice Department lawsuit against American:“Our view was that it was very important for American to prevail and that as a consequence, in order to prevail in a very competitive industry, it was necessary to look at business as a contest,” he said in the deposition.“If you’re going to have a contest and you’re going to prevail, you ought to be angry at your opponent, and you ought to be angry with yourself if you don’t win.”When Northwest and Continental sued American in 1993, they introduced into evidence a 1991 AA memo about ailing Pan American World Airways, with a notation from Crandall in the margins: "Crush these guys."Under Crandall’s direction, American created a hub at Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Airport in the early 1980s, stepping in just as Braniff Airways was weakening its hub operations in favor of more point-to-point flying.In May 1982, Braniff stopped flying as it ran low on cash. While Braniff supporters blamed American for Braniff’s demise, Crandall insisted that Braniff was doomed by its own poor management decisions.“We didn't cheat or play dirty in any way,” Crandall growled in a 1998 interview. “We came down here and we flew our airplanes. Braniff destroyed itself. People who refuse to understand the facts, who refuse to study the facts, who do not know the facts are nevertheless entitled to mistaken opinions.”In the low point of his career, Crandall suggested during a February 1982 telephone conversation with Braniff chief executive Howard Putnam that they should raise their fares by 20 percent. It was a low point because Putnam secretly taped the call and gave it to federal authorities.U.S. prosecutors later accused of Crandall of violating federal antitrust laws. In a 1985 settlement, Crandall admitted no liability, but agreed not to discuss fares with competitors for five years unless American was setting up joint fares with another carrier.Crandall understandably is touchy about that Putnam conversation. In 1991, I wrote a story about how Delta Air Lines was picking up market share at D/FW Airport at the expense of American. American had pulled down capacity there in early 1991 as some pilots staged a slowdown during prolonged contract talks.At the insistence of an editor, I included a quote from the Putnam conversation in which Crandall told Putnam “we can both live here and there ain't no room for Delta.”Not long later, the food chains at American and the Dallas Morning News was having one of its periodic dinners – I was the amoeba at the bottom of our food chain – when suddenly I heard Crandall roar from the other end of the table something along the lines of “How much longer am I going to have to read about the Putnam conversation?” (Expletives deleted.)Well, I don’t know. Maybe forever. In any case, he wasn’t pleased.A story involving Delta also prompted Crandall to issue an order in late April 1992 banning all American Airlines employees from talking to me.I had gone to cover the Harvard Club of Dallas’ ceremonies honoring Herb Kelleher as its man of the year. Crandall, a close friend as well as fierce competitor, was to introduce Kelleher.The Harvard Club hosted Kelleher for a press conference prior to a reception and dinner. After the press conference, I called in to my office to say that Herb was very entertaining as usual but made no news. My editor said that Dallas Mayor Steve Bartlett that day had backed off his idea of amending the Wright amendment and that I should ask Crandall for comment. This would be easy, because Crandall would be pleased that Bartlett was withdrawing his proposal.I found Crandall at the reception and got his attention. Before I could ask my question, he tore into me about two stories that had appeared in the previous Sunday’s newspaper.Back then we had a column called Sunday Notebook in which we dropped items of interest  that didn't justify a separate story.One item I wrote the previous Sunday pointed out that Delta in 1992 had lost all the D/FW Airport market share that it had picked up at American’s expense in 1991.A second item said that American was sending employees a $50 gift check for finishing first in an airline quality index. At the bottom of the item, I had noted that some AA pilots were donating their checks to a strike fund for American’s regional pilots in Puerto Rico.Crandall said I seemed to regret Delta’s loss of market share. No explanation is necessary about what he didn’t like the second item. He turned his back to me to get another drink. When he turned around, he tore into me again. Then he abruptly turned to someone else at the reception and began a pleasant conversation.I spent the next day observing cockpit resource management training at Southwest. When I got back to office late that afternoon, my editor said something along the lines of “We got problems.”American’s corporate communications office had called during the day to say that Crandall had barred AA employees from talking to me ever again. Well, how about that?As it so happened, that very evening, I got a tip from someone involved in the Confirm RS project – the one referenced earlier that eventually brought American more than $200 million in losses – that the project appeared to be collapsing, that people were moving out of their offices with their belongings in boxes.So that’s the first story I had to work after getting the AA ban?After delicate diplomatic negotiations, I faxed my questions to the public relations people at American and they faxed AA's answers back to the business editor. I wrote the story from their faxed response.This continued for about two weeks. Then we had another one of those food-chain dinners and it was as if the whole brouhaha had not happened.Others inside AA later told me that Crandall thought his edict would force the Dallas Morning News to take me off the airline beat. Instead, it seems to have made me airline reporter for life.I’ve since wondered if Crandall had gotten a briefing from Sabre chief Max Hopper about the enormous mess at Confirm, and then went straight from that bad news to the Kelleher event – and up I walked. (I asked him about that sequence of events many years later. He said he didn’t remember, that it was probably just us being macho. Believe me, I wasn’t/am not macho.)Crandall had a reputation of being merciless with a subordinate who was not prepared or tried to bluff his or her way through a presentation. He expected others to work as hard as him and to care about his airline and about winning as much as he did.He also had a reputation for being fiercely loyal to those who met his standards, and compassionate when compassion was called for.He also had a sense of humor.In the early 1990s, I sat in on a “president’s conference” at a University of Texas-Arlington theater. Each year, Crandall would lead a series of meetings with employees in which he and his team would give a state-of-the-airline/industry presentation and then answer questions.At this particular conference, he told a story about a man who slipped off a cliff and barely grabbed onto a bush on the side of the cliff to keep him from falling to his death. “Help, help!” the man yelled. “Is there anyone up there?” Suddenly a light shone out of the clouds, and a voice boomed: “It is the Lord, thy God. Release the bush, and I will lift you up!”The man looked down far below to the ground, then looked back up. “Is there anyone else up there?’ he yelled.Good joke, but the point was that there was nobody else up there, that American could not rely on others to save it.Later, during the Q&A, an employee noted that union employees had won a third week of vacation after 10 years’ service, and he wanted non-union employees to get the same. In a lengthy answer, Crandall acknowledged the desire for more vacation, but said no, those employees would still get only two weeks’ vacation.The employee thought about it, and then said: “Is there anyone else up there?”Crandall laughed as heartily as everyone else.In March 2015, Crandall spoke to the Wings Club, an aviation-focused group that attracts the big names in airlines and aircraft. He was asked his biggest mistakes and his biggest triumphs.“In terms of worst decision, probably we weren’t smart enough to realize that Nashville and Raleigh Durham weren’t going to work. We got smarter as time passed,” Crandall said.“The best decision I think was when in the early 1980s we persuaded the union that allowing us to grow a new airline within the American Airlines framework on a two-tier basis, it allowed us to triple the size of the airline. It allowed us to create a very successful commercial enterprise. And it allowed us to provide jobs to 65,000 people that didn’t have one when we started. So I think that was pretty good.”Crandall stepped down as chairman and CEO of American and AMR in May 1998, and he and wife Jan flew to England to pick up a boat, "Arway," they had commissioned. They then sailed it back to the United States.I saw him that September at a Dallas event where he was speaking and told him some pilots had already said they wished Crandall was still running the airline. Crandall, who butted heads frequently with the unions, just laughed.When he stepped down from American, he stepped down completely. He didn’t stay on the AMR board and has largely refrained from commenting publicly about American’s path in the years. He may have been calling up AA executives every day to tell them what they should do. But if he did, it never became public.I’ve seen him a few times since and we have a cordial relationship. Most recently, I visited with him and Jan on Dec. 9, 2013, the day that American and US Airways merged to form American Airlines Group. I told him that it seemed he was sending a message to the troops by showing up at AA HQs to applaud the merger.“That was the idea. The idea they had and the idea I had by agreeing to come was that I think these guys are saying the right things,” Crandall said. “Now, if they do what they say they’ll do, then I think this will work very well.”At ceremonies marking the merger, Crandall expressed regret that he wouldn’t be able to help out in the merger. I asked him later about whether he really would have liked to go through all that work again.Yes indeed, said Crandall, who had turned 78 only two days before.“It would be great fun to do it again. I had a wonderful time doing it. It would be great fun to do it again. But I said to Jan this morning, even if they asked me to come back and run it, I’m not physically able any more to work 18-hour days, and that’s what it takes. You’ve got to get up at 5:30 in the morning and you’ve got to be able to stay up until 11 o’clock at night, and I can’t do that anymore.”

Robert L. Crandall: The board as wingman
In The Director’s Chair with David W. Anderson: Robert L. Crandall, chair of Celestica Inc. and former CEO and chair of AMR Corp. and American Airlines, shares some strong thoughts on CEOs and boards working closer together

						March 15, 2012					

Robert Crandall is best known globally for being the CEO and chair of AMR Corp. and American Airlines Inc. through much of the 1980s and ’90s. He played a central role in making American the leading innovator in the industry and directed its rise from domestic carrier to major international airline. But Crandall has also had a lengthy Canadian presence, sitting on the board of Celestica since 1999, becoming chair in 2004. Here, in an exclusive interview with Listed contributing editor and governance expert David W. Anderson, Crandall outlines three primary criticisms of corporate governance today. In particular, he draws on his personal experience to challenge the conventional “nonsense” that says company operations are none of a director’s business. He says it’s up to CEOs to do more to educate their boards. The more directors know, Crandall says, the more a CEO benefits from their advice.
David W. Anderson You are counted among the legendary leaders in U.S. business history. You ran AMR/American Airlines for 13 years, overseeing its remarkable expansion and success in the 1980s and ’90s. Since then, you’ve served as a director of several public and private companies, including as chair of Celestica in Canada. How has your experience as a CEO made you a better director?
Robert L. Crandall Being a successful CEO shapes your view of how other CEOs ought to manage. The experience of running a company has provided me a template against which to measure the performance of management. That’s vital, because the board is there to judge management’s performance. Performance is the bottom line and it must be judged in both absolute and comparative terms. There are many managements who succeed in absolute terms but which fall short when measured against the accomplishments of their competitors.
David W. Anderson What specifically do you look for in a CEO’s performance to make your judgment?
Robert L. Crandall My expectation is that the CEO will apply high standards to the work he or she expects from subordinates and the company as a whole, and will expect the board to apply similarly high standards to the CEO’s performance. In particular, I expect the CEO to have a comprehensive knowledge of the company’s affairs and to answer most questions directors pose without needing to do much follow-up research and without needing to call often on subordinates. If the CEO doesn’t know the answers, I get concerned because it means he or she is not asking the same questions and isn’t deep enough into day-to-day operations. Of course, it’s important for the CEO to expose the board to his or her subordinates and I see the competence of those subordinates as a reflection on the CEO, providing another means of assessment.
David W. Anderson Are there personal characteristics of a CEO that provide you with insight into performance, or by which you gauge a CEO’s credibility?
Robert L. Crandall I want to see confidence, crisp and well-reasoned decision-making and an ability to choose leaders. I expect the CEO to be personally involved in all substantive corporate decisions. If the CEO relies too much on subordinates, I think it shows a lack of confidence and often reflects an inappropriate degree of delegation. The board is paying the CEO to run the place.
David W. Anderson If you think CEOs are at risk of over-delegating, do you think the same of boards? Do boards give CEOs too much leeway?
Robert L. Crandall Yes, I think CEOs tend to over-delegate and as a generality, expect too much delegation from their boards. But boards let them get away with it. As a result, boards are at the mercy of their CEOs, who often share lots less information than they should.
David W. Anderson You’ve been a consistently fierce critic of boards from a vantage point few others have. Yet much has changed since Enron made governance front-page news. How do you critique the state of corporate governance today?
Robert L. Crandall I’ll agree that boards are doing better than a decade ago, but it’s a low bar. Sure, there have been improvements in how boards function, but there is more window dressing than substance. I have three main criticisms, which if addressed, might begin to bring real change. First, boards aren’t really holding management sufficiently accountable. Secondly, boards often aren’t sufficiently knowledgeable of the business to play a fully engaged role. And thirdly, boards are not functioning well from a compensation perspective.
David W. Anderson Let’s examine those points in turn. Where’s the flaw in management accountability to boards?
Robert L. Crandall The greatest failure of boards is that they don’t focus sufficiently on performance metrics. How many boards really know about the quality of their products and the satisfaction of customers relative to competitors? Boards don’t explore these questions in sufficient detail. Too often, a singular focus on financial metrics lulls directors into complacency and keeps them away from the operational metrics where early warning flags may exist. The habit of using financial reports as the only measure of success has led to spectacular failures. Directors need to ask questions about how the company is operating in a more demanding way than they do now. This means broadening their interest beyond financial metrics to lots more operational metrics. I mean, for example, that it should have been fully obvious to GM’s board, for many years prior to the company’s bankruptcy, that GM was doing all the wrong things—building the wrong cars, paying above market wages and benefits, and falling further and further behind others on quality measures.
David W. Anderson Are there any particular performance metrics boards should look for to better understand the core of the business—the operations?
Robert L. Crandall Boards need to insist on performance metrics that are relevant to the nature of the business and on comparing those performance metrics to those of competitors. Until boards raise detailed performance related questions, they can’t truly measure management’s performance. And that means, I think, that boards need lots more information than managements typically provide. Boards have the ability to cause management to gather and present this information to the board, but seem inclined to use it only when there is some sort of crisis. Boards have to move beyond that mindset, and insist on in-depth, detailed operating information on a continuing basis.
David W. Anderson Would developing an independent research capability address your second criticism of how boards currently govern—namely, that boards lack sufficient knowledge of the business to be fully effective?
Robert L. Crandall An independent board research capability probably isn’t the answer. Let’s understand the issue here: a board needs to have an in-depth understanding of the business—from competitive pressures to technological challenges—to participate fully in a dialogue with management on strategic planning and performance metrics. If the board doesn’t know enough, it simply can’t understand the implications of the data and form its own judgment. The only way a board will have sufficient knowledge of the business is if the CEO fully understands the issues—many do not—and takes the time to educate the board about what those issues are and how the company is dealing with them. The board can encourage this, but the CEO has to make it happen. If management wants a meaningful dialogue with the board, the CEO will take time to teach the board the business.
In a sense, running an airline was a great advantage; as our board members rode around on the planes, the employees told directors exactly what they thought about management and about how the airline was doing relative to its competitors. That openness encouraged directors to be more educated and management to be more transparent—because we couldn’t hide the real issues.
David W. Anderson Are you encouraging directors to take the initiative to talk to employees directly?
Robert L. Crandall Yes. The mindset holding back most boards is the notion that running the business is separate from governing the management process and that operations are none of the directors’ business. What could be more their business than how the company is run? This illustrates the constant tension directors face: needing to know what’s going on in order to do their job but being told not to intrude on management’s turf by asking irritating questions. Boards lose both ways by being criticized for being too involved or after the fact for not knowing enough.
David W. Anderson To many directors and CEOs, what you’re advocating will sound like a violation of the cardinal rule of governance that boards are told to follow: “nose in, fingers out.”
Robert L. Crandall Unhappily, that nonsense is widely accepted as a truism. The problem is that boards don’t see themselves as performance critics and too often feel they are supposed to be cheerleaders for management. Directors who ask pointed questions are often accused of “micro-managing” when they are actually seeking to take responsibility for understanding the events they are asked to evaluate. I’m amused at how often, after things go wrong, the board and the CEO replace people further down in the organization. That’s not taking responsibility for being the boss.
David W. Anderson Looking at this from the CEO perspective, how would you advise a CEO to work with a board seeking greater engagement—or simply to get the most value from directors?
Robert L. Crandall My advice is simple: educate your board comprehensively so that the board knows everything you know. The best way to take advantage of a board’s experience is to give the board exposure to management’s analysis and the competing opinions before major decisions are made. In large companies in particular, the analytical work done to support decisions tends to be extensive and professional. Being immersed in these data allows the board to bring its expertise to bear. What often happens, though, is the board gets presented with just a summary of the analysis and management’s conclusion, so there’s little opportunity to add value.
Rather than keeping the data and applying your own judgment in isolation of the board, benefit from its experience by allowing the board’s judgment to be brought to bear on the same data. This is a rare experience for any board. The CEO may find his or her conclusions differ from those of the board, but a confident CEO wouldn’t be concerned and a competent CEO won’t find that happens very often. A confident and competent CEO ought to take full advantage of a board by educating it extensively. If the board doesn’t comprehend key issues in the business, its view on strategy won’t be relevant whatever their experience.
David W. Anderson The third major criticism of governance you identified was excessive executive pay. You’re a rarity among business leaders in your condemnation of current pay practices—and rarer still for advocating much higher marginal tax rates on high-income earners. Why do you feel so passionately about pay?
Robert L. Crandall A lot of CEO compensation granted by boards is clearly excessive. Go back 30 years and you’ll find a typical CEO made 30-40 times average compensation at the company, not 300 times as we see today. Are CEOs that much better now? Is the market for CEOs that much tighter? No. Simply, boards are not doing a good job of controlling the rate of pay for executives and are far too timid about acknowledging that losing a CEO who wants to be paid more probably isn’t the end of the world.
David W. Anderson Beyond this inefficient use of shareholder money, has the considerable change in executive pay you’ve noted had other implications that concern you?
Robert L. Crandall Two other consequences of excessive executive pay bother me. The first is the increasing level of societal income inequality. Today, we seem to be living in a world that is shaped by the idea the people at the top are entitled to an outsized share of the rewards. The people who actually make the company work are, as a consequence, getting a smaller share of the pie. This is not right by any standard of fairness or morality. When you take away fairness, you undermine the work ethic and the belief in potential upward mobility that makes a society work. Here’s the reality: my phone com- pany is a good company not because of the CEO but because of the guy who comes to fix the line at my home. It’s the same in the airline business. The frontline worker is key, but you wouldn’t know it today.
Secondly, at the management level, excessive CEO pay can have a debilitating impact by understating the value of the corporate team. Yes, the CEO makes a real difference by setting the tone, needs to be an effective leader and is hopefully the most competent and creative member of the senior team. But there are lots of competent people in management. Paying the CEO multiples of what his or her subordinates earn has an adverse affect on people’s ability to function as a team. When you come to CEO succession, everyone knows that whoever prevails in the contest to lead will receive several times the compensation earned by others. This makes the competition to become the leader more intense than is healthy, and makes it hard to keep other valued executives. Overall, these disparities and inequalities undermine both effective management and effective governance.
