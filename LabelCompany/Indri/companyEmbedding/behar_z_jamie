CLEVELAND, April 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Forest City Realty Trust, Inc., (NYSE:   FCEA and FCEB) today announced the appointment of Z. Jamie Behar, CFA, and the nomination of Craig Macnab, two highly qualified and accomplished real estate executives with significant board experience, to serve on its Board of Directors. 








Behar will join the Board effective immediately and will fill the vacancy created when Bruce C. Ratner, executive chairman of Forest City's New York subsidiary, stepped down from the Board at the end of 2016. The Board has nominated Macnab as an independent director to succeed Stan Ross, who will not stand for re-election at the Company's upcoming Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
Behar brings to the Board more than 35 years of experience in investment management and financial analysis with a focus on real estate, together with significant experience serving on boards. Behar is the former Managing Director, Real Estate & Alternative Investments, at GM Investment Management Corp, where she was responsible for managing real estate and alternative investment portfolios totaling approximately $12 billion at peak value. 
Macnab is a seasoned executive with more than 35 years of experience in the real estate industry and investment banking and management. Macnab has served as chief executive officer of National Retail Properties, a publicly traded REIT with a market capitalization of approximately $6.5 billion, since 2004, and the chairman of its Board of Directors since 2008. He will retire from his roles at National Retail Properties, effective April 28, 2017.
"We are thrilled to welcome these two outstanding real estate professionals to our board and we look forward to benefiting from their significant industry experience," said James A. Ratner, chairman of the Board. "In addition to their deep knowledge of our industry and impressive board-service credentials, the appointment of Jamie Behar and the nomination of Craig Macnab reflect our ongoing commitment to best practices in corporate governance and increased board independence."
"As a management team, we look forward to capitalizing on the fresh insights and viewpoints these new directors are expected to bring to the Board as we continue to execute on our strategy to ensure long-term growth at Forest City," said David J. LaRue, president and chief executive officer. "Both Jamie and Craig have unique perspectives on the real estate business and a wealth of experience in organizational and investment strategy, as well as outstanding leadership skills, and will provide Forest City with additional perspectives for enhancing shareholder value."
Both Behar and Macnab, along with the Company's other directors, will stand for election at the upcoming Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
Behar and Macnab were identified through the Board's previously announced search process, which it conducted with the assistance of nationally recognized search firm Ferguson Partners, Ltd. With these board actions and anticipated director elections, the Forest City Board will be comprised of thirteen directors, eight of whom are independent, one of whom is the President and Chief Executive Officer, and four of whom are members of the founding family, the Company's largest non-institutional shareholder.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"

U.S. News & World Report
