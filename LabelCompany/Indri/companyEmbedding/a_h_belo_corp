The Belo Building in Dallas, the headquarters of A. H. Belo Corporation


A. H. Belo Corporation /ˈbiloʊ/ is a Dallas-based media company that owns newspapers in North Texas. The current corporation was formed when Belo Corporation separated its broadcasting and publishing operations into two corporations. A. H. Belo also owns a part interest in Classified Ventures. Its CEO is Robert Decherd who had headed Belo before the spin-off. The company has its headquarters in the Belo Building in Downtown Dallas.[2]
The company was organized as a fully owned subsidiary of Belo Corporation on October 1, 2007, then taken public by issuing the new stock to Belo shareholders and starting trade on February 8, 2008. The split was structured so that Belo Corporation was the legal successor of the original company. While technically this corporate entity was formed in 2008, the organization traces its roots and history back to 1842. The Belo Corporation used the A. H. Belo name from 1926 to 2002 when it was shortened to simply Belo. With the split the old name, which honors Alfred Horatio Belo, founder of the Dallas Morning News, was revived.
Newspapers[edit]

The Dallas Morning News (Dallas, Texas)

Al Día (Spanish language - Dallas, Texas)


Denton Record-Chronicle (Denton, Texas)

The company also formerly published the Providence Journal, the Riverside Press-Enterprise, Quick, a free weekly in Dallas, and The Business Press, a weekly business publication in Riverside.
For decades, News-Texan, Inc., an A.H. Belo subsidiary, was the owner of The Dallas Morning News as well as other newspapers in the suburban Dallas area. Belo acquired seven newspapers in 1963, which included The Garland Daily News, The Grand Prairie Daily News, and The Richardson Daily News. The newspaper group would become Dallas-Fort Worth Suburban Newspapers, Inc.[3]
Belo executives specifically shifted the newspapers to afternoon delivery to compete with The Dallas Times-Herald, the rival of the chain's flagship Dallas Morning News, according to Judith Garrett Segura, author of Belo: From Newspapers to New Media She claims the newspapers were not profitable for roughly two years.[3]
These newspapers would operate and be published relatively independently until the late 1980s. Under increased advertising pressures and laws prohibiting media monopolies in urban markets, the newspapers were ultimately absorbed into The Dallas Morning News.

A. H. Belo Corporation Announces Third Quarter 2017 Dividend













Cash Dividend On The Way From AH Belo (AHC)

For sale: A 122-year-old Texas newspaper institution with 412,000 readers. Debt-free. Good condition. Technology needs work. Available as early as 2009.
It's not likely that A.H. Belo Corp. will place that classified advertisement for The Dallas Morning News in one of its three major daily newspapers. But that's the message media analysts are getting in the wake of Belo Corp.'s decision to isolate its ailing newspapers from its more profitable broadcasting division.





 


Belo CEO Robert Decherd, who will lead the newspaper business, declined to comment for this story through a spokesman.
Analysts began asking about the Belo newspaper company going private on an Oct. 1 conference call -- the day the split-up plan was announced.
"We don't want to speculate about anything beyond this transaction," Decherd said on the conference call. "There is a lot yet to be determined about how the newspaper industry plays out, and we like the position we are in working through that."
The two new companies will require "at least a year of seasoning to see how they operate in the new environment," Decherd said.
In a written analysis, equity research firm Bear Stearns states that the newspaper-only company "will be ripe for privatization" in the long-run.
Since Oct. 1, the spinoff has been well-received. Belo's stock immediately shot up almost 20%. It was still up nearly 8% this week, closing at $18.87 on Oct. 17.
Rick Edmonds, media business analyst at The Poynter Institute, said institutional investors and analysts had been suggesting the split for some time before Belo pulled the trigger.
Private ownership has grown in appeal for the newspaper business recently, said Scott Bosley, executive director of the American Society of Newspaper Editors.
"There are those who believe they'll (private owners will) accept predictable but lower margins than publicly held companies," he said. "There are a lot of businesses that would accept a lower margin at a steady business, and some investors would, too."
Who would buy it?
Publicly traded companies can go private in a few different ways -- by merging or selling its assets to a private company, or by having a private company or individual buy all or most of the company's publicly held shares.

The newspaper business, A.H. Belo Corp., is set for a tax-free spin-off from the exisiting company, Belo Corp. (NYSE: BLC) by early 2008.
It's most likely that CEO Decherd, who is leaving the larger, more profitable broadcasting business to lead the newspaper operation, would be involved in the privatization of the paper company, says Lee Westerfield, managing director/media analyst for BMO Capital Markets, who has been covering Belo since 1998.
He says Belo has $2.7 billion in enterprise value. Belo estimates A.H. Belo will have a net worth of more than $850 million. Privatization could happen, but no sooner than 2009, Westerfield said.
"It's more likely there will be a management buyout than a disposition of the assets, because I think Robert Decherd is and will continue to be the steward of A.H. Belo journalism," he said.
Other prospective buyers are hard to name.
E.W. Scripps Co. announced a similar split of newspaper and television interests on Oct. 16. Poynter's Edmonds says that organization wouldn't be a likely buyer. And Hearst Corp., which owns daily newspapers of record in Houston and San Antonio, isn't a likley buyer either, he says.
Still, the structure of Belo's newspaper spinoff makes a buyout very possible.
"It really sets up that possibility, particularly with the debt-free structure of the deal," Edmonds said. "There remains the question: Who would buy it? Is taking the company private something that Decherd and others in management would be looking at? They're certainly not in a position to say anything like that right now."




 


Names aside, the group that could take the newspaper operation private may look something like in-state, non-newspaper businesspeople joining into a group because they believe maintaining a strong newspaper is a good thing for the city, Edmonds said. But he agrees that the most likely scenario is for Decherd and the family descended from company namesake Alfred Horatio Belo to draw on their resources and lenders in a private market for an internal sale.
A year away, at least
Despite the instant chatter, ownership changes will be a long time coming, thanks in large part to tax issues.
"Privatizing may ... one day play into strategies of A.H. Belo and Belo, but no time soon," Westerfield said. "A good rule of thumb is at least a year."
The federal tax code requires a lengthy seasoning period to preserve the tax-free virtue of the spin-off, he said.
In that time, Edmonds says Decherd will focus on improving The Dallas Morning News. The newspaper has since 2004 shed about 200 journalists, or 30% of its newsroom through layoffs and attrition. The Audit Bureau of Circulations indicates that from October 2006 through March 2007, The Morning News' daily circulation was 411,919 -- a decline of 14.3% from a year earlier.
"I think the DMN is the first priority for (Decherd)," Edmonds said. "I think the Morning News is going to get a lot of attention. They've made some very big cuts over the years. I don't think they're needing to cut anymore.
Splitsville
Early next year, media company Belo Corp. will split its newspaper business from its other operations. Here's a rundown on what the two companies will look like after the split.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  OVERVIEW  With a continued focus on extending the Company's media platform, A. H. Belo delivers news and information in innovative ways to a broad spectrum of audiences with diverse interests and lifestyles.  The Company's Publishing segment includes the operations of The Dallas Morning News (www.dallasnews.com), Texas' leading newspaper and winner of nine Pulitzer Prizes; the Denton Record-Chronicle (www.dentonrc.com), a daily newspaper operating in Denton, Texas, and various niche publications targeting specific audiences. Its newspaper operations also provide commercial printing and distribution services to large national and regional newspapers and other businesses in Texas.  All other operations are reported within the Company's MEMO segment. These operations primarily include DMV Holdings and its subsidiaries Distribion, Vertical Nerve and MarketingFX; Speakeasy; sales of online automotive classifieds on the cars.com platform; marketing services generated by the Company's branded marketing division Connect; and Proven Performance Media. The segment also includes event activation, promotion and marketing services provided by CrowdSource.  Overview of Significant Transactions from Continuing Operations  Operating results for 2016, 2015 and 2014 reflect continued challenges in print advertising revenue trends, primarily due to volume and rate declines, partially offset by increases in the Company's digital advertising and marketing services revenues. The Company continues its efforts to diversify revenues through leveraging its brand, its personnel and its infrastructure in both organic new product development and in pursuit of acquisitions of related advertising and marketing services companies.  The Company conducted its annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2016, for all reporting units. This test, which was based on the Company's most recent cash flow forecast, indicated that the Publishing reporting unit's carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value. Accordingly, the Company recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $22,682 in the fourth quarter of 2016, fully impairing the Publishing reporting unit's goodwill.  In January 2015, the Company acquired an 80 percent voting interest in DMV Digital Holdings Company, into which the stock of three Dallas-based companies, Distribion, Inc., Vertical Nerve, Inc. and CDFX, LLC, were contributed. These businesses specialize in local marketing automation, search engine marketing, and direct mail and promotional products, respectively. The Company believes this acquisition complements the product and service offerings currently available to A. H. Belo customers, thereby strengthening the Company's diversified product portfolio and allowing for greater penetration in a competitive advertising market. DMV Holdings was acquired for a cash purchase price of $14,110 and the transaction costs totaled $1,288. Results of operations related to the companies acquired are presented within this Annual Report on Form 10-K on a prospective basis from the date of acquisition.  Cost reductions were completed in 2015 through a voluntary severance option offered to certain newsroom employees and through other headcount reductions. Approximately 70 positions were eliminated, resulting in $2,891 of severance and other related costs charged to employee compensation and benefits. Through the savings generated, the Company began a newsroom reorganization aimed at making The Dallas Morning News a more effective digital news organization in part through the recruitment of a new editor and a nationally recognized digital journalist as the Company's managing editor and placing innovative journalists in other key roles.  In efforts to de-risk the Company's pension plans, lump-sum payments totaling $100,877 and $52,919 were made to participants through the plans' master trust in 2015 and 2014, respectively. These payments allowed favorable settlement of the pension obligation totaling $20,000 and resulted in a noncash charge to pension expense of $14,964 and $7,648 in 2015 and 2014, respectively, for amortization of losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss.  The sale of The Providence Journal was completed in 2014. The purchase price consisted of $46,000 plus a working capital adjustment of $2,654 for a pretax gain of $17,104. The sale allowed the Company to focus its capital and other resources in the growing North Texas market. See Note 13 - Discontinued Operations and Sales of Assets .  In April 2014, the Company received a cash distribution of $18,861 from Classified Ventures, LLC ("Classified Ventures"), an equity method investee, for its portion of the net sales proceeds for apartments.com, and recorded a gain of $18,479. In October 2014, the Company completed a transaction with Gannett Co. Inc. and other unit holders of Classified Ventures whereby Gannett acquired all membership interests from the unit holders for Classified Ventures' remaining business, which primarily consists of cars.com. The Company received pre-tax cash proceeds, net of selling costs, of $77,661. A gain of $77,092 was recorded related to the transaction. The Company entered into a five-year affiliate agreement with Classified Ventures that allows The Dallas Morning News to continue to resell cars.com products and services exclusively in its local market. The affiliate agreement increased the wholesale rate that the Company pays to Classified Ventures for selling cars.com products. Other income of $3,540 was recorded in July 2014 for the receipt of an economic parity payment from the former parent company in conjunction with the dissolution of the jointly-owned partnership holding the Company's investment in Classified Ventures.  A. H. Belo Corporation 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K PAGE 16  Table of Contents  Proceeds generated from the sales of investments and newspaper operations resulted in the declaration of special dividends of $2.25 and $1.50 per share in 2014, totaling $83,967. Quarterly dividends of $0.08 per share returned $7,029, $7,052 and $7,193 to shareholders in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. On December 9, 2016, the Company announced a $0.08 per share dividend to shareholders of record and holders of restricted stock units ("RSUs") as of the close of business on February 10, 2017, payable on March 3, 2017.  Additional capital was returned to shareholders through the share repurchase program. In 2015 and 2014, the Company purchased 472,245 and 449,436 of its Series A common shares through open market transactions for $3,146 and $4,974, respectively, which are recorded as treasury stock. The Company's agreement to repurchase its shares was terminated in December 2015.  A. H.

As a result of competitive and economic conditions, the newspaper industry has faced significant revenue declines over the past decade. Therefore, the Company has sought to diversify its revenues through development and investment in new product offerings, increased circulation rates and leveraging of its existing assets to offer cost efficient commercial printing and distribution services to its local markets. The Company continually evaluates the overall performance of its core products to ensure existing assets are deployed adequately to maximize return.  In 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company's advertising revenue from its core newspapers continues to be adversely affected by the shift of advertiser spending to other forms of media and the increased accessibility of free online news content, as well as news content from other sources, which resulted in declines in advertising and paid print circulation volumes and revenue. The most significant decline in advertising revenue has been attributable to print display and classified categories. These categories, which represented 26.6 percent of consolidated revenue in 2014, have declined to 19.9 percent of consolidated revenue in 2016, and further declines are likely in future periods. Decreases in print display and classified categories are indicative of continuing trends by advertisers towards digital platforms, which are widely available from many sources. In the current environment, companies are allocating more of their advertising spending towards programmatic channels that provide digital advertising on multiple platforms with enhanced technology for targeted delivery and measurement. As a result of the continued declines the Publishing segment experienced, and expects to continue to experience, in advertising and print circulation revenues, the Publishing reporting unit's goodwill was determined to be impaired. The Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $22,682 in the fourth quarter of 2016.  The Company has responded to these challenges by expanding programmatic channels through which it works to meet customer demand for digital advertisement opportunities in display, mobile, video and social media categories. By utilizing advertising exchanges to apply marketing insight, the Company believes it offers greater value to customers through focused targeting of advertising to potential customers.  The Company's expanded digital and marketing services product offerings leverage the Company's existing resources and relationships to offer additional value to existing and new advertising customers. Solutions provided by DMV Holdings include  A. H. Belo Corporation 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K PAGE 18  Table of Contents  development of mobile websites, search engine marketing and optimization, video, mobile advertising, email marketing, advertising analytics and online reputation management services. Through Speakeasy, the Company is able to target middle-market business customers and provide turnkey social media account management and content development services.  Advertising and marketing services revenue  Advertising and marketing services revenue was 57.8 percent, 57.6 percent and 58.0 percent of total revenue for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.   Years Ended December 31, Percentage Percentage 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014 Publishing Display advertising $ 32,535 (27.3) % $ 44,751 (9.5) % $ 49,464 Classified advertising 19,218 (7.1) % 20,676 (10.5) % 23,097 Preprint advertising 47,533 (2.6) % 48,823 (8.4) % 53,272 Digital advertising 10,068 (6.4) % 10,757 (1.2) % 10,889 MEMO Digital services 37,295 26.7 % 29,428 37.1 % 21,461 Other services 3,666 55.7 % 2,355 - % - Advertising and Marketing Services $ 150,315 (4.1) % $ 156,790 (0.9) % $ 158,183  Publishing  Display - Display revenue primarily represents sales of non-classified advertising space within the Company's core and niche newspapers. As advertisers continue to diversify marketing budgets to incorporate more and varied avenues of reaching consumers, traditional display advertising continues to decline. Revenue decreased in 2016 due to lower retail and general advertising in substantially all categories except sporting goods. In retail, the department store, food and beverage, furniture, electronics and entertainment categories experienced the greatest declines with a combined revenue decrease of approximately $4,301 driven heavily by a volume decline of 23.3 percent and varying rate declines across most categories. General advertising has declined in all categories with a combined revenue decrease of approximately $3,149 primarily due to a volume decline of 36.2 percent.  In 2015, revenue decreased due to lower retail advertising in substantially all categories except medical and sporting goods. The electronics and furniture categories experienced the greatest declines with a combined revenue decrease of approximately $2,200 driven heavily by a volume decline of 17.0 percent  Classified - Classified revenue primarily represents sales of classified advertising space within the Company's core and niche newspapers. The decline in classified advertising revenue continues to be challenging as alternative digital outlets continue to emerge. Rate improvement trends in certain display advertising categories partially offset the volume decline. Overall classified revenue decreased in 2016 due to lower volumes in employment and obituaries. This decline was partially offset by an increase in automotive.  In 2015, overall classified revenue decreased due to lower volumes in all categories except legal and real estate. This decline was partially offset by higher rates in employment and obituaries.  Preprint - Preprint revenue primarily reflects preprinted advertisements inserted into the Company's core newspapers and niche publications, or distributed to non-subscribers through the mail. Revenue decreased in 2016 and 2015 due to a decline in the rate and volume of preprint newspaper inserts, consistent with the decline in circulation volumes discussed below. The 2016 preprint decline was partially offset by higher volumes in home delivery mail advertising.  Digital - Digital publishing revenue is primarily comprised of banner and real estate classified advertising on The Dallas Morning News' website dallasnews.com as well as online employment and obituary classified advertising on third-party websites sold under a print/digital bundle package. Revenue decreased in 2016 and 2015 due to a lower volume of online banner advertisements on dallasnews.com.  A. H. Belo Corporation 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K PAGE 19  Table of Contents  Marketing, Event Marketing and Other Services  Digital services - Digital marketing revenue includes targeted and multi-channel advertising placed on third-party websites, content development, social media management, search optimization, other consulting, and sales of online automotive classifieds on the cars.com platform. The 2015 acquisition of DMV Holdings provided a significant portion of the growth in digital marketing revenue. For 2016, DMV Holdings revenue increased 97.6 percent, or $6,486, and organic growth from Speakeasy resulted in increased revenue of $2,068. These revenue increases offset approximately 55 percent of the core print advertising revenue decline during 2016.  In 2015, digital marketing revenue increased 37.1 percent or $7,967. DMV Holdings accounted for $6,646 of the revenue growth and organic growth from Speakeasy resulted in a revenue increase of $1,314. These increases in marketing services revenues offset approximately 50 percent of the core print advertising revenue declines during 2015.  Other services - Other services revenue increased $1,311, or 55.7 percent, due to the sale of promotional merchandise by MarketingFX, acquired in 2015.  Circulation revenue  Circulation revenue was 30.6 percent, 30.7 percent and 31.1 percent of total revenue for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.   Years Ended December 31, Percentage Percentage 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014 Publishing Circulation $ 79,619 (4.7) % $ 83,581 (1.6) % $ 84,922  Revenue decreased in 2016 due to a decline in home delivery and single copy paid print circulation volumes of 8.7 percent and 13.7 percent, respectively. These volume declines were partially offset by a rate increase of 5.6 percent for home delivery. Additionally, the daily single copy rate was raised from $1.50 to $2.00 in November 2016, which had a negligible impact on the Company's 2016 circulation revenue. In 2015, revenue decreased due to 8.3 percent and 16.1 percent declines in paid print home delivery and single copy circulation volumes, respectively.  Volume declines in circulation revenue have been more pronounced with single copy sales as it competes for retail space. Price increases and supplemental editions are critical to maintaining the revenue base to support this product. In 2016, the Company generated $126 of incremental circulation revenue through the distribution of specialty magazines to its core subscribers.  Printing, distribution and other revenue  Printing, distribution and other revenue was 11.6 percent, 11.7 percent and 10.9 percent of total revenue for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.   Years Ended December 31, Percentage Percentage 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014 Publishing Commercial print and distribution $ 26,586 (3.6) % $ 27,578 (3.1) % $ 28,468 MEMO Event marketing and other 3,464 (16.7) % 4,159 242.3 % 1,215 Printing, Distribution and Other $ 30,050 (5.3) % $ 31,737 6.9 % $ 29,683  Publishing - The Company aggressively markets the capacity of their printing and distribution assets to other newspapers that would benefit from cost sharing arrangements. Revenue decreased in 2016 due to a decline in volumes associated with certain national newspapers. This decrease was partially offset by commencement of printing operations related to a regional newspaper in January 2016.  Marketing, Event Marketing and Other Services - CrowdSource provides event marketing services including event activation and sponsorship for large scale community events, seminars and festivals. CrowdSource revenue decreased in 2016 by $1,195, due to events the Company did not host in 2016. This decrease was partially offset by a revenue increase of $500 related to performance-based sales leads generated by Proven Performance Media.  A. H. Belo Corporation 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K PAGE 20  Table of Contents  Operating Costs and Expense  The table below sets forth the components of the Company's operating expenses for the last three years.   Years Ended December 31, Percentage Percentage 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014 Publishing Employee compensation and benefits $ 88,139 (18.7) % $ 108,376 2.6 % $ 105,674 Other production, distribution and operating costs 96,496 (7.7) % 104,598 (3.4) % 108,313 Newsprint, ink and other supplies 24,534 (18.3) % 30,021 (6.8) % 32,213 Depreciation 10,633 (6.7) % 11,401 (16.6) % 13,672 Amortization - (100.0) % 120 (0.8) % 121 Goodwill impairment 22,682 N/A - N/A - MEMO Employee compensation and benefits 15,870 27.6 % 12,442 106.1 % 6,036 Other production, distribution and operating costs 23,334 9.9 % 21,231 52.5 % 13,926 Newsprint, ink and other supplies 1,056 21.2 % 871 196.3 % 294 Depreciation 80 (29.8) % 114 (23.0) % 148 Amortization 906 (26.3) % 1,229 N/M 77 Total Operating Costs and Expense $ 283,730 (2.3) % $ 290,403 3.5 % $ 280,474  Publishing  Employee compensation and benefits - The Company continues to implement measures to optimize its workforce and reduce risk associated with future obligations towards employee benefit plans. Employee compensation and benefits decreased $20,237 in 2016 due to a decrease in pension expense of $13,793 and a decrease of $6,444 due to headcount reductions within the Company that were effected in the second half of 2015. In 2015, expense increased due to higher pension expense of $6,235. The increase in this noncash expense was primarily due to amortization of $14,964 of prior year actuarial losses associated with liquidated pension obligations in 2015. The increase in 2015 was substantially offset by lower salary and commissions expense of $4,297, primarily due to headcount reductions at the Company's newspapers and corporate operations and due to lower sales.  Other production, distribution and operating costs - Expense decreased in 2016, reflecting savings as the Company continues to manage discretionary spending. Savings were generated by reductions in temporary and personnel recruiting services, promotional spending, travel and other outside service expenses. In 2015, expense decreased due to a decrease in delivery costs, consistent with lower circulation volumes. These costs were offset by higher postage related to mailed advertisements. Additional savings were generated by discontinued computer maintenance costs no longer supporting the Company's systems and from negotiation of lower utility rates.  Newsprint, ink and other supplies - Expense decreased in 2016 and 2015 due to reduced newsprint costs associated with lower circulation volumes from the Company and certain third-party newspapers and the discontinuation of unprofitable product lines in 2016. Newsprint consumption approximated 26,752, 31,141 and 33,717 metric tons in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, at an average cost per metric ton of $532, $550 and $589, respectively. The average purchase price for newsprint was $538, $534 and $617 per metric ton in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Depreciation - Expense decreased in 2016 and 2015 due to a lower depreciable asset base as a higher level of in-service assets are now fully depreciated. Capital spending is primarily directed towards digital platforms, production systems and improvements to the Company's facilities. The Company is committed to investing the appropriate levels of capital to sustain existing operations and develop new operations having an appropriate return on the investment. Capital spending is expected to be approximately $13,000 in 2017, which includes $7,000 for the Company's new headquarters.  Amortization - All definite-lived intangible assets are fully amortized. Amortization of customer relationships acquired in 2015 was completed in 2015.  Goodwill impairment - 2016 operating costs and expense for the Publishing segment reflect a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $22,682.  A. H. Belo Corporation 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K PAGE 21  Table of Contents  Marketing, Event Marketing and Other Services  Employee compensation and benefits - Expense increased in 2016 by $3,428, primarily related to headcount growth of 26, or 3.0 percent, in DMV Holdings.  Other production, distribution and operating costs - Expenses increased in 2016 by $2,103 primarily attributed to an increase in sales related expenses driven by the growth in DMV Holdings.  Newsprint, ink and other supplies - Expense increased in 2016 primarily due to an increase in promotional material printing costs associated with MarketingFX.  Depreciation - Marketing and event services' cost structure is primarily labor driven. Capital purchases are required to support technology investments, the Company's websites and customer engaging applications. Capital assets are primarily depreciated over a life of three years.  Amortization - Expense decreased in 2016 primarily related to CrowdSource customer lists that became fully amortized as of December 31, 2015.  Other  The table below sets forth the other components of the Company's results of operations.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.
