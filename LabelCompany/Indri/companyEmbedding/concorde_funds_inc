Concorde Asset Management currently manages over 30 funds, and is the longest standing independent asset manager locally, with an 18 year track record. We have in house expertise in global macro economics, Central and Eastern European equities and fixed income. Investment managers draw on a number of these sources as well as standard market data services like Bloomberg and Reuters and have access to analyst reviews internationally.
The 16 investment managers responsible for managing the Concorde funds keep the requirements of the specific mandates and associated risk constrains at the fore. We believe that flexibility and quick time to market are key attributes of a successfully managed hedge fund. This is why at Concorde the investment decision making process is not encumbered with bureaucratic hurdles. None the less, our procedures are within the legal guidelines and at times are subject to more stringent scrutiny to fairly serve client interest.
Five of Concorde Asset Management’s funds are being made available to investors internationally. Four of these follow an absolute return strategy, while one, Concorde 2000, our flagship vehicle with a 18 year track record, is a long only Central and Eastern European balanced fund.

Platina Pí Absolute Return Fund
Concorde’s Platina Pí fund is an absolute return fund with a target return of ten percent over the risk free rate, irrespective of the macro economic and capital market environment, while maintaining moderate risk exposure. Since its inception in 2006 it achieved an annualised return of 15.67% with the annualised standard deviation of daily returns being 12.11% and a Sharpe ratio of 0.72.*
Concorde-VM Absolute Return Fund
Concorde-VM is the most conservative of Concorde Asset Management’s absolute return strategies. The Fund’s objectives are two pronged; the return objective of five to ten percent over the risk free rate is complemented by a strong focus on capital preservation. The managers’, Ferenc Faragó and Tamás Makara, success in reaching this objective had been borne out by the Fund’s performance. Concorde-VM’s performance has always been positive for any 12 month period since its inception, while the annualised since inception return of Concorde-VM was 8.74% with no leverage. The annualised standard deviation of daily returns for the same period was 3.72% and the Sharpe ratio 0.52.*
Concorde Columbus Absolute Return Fund
Concorde Columbus Absolute Return Fund has a global mandate and may invest in a broad selection of assets including equities, bonds, commodities as well as derivative instruments with the prior as underlying assets. Due to the significant local expertise of the managers; Daniel Móricz and Tamás Cser the Fund is overweight in Central and Eastern European positions be it long or short. The managers primarily rely on fundamental analysis when selecting assets, albeit market timing may be influenced by technical factors. Concorde Columbus is managed with a relative value approach, often investing in securities that are less well covered by analysts and are consequently under valued.
Citadella Absolute Return Fund
Citadella is one of Concorde Asset Management’s absolute return funds. Viktor Zsiday, the manager of the fund, combines a global macro approach with technical analysis to generate target returns of five to ten percent over the risk free rate.

Jaidip  Chanda

Head of Charitable Asset Management
BIO





Jai Chanda, Head of Charitable Asset Management, discusses how the SHE donor advised fund gives back to our communities by funding female leadership programs.














































*Noland, Marcus et al. “Is Gender Diversity Profitable? Evidence from a Global Survey.” Peterson Institute for International Economics, February 2016.
 



Concentrated investments in a particular industry or sector may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in that industry or sector.
                                                                                                                                                                                                             
ETFs trade like stocks, are subject to investment risk, fluctuate in market value and may trade at prices above or below the ETFs net asset value. Brokerage commissions and ETF expenses will reduce returns.

Equity securities may fluctuate in value in response to the activities of individual companies and general market and economic conditions.

Gender diversity risk: The returns on a portfolio of securities that excludes companies that are not gender diverse may trail the returns on a portfolio of securities that includes companies that are not gender diverse.

Non-diversified funds that focus on a relatively small number of issuers tend to be more volatile than diversified funds and the market as a whole.

Passively managed funds hold a range of securities that, in the aggregate, approximates the full Index in terms of key risk factors and other characteristics. This may cause the fund to experience tracking errors relative to performance of the index.

Companies with large market capitalizations go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions. Larger companies tend to be less volatile than companies with smaller market capitalizations. In exchange for this potentially lower risk, the value of the security may not rise as much as companies with smaller market capitalizations.

Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.

What Local Florida Realtors are saying about R P Funding:

"We have been blown away with the attention to detail and the efficiency that RP funding has provided our clients. Most of the time it is like pulling teeth with folks in the mortgage industry. RP has simplified everything letting me as a realtor and my clients breathe a little bit easier. I will recommend all of my clients to use RP Funding, hands down." 

Lee Goldberg
		Realtor
		GCI Realty, Inc
		Orlando, Florida

"During the government's &dollar;8,000 home buying credit program, I was the listing agent for a single family home in the BVL area; the buyer had been diligently trying to secure his loan, but 10 days before the closing a last minute over-site by his chosen lender made him ineligible for their loan product and the buyer's agent had no back-up. I suggested to the buyer's agent that the buyer contact RP Funding to review the buyer's qualifications, before they just walked away. RP Funding came through; saving the sale by qualifying the buyer, saving his $8,000 credit and closing the deal on time. Result: all parties to the transaction (buyer, seller and agents) were very happy.
		
Thanks RP!!!"
		
Daniel J. Lopez
		Sales Agent
		Hometown Realty Group, Inc

"I discovered RP Funding through an email advertisement I received.	After looking at their website
		and speaking with Brandon Fields about their low closing costs, 10 day closings, and $1,000
		guarantee, I was anxious to give RP Funding a try.	I sent Brandon a client on Dec. 8th to get pre-
		approved and had a FULL loan approval by Dec. 17th.	Amazing!	Brandon Fields and his
		processor Jill Hoyle are fabulous to work with and they have definitely earned my business.
		RP Funding is the only place I will send my clients from now on!!"

Direct Mortgage Lender - Not a Bank and Not a Broker

The big banks are so backed up with refinances, many raised their rates to slow down volume. 
To a big bank you are just a number, and will most likely work with an out of state call center. 
Mortgage broker fees raise the cost of your refinance, as a Direct Lender you pay no Broker Fees.
We have the authority to underwrite and close your loan, and we do it in as little as 10 days right here in Orlando, Florida. †
Mortgage Rates in Florida will not stay this low for long, and with our fast process you can get in before it's too late.




No Games, No Pushy Sales People and BBB A-Rated
Most mortgage loan officers are paid commission and make extra money by selling you a higher interest
	rate, not here. We don't have pushy commission sales people, you will work directly with a Salaried Credit
	Manager who's only concern is earning your business, not making their next big commission check.
	This helps us keep our rates and fees low.
Based Locally in the Central FL area
Our office is just off of Interstate 4, Exit 90B in Maitland, Florida, just outside of Orlando. We would
	love to meet you in person, although you are welcome to complete the entire process over the phone,
	it's completely up to you.  We help home buyers and home owners all over Florida.
&dollar;1,000 "Best Florida Mortgage Rates" Guarantee
If you find a better loan somewhere else (which we doubt you can) and we can't beat it, we will give
	you a &dollar;1,000 Visa Gift Card.*

Rates, Fees & Our $1,000 Guarantee
We don't charge any lender fees, because you shouldn't have to pay to get a mortgage.
The only fee you would ever pay to RP Funding is rate discount costs, and only if You decide you want to buydown to an even lower interest rate.   Many clients will use the money they would have spent on Fees with other lenders and use it to buydown to an even lower interest rate.  Your credit manager can discuss all of these options with you and help you make the best decision.

How do we offer the Best Mortgage Rates in Florida?
We get asked this question often; it really comes down to business philosophy.  Most mortgage loan officers and brokers only close 1 - 2 loans per month, so to make a living they need to make thousands of dollars in commissions on each loan they close.  These commissions are earned through a combination of charging upfront fees and higher interest rates to earn "kick backs".  Not at RP Funding! Our loan officers are paid a base + bonus and they close 15 - 20 loans each month.  So instead of paying thousands of dollars in commissions on each loan, we only pay hundreds of dollars in salaries - and we pass this savings onto you in the form of the best mortgage rates possible and no lender fees.
Now you may be worried that you won't get as good of service from a loan officer who closes 10 - 15 times the industry average, but this isn't true (read more about why RP funding service is fast and great here).  We have found that 15 - 20 closings per month per credit manager is the optimal number to keep our costs and rates the lowest without sacrificing customer service.
 Our efficiency helps us offer the lowest rates. While other companies waste time and money shipping files all over the country, we do everything locally. You can read more about the differences this makes here.
Shopping for a mortgage can be hard work and confusing because of the numerous combinations of mortgage rates and fees and loan programs.  We set our mortgage rates low to make your decision easy. When you can get  Florida's best mortgage rates and fees from a local, Direct Mortgage Lender, why would you go anywhere else?



Click here & Get Started Today!



$1,000 Guarantee
While we are confident that our published rates and no lender fees are the most competitive in the industry, we do find rare instances where a competitor offers a better deal.  Our promise to you at RP Funding is that we will never let rates or fees stand in the way of you being able to work with your local Direct Mortgage Lender and take advantage of all the other benefits we offer.  If you receive a legitimate offer from a competitor that is lower, our promise to you is that we will match it, and if we can't we will give you $1,000.
Unfortunately we have found in most cases, when a competitor does offer a lower rate, it is part of a bait and switch.  Some unscrupulous companies will quote you anything over the phone and then when it comes time to give you the real figures (usually AFTER you have spent your hard earned money on an appraisal) the deal suddenly changes.  With RP Funding you can get the Best Deal on a Florida Mortgage and avoid any "bait and switch" or games.
In most cases the client came back to us when the "Bait and Switch" Occurred, or in some cases they were too far into the process and were stuck with a higher rate and fees because the "Bait and Switch" happened so far in the process they could not back out.
So beware when dealing with some unknown voice on the phone. If they do make a better offer than RP Funding, send us a copy and we will do our best to beat it.  If we can't beat it, we'll give you $1,000 when you actually close on their mortgage as disclosed - but from our experience, when we can't match it, it's just too good to be true.
Come down to our office, you can see that we are real people and a legitimate operation. Unfortunately the mortgage crises happened for a reason, and some of the people involved are still in our industry.  There are mortgage companies out there taking advantage of borrowers; working from home and ready to shut down and reopen under a new name when things start to catch up with them.  Our $1,000 Guarantee allows you to work with a local, reputable company that cares about this community, without missing out on the best possible deal.
As your Local Direct Mortgage Lender, our reputation in this community is important. While other "Discount" lenders may hit you with hidden fees and other last minute surprises... Not at RP Funding.

Rules and Restrictions for the $1,000 Guarantee

				HARP (Home Affordable Refinance Program), Freddie Mac RELIEF, and HomePath loans are not eligible for the $1,000 Guarantee.
			

No Adjustable Rate Mortgages. There are too many different variations of Indexes, Margins, Adjustment Periods and Rate Caps, we just could never offer them all.  So our $1,000 Guarantee only applies to Fixed Rate Mortgages.  Adjustable rate mortgages make up less than 5% of total Mortgage Volume, so our Guarantee applies to most mortgages.
			
* &dollar;1,000 Mortgage Challenge/Guarantee requires minimum &dollar;100,000 loan amount, but does not include Jumbo Loans, which are loans for &dollar;424,100 or larger, and applies to Fixed Rate Loans Only. Does not apply if borrower is declined by RP Funding for not meeting credit or income program guidelines. Borrower must provide Loan Estimate Disclosure to RP Funding from competing lender on the same day the competitor's terms were offered. Loan program offered by competitor must be a program RP Funding offers. Does not apply to prior locks or terms. RP Funding must have an opportunity to beat the terms. In the event that RP Funding is unable to beat the terms of the competing lender, borrower must provide the final executed Closing disclosure, the first page of mortgage note after closing and funding, and the lock-in agreement dated the same day terms were presented to RP Funding, all of which will be used to verify competing lender's terms have not changed at closing. The $1,000 Mortgage Challenge/Guarantee is not applicable if the loan closes on terms different than those detailed in the Loan Estimate Disclosure provided to RP Funding. Change in terms  include, but are not limited to, changes in loan amount, loan program, fees, discounts, lender credits, rate, APR, buydowns, years of term, origination, down payment, seller or any interested party credits, and within the time of the competitors initial lock in, or any other material loan changes not specifically mentioned here.

* $1,000 Mortgage Challenge/Guarantee requires a minimum loan amount of $100,000 and applies to Fixed Rate Loans only. This Challenge/Guarantee is not applicable to Jumbo Loans, which are loans for $424,100 and greater, and does not apply if borrower is declined by R P Funding for not meeting credit or income program guidelines. Borrower must provide Loan Estimate Disclosure to R P Funding from competing lender on the same day the competitor's terms are offered. Loan program offered by competitor must be a program R P Funding currently offers. This offer does not apply to prior locks or terms, and R P Funding must have an opportunity to beat the terms. In the event that R P Funding is unable to beat the terms of the competing lender, borrower must provide the final executed Closing disclosure, the first page of mortgage note after closing and funding, and the lock-in agreement dated the same day terms are presented to R P Funding, all of which will be used to verify competing lender's terms have not changed at closing. The $1,000 Mortgage Challenge/Guarantee is not applicable if the loan closes on terms different than those detailed in the Loan Estimate Disclosure provided to R P Funding. Change in terms include, but are not limited to, changes in loan amount, loan program, fees, discounts, lender credits, rate, APR, buy-downs, years of term, origination, down payment, seller or any interested party credits, and within the time of the competitor's initial lock in, or any other material loan changes not specifically mentioned here.
