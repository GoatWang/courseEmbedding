History[edit]
Brevan Howard was co-founded in 2002 by former Credit Suisse traders Alan Howard,[3] Jean-Philippe Blochet, Chris Rokos, James Vernon, and Trifon Natsis.[4][11][12] The company name was created by utilizing portions of the last names of the co-founders.[13] Blochet took a "sabbatical" in 2008, returned and left the firm again in November 2009.[14] Vernon left his position as chief executive officer (CEO) in 2011 but returned to the company as group chief operating officer (COO) in September 2013.[15][16] Another co-founder, Rokos, retired from the company in 2012.[15][17] The company received $2 billion to manage in the global macro fund from Credit Suisse Private Bank. Under the leadership of Brevan Howard's founding partner, assets grew to $10.5 billion in 2006.[18] The company generated a 25% return in 2007 and returns from their global macro fund continued to perform well during the financial crisis of 2008.[18]
In 2010, the company moved its headquarters from London to Geneva.[12] In July 2012, the firm opened an affiliate firm in New York called Brevan Howard U.S. Investment Management LP which had about $800 million in assets under management.[12] By 2013 the company had established Brevan Howard Capital Management LP on the island of Jersey.[19] As of June 2013 it was reported to be the largest European hedge fund management firm based on its total AUM.[5][19] An April 2013 article in the Financial News described the company as "the biggest and best-performing [hedge fund management] firm in Europe".[4] In 2015, The company reduced its workforce by about 10% due to reduced management assets and diminishing returns.[20] The fund had further losses in 2014 and 2015 and had only $14.5 billion in assets as of October 2016.[10] By 2016, the firm had reduced it's assets under management (AUM) from $41 billion spread across nine funds in 2013 to an $18 billion AUM spread over three funds.[10]
Investment funds history[edit]
In 2012, a founding partner, said the firm's overall strategy is focusing on "near-term opportunities" and establishing investment positions that are maintained for one to six months.[18]As a macro hedge fund, in 2013, the company aspires to profit as a result of "broad economic trends" and trades many types of assets including commodities and currencies.[19]
The firm set up 11 funds [21] including the Brevan Howard Master Fund (BHMF) 2003, Brevan Howard Multi-Strategy Master Fund Limited (BHMS) 2008, Brevan Howard Emerging Markets Strategies Master Fund Limited (BHEMS) 2007, Brevan Howard Credit Catalysts Master Fund Limited (BHCC) 2009, the Brevan Howard Asia Master Fund Limited (BHA) 2004,[5] the Brevan Howard Emerging Markets Local Fixed Income Fund (BHEML),[22] Brevan Howard Credit Catalysts Master Fund Limited ("BHCC"),[23] Brevan Howard Commodities Strategies Master Fund Limited ("BHCS"),[24] Brevan Howard Systematic Trading Master Fund Limited ("BHST"),[25] Brevan Howard Credit Value Master Fund Limited ("BHCV"),[26] Brevan Howard CMBS Master Fund Limited ("BHCMBS"),[27] Brevan Howard Investment Fund II - Macro FX Fund Limited ("BHMFX"),[28] The company also manages three closed-ended feeder funds, listed on the London Stock Exchange. They are: BH Global Limited (BHMG), BH Macro Limited (BHGG)[29] and Brevan Howard Credit Catalysts Limited (BHCC).[30]
Its flagship fund, the Brevan Howard Master Fund Ltd. was capped at $25 billion AUM and closed to new investors in 2012.[18] It had a $28 billion AUM as of October 2013 and was reported to be the 11th most popular hedge fund among institutional investors in the U.S.[9] As of 2013, the Master Fund had averaged a 12 percent annual gain since its inception in 2003.[9][19][31] After 10 years the fund reported its first annual loss of 0.8% in 2014. [32][33]
Corporate affairs[edit]
Brevan Howard describes itself as a "global alternative asset manager" and maintains offices in London, Geneva, St. Helier, Hong Kong, Tel Aviv, Washington and New York.[34] The company employs more than 430 people worldwide with 28 employees in its New York office[9] and more than 40 employees at its offices located on the island of Jersey.[15][18][35] Eighty of its employees are traders[21] that receive commissions equal to "11% to 17% of gains."[4] This segment of the employee base includes 15 traders who work at the company's Ramat Gan, Israel office[36] with 38 traders being added to the "global team" of employees in 2012.[4] According to one of the company's founding partner's, "high turnover is part of the business model" and traders are "cut" if they do not perform up to the company's standards for success.[13][18] According to one investment consultant, "It's a very mercenary [corporate] culture.” [5] Brevan Howard's standards for success in trading are so high that some traders who have been dismissed from Brevan Howard "have become stars at other firms."[13] Geraldine Sundstrom, joined the company in 2007 and was the portfolio manager for the Brevan Howard Emerging Markets Strategies Master Fund Limited.[9][37] Sundstrom left the company in 2014 when the fund she managed was shut down.[38]
The company operated offices in Singapore from 2007 to 2014.[2]
Brevan Howard has made a variety of philanthropic contributions to the Imperial College Business School (ICBS). The company donated £20.1m over eight years to fund a financial economics research centre.[39] As of 2013 the firm had donated £1.5m to ICBS's, Alan Howard Scholarships for Energy Futures.[39] In 2012, BrevanHoward pledged a £250,000 donation to the ARK Bentworth PrimaryAcademy.[40]
British finance professionals consider the company to be their first choice for employment.[41] The company is noted for hiring ex-investment bank traders and highly qualified quantitative analysts.[42]

History[edit]
Brevan Howard was co-founded in 2002 by former Credit Suisse traders Alan Howard,[3] Jean-Philippe Blochet, Chris Rokos, James Vernon, and Trifon Natsis.[4][11][12] The company name was created by utilizing portions of the last names of the co-founders.[13] Blochet took a "sabbatical" in 2008, returned and left the firm again in November 2009.[14] Vernon left his position as chief executive officer (CEO) in 2011 but returned to the company as group chief operating officer (COO) in September 2013.[15][16] Another co-founder, Rokos, retired from the company in 2012.[15][17] The company received $2 billion to manage in the global macro fund from Credit Suisse Private Bank. Under the leadership of Brevan Howard's founding partner, assets grew to $10.5 billion in 2006.[18] The company generated a 25% return in 2007 and returns from their global macro fund continued to perform well during the financial crisis of 2008.[18]
In 2010, the company moved its headquarters from London to Geneva.[12] In July 2012, the firm opened an affiliate firm in New York called Brevan Howard U.S. Investment Management LP which had about $800 million in assets under management.[12] By 2013 the company had established Brevan Howard Capital Management LP on the island of Jersey.[19] As of June 2013 it was reported to be the largest European hedge fund management firm based on its total AUM.[5][19] An April 2013 article in the Financial News described the company as "the biggest and best-performing [hedge fund management] firm in Europe".[4] In 2015, The company reduced its workforce by about 10% due to reduced management assets and diminishing returns.[20] The fund had further losses in 2014 and 2015 and had only $14.5 billion in assets as of October 2016.[10] By 2016, the firm had reduced it's assets under management (AUM) from $41 billion spread across nine funds in 2013 to an $18 billion AUM spread over three funds.[10]
Investment funds history[edit]
In 2012, a founding partner, said the firm's overall strategy is focusing on "near-term opportunities" and establishing investment positions that are maintained for one to six months.[18]As a macro hedge fund, in 2013, the company aspires to profit as a result of "broad economic trends" and trades many types of assets including commodities and currencies.[19]
The firm set up 11 funds [21] including the Brevan Howard Master Fund (BHMF) 2003, Brevan Howard Multi-Strategy Master Fund Limited (BHMS) 2008, Brevan Howard Emerging Markets Strategies Master Fund Limited (BHEMS) 2007, Brevan Howard Credit Catalysts Master Fund Limited (BHCC) 2009, the Brevan Howard Asia Master Fund Limited (BHA) 2004,[5] the Brevan Howard Emerging Markets Local Fixed Income Fund (BHEML),[22] Brevan Howard Credit Catalysts Master Fund Limited ("BHCC"),[23] Brevan Howard Commodities Strategies Master Fund Limited ("BHCS"),[24] Brevan Howard Systematic Trading Master Fund Limited ("BHST"),[25] Brevan Howard Credit Value Master Fund Limited ("BHCV"),[26] Brevan Howard CMBS Master Fund Limited ("BHCMBS"),[27] Brevan Howard Investment Fund II - Macro FX Fund Limited ("BHMFX"),[28] The company also manages three closed-ended feeder funds, listed on the London Stock Exchange. They are: BH Global Limited (BHMG), BH Macro Limited (BHGG)[29] and Brevan Howard Credit Catalysts Limited (BHCC).[30]
Its flagship fund, the Brevan Howard Master Fund Ltd. was capped at $25 billion AUM and closed to new investors in 2012.[18] It had a $28 billion AUM as of October 2013 and was reported to be the 11th most popular hedge fund among institutional investors in the U.S.[9] As of 2013, the Master Fund had averaged a 12 percent annual gain since its inception in 2003.[9][19][31] After 10 years the fund reported its first annual loss of 0.8% in 2014. [32][33]
Corporate affairs[edit]
Brevan Howard describes itself as a "global alternative asset manager" and maintains offices in London, Geneva, St. Helier, Hong Kong, Tel Aviv, Washington and New York.[34] The company employs more than 430 people worldwide with 28 employees in its New York office[9] and more than 40 employees at its offices located on the island of Jersey.[15][18][35] Eighty of its employees are traders[21] that receive commissions equal to "11% to 17% of gains."[4] This segment of the employee base includes 15 traders who work at the company's Ramat Gan, Israel office[36] with 38 traders being added to the "global team" of employees in 2012.[4] According to one of the company's founding partner's, "high turnover is part of the business model" and traders are "cut" if they do not perform up to the company's standards for success.[13][18] According to one investment consultant, "It's a very mercenary [corporate] culture.” [5] Brevan Howard's standards for success in trading are so high that some traders who have been dismissed from Brevan Howard "have become stars at other firms."[13] Geraldine Sundstrom, joined the company in 2007 and was the portfolio manager for the Brevan Howard Emerging Markets Strategies Master Fund Limited.[9][37] Sundstrom left the company in 2014 when the fund she managed was shut down.[38]
The company operated offices in Singapore from 2007 to 2014.[2]
Brevan Howard has made a variety of philanthropic contributions to the Imperial College Business School (ICBS). The company donated £20.1m over eight years to fund a financial economics research centre.[39] As of 2013 the firm had donated £1.5m to ICBS's, Alan Howard Scholarships for Energy Futures.[39] In 2012, BrevanHoward pledged a £250,000 donation to the ARK Bentworth PrimaryAcademy.[40]
British finance professionals consider the company to be their first choice for employment.[41] The company is noted for hiring ex-investment bank traders and highly qualified quantitative analysts.[42]

Special Alert: Now Available In Your Area!

Hi, my name is Ross Williams. Let me share a personal story with you. Back in 2007, I held an excellent position at a large IT company with a nice monthly salary. By 2008, the great recession hit. The company ran into financial problems and was forced to lay off over 50% of its staff. Unfortunately for me, I was included.
So there I was stranded, unemployed, with all the bills to pay and a family to support. Where I lived, such jobs weren't easy to come by.  So I decided to do a little research. I spent many sleepless nights on the web just searching for something to do, anything that could help support me and my family. I just wanted a way to make money, and not lose it, as I soon found to be the case with numerous internet scams.
Just like you, I often stumbled upon all types of web sites offering me some money matrix scheme, promising me all the money in the world. Yeah, right! From stuffing envelopes, Multi Level Marketing, High Yield Investment Programs, to selling all types of useless products. You name it, I've been there, done that. Finally, I came across something that worked... 


Online advertising has skyrocketed over the past few years. In 2015, companies spent close to $50 billion advertising online. That figure is expected to increase substantially in 2016. What does this mean for you? A lot more money could be going into your bank account this year. That's IF you take advantage of this secret system.
Companies worldwide are desperately searching for people just like you to type up their ads and post them online, and they'll pay you nicely in return. It's a win-win situation. They get more customers, you get paid. It's as simple as that. These companies have cash, LOTS of it and they're eager to share it with you. All types of individuals around the world are using this system to make more money than they ever could working in a boring, dead-end job. You can work part-time or full-time, it's all up to you.
All you need to get started is a computer with internet access. You'll be posting short text ads for companies and submitting them into various online forms. 
					No prior skills or work experience required, just basic 
					computer skills!








You submit the ads on your own schedule, day or night, and you do as many as you want with absolutely no restrictions. There will always be work for you to do no matter where you live.
This is a successful work at home program with unlimited potential. We'll show you 
					EXACTLY what you need to do to make money posting ads for companies online. It runs virtually on autopilot. Once your ads are submitted, they can be making money for you over and over. In other words, you don't have to be sitting in front of your computer all day just to make money. You can go play golf with your friends or go shopping at the mall with your family. It's totally up to you. That's the beauty of this system.
Members worldwide are accepted and
					you can start immediately. You will be provided with everything you  need to get started; including some sample info that you can just copy and paste into the forms, along  with our Complete Step-by-Step System.



Here's a screenshot from one of my accounts to prove this 
					system works. I make over $9,000 per 
					month! Now everyone won't start out making this kind of cash. This is a legitimate way to make a good income using your computer and the internet. Don't expect to make $1,000 per day.
