Ms. Bane is also a member of the board of directors of Southern Company Gas (formerly AGL Resources Inc.), an energy services company which is a subsidiary of Southern Company, where she chairs the Controls and Compliance Committee and serves on the Compensation and Executive Committees, and Transamerica Asset Management Group, a mutual fund company, where she serves on the Audit Committee. She was formerly a director of PETCO Animal Supplies, Inc. from 2004 to 2006. Additionally, Ms. Bane serves as a member of the board of directors for several nonprofit institutions in her community. She is also a member of the AICPA and the California Society of Certified Public Accountants. Age: 64. 
Ms. Bane brings many years of experience as an audit partner with KPMG with extensive financial accounting knowledge that is critical to our Board. We believe that Ms. Bane's experience with accounting principles, financial reporting rules and regulations, evaluating financial results and generally overseeing the financial reporting process of large public companies from an independent auditor's perspective and as a board member and audit committee member of other public companies makes her an invaluable asset to our Board.
