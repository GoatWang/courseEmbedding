Item 2.01
Disposition of Asset(s).

 

The
“Company” refers to British Cambridge, Inc.

 

On
September 2, 2016 at a meeting of our majority shareholders and

comprehensive rights to the Company’s online education
platform to British Cambridge College, including any propriety
code. British Cambridge College is considered a related party and
is in part owned by both our CEO Teodoro G. Bondoc Jr. and
President Hatadi Shapiro Supaat. The consideration British
Cambridge College paid for the platform to the Company was
$35,000.

 

During the
three month period ended June 30, 2016 British Cambridge College
paid us $35,000 in advance payments to be put toward the lease of
our online education platform. Because we have sold the online
education platform to them we have agreed that the advance payments
will be considered as the monetary consideration in the above
transaction. As a result there was no physical exchange of cash
regarding the above transaction.

 

The lease
agreement executed on August 1, 2016 between the two aforementioned
parties is now terminated.

 

 

The above
description of the material terms of the aforementioned agreement
is simply a summary and should be read in its entirety. It is
included herein as exhibit 10.1 of this Form 8-K.

 
 

Item 8.01
Other Events.

 

As
described below the nature of our business and operations have
changed. We have adopted a new businesses plan. As a result we have
included below a description of our new plan moving forward
including the industry we will operate in, and any applicable risk
factors that relate to our new course of business. It should be
noted that at this time all of our officers and directors will
remain in their respective positions with the Company.

 

Industry
Overview 

 

 

 

The global
consulting industry has a total value of around $250 billion and is
one of the most substantial markets within the larger professional
services industry. As the global economy fluctuates, so too does
the consulting industry. In any economy experiencing growth, higher
revenues and budgets, this creates a setting in which companies are
more willing to spend their revenue on consultation services. Of
course that also means that when countries experience and economic
downturn this alters their spending behavior and typically results
in cutting down on their consultation budgets.

 

Despite
the close link between the consulting industry and a
country’s economy, it is notable that between the 1970s up to
the 1990s the global consulting market grew every single year,
despite two recession periods. However, in 2002 and later between
2009 and 2011 the consultation industry contracted due to global
financial crises.

 

 

 
 


 

According
to http://www.consultancy.uk/consulting-industry/global the
consulting industry was valued at around $205 billion, and since
then the market has grown with an average Compound Annual Growth
Rate (CAGR) of 4.1% to a value of $251 billion in 2016. For many
years globalization, consolidation, developments in laws and
legislation, efficiency and technology have acted as the main
growth drivers of the global consulting industry. More recently,
digital and business model disruption has surfaced as the driving
factor behind growth, in particular in the more mature
markets.

 

Relevant
data regarding how many consulting firms offer comparable services,
I.E., assist in taking a Company public onto a recognized exchange,
are incredibly difficult to come by because the range of services
consultants offer can vary so broadly and can fluctuate on a case
by case basis. Many consultants tailor their services to each
individual client and thereby if going public is ideal for their
client then they will attempt to assist in that process. However,
in addition to general consulting there are certain subsections of
the industry which are noteworthy.

 

The five
main branches of the consulting industry are: strategy, operations,
financial advisory, human resources, and technology. Strategy
consulting, also termed boardroom consulting, focuses on ‘big
picture’ consultation services which are typically provided
to executives, members of the board of directors, etc. Operations
relates to the day to day running and operations of a company, and
human resources relates directly to its namesake. Financial
consulting is built on an analytic foundation and can cover a wide
range of topics relating to a company’s finances. Technology
consulting is increasingly important as technology continues to
evolve and industry professionals find their skills in higher
demand.

 

General
consulting can cover some of, or all, of the branches of
consultation and is rather difficult to quantify. While we believe
that our services can fit into several of the aforementioned
branches it may be more accurate to state that we provide general
consultation services. This puts us directly into competition with
tens of thousands of other companies, and as the industry continues
to evolve and grow the competition for the growing market share
will only become stronger.

 

 

Business
Plan 

 

 

We,
British Cambridge, Inc. have changed the nature of our business and
operations from marketing our online education platform
‘British Cambridge College’ to business consulting.
Specifically, we aim to provide small businesses with consulting
services relating to going public on the Over-the-Counter (OTC)
Marketplace, a United States Financial Listing Platform, and may
evaluate assisting companies to go public on other, as of this
time, unidentified exchanges. From time to time, upon request, we
may also assist our clients in becoming SEC Reporting via a Form
10, an S-1 Registration Statement or other comparable Registration
Statement.

 

We will
charge a flat fee for our business consulting services depending
upon the consulting service that is being requested. As of this
point in time, the fees we intend to charge prospective clients are
undecided, however they will likely be determined on a case by case
basis. The determination of our fees can vary based on a number of
factors including, but not limited to, the size of the
client’s Company, the amount of time each project is likely
to take, the difficulty inherent in every project, etc.

 

We will
not be offering our clients investment or legal advice, nor do we
anticipate that we will be conducting any SEC filings on behalf of
our clients. Our primary focus is on connecting our clients to
reputable service providers in the United States that can assist
our client’s in going public, becoming SEC Reporting, or
assisting with other related services. Upon connecting our clients
with these service providers we will oversee their operations in
order to ensure that they are carrying out their tasks in a
reasonable amount of time and providing work that lives up to our
standards.

 

We
anticipate that our services will extend to assisting our clients
by providing the communication link between their company and the
U.S. Service providers. As an example, we may provide services
relating to bettering our clients’ business plans and other
material necessary for a U.S. service provider in order to complete
their services.

 

Additionally,
we may offer advice and consultation to any of our clients who are
seeking to conduct mergers and acquisitions. As before, our
advisory and consultancy services should not be misconstrued as
providing legal or investment advice to our clients.

 

Going
forward we will use Company revenue and available cash to fund our
operations. We may also seek to acquire and maintain equity in some
of our clients’ companies seeking to go public on various
exchanges in lieu of full cash payments. Our initial focus will be
on businesses located in the Philippines, where our Company is
currently located, however we do have future unidentified plans to
expand into other areas in Asia. At this time we do not have a
definitive marketing plans.  We do however, have a website
that is in development which will showcase the services we will
offer to our clients. We believe that the website will be completed
in the next few months.

British Cambridge Institute (BCI) Enters into a Strategic Partnership with AIM Global Inc.





British Cambridge Institute



Business 

          Posted          6th June 2015.
        


June 5, 2015 – British Cambridge Institute (BCI), an internationally recognized curriculum provider and course developer in the Philippines, announced today its strategic partnership with Alliance in Motion (AIM) Global Inc., one of the top companies in the multi level marketing (MLM) industry in the country. This partnership program grants AIM Global the rights to use BCI Accredited Entrepreneurship and MLM Course Programs in the training and development of their global sales agents, distributors and sponsors.

Market for Entrepreneurship & MLM Programs in the Philippines
A recent study1 in Asia says that “small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) account for the largest share of Philippine entrepreneurs. SMEs, including micro-enterprises, account for 99% of all business establishments and 60% of the exporting firms in the Philippines. SMEs currently employ about 55% of the Philippine labor force and contribute 30% to total domestic volume sales.”
Network Marketing Businesses (also known as MLM) in the Philippines is a growing industry and it is not showing any sign of slowing down. The entrepreneurial mindset of many Filipinos, primarily drive by poverty, is what triggers them to engage in this kind of business. According to market analysts, many Filipinos tend to take the enticement of “high compensation plan” and “million-income-potential” and register to the Network Marketing company they are invited in2.
Among of the top Network Marketing Companies in the Philippines today are Unlimited Network of Opportunities (UNO), DXN International Private Ltd., AVON Products Inc., Forever Living Products Philippines, Inc. and AIM Global Inc2.
Market for Entrepreneurship & MLM Programs Across the World
The top Network Marketing Companies in terms of revenue are mostly based in the United States. In 2012, Amway earned a total sales revenue of US$11.3 billion, followed by Avon Products Inc. with US$10.7 billion, and Herbalife Ltd. with US$4.1 billion4.
Pola and Miki Corp. of Japan earned US$1.2 billion and US$1.1 billion, respectively4. AmorePacific and LG Household and Health Care, both from South Korea, recorded sales revenue of US$520 million and US$350 million, respectively4.
Majority of surveys and reports show that many of the companies that are making it on top of the global rankings are companies that are over 10 years in the MLM business and has more than US$200 million annual net sales. Remarkably, Amway is over 50 years in the industry.

behalf.  Regarding the sale of Mr. Supaat�s shares, they will be sold at a fixed price of $1.00 for the duration of
the offering however, if at such time our shares are quoted on the Over The Counter Marketplace �OTC� the selling stockholders,

directly into the Company�s account; any investor who purchases shares will have no assurance that any monies, beside
their own, will be subscribed to the prospectus. All proceeds from the sale of the securities are non-refundable, except as

The Company
�
British Cambridge, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (�the Company�) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 24, 2015.
�
The Company is an operating entity that
currently owns the comprehensive rights to an online platform herein to be referred to as �the platform� that is used
for the purposes of online education. It offers several key features with include, but are not limited to, the ability for students
to enroll in online classes, the ability to create an individual custom profile to interact with other students and faculty, and
the ability to review course material of enrolled courses.
�
Currently, we have only licensed the
use of this platform to British Cambridge College, Inc., a university located in the Philippines, however we intend to license
this platform to other universities in the future.

�
Our principal executive
office is located at Ground Floor, Unit D, Belvedere Tower San Miguel Avenue, Ortigas Center. Our
phone number is (+63) 2 650 6565
��
We believe we need to raise $40,000,000 to fully execute
our business plan over the next 12 months to increase our current level of operations. The funds raised in this offering, even
assuming we sell all the shares being offered herein, may be insufficient to carry out our intended expansion plans.
�
The expenses of this offering, including the preparation
of this prospectus and the filing of this registration statement, estimated at $65,000.00, are being paid for by the Company.

Our Offering
�
We have authorized capital stock consisting of 1,000,000,000
shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (�Common Stock�) and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.0001
par value per share (�Preferred Stock�). We have 241,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 3,000,000 shares of Preferred
Stock issued and outstanding.�Through this offering we will register a total of 76,000,000 shares. These shares represent
40,000,000 additional shares of common stock to be issued by us and 36,000,000 shares of common stock by our selling stockholders.
We may endeavor to sell all 40,000,000 shares of common stock after this registration becomes effective. Upon effectiveness of
this Registration Statement, the selling stockholders may also sell their own shares. The price at which we, the company, offer
these shares is at a fixed price of $1.00 per share for the duration of the offering. The selling stockholders will also sell shares
at a fixed price of $1.00 for the duration of the offering however, if at such time our shares are quoted on the Over The Counter
Marketplace �OTC� the selling stockholders may sell their shares at prevailing market prices or at privately negotiated
prices. There is no arrangement to address the possible effect of the offering on the price of the stock. We will receive all proceeds
from the sale of our common stock but we will not receive any proceeds from the selling stockholders.

�
*The primary offering on behalf of the company is
separate from the secondary offering of the selling stockholders in that the proceeds from the shares of stock sold by the
selling stockholder�s will go directly to them, not the company. The same idea applies if the company approaches or is approached
by investors who then subsequently decide to invest with the company. Those proceeds would then go to the company. Whomever the
investors decide to purchase the shares from will be the beneficiary of the proceeds. None of the proceeds from the selling stockholder�s
will be utilized or given to the company. Mr. Supaat will clarify for investors at the time of purchase whether the proceeds are
going to the company or directly to himself.
�
*Mr. Supaat will be able to sell his shares at any time during
the duration of this offering. Regarding the sale of Mr. Supaat�s shares, they will be sold at a fixed price of $1.00 for
the duration of the offering however, if at such time our shares are quoted on the Over The Counter Marketplace �OTC�
the selling stockholders, including Mr. Supaat, may sell their shares at prevailing market prices or at privately negotiated prices.
�
*Mr. Supaat will be selling shares of common stock on
behalf of the Company simultaneously to selling shares of his own personal stock from his own account. A conflict of interest may
arise between Mr. Supaat�s interest in selling shares for his own account and in selling shares on the Company�s behalf.
�
*We will notify investors by filing an information statement
that will be available for public viewing on the SEC Edgar Database of any such extension of the offering.

The Company is electing to not opt out of JOBS Act extended
accounting transition period. �This may make its financial statements more difficult to compare to other companies.
�
Pursuant to the JOBS Act of 2012, as an emerging growth
company the Company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period for any new or revised accounting standards that may
be issued by the PCAOB or the SEC. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that
when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an
emerging growth company, can adopt the standard for the private company. This may make comparison of the Company�s financial
statements with any other public company which is not either an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has
opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible as possible different or revised standards may be used.
�
Emerging Growth Company
�
The recently enacted JOBS Act is intended to reduce the regulatory
burden on emerging growth companies. The Company meets the definition of an emerging growth company and so long as it qualifies
as an �emerging growth company,� it will, among other things:



�
�

�
be temporarily exempted from the internal control audit requirements Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;

�
�

�
be temporarily exempted from various existing and forthcoming executive compensation-related disclosures, for example: �say-on-pay�, �pay-for-performance�, and �CEO pay ratio�;

�
�

�
be temporarily exempted from any rules that might �be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or supplemental auditor discussion and analysis reporting;

�
�

�
be temporarily exempted �from having to solicit advisory say-on-pay, say-on-frequency and say-on-golden-parachute shareholder votes on executive compensation under Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended;

�
�

�
be permitted to comply with the SEC�s detailed executive compensation disclosure requirements on the same basis as a smaller reporting company; and, 

�
�

�
be permitted to adopt any new or revised accounting standards using the same timeframe as private companies (if the standard applies to private companies).

�
Our company will continue to be an emerging growth company
until the earliest of:
�


�
�

�
the last day of the fiscal year during which we have annual total gross revenues of $1 billion or more; 

�
�

�
the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the first sale of our common equity securities in an offering registered under the Securities Act;

�
�

�
the date on which we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities during a previous three-year period; or

�
�

�
the date on which we become a large accelerated filer, which generally is a company with a public float of at least $700 million (Exchange Act Rule 12b-2).

��
MANAGEMENT�S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS
�
Our cash
balance is $ 0 as of September 30, 2015. After a twelve-month period we may need additional financing but currently do
not have any arrangements for such financing.
�

Long term financing beyond the
maximum aggregate amount of this offering will be required to fully implement our business plan. The exact amount of funding
will depend on funding required for full implementation of our business plan. Our expansion may include, but  is not limited
to, increasing staff, marketing efforts, and discovering potential candidates in the field of education whom we may be able
to acquire.

�
If we do not receive any proceeds from
the offering or the minimum amount of $40,000,000 that we require to operate for the next 12 months we may need to either reduce,
or allocate less funds to certain endeavors.

RISK
FACTORS
�
Please consider the following risk factors and other information
in this prospectus relating to our business before deciding to invest in our common stock.
�
This offering and any investment in our common stock involves
a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the information contained in this prospectus
before deciding whether to purchase our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition
and results of operations could be harmed. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you
may lose all or part of your investment.
�
We consider the following to be the material risks for an
investor regarding this offering. Our company should be viewed as a high-risk investment and speculative in nature. An investment
in our common stock may result in a complete loss of the invested amount.
�
An investment in our common stock is
highly speculative, and should only be made by persons who can afford to lose their entire investment in us. You should carefully
consider the following risk factors and other information in this report before deciding to become a holder of our common stock.
If any of the following risks actually occur, our business and financial results could be negatively affected to a significant
extent.
�

Risks Relating to Our Company and
Our Industry
�

Technology is constantly undergoing significant changes and evolutions
and it is imperative that we keep up with an ever changing technological landscape in order to ensure the continued use and viability
of our software.
�
Our industry is categorized by rapid technological progression and
ever increasing innovation. While we believe ourselves to currently offer the best program to suit the unique needs of our customers
we will need to constantly work on improving our current assets in order to keep up with technological advances that will almost
certainly occur. Should we fail to do so our business may be adversely affected and in the worst possible scenario we may have
to cease operations altogether if we do not adapt at the conclusion of the contracts we will have in place shortly.
�
Strong competition in the
education market, especially in the online education market, could decrease our market share.
The education industry is
highly competitive. We compete with various institutes, traditional colleges and universities who may offer similar online platforms
to our own. In addition, some of our competitors, including both traditional colleges and universities, may have substantially
greater name recognition and financial and other resources than we have, which may enable them to compete more effectively for
potential learners and decrease our market share. We also expect to face increased competition as a result of new entrants to
the online education market, including established colleges and universities that had not previously offered online education
programs. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and may face competitive pressures
that could adversely affect our business or results of operations.
- 8 -�

Table of Contents


�
We operate in a highly competitive market with rapid
technological change, and we may not have the resources needed to compete successfully.
�
Online education is a highly competitive market that is characterized
by rapid changes in our learners� technological requirements and expectations and evolving market standards. Competitors
vary in size and organization from traditional colleges and universities, corporate universities and software companies providing
online education and training software. Each of these competitors may develop platforms or other technologies that are superior
to the platform and technology we use. We may not have the resources necessary to acquire or compete with technologies being developed
by our competitors, which may render our online delivery format less competitive or obsolete.
��
Our current success and future growth depend on the continued
acceptance of the Internet and the corresponding growth in users seeking educational services on the Internet.
�
Our business, to a large extent, relies on the Internet for
its success. A number of factors could inhibit the continued acceptance of the Internet and adversely affect our profitability,
including:
�
	� 	Inadequate Internet infrastructure;�
	� 	Security and privacy concerns; and
	� 	The unavailability of cost-effective Internet
service and other technological factors.
�
If Internet use decreases, or if the number of Internet users
seeking educational services on the Internet does not increase, our business may not grow as planned.
�
Government regulations relating to the Internet could
increase our cost of doing business, affect our ability to grow or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.
�
The increasing popularity and use of the Internet and other
online services has led, and may lead, to the adoption of new laws and regulatory practices in the United States or foreign countries
and to new interpretations of existing laws and regulations. These new laws and interpretations may relate to issues such as online
privacy, copyrights, trademarks and service marks, sales taxes, fair business practices and the requirement that online education
institutions qualify to do business as foreign corporations or be licensed in one or more jurisdictions where they have no physical
location or other presence. New laws, regulations or interpretations related to doing business over the Internet could increase
our costs and materially and adversely affect our enrollments, revenues and results of operations.

Table of Contents

�
Our success depends substantially on the continuing efforts
of our senior executives and other key personnel, and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose their services. 
�
Our future success heavily depends upon the continued services
of our senior executives and other key employees. If one or more of our senior executives or key employees are unable or unwilling
to continue in their present positions, it could disrupt our business operations, and we may not be able to replace them easily
or at all. In addition, competition for senior executives and key personnel in our industry is intense, and we may be unable to
retain our senior executives and key personnel or attract and retain new senior executives and key personnel in the future, in
which case our business may be severely disrupted.
�
Our online platform generates
and processes a large amount of data, and the improper use or disclosure of such data could harm our reputation as well as have
a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.
Our online platform generates
and processes a large quantity of transactions, demographic and behavioral data. We face risks inherent in handling large volumes
of data and in protecting the security of such data. This includes protecting the data in and hosted on our system, including against
attacks on our system by outside parties or fraudulent behavior by our employees; addressing concerns related to privacy and sharing,
safety, security and other factors; and complying with applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to the collection, use,
disclosure or security of personal information, including any requests from regulatory and government authorities relating to such
data.
While we are not
personally responsible for the information generated by British Cambridge College, Inc. (the institute who currently leases
our online platform) any improper use of our online platform by British Cambridge College would still materially affect our
brand image. Any systems failure or security breach or lapse that results in the release of user data could harm our
reputation and brand and, consequently, our business, in addition to exposing us to potential legal liability.
As we expand our
operations, the laws, rules and regulations of other jurisdictions may impose more stringent or conflicting requirements and
penalties than those in the Philippines (in which our current sole client British Cambridge College, Inc. is located),
compliance with which could require significant resources and costs. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with
our posted privacy policies or with any regulatory requirements or privacy protection-related laws, rules and regulations
could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. These proceedings or actions may
subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase our costs
and severely disrupt our business.
We operate in a competitive
environment, and if we are unable to compete with our competitors, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash
flows and prospects could be materially adversely affected.
Education, both standard learning methods and E-learning,
are a highly competitive industry, and we face competition from numerous companies that offer similar services to our own. If we
are not able to compete effectively with our competitors, we may not be able to attract new business or retain any business we
do acquire in the future. It is imperative that we make every attempt to remain at the forefront of our industry and offer high
quality service to ensure that we remain viable going into the future. A competitive environment could materially adversely affect
our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
The success of our business
depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our reputation and brand.
We believe that our reputation
in the Education industry is of significant importance to the success of our business. A well-recognized brand is critical to increasing
our customer base and, in turn, increasing our revenue. Since the education industry is highly competitive, our ability to remain
competitive depends to a large extent on our ability to maintain and enhance our reputation and brand, which could be difficult
and expensive. To maintain and enhance our reputation and brand, we need to successfully manage many aspects of our business, such
as cost-effective marketing campaigns to increase brand recognition and awareness in a highly competitive market;�our ability
to deliver our online platform and to ensure that it is seen as continually valuable within the education industry.
We will continue to conduct
various marketing and brand promotion activities. We cannot assure you, however, that these activities will be successful and achieve
the brand promotion goals we expect. If we fail to maintain and enhance our reputation and brand, or if we incur excessive expenses
in our efforts to do so, our business, financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our internal controls may be inadequate, which
could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation being disseminated to the public.
Our management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. As defined in Exchange
Act Rule 13a-15(f), internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal
executive and principal financial officer and effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: pertain to the maintenance
of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and/or directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Our internal
controls may be inadequate or ineffective, which could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation
being disseminated to the public. Investors relying upon this misinformation may make an uninformed investment decision. If we
cannot provide reliable financial reports, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence
in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock, if a market ever develops, could drop significantly
and result in a loss of some or all of your investment.
We expect
our quarterly financial results to fluctuate. 
We expect our net sales and operating
results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, including changes in:
�
� General Economic Conditions;
� The number of institutions
and businesses utilizing our online platform;
� Our ability to retain,
grow our business and attract new clients;
� Administrative Costs;
� Advertising and other
marketing costs;
�
As a result of the variability of these and other factors,
our operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors.
Our current President and Chairman
of our Board of Directors, Hatadi Shapiro Supaat, beneficially owns approximately or has the right to vote on 92.42% of our outstanding
common stock. In addition, Hatadi Shapiro Supaat beneficially owns or has the right to vote on an additional 3,000,000 shares of
outstanding preferred stock As a result, he has a substantial voting power in all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval
including:
�
� Election of our board
of directors;
� Removal of any of our
directors;
� Amendment of our Certificate
of Incorporation or bylaws;
� Adoption of measures
that could delay or prevent a change in control or impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us.
�
As a result of his ownership and position,
he is able to substantially influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval
of significant corporate transactions. In addition, the future prospect of sales of significant amounts of shares held by Mr. Supaat
could affect the market price of our common stock if the marketplace does not orderly adjust to the increase in shares in the market
and the value of your investment in our company may decrease. Mr. Supaat�s stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer
from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent
our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.
�
Our future success is dependent,
in part, on the performance and continued service of Hatadi Shapiro Supaat, our President and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
Without his continued service, we may be forced to interrupt or eventually cease our operations.
�
We are presently dependent to a great
extent upon the experience, abilities and continued services of Hatadi Shapiro Supaat, our President and Chairman of our Board
of Directors. The loss of his services would delay our business operations substantially.

The recently enacted JOBS Act will
allow the Company to postpone the date by which it must comply with certain laws and regulations intended to protect investors
and to reduce the amount of information provided in reports filed with the SEC.
�
The recently enacted JOBS Act is intended
to reduce the regulatory burden on �emerging growth companies�. The Company meets the definition of an �emerging
growth company� and so long as it qualifies as an �emerging growth company,� it will, among other things:
�
-be exempt from the provisions of Section
404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that its independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report
on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting;
�
-be exempt from the "say on pay�
provisions (requiring a non-binding shareholder vote to approve compensation of certain executive officers) and the "say on
golden parachute� provisions (requiring a non-binding shareholder vote to approve golden parachute arrangements for certain
executive officers in connection with mergers and certain other business combinations) of The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act (the �Dodd-Frank Act�) and certain disclosure requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act relating to
compensation of Chief Executive Officers;
�
-be permitted to omit the detailed compensation
discussion and analysis from proxy statements and reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the �Exchange
Act�) and instead provide a reduced level of disclosure concerning executive compensation; and
�
-be exempt from any rules that may be
adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the �PCAOB�) requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a
supplement to the auditor�s report on the financial statements.
�
Although the Company is still evaluating
the JOBS Act, it currently intends to take advantage of all of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that will be available
to it so long as it qualifies as an �emerging growth company�. The Company has elected not to opt out of the extension
of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards available under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. Among other
things, this means that the Company's independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to provide an attestation
report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting so long as it qualifies as an �emerging
growth company�, which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in the internal control over financial reporting
go undetected. Likewise, so long as it qualifies as an �emerging growth company�, the Company may elect not to provide
certain information, including certain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of executive officers,
which would otherwise have been required to provide in filings with the SEC, which may make it more difficult for investors and
securities analysts to evaluate the Company. As a result, investor confidence in the Company and the market price of its common
stock may be adversely affected.
�
Notwithstanding the above, we are also
currently a �smaller reporting company�, meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or
a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a public float of less than $75
million and annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. In the event that we are
still considered a �smaller reporting company�, at such time are we cease being an �emerging growth company�,
the disclosure we will be required to provide in our SEC filings will increase, but will still be less than it would be if we
were not considered either an �emerging growth company� or a �smaller reporting company�. Specifically,
similar to �emerging growth companies�, �smaller reporting companies� are able to provide simplified executive
compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring
that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things,
being required to provide only two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings
due to our status as an �emerging growth company� or �smaller reporting company� may make it harder for
investors to analyze the Company�s results of operations and financial prospects.
�
We are an �emerging growth
company� under the JOBS Act of 2012, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging
growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.
�
We are an �emerging growth company,�
as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable
to other public companies that are not �emerging growth companies� including, but not limited to, not being required
to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding
executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding
advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot
predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find
our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price
may be more volatile.
�
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS
Act also provides that an �emerging growth company� can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in
Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an �emerging
growth company� can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private
companies. We are choosing to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates.
�
We will remain an �emerging growth
company� for up to five years, although we will lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed $1 billion, if we issue more
than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three year period, or if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates
exceeds $700 million.
�
As we are a publicly reporting company,
we will continue to incur significant costs in staying current with reporting requirements. Our management will be required to
devote substantial time to compliance initiatives. Additionally, the lack of an internal audit group may result in material misstatements
to our financial statements and ability to provide accurate financial information to our shareholders.
�
Our management and other personnel will
need to devote a substantial amount of time to compliance initiatives to maintain reporting status. Moreover, these rules and regulations,
which are necessary to remain as an SEC reporting Company, will be costly as an external third party consultant(s), attorney, or
firm, may have to assist in some regard to following the applicable rules and regulations for each filing on behalf of the company.
�
We currently do not have an internal
audit group, and we will eventually need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience
and technical accounting knowledge to have effective internal controls for financial reporting. Additionally, due to the fact that
our officers and Director, have limited experience as an officer or Director of a reporting company, such lack of experience may
impair our ability to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, which
may result in material misstatements to our financial statements and an inability to provide accurate financial information to
our stockholders.
�
Moreover, if we are not able to comply
with the requirements or regulations as an SEC reporting company, in any regard, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations
by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.

Our Officers and Directors lack experience in and with
the reporting and disclosure obligations of publicly-traded companies.
�
Our Officers and Directors lack experience
in and with the reporting and disclosure obligations of publicly-traded companies and with serving as an Officer and or Director
of a publicly-traded company. Such lack of experience may impair our ability to maintain effective internal controls over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, which may result in material misstatements to our financial statements and an
inability to provide accurate financial information to our stockholders. Consequently, our operations, future earnings and ultimate
financial success could suffer irreparable harm due to our Officers� and Director�s ultimate lack of experience in
our industry and with publicly-traded companies and their reporting requirements in general.
�
Risks
Relating to the Company�s Securities
�
We may never have a public market
for our common stock or may never trade on a recognized exchange. Therefore, you may be unable to liquidate your investment in
our stock. 
�
There is no established public trading
market for our securities. Our shares are not and have not been listed or quoted on any exchange or quotation system.
�
In order for our shares to be quoted,
a market maker must agree to file the necessary documents with the National Association of Securities Dealers, which operates the
OTCQB. In addition, it is possible that such application for quotation may not be approved and even if approved it is possible
that a regular trading market will not develop or that if it did develop, will be sustained. In the absence of a trading market,
an investor may be unable to liquidate their investment.
�
We may in the future issue additional
shares of our common stock, which may have a dilutive effect on our stockholders.
�
Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes
the issuance of 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 241,000,000 shares are issued and outstanding as of November 12,
2015. The future issuance of our common shares may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common shares held by
our then existing stockholders. We may value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis. The issuance of common
stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held
by our investors, and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock.
�
We may issue shares of preferred
stock in the future that may adversely impact your rights as holders of our common stock.
�
Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes
us to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Accordingly, our board of directors will have the authority to fix and
determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred shares, as well as the authority to issue such shares, without further
stockholder approval. Currently, each one (1) share of Preferred Stock shall have voting rights held at all stockholders�
meetings for all purposes, including election of directors equal to one hundred (100) shares of common stock.
�
Our preferred Stock does not have any
dividend, conversion, liquidation, or other rights or preferences, including redemption or sinking fund provisions. However, our
board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders preferred rights to
our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividends before dividends are declared to holders of our common stock, and the
right to the redemption of such preferred shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of the common stock. To the
extent that we do issue such additional shares of preferred stock, your rights as holders of common stock could be impaired thereby,
including, without limitation, dilution of your ownership interests in us. In addition, shares of preferred stock could be issued
with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control or make removal of management more difficult, which may not be in
your interest as holders of common stock.
�

We do not currently intend to pay
dividends on our common stock and consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation
in the price of our common stock. 
�
We have never declared or paid any cash
dividends on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our
future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the
foreseeable future and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its
value. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders
have purchased their shares.

We may be exposed to potential risks
resulting from requirements under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
�
As a reporting company we are required,
pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, to include in our annual report our assessment of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting. We do not have a sufficient number of employees to segregate responsibilities
and may be unable to afford increasing our staff or engaging outside consultants or professionals to overcome our lack of employees.
�
We do not currently have independent
audit or compensation committees. As a result, our directors have the ability, among other things, to determine their own level
of compensation. Until we comply with such corporate governance measures, regardless of whether such compliance is required, the
absence of such standards of corporate governance may leave our stockholders without protections against interested director transactions,
conflicts of interest and similar matters and investors may be reluctant to provide us with funds necessary to expand our operations.
�
The costs to meet our reporting and
other requirements as a public company subject to the Exchange Act of 1934 is and will be substantial and may result in us having
insufficient funds to expand our business or even to meet routine business obligations.
�
As a public entity, subject to the reporting
requirements of the Exchange Act of 1934, we will continue to incur ongoing expenses associated with professional fees for accounting,
legal and a host of other expenses for annual reports and proxy statements. We estimate that these costs will range up to $35,000
per year for the next few years and will be higher if our business volume and activity increases. As a result, we may not have
sufficient funds to grow our operations.
�
State Securities Laws may limit secondary
trading, which may restrict the states in which and conditions under which you can sell Shares.
�
Secondary trading in our common stock
may not be possible in any state until the common stock is qualified for sale under the applicable securities laws of the state
or there is confirmation that an exemption, such as listing in certain recognized securities manuals, is available for secondary
trading in the state. If we fail to register or qualify, or to obtain or verify an exemption for the secondary trading of, the
common stock in any particular state, the common stock cannot be offered or sold to, or purchased by, a resident of that state.
In the event that a significant number of states refuse to permit secondary trading in our common stock, the liquidity for the
common stock could be significantly impacted.

Risks
Relating to this Offering
�
Investors
cannot withdraw funds once invested and will not receive a refund.
�
Investors
do not have the right to withdraw invested funds. Subscription payments will be paid to British Cambridge, Inc. and held in our
corporate bank account if the Subscription Agreements are in good order and the Company accepts the investor�s investment.
Therefore, once an investment is made, investors will not have the use or right to return of such funds.

�
Hatadi
Shapiro Supaat will be able to sell his shares at any time during the duration of this offering. This may pose a conflict of interest
since he is also selling shares on behalf of the company in this offering. It is possible that this conflict of interest could
affect the ultimate amount of funds raised by the Company. This could negatively affect your investment.
�
As previously mentioned Mr. Supaat is going to be selling
shares on behalf of the Company in this offering. Mr. Supaat is also simultaneously having his shares registered for resale. This
conflict of interest could divert Mr. Supaat�s time and attention in selling shares on behalf of the Company since he will
also be able to sell his own shares. Several factors that could result are less monies raised by the company, and less desire to
purchase shares by investors to name a few negative consequences. Because of this your investment could be adversely affected.

Our
President and Chairman of our Board of Directors, Hatadi Shapiro Supaat does not have any prior experience conducting a best effort
offering, and our best effort offering does not require a minimum amount to be raised. As a result, we may not be able to raise
enough funds to commence and sustain our business and our investors may lose their entire investment.
�
Mr. Supaat
does not have any experience conducting a best-efforts offering. Consequently, we may not be able to raise the funds needed to
commence business operations. Also, the best efforts offering does not require a minimum amount to be raised. If we are not able
to raise sufficient funds, we may not be able to fund our operations as planned, and our business will suffer and your investment
may be materially adversely affected. Our inability to successfully conduct a best-efforts offering could be the basis of your
losing your entire investment in us.
�
The
trading in our shares will be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15G-9 which established the definition of
a �Penny Stock.�
�
The
shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the �Exchange
Act�), and rules of the Commission. The Exchange Act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice
and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are,
generally, institutions with assets in excess of $4,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income
exceeding $200,000 ($300,000 jointly with spouse), or in transactions not recommended by the broker-dealer. For transactions covered
by the penny stock rules, a broker dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions, including the actual
sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations, the compensation to be received by the broker-dealer and certain associated
persons, and must deliver certain disclosures required by the Commission. Consequently, the penny stock rules may make it difficult
for you to resell any shares you may purchase.
�
We
are selling the shares of this offering without an underwriter and may be unable to sell any shares.
�
This
offering is self-underwritten, that is, we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares; we intend
to sell our shares through our President and Chairman of our Board of Directors Hatadi Shapiro Supaat, who will receive no commissions.
There is no guarantee that he will be able to sell any of the shares. Unless he is successful in selling all of the shares of our
Company�s offering, we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our business plan.
�
Due
to the lack of a trading market for our securities, you may have difficulty selling any shares you purchase in this offering.
�
We
are not registered on any market or public stock exchange. There is presently no demand for our common stock and no public market
exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the completion
of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the OTCQB. The OTCQB is a regulated quotation service that display real-time
quotes, last sale prices and volume information in over-the-counter securities. The OTCQB is not an issuer listing service, market
or exchange. Although the OTCQB does not have any listing requirements per se, to be eligible for quotation on the OTCQB, issuers
must remain current in their filings with the SEC or applicable regulatory authority. If we are not able to pay the expenses associated
with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTCQB. Market makers are not permitted to begin
quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement. Securities already quoted on the OTCQB that become
delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a 30 to 60 day grace period if they do not make their required filing
during that time. We cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale.
As of the date of this filing, there have been no discussions or understandings between the Company and anyone acting on our behalf,
with any market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for our securities. If no market is ever developed for
our common stock, it will be difficult for you to sell any shares you purchase in this offering. In such a case, you may find that
you are unable to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay, if at all. In addition,
if we fail to have our common stock quoted on a public trading market, your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and
it may be difficult, if not impossible, to ever resell your shares, resulting in an inability to realize any value from your investment.
�
We
will incur ongoing costs and expenses for SEC reporting and compliance. Without revenue we may not be able to remain in compliance,
making it difficult for investors to sell their shares, if at all.�
�
The
estimated cost of this registration statement is $65,000. After the effective date of this prospectus, we will be required to
file annual, quarterly and current reports, or other information with the SEC as provided by the Securities Exchange Act. We plan
to contact a market maker immediately following the close of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the OTCQB. To
be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC. In order for us to remain in compliance
we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings, which could comprise a substantial portion of our available
cash resources. The costs associated with being a publicly traded company in the next 12 months will be approximately $35,000.
If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you
may purchase, if at all. Also, if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be
able to apply for quotation on the OTCQB.

The Industry

�
The field
of education is immense, competitive and categorized by rapid change and innovation. Higher learning, in particular among
colleges and universities worldwide, has become increasingly competitive as more and more educational institutions crop up to
take advantage of this large and consistent market. The education industry has evolved from its roots in the traditional
setting of on-location education with the emergence and increasing popularity of the internet. E-learning is an increasingly
popular option among the youth, and even adult learners, of today and shows no signs of slowing down with more and more
individuals opting to take their education online now than ever before.
The emergence of online learning has helped the
education  industry expand its reach among students not just in developed countries, but in developing countries alike, due
to advances in technology and a greater accessibility to the internet. However, there are still students interested
in learning from countries that do not, as of yet, have stable internet access and to cater to these individuals the more
traditional methods of learning are more appropriate.
Currently, the
worldwide higher education industry is a 1.5 trillion dollar industry with the e-learning industry poised to reach 107
billion dollars by the end of 2015.
As
technology advances so does e-learning, or in other words �the online learning platform�. Today, online learning
platforms now make it possible to keep costs of tuition down considerably and expenses of higher learning institutions at new
record lows. The reasoning is simple and rests on the fact that most of the material is nonphysical and not in print form. A
student can now attend a class from the comfort of their home rather than attending a classroom; they can can also view most
of their study materials online and interact with students through online messaging boards and/or discussion boards. This
innovation has made it financially feasible for individuals in lower income brackets to have the same education as those who
come from a more wealthy country or community.
This is not to
say, however, that students will not continue to seek their education  in a classroom setting, but rather that education is
now becoming more readily available to students of a wider range of social classes, and  more diverse parts of the world,
where the classroom setting might not have been a possibility or even available.

Upon clicking on
�my profile� a student or faculty member will be able to add a profile picture and general information on
themselves including any relevant contact information. Notably, students are able to search, sign up, and pay
for their program of study through clicking on the side tab titled �coupons.� Once a program, or
�major�, has been selected and paid for the purchase, or purchases, can be viewed by clicking the tab �my
orders.� For a quicker search the platform  allows students to search particular programs  by entering an
assigned identification number into the search box  that appears on the screen by clicking on the side
tab titled �classrooms.�  The current platform accepts both credit cards and debit cards.
�
After a program study, referred to
herein as a �coupon� study, is selected and paid for a student will be able to click on the �my
courses� tab which will display the courses necessary to complete the program the student has enrolled in. The student
will then be able to begin reviewing a description of each specific course they must complete to finish the entire program of
study they signed up for. Once a student finishes reading the description of a class they will be prompted to begin reviewing
course material, or in other words begin taking the class. Students do not have a specific time frame in which the platform
requires they complete the coursework. They are able to review and complete their courses at their leisure and can simply
pick up from the last spot they left off.


�
It should be noted that for faculty
the �my courses�  allows them to track enrolled students� progress, quiz results, and other
related material.

our intent to forge additional lease agreements in the future. Any courses that the students, or other registered members of
the site, are using through the platform should not be attributed to the platform itself, but rather to the universities, or
other institutions, who have the ownership rights to said courses. However,  the platform  allows for colleges and
universities to upload both textual content and actual quizzes, which can be timed.


The below images display an
example of the aforementioned features.

In addition to the previously disclosed features the platform also
offers students the ability to interact with other  learners in their program of study, most notably by posting questions
and discussion topics in the forums. Another feature that is notable is that students can upload written assignments such
as essays or other comparable documents to their assigned faculty member for review. The previous information we have
disclosed encompasses the bulk of the online platform, but there are a few more small features which can be found when an
individual logs on to the platform itself.
Future Plans�
Our future plans following this offering include
increasing staff, launching our unidentified marketing plan, and searching for suitable acquisition candidates.
�
The first three months of our operations following
this offering will centralized on discovering suitable employees who have the marketing background to put together a
marketing campaign on our behalf. Methods they may employ include, but are not limited to, utilizing social media
platforms to promote our business, t.v. commercials, print media such as magazines, and online advertising.
�
For the next twelve months as we continuously look
to increase our client base we will focus on making acquisitions of unidentified entities in the field of education. We
feel that it would benefit us, and our Company�s valuation, if we were able to grow through increasing our areas of
business relating to education, and also by creating a greater market share. We have not yet identified any potential
acquisition candidates nor are we sure of  the cost they may impose upon us to take over. We estimate that we
will allocate $15,000,000 to this endeavor.
�
In order to house our future employees within the
first three months following this offering we anticipate that we will purchase or rent a physical facility. If funds allow us
to do so we will purchase a headquarters. The cost of such a space will most likely be $1,500,000-$6,000,000 depending on the
level of funds we receive, how many locations we will purchase and whether or not we will, at this juncture, acquire a headquarters.
�
The remainder of the funds we raise will be used
for working capital of the Company and will go to further developing our existing platform, and potentially designing other
add on�s that we feel it may benefit from. 
�



Employees
�

As of November 12, 2015 we have
  ten part time employees, of which seven are our Officers and Directors.
�
Currently, our employees
all have the flexibility to work on our business up to 25 to 30 hours per week, but are prepared to devote more time if necessary.
�
We do not presently have pension, health, annuity, insurance,
stock options, profit sharing, or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt plans in the future. There are presently no personal
benefits available to our officers/or directors and or employees.

�
DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE
�
Since our shares are not listed or quoted
on any exchange or quotation system, the offering price of the shares of common stock was arbitrarily determined. The offering
price was determined by us and is based on our own assessment of our financial condition and prospects, limited offering history,
and the general condition of the securities market. It does not necessarily bear any relationship to our book value, assets, past
operating results, financial condition or any other established criteria of value. Although our common stock is not listed on a
public exchange, we will be filing to obtain a listing on the OTCQB concurrently with the filing of this prospectus. In order to
be quoted on the OTCQB, a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock.
�
There is no assurance that our common
stock will trade at market prices in excess of the initial public offering price as prices for the common stock in any public market
which may develop will be determined in the marketplace and may be influenced by many factors, including the depth and liquidity
of the market for the common stock, investor perception of us and general economic and market conditions.�

DILUTION
�

The price of the current offering is fixed at $1.00 per
share. This price is significantly higher than the price paid by the Company�s officers and directors which was $0.00 as
the shares were issued solely for services rendered to developing the Company�s business plan.

Dilution represents the difference between
the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering. Net tangible book value
is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and intangible assets from total assets. Dilution arises mainly as
a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of the shares being offered. Dilution of the value of the shares
you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders. The following tables compare
the differences of your investment in our shares with the investment of our existing stockholders.

PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
�
The Company has 241,000,000 shares
of common stock issued and outstanding as of the date of this prospectus. The Company is registering an additional 40,000,000 shares
of its common stock for sale at the price of $1.00 per share.
�
There is no arrangement to address the
possible effect of the offering on the price of the stock.
�
In connection with the Company�s
selling efforts in the offering, Hatadi Shapiro Supaat will not register as a broker-dealer pursuant to Section 15 of the Exchange
Act, but rather will rely upon the �safe harbor� provisions of SEC Rule 3a4-1, promulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the �Exchange Act�).
�
Generally speaking, Rule 3a4-1 provides
an exemption from the broker-dealer registration requirements of the Exchange Act for persons associated with an issuer that participate
in an offering of the issuer�s securities. Hatadi Shapiro Supaat is not subject to any statutory disqualification, as that
term is defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act. Hatadi Shapiro Supaat will not be compensated in connection with her participation
in the offering by the payment of commissions or other remuneration based either directly or indirectly on transactions in our
securities. Mr. Supaat is not, nor has he been within the past 12 months, a broker or dealer, and he is not, nor has he been within
the past 12 months, an associated person of a broker or dealer. At the end of the offering, Mr. Supaat will continue to primarily
perform substantial duties for the Company or on its behalf otherwise than in connection with transactions in securities. Hatadi
Shapiro Supaat will not participate in selling an offering of securities for any issuer more than once every 12 months other than
in reliance on Exchange Act Rule 3a4-1(a)(4)(i) or (iii).
�
The Company will receive all proceeds
from the sale of the 40,000,000 shares being offered on behalf of the company itself. The price per share is fixed at $1.00 for
the duration of this offering. Although our common stock is not listed on a public exchange or quoted over-the counter, we intend
to seek to have our shares of common stock quoted on the OTC Marketplace. In order to be quoted on the OTC Marketplace a market
maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock. There can be no assurance that a market
maker will agree to file the necessary documents with FINRA, nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation
will be approved. However, sales by the Company must be made at the fixed price of $1.00 until a market develops for the stock.
The Company�s shares may be sold to purchasers from time to time directly by and subject to the discretion of the Company.
Further, the Company will not offer its shares for sale through underwriters, dealers, agents or anyone who may receive compensation
in the form of underwriting discounts, concessions or commissions from the Company and/or the purchasers of the shares for whom
they may act as agents. The shares of common stock sold by the Company may be occasionally sold in one or more transactions; all
shares sold under this prospectus will be sold at a fixed price of $1.00 per share.

�
In order to comply with the applicable
securities laws of certain states, the securities will be offered or sold in those states only if they have been registered or
qualified for sale; an exemption from such registration or if qualification requirement is available and with which the Company
has complied.
�
In addition and without limiting the
foregoing, the Company will be subject to applicable provisions, rules and regulations under the Exchange Act with regard to security
transactions during the period of time when this Registration Statement is effective.
�
The Company�s Officers and
Directors will pay all expenses incidental to the registration of the shares (including registration pursuant to the
securities laws of certain states), which we expect to be no more than $65,000.
�
Procedures for Subscribing
If you decide to subscribe for any shares
in this offering, you must
�
- Execute and deliver a subscription
agreement; and
- Deliver a check or certified
funds to us for acceptance or rejection.
�
All checks for subscriptions must be
made payable to �British Cambridge, Inc.�. The Company will deliver stock certificates attributable to shares of common
stock purchased directly to the purchasers within ninety (90) days of the close of the offering.
�
Right to Reject Subscriptions
We have the right to accept or reject
subscriptions in whole or in part, for any reason or for no reason. All monies from rejected subscriptions will be returned immediately
by us to the subscriber, without interest or deductions. Subscriptions for securities will be accepted or rejected with letter
by mail within 48 hours after we receive them.

DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES
�
We
have authorized capital stock consisting of 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (�Common Stock�)
and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.0001 par value per share (�Preferred Stock�). As of the date of this
filing we have 241,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 3,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding.
�
Common Stock
�
The
holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive dividends out of assets or funds legally available for the
payment of dividends of such times and in such amounts as the board from time to time may determine. Holders of Common Stock are
entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders. There is no cumulative voting of the
election of directors then standing for election. The Common Stock is not entitled to pre-emptive rights and is not subject to
conversion or redemption. Upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, the assets legally available for distribution
to stockholders are distributable ratably among the holders of the Common Stock after payment of liquidation preferences, if any,
on any outstanding payment of other claims of creditors. 
�
Preferred Stock

�
Each
one (1) share of Preferred Stock shall have voting rights held at all stockholders� meetings for all
purposes, including election of directors equal to one hundred (100) shares of Common Stock eligible to vote at the time of the
respective vote.
�
Options and Warrants
�
None.
�
Convertible Notes�
�
None.
�
Dividend Policy

�
We have not paid any cash dividends to shareholders. The
declaration of any future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends upon our earnings, if any,
our capital requirements and financial position, general economic conditions, and other pertinent conditions. �It is our present
intention not to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, but rather to reinvest earnings, if any, in our business operations.
�
Transfer Agent
�
At this time we do not have a stock transfer agent however,
in the future we do intend to  enlist the services of one following effectiveness of this Registration Statement.

�
Penny Stock Regulation
�
The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define �penny
stock� to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of
less than $5.00 per share. Such securities are subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers
who sell them. For transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the
purchaser of such securities and have received the purchaser�s written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase.
Additionally, for any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction,
of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions
payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer
is the sole market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer�s presumed control over the market.
Finally, among other requirements, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held
in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. As the Shares immediately following this Offering will likely
be subject to such penny stock rules, purchasers in this Offering will in all likelihood find it more difficult to sell their Shares
in the secondary market.

The Company promotes accountability
for adherence to honest and ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
reports and documents that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the �SEC�) and in other public
communications made by the Company; and strives to be compliant with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations. The Company
has not formally adopted a written code of business conduct and ethics that governs the Company�s employees, officers and
Directors as the Company is not required to do so.
�
In lieu of an Audit Committee, the Company�s
Board of Directors, is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning the selection of outside auditors, reviewing
the scope, results and effectiveness of the annual audit of the Company's financial statements and other services provided by the
Company�s independent public accountants. The Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer
of the Company review the Company's internal accounting controls, practices and policies.

Committees
of the Board
�
Our
Company currently does not have nominating, compensation, or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does
our Company have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our Directors believe that it is not necessary
to have such committees, at this time, because the Director(s) can adequately perform the functions of such committees.
�
Audit Committee Financial Expert
�
Our Board of Directors has determined
that we do not have a board member that qualifies as an �audit committee financial expert� as defined in Item 407(D)(5)
of Regulation S-K, nor do we have a Board member that qualifies as �independent� as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B)
of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined by Rule 4200(a)(14) of the FINRA Rules.
�
We
believe that our Director(s) are capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls
and procedures for financial reporting. The Director(s) of our Company does not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee
because management believes that the Board of Directors can adequately perform the functions of an audit committee. In addition,
we believe that retaining an independent Director who would qualify as an "audit committee financial expert" would be overly
costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given the stage of our development and the fact that we have not
generated any positive cash flows from operations to date.
�
Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings
�
Our
Directors and our Executive officers have not been involved in any of the following events during the past ten years:

�


1.
bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time;

2.
any conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses);

3.
being subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his/her involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities; or

4.
being found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated.

5.
Such person was found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commission to have violated any Federal or State securities law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commission has not been subsequently reversed, suspended, or vacated;

6.
Such person was found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated any Federal commodities law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has not been subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated;

7.
Such person was the subject of, or a party to, any Federal or State judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, relating to an alleged violation of:(i) Any Federal or State securities or commodities law or regulation; or(ii) Any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or prohibition order; or(iii) Any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity; or

8.
Such person was the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26))), any registered entity (as defined in Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member.

��
Independence
of Directors
�
We
are not required to have independent members of our Board of Directors, and do not anticipate having independent Directors until
such time as we are required to do so.
�
Code
of Ethics
�
We
have not adopted a formal Code of Ethics. The Board of Directors evaluated the business of the Company and the number of employees
and determined that since the business is operated by a small number of persons, general rules of fiduciary duty and federal and
state criminal, business conduct and securities laws are adequate ethical guidelines. In the event our operations, employees and/or
Directors expand in the future, we may take actions to adopt a formal Code of Ethics.
�
Shareholder
Proposals
�
Our
Company does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for
Directors. The Board of Directors believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature
and of little assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our Company does not currently have any
specific or minimum criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any specific process or
procedure for evaluating such nominees. The Board of Directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders,
and make recommendations for election or appointment.
�
A
shareholder who wishes to communicate with our Board of Directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our President,
at the address appearing on the first page of this Information Statement.

Beneficial
ownership has been determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. Under this rule, certain shares may be deemed
to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the
shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire shares (for
example, upon exercise of an option or warrant) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing
the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such
person by reason of such acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in the following
table does not necessarily reflect the person�s actual voting power at any particular date.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
�
To the Board of Directors
British Cambridge, Inc.
Pasig City, Philippines
�
�
We
have audited the accompanying balance sheet of British Cambridge, Inc. (the �Company�) as of September 30, 2015
and the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows for the period from June 24, 2015
(inception) to September 30, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
�

We conducted
our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatements. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company�s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
�

In our
opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of British
Cambridge, Inc. as of September 30, 2015 and the result of its operations and its cash flows for the period from June 24, 2015
(inception) to September 30, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
�
The accompanying
financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to
the financial statements, the Company incurred net losses since inception, which raises substantial doubt about the Company�s
ability to continue as a going concern. Management�s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

British Cambridge, Inc.
Notes to the Financial Statements
For the Period from June 24, 2015
(Inception) to September 30, 2015

�
Note 1 � Organization and Description
of Business
�
British Cambridge, Inc. (the Company)
was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 24, 2015. The Company intends to further develop and lease its
online education software to new and existing customers. As of September 30, 2015 the Company had not yet commenced any operations.
�
The Company has elected September 30th
as its year end.
�
Note 2 � Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies
�
Basis of Presentation
�
 
The accompanying audited financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.
�
Use of Estimates
�
The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary
in order to make the financial statements not misleading have been included. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Due to the minimal level of operations, the Company has not had to make material assumptions or estimates other than the assumption
that the Company is a going concern.
�
Cash Equivalents
�
The Company considers all highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents
at September 30, 2015 were $0.

Income Taxes
�
The Company accounts for income taxes
under ASC 740, �Income Taxes.� �Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. �Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled. �The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the period the enactment occurs. �A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely
than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations. �No deferred tax assets or liabilities were
recognized at September 30, 2015.
�
Basic Earnings (Loss) Per Share
�
The Company computes basic and diluted earnings per share
amounts in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income
(loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period.
Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options and other commitments to issue common
stock were exercised or equity awards vest resulting in the issuance of common stock that could share in the earnings of the Company.
�
The Company does not have any potentially dilutive instruments
as of September 30, 2015 and, thus, anti-dilution issues are not applicable.
�
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,
defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in
the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the
measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1)�market participant assumptions
developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2)�an entity�s own assumptions
about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs).
The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels
of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
�


��������� �
Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.

��������� �
Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.

��������� �
Level 3 - Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.

�
Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon
certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of September 30, 2015.

�Related Parties
The Company follows ASC 850, Related Party Disclosures,
for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.
Share-based Expense
�
ASC 718, �Compensation � Stock Compensation�,
prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee services are acquired.
Transactions include incurring liabilities, or issuing or offering to issue shares, options, and other equity instruments such
as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
stock options, are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values. That expense is recognized
over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service
period (usually the vesting period).
�
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation issued
to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505-50, �Equity � Based Payments to Non-Employees.�
�Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably
measurable: �(a) the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments issued. �The fair value of the share-based
payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date. �
�
The company had no stock-based compensation plans September
30, 2015.
Share-based expense for the period ended September 30, 2015
was $24,400.
�
Note 3 � Going Concern
The Company�s financial statements are prepared using
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern that contemplates the realization
of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
�
The Company demonstrates adverse conditions that raise substantial
doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for one year following the issuance of these financial statements.
These adverse conditions are negative financial trends, specifically operating loss, working capital deficiency, negative cash
flow from operating activities, and other adverse key financial ratios.
�
The Company has not established any source of revenue to
cover its operating costs. Management plans to fund operating expenses with related party contributions to capital. There is no
assurance that management's plan will be successful.
�
The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern.
�

Contents
�
�Note 4 - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements		
�
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial
statements and does not believe that there are any other new pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact
on its financial position or results of operations.

�
Note 5 � Commitments and Contingencies
�
The Company follows ASC 450-20, Loss Contingencies,
to report accounting for contingencies.� Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation,
fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the
assessment can be reasonably estimated. There were no commitments or contingencies as of September 30, 2015.

INDEMNIFICATION
OF DIRECTOR AND OFFICERS
��
Section
145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the �Delaware Law�) authorizes a court to award, or a corporation�s
board of directors to grant, indemnity to directors and officers in terms sufficiently broad to permit such indemnification under
certain circumstances for liabilities, (including reimbursement for expenses incurred) arising under the Securities Act of 1933.
Article VII of the Certificate of Incorporation of British Cambridge, Inc. (�we�, �us� or �our company�)
provides for indemnification of officers, directors and other employees of British Cambridge, Inc. to the fullest extent permitted
by Delaware Law. Article VII of the Certificate of Incorporation provides that directors shall not be personally liable to the
Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except (i) for any breach of
a director�s duty of loyalty to our company or our stockholders, (ii) acts and omissions that are not in good faith or that
involve intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware Law, or (iv) for any transaction
from which the director derived any improper benefit.
�
Insofar
as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers or persons
controlling the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, the registrant has been informed that in the opinion of the Securities
and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.
�
Delaware
Corporation Law and our Certificate of Incorporation, allow us to indemnify our officers and Directors from certain liabilities
and our Bylaws, as amended (�Bylaws�), state that we shall indemnify every (i) present or former Director, advisory
Director or officer of us and (ii) any person who while serving in any of the capacities referred to in clause (i) served at our
request as a Director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, association or other
enterprise. (each an �Indemnitee�).
�
Our Bylaws
provide that the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action
by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or, while
a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee
or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, association or other enterprise, against expenses (including
attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with which
action, suit or proceeding, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his/her
conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon plea
of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and
in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and, with respect to
any criminal action or proceeding, that he had reasonable cause to believe that his/her conduct was unlawful.
�
Except
as provided above, our Certificate of Incorporation provides that a Director shall be liable to the extent provided by applicable
law, (i) for breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in
good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) pursuant to Section 174 of the DELAWARE
CORPORATION LAW or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If the DELAWARE CORPORATION
LAW hereafter is amended to authorize the further elimination or limitation of the liability of directors, then the liability
of a director of the Corporation, in addition to the limitation on personal liability provided herein, shall be limited to the
fullest extent permitted by the amended DELAWARE CORPORATION LAW. Neither any amendment to or repeal of this Article 7, nor the
adoption of any provision hereof inconsistent with this Article 7, shall adversely affect any right or protection of any director
of the Corporation existing at the time of, or increase the liability or alleged liability of any director of the Corporation
for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to or at the time of such amendment.
�
Neither our Bylaws, nor our
Certificate of Incorporation include any specific indemnification provisions for our officer or Directors against liability under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Additionally, insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Company pursuant to
the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Company has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission
such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.

UNDERTAKINGS
The undersigned
Registrant hereby undertakes:
�
(a)(1)
To file, during any period in which offers or sales of securities are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration
statement to:
�
(i) Include
any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;
�
(ii)
To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent
post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set
forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if
the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high
end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule
383(b) (�230.383(b) of this chapter) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change
in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the �Calculation of Registration Fee� table in the effective
registration statement.
�
(iii)
To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement
or any material change to such information in the registration statement;
�
(2) That,
for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed
to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time
shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
�
(3) To
remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at
the termination of the offering.
�
(4) That,
for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:
�
(i) If
the registrant is subject to Rule 430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 383(b) as part of a registration statement relating
to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A,
shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness.
Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement
or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part
of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify
any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in
any such document immediately prior to such date of first use.
�
(5) That,
for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution
of the securities: The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant
pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if
the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant
will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:
�
(i) Any
preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule
383;
�
(ii)
Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred
to by the undersigned registrant;
�
(iii)
The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned
registrant or our securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and
�
(iv)
Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.
�
Insofar
as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the �Act�) may be permitted to our directors,
officers and controlling persons pursuant to the provisions above, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the
SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable.
�
In the
event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by
one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted
by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless
in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction
the question whether such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and we will be governed
by the final adjudication of such issue.
