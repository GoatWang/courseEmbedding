Maureen Helmer concentrates her practice on energy and telecommunications law as well as corporate and professional ethics and the New York State Legislature. 
Maureen has had an expansive career touching on a broad range of issues related to New York energy and telecommunications law. She led the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) during a time of sweeping change in the telecommunications and energy industries. A key goal during her tenure was the development of rational market rules that would nurture innovation and reduce barriers to competition while maintaining reliable service. It was with this goal in mind that she took on a leadership role in increasing coordination between New York and its neighboring U.S. and Canadian ISOs and RTOs. During this initiative, she was a vocal advocate for resolving “seams” issues and enhancing regional reliability. 
In addition to her work during the restructuring of the energy and telecommunications markets, Maureen's involvement in critical infrastructure issues in the wake of 9/11 has led to an ongoing involvement in security and cybersecurity issues on a national basis. She was recently added to the Board of the Center for Internet Security, a not-for-profit organization focused on enhancing the cyber security readiness and response of public and private sector entities. 
Since leaving government, Maureen has applied her broad government experience to assist clients of all sizes as they invest and grow in the country’s energy and telecommunications markets. She provides strategic advice regarding relevant regulatory and legislative environments and gives clients the assistance needed to impact policies that foster investment and obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. As a demonstration of her leadership capacity, Maureen serves as Chair of the firm’s Regulatory Practice Area. 
In furtherance of Maureen’s commitment to diversity, she is an active participant in the firm’s Women’s Forum, as well as a founding member, past president and current board member of New York Women in Communications and Energy. 
Representative Experience
Obtained state regulatory approvals for upstream changes in ownership/corporate structure for large, international energy clients. 
Represented large communications/cable trade association before numerous governmental entities in New York, including the Public Service Commission, the Executive, Office for Technology, the Legislature. 
Advised large investors and shareholders in matters pending before the New York Public Service Commission.

Advised individual cable companies regarding New York Public Service Commission cases and assisted with filings and responses in cases.
