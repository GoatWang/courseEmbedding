Ulysses Lee "Junior" Bridgeman (born September 17, 1953) is a retired American basketball player.
Born in East Chicago, Indiana, Bridgeman was a member of the 1971 East Chicago Washington High School Senators basketball team, which went undefeated (29-0) and won the Indiana state high school basketball championship. Among his teammates were his brother Sam, Pete Trgovich (who played at UCLA) and Tim Stoddard (N.C. State), who would go on to have success as a Major League Baseball pitcher.
A 6'5" guard/forward from the University of Louisville, Bridgeman was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers in 1975 and immediately traded with Brian Winters, David Meyers and Elmore Smith to the Milwaukee Bucks for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Bridgeman went on to have a solid 12-year NBA career, spent mostly with the Bucks, and he scored 11,517 total points. Although he was a sixth man for most of his career, he averaged double figures in scoring for nine consecutive seasons. He played in 711 games for the Bucks, still the most in franchise history, although he started only 105 times. His #2 jersey was retired by the Bucks franchise in 1988.
Bridgeman is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.[1]
Bridgeman has an estimated net worth of $600 million thanks to his franchising over 160 Wendy's restaurants, as well as over 120 Chili's restaurants.[2] In late June 2016, Bridgeman was appointed to the University of Louisville Board of Trustees by Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin following an administrative reorganization in which Bevin abolished the university's former governing board. The appointment of the new board, including Bridgeman, is being challenged by the state's Attorney General Andy Beshear on grounds that the governor did not have the power to do so.[3]
He was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1999.

Entrepreneur businessman Ulysses Bridgeman, better known by his nickname, “Junior,” was born on September 17, 1953, in East Chicago, Indiana. His father, Ulysses Sr., worked in a steel mill, and his mother was a homemaker.

Bridgeman attended East Washington High School where he maintained a high GPA while playing on the school’s basketball team. Although he was considered a solid basketball player, Bridgeman did not anticipate playing the sport beyond high school. In his senior year (1971), however, he realized his full potential as a basketball player. The East Washington team went undefeated that year and won the Indiana state high school championships. 

The University of Louisville in Kentucky offered the young basketball star a scholarship, and with his help the Louisville team went on to play in 1975’s Final Four. After graduating with his bachelor's degree in psychology, Bridgeman contemplated attending law school but was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers. Soon after the draft, he was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks for Kareem Abdul-Jabber. 

The now-pro basketball player spent ten years playing for the Bucks, and two years with the L.A Clippers. At the time, Bridgeman, in his highest earning year, received a comparatively modest $350,000. He also served as the head of the National Basketball Players Association—the player’s union—and used his position to learn all he could about business and finance.

As his basketball career came to a close in 1987, Bridgeman purchased several Wendy’s franchises in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In 1988 his highest-earning Wendy’s grossed $800,000, which was about the average for Wendy’s franchises at the time. Bridgeman sought to raise the income of his franchises by concentrating on gaining the trust and respect of his employees, which in turn motivated them to work harder and sell more products. His franchises began to yield above-average returns, bringing in millions of dollars each year. Bridgeman used the revenue to purchase more franchises, and by 2014, he became the second largest Wendy’s franchise owner in the United States. 

As the number of Wendy’s franchises grew, Bridgeman purchased other brands. By 2015 he owned over two hundred Wendy’s, Chili’s, and Fannie Mae Chocolate stores in various states all under the umbrella of Bridgeman Foods. Now sixty-two years old, the businessman has a net worth approaching $400 million dollars. He is known for philanthropy in his home community of Louisville, Kentucky, having contributed significantly to the Lincoln Heritage Council of Boy Scouts of America, among other organizations. Bridgeman married his college sweetheart, Doris Griffith, shortly after he joined the Bucks in 1975. The couple has three children together: Eden, Justin, and Ryan.
