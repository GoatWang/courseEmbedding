Steton picks up $7.5 mln from Access Holdings


November 3, 2015
By Iris Dorbian






Salt Lake City-based Steton Technology Group, a provider of compliance auditing SaaS technology, has closed $7.5 million in Series B financing. The investor was Access Holdings.
PRESS RELEASE
SALT LAKE CITY, Nov. 3, 2015 /PRNewswire/ — Steton Technology Group, Inc., the world’s leading provider of compliance auditing SaaS technology, today announced the completion of a $7.5 million Series B financing backed by Access Holdings, a private equity firm based in Baltimore and Toronto. Including Series A financing in September 2014, Access Holdings has invested a total of $30 million into Steton to support product innovation, accelerated sales, and market expansion.
Steton’s growth has been driven by increased demand for brand protection among global organizations. Compliance auditing programs are heavily analyzed by executive leaders under pressure to deliver quality and positive customer experiences in today’s highly digital environment.
“Compliance and quality management solutions represent an enormous, yet neglected market,” said Kevin McAllister, managing partner of Access Holdings. “Existing solutions are hard to use, painful to implement, or too narrowly focused for today’s highly scrutinized service and retail organizations. Steton is the most powerful product with tremendous penetration into the world’s biggest brands.”
With millions of stakeholders responsible for internal auditing programs in food service, hotel, and retail stores worldwide, the company has identified the high opportunity for growth. Steton provides a full suite of applications that give companies greater visibility, intelligence, and control over their quality and compliance auditing programs. 





“Financial backing from Access Holdings allows Steton to accelerate growth, particularly around product development and industry adoption,” said Frank Maylett, president and CEO of Steton. “Steton has real business impact that helps our customers succeed, and with resources allocated appropriately we will shape and define the future of compliance auditing programs.”

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
