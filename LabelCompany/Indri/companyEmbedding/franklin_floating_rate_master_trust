            Fund Description
        




The fund seeks a high level of current income and, secondarily, preservation of capital, by investing predominantly in floating interest rate senior secured corporate loans (floating-rate loans) and corporate debt securities.



            Strategy Statement
        








"We invest in floating-rate loans, which pay interest that adjusts periodically to current rates, generally making them less sensitive to interest rate volatility than fixed-rate securities.
"

            Strategy
        
We invest predominantly in floating interest rate senior secured corporate loans and corporate debt securities.
We seek higher credit-quality loans that may potentially help the fund maintain a more stable net asset value than the fund's benchmark index.
We look for companies with strong management teams and market leadership.




            Benefits
        
Dedicated Floating Rate Research Team. We have a team solely focused on floating-rate loans analysis, separate from high-yield bonds.
Access to In-Depth Investment Expertise. Whether we want to look at a security from a credit or equity perspective to get a holistic understanding of the security, we have the ability to draw upon the extensive research resources of Franklin Templeton's fixed income and equity teams.
Diversified Portfolio. The fund's diversification helps to potentially reduce credit risk by spreading assets across many different issuers and industries.

Hypothetical $10K Investment



















            Investing In The Fund
        

What Are the Risks?

All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal.
Investors should be aware that the fund’s share price and yield will fluctuate with market conditions.
The fund should not be considered an alternative to money market funds or certificates of deposit (CDs).
The floating-rate loans and debt securities in which the fund invests tend to be rated below investment-grade.
Investing in higher-yielding, lower-rated, floating-rate loans and debt securities involves greater risk of default, which could result in loss of principal — a risk that may be heightened in a slowing economy.
Interest earned on floating-rate loans varies with changes in prevailing interest rates; therefore, while floating-rate loans offer higher interest income when interest rates rise, they will also generate less income when interest rates decline.
Changes in the financial strength of a bond issuer or in a bond’s credit rating may affect its value.
The fund is actively managed but there is no guarantee that the manager’s investment decisions will produce the desired results.
These and other risks considerations are discussed in the fund’s prospectus.

Important Legal Information

Total Returns include change in share price, assume reinvestment of all distributions, and reflect the deduction of fund expenses and applicable fees. Total Returns With Sales Charge: returns reflect the deduction of the stated sales charge. Total returns, distribution rate, and yields reflect any applicable expense reductions, without which the results for those impacted funds would have been lower.
For more information on any of our funds, contact your financial advisor or download a free prospectus. Investors should carefully consider a fund's investment goals, risks, sales charges and expenses before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information.  Please read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money.
Most Franklin Templeton funds offer multiple share classes. Share classes are subject to different fees and expenses, which will affect their performance. In general, Class A shares have a maximum initial sales charge; Class C shares have a 1% contingent deferred sales charge; Class Z, Advisor Class and Class R6 shares have no sales charges nor Rule 12b-1 fees; Class R shares have no sales charges, but do have a Rule 12b-1 fee.

Footnotes

A statistical measurement of the range of a fund's total returns. In general, a higher standard deviation means greater volatility. Based on the fund's monthly returns over the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
A statistical measurement of a fund's historical risk-adjusted performance. It is calculated by taking a fund's excess return over that of the three-month Treasury bill divided by its standard deviation. Higher values generally indicate better historical risk-adjusted performance. Based on the 3 years ended as of the date of the calculation.
The annualized percentage difference between a fund's actual returns and its expected performance given its level of market risk, as measured by beta.  Based on the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
Percentage of the fund's returns explained by movements in the Credit Suisse Leveraged Loan Index. 100 equals perfect correlation to the index. Based on the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
A measure of the fund's volatility relative to the market, as represented by the Credit Suisse Leveraged Loan Index. A beta greater than 1.00 indicates volatility greater than the market. Based on the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
The fund's 30-day standardized yield is calculated over a trailing 30-day period using the yield to maturity on bonds and/or the dividends accrued on stocks. It may not equal the fund's actual income distribution rate, which reflects the fund's past dividends paid to shareholders.
Public Offering Price — Purchase price for each share of the fund on a given day. It includes the maximum initial sales charge, if any.
Net Asset Value — The amount per share you would receive if you sold shares that day.
Source: Morningstar®. For each mutual fund and exchange traded fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on how a fund ranks on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure against other funds in the same category. This measure takes into account variations in a fund's monthly performance, and does not take into account the effects of sales charges, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The weights are: 100% 3-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% 5-year rating/40% 3-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 5-year rating/20% 3-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent 3-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Morningstar Rating™ is for the named share class only; other classes may have different performance characteristics. Past performance is not an indicator or a guarantee of future performance.
©2017 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. The information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or distributed and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information.
The Gross Expense Ratio does not include a fee waiver related to the Fund's investment in a Franklin Templeton money fund and/or other Franklin Templeton fund, contractually guaranteed through its 2/28/18. Fund investment results reflect the fee reduction; without this reduction, the results would have been lower. Please see the prospectus for additional information. 
Indices are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in them. Index returns do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges.
For performance reporting purposes, the inception date for Classes A, R, R6, Z, and Advisor Class shares of all Franklin Templeton Funds is the date of effectiveness of the fund's registration statement or the first day the fund commenced operations. For Class C shares, generally the inception date is the first day the fund commenced offering such shares. Exceptions: Templeton Global Balanced Fund Classes A and C use the inception date of the old Class A and C shares, renamed Class A1 and Class C1. For Franklin Mutual Series Funds, Franklin International Small Cap Growth Fund and Franklin Pelagos Commodities Strategy Fund, the inception date for Classes A, C, R and R6 shares is the funds' oldest class', Z or Advisor, inception date. Franklin U.S. Government Money Fund Class R6 inception date is the first day it commenced offering such shares. For Franklin California Ultra-Short Tax-Free Income Fund Classes A1 and Advisor Class use the inception date of its predecessor, Franklin California Tax-Exempt Money Fund.

This portfolio data should not be relied upon as a complete listing of a fund’s holdings (or of a fund’s top holdings) as information on particular holdings may be withheld if it is in the fund’s interest to do so.
Monthly portfolio data for the Franklin Templeton money funds is made available on the franklintempleton.com website 5 business days after the end of each month. The complete Schedules of Investments for the Franklin Templeton money funds are available through Form N-MFP filings on the SEC website:

Portfolio holdings are subject to change without notice and may not represent current or future portfolio composition. The portfolio data is “as of” the date indicated and we disclaim any responsibility to update the information.

FRANKLIN FLOATING RATE MASTER TRUST

FRANKLIN FLOATING RATE MASTER SERIES






NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)



1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


The Franklin Floating Rate Master Trust (the Trust) is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 as a non-diversified, open-ended investment
company. The Trust is organized as a partnership and consists of one series, the
Franklin Floating Rate Master Series (the Fund). Shares of the Fund are issued
in the form of partnership interests and are exempt from registration under the
Securities Act of 1933. The Fund seeks current income and preservation of
capital.


The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.



A. SECURITY VALUATION



Securities listed on a securities exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market
System are valued at the last quoted sale price or the official closing price of
the day, respectively. Over-the-counter securities and listed securities for
which there is no reported sale are valued within the range of the most recent
quoted bid and ask prices. Securities that trade in multiple markets or on
multiple exchanges are valued according to the broadest and most representative
market. Repurchase agreements are valued at cost.


Corporate debt securities generally trade in the over-the-counter market rather
than on a securities exchange. The Fund may utilize independent pricing
services, quotations from bond dealers, and information with respect to bond and
note transactions, to assist in determining a current market value for each
security. The Fund's pricing services may use valuation models or matrix pricing
which considers information with respect to comparable bond and note
transactions, quotations from bond dealers, or by reference to other securities
that are considered comparable in such characteristics as rating, interest rate
and maturity date, option adjusted spread models, prepayment projections,
interest rate spreads and yield curves, to determine current value.


Senior secured corporate loans with floating or variable interest rates
generally trade in the over-the-counter market rather than on a securities
exchange. The Fund may utilize independent pricing services, quotations from
loan dealers and other financial institutions, and information with respect to
bond and note transactions, to assist in determining a current market value for
each security. The Fund's pricing services use independent market quotations
from loan dealers or financial institutions and may incorporate valuation
methodologies that consider multiple bond characteristics such as dealer quotes,
issuer type, coupon, maturity, weighted average maturity, interest rate spreads
and yield curves, cash flow and credit risk/quality analysis to determine
current value.


The Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of individual securities and
other assets for which market prices are not readily available or which may not
be reliably priced. Some methods for valuing these securities may include:

fundamental analysis, matrix pricing, discounts from market prices of similar
securities, or discounts applied due to the nature and duration of restrictions
on the disposition of the securities. Occasionally, events occur between the
time at which trading in a security is completed and the close of the NYSE that
might call into question the availability (including the reliability) of the
value of a portfolio security held by the Fund. If such an event occurs, the
securities may be valued using fair value procedures, which may include the use
of independent pricing services. All security valuation procedures are approved
by the Fund's Board of Trustees.



B. JOINT REPURCHASE AGREEMENT



The Fund may enter into a joint repurchase agreement whereby its uninvested cash
balance is deposited into a joint cash account to be used to invest in one or
more repurchase agreements. The value and face amount of the joint repurchase
agreement are allocated to the Fund based on its pro-rata interest. A repurchase
agreement is accounted for as a loan by the Fund to the seller, collateralized
by securities which are delivered to the Fund's custodian. The market value,
including accrued interest, of the initial collateralization is required to be
at least 102% of the dollar amount invested by the Funds, with the value of the
underlying securities marked to market daily to maintain






FRANKLIN FLOATING RATE MASTER TRUST

FRANKLIN FLOATING RATE MASTER SERIES

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)



coverage of at least 100%. At January 31, 2005, all repurchase agreements held
by the Fund had been entered into on that date.



C. SECURITIES PURCHASED ON A WHEN-ISSUED OR DELAYED DELIVERY BASIS



The Fund may purchase securities on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis,
with payment and delivery scheduled for a future date. These transactions are
subject to market fluctuations and are subject to the risk that the value at
delivery may be more or less than the trade date purchase price. Although the
Fund will generally purchase these securities with the intention of holding the
securities, it may sell the securities before the settlement date. Sufficient
assets have been segregated for these securities.



D. SENIOR FLOATING RATE INTERESTS



Senior secured corporate loans pay interest at rates which are periodically
reset by reference to a base lending rate plus a spread. These base lending
rates are generally the prime rate offered by a designated U.S. bank or the
London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Senior secured corporate loans often
require prepayment of principal from excess cash flows or at the discretion of
the borrower. As a result, actual maturity may be substantially less than the
stated maturity.


Senior secured corporate loans in which the Fund invests are generally readily
marketable, but may be subject to some restrictions on resale.



E. INCOME TAXES



No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes because all income and expenses
are allocated to the partners for inclusion in their individual income tax
returns.



F. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS



Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Discounts and premiums
on securities purchased are amortized over the lives of the respective
securities. Facility fees are recognized as income over the expected term of the
loan. The Fund's net investment income is proportionally allocated daily and
distributed monthly to the partners.



G. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES



The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.



H. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS



Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and trustees are
indemnified by the Fund against certain liability arising out of the performance
of their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the
Fund enters into contracts with service providers that contain general
indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund
that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the Fund expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

8. CREDIT RISK


The Fund has 85.47% of its portfolio invested in below investment grade and
comparable quality unrated high yield securities, which tend to be more
sensitive to economic conditions than higher rated securities.




9. UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS


The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund is obligated to fund these loan commitments at the
borrowers' discretion.

         1/31/2005                $0.034948








Daily distribution information is available at the registered office upon
request.


11. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS


Advisers, as the Fund's Manager, may serve as a member of various bondholders'
steering committees, on credit committees, or may represent the Funds in certain
corporate restructuring negotiations. At January 31, 2005, the Manager serves in
one or more of these capacities for Adelphia Communications Corp. As a result of
this involvement, Advisers may be in possession of certain material non-public
information. If the Fund's Manager, while






FRANKLIN FLOATING RATE MASTER TRUST

FRANKLIN FLOATING RATE MASTER SERIES

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)



in possession of such information, seeks to sell any of its holdings in these
securities it will comply with all applicable federal securities laws.


12. FUND LITIGATION


On July 6, 2003, Adelphia Communications Corp. ("Adelphia") and related parties,
along with its Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, filed an adversary
proceeding in the Adelphia bankruptcy case in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court (SDNY)
against more than 360 banks, financial services companies, insurance companies,
investment banks, mutual funds and other parties that had arranged for the sale
of, or purchased the bank debt of,


Adelphia or its related parties. Named Defendants included Franklin Advisers
Inc., Franklin CLOs I - III, Franklin Floating Rate Daily Access Fund, Franklin
Floating Rate Master Series, and Franklin Floating Rate Trust.


The Complaint alleges that the purchasers of this bank debt knew, or should have
known, that the loan proceeds would not benefit Adelphia, but instead would be
used to enrich Adelphia insiders. It seeks avoidance of the loans and recovery
of intentionally fraudulent transfers.


Discovery for this case has been stayed and pending motions have not been ruled
upon. Thus, it is not possible to predict its outcome at this early stage of the
proceedings. However, management of the Funds does not expect that the result
will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Funds.


13. REGULATORY MATTERS



INVESTIGATIONS



As part of various investigations by a number of federal, state, and foreign
regulators and governmental entities, including the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC"), the California Attorney General's Office ("CAGO"), and the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD"), relating to certain
practices in the mutual fund industry, including late trading, market timing and
marketing support payments to securities dealers who sell fund shares, Franklin
Resources, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (as used in this section,
together, the "Company"), as well as certain current or former executives and
employees of the Company, received subpoenas and/or requests for documents,
information and/or testimony. The Company and its current employees provided
documents and information in response to those requests and subpoenas.



SETTLEMENTS



Beginning in August 2004, the Company entered into settlements with certain
regulators investigating the mutual fund industry practices noted above. The
Company believes that settlement of each of the matters described in this
section is in the best interest of the Company and shareholders of the Franklin,
Templeton, and Mutual Series mutual funds (the "funds").


On August 2, 2004, Franklin Resources, Inc. announced that its subsidiary,
Franklin Advisers, Inc., reached an agreement with the SEC that resolved the
issues resulting from the SEC investigation into market timing activity. In
connection with that agreement, the SEC issued an "Order Instituting
Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 203(e) and
203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Sections 9(b) and 9(f) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions
and a Cease-and-Desist Order" (the "Order"). The SEC's Order concerned the
activities of a limited number of third parties that ended in 2000 and those
that were the subject of the first Massachusetts administrative complaint
described below.






FRANKLIN FLOATING RATE MASTER TRUST

FRANKLIN FLOATING RATE MASTER SERIES

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)



Under the terms of the SEC's Order, pursuant to which Franklin Advisers, Inc.
neither admitted nor denied any of the findings contained therein, Franklin
Advisers, Inc. agreed to pay $50 million, of which $20 million is a civil
penalty, to be distributed to shareholders of certain funds in accordance with a
plan to be developed by an independent distribution consultant. At this time, it
is unclear which funds or which shareholders of any particular fund will receive
distributions. The Order also required Franklin Advisers, Inc. to, among other
things, enhance and periodically review compliance policies and procedures.


On September 20, 2004, Franklin Resources, Inc. announced that two of its
subsidiaries, Franklin Advisers, Inc. and Franklin Templeton Alternative
Strategies, Inc. ("FTAS"), reached an agreement with the Securities Division of
the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the "State of
Massachusetts") related to its administrative complaint filed on February 4,
2004, concerning one instance of market timing that was also a subject of the
August 2, 2004 settlement that Franklin Advisers, Inc. reached with the SEC, as
described above.


Under the terms of the settlement consent order issued by the State of
Massachusetts, Franklin Advisers, Inc. and FTAS consented to the entry of a
cease-and-desist order and agreed to pay a $5 million administrative fine to the
State of Massachusetts (the "Massachusetts Consent Order"). The Massachusetts
Consent Order included two different sections: "Statements of Fact" and
"Violations of Massachusetts Securities Laws." Franklin Advisers, Inc. and FTAS
admitted the facts in the Statements of Fact.


On October 25, 2004, the State of Massachusetts filed a second administrative
complaint, alleging that Franklin Resources, Inc.'s Form 8-K filing, in which it
described the Massachusetts Consent Order and stated that "Franklin did not
admit or deny engaging in any wrongdoing", failed to state that Franklin
Advisers, Inc. and FTAS admitted the Statements of Fact portion of the
Massachusetts Consent Order (the "Second Complaint"). Franklin Resources, Inc.
reached a second agreement with the State of Massachusetts on November 19, 2004,
resolving the Second Complaint. As a result of the November 19, 2004 settlement,
Franklin Resources, Inc. filed a new Form 8-K. The terms of the Massachusetts
Consent Order did not change and there was no monetary fine associated with this
second settlement.


On November 17, 2004, Franklin Resources, Inc. announced that Franklin/Templeton
Distributors, Inc. ("FTDI") reached an agreement with the CAGO, resolving the
issues resulting from the CAGO's investigation concerning sales and marketing
support payments. Under the terms of the settlement, FTDI neither admitted nor
denied the allegations in the CAGO's complaint and agreed to pay $2 million to
the State of California as a civil penalty, $14 million to the funds, to be
allocated by an independent distribution consultant to be paid for by FTDI, and
$2 million to the CAGO for its investigative costs.


On December 13, 2004, Franklin Resources, Inc. announced that its subsidiaries
FTDI and Franklin Advisers, Inc. reached an agreement with the SEC, resolving
the issues resulting from the SEC's investigation concerning marketing support
payments to securities dealers who sell fund shares. In connection with that
agreement, the SEC issued an "Order Instituting Administrative and
Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions
Pursuant to Sections 203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,
Sections 9(b) and 9(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, and Section 15(b)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934" (the "Second Order").


Under the terms of the Second Order, in which FTDI and Franklin Advisers, Inc.
neither admitted nor denied the findings contained therein, they agreed to pay
the funds a penalty of $20 million and disgorgement of $1 (one dollar). FTDI and
Franklin Advisers, Inc. also agreed to implement certain measures and
undertakings relating to marketing support payments to broker-dealers for the
promotion or sale of fund shares, including making additional disclosures in the
funds' Prospectuses and Statements of Additional Information. The Second Order
further requires the appointment of an independent distribution consultant, at
the Company's expense, who shall develop a plan for the distribution of the
penalty and disgorgement to the funds.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)



The SEC's Second Order and the CAGO settlement agreement concerning marketing
support payments provide that the distribution of settlement monies are to be
made to the relevant funds, not to individual shareholders. The IDC has
substantially completed preparation of these distribution plans. The CAGO has
approved the distribution plan pertaining to the distribution of the monies owed
under the CAGO settlement agreement and, in accordance with the terms and
conditions of that settlement, the monies are expected to be disbursed promptly.
The SEC has not yet approved the distribution plan pertaining to the Second
Order. When approved, disbursements of settlement monies under the SEC's Second
Order will be made promptly in accordance with the terms and conditions of that
order.



OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS



The Fund, in addition to the Company and other funds, and certain current and
former officers, employees, and directors have been named in multiple lawsuits
in different federal courts in Nevada, California, Illinois, New York and
Florida, alleging violations of various federal securities laws and seeking,
among other relief, monetary damages, restitution, removal of fund trustees,
directors, advisers, administrators, and distributors, rescission of management
contracts and 12b-1 Plans, and/or attorneys' fees and costs. Specifically, the
lawsuits claim breach of duty with respect to alleged arrangements to permit
market timing and/or late trading activity, or breach of duty with respect to
the valuation of the portfolio securities of certain Templeton funds managed by
Franklin Resources, Inc. subsidiaries, resulting in alleged market timing
activity. The majority of these lawsuits duplicate, in whole or in part, the
allegations asserted in the February 4, 2004 Massachusetts administrative
complaint and the findings in the SEC's August 2, 2004 Order, as described
above. The lawsuits are styled as class actions, or derivative actions on behalf
of either the named funds or Franklin Resources, Inc.


In addition, the Company, as well as certain current and former officers,
employees, and directors, have been named in multiple lawsuits alleging
violations of various securities laws and pendent state law claims relating to
the disclosure of directed brokerage payments and/or payment of allegedly
excessive advisory, commission, and distribution fees, and seeking, among other
relief, monetary damages, restitution, rescission of advisory contracts,
including recovery of all fees paid pursuant to those contracts, an accounting
of all monies paid to the named advisers, declaratory relief, injunctive relief,
and/or attorneys' fees and costs. These lawsuits are styled as class actions or
derivative actions brought on behalf of certain funds.


The Company and fund management strongly believes that the claims made in each
of the lawsuits identified above are without merit and intends to vigorously
defend against them. The Company cannot predict with certainty, however, the
eventual outcome of the remaining governmental investigations or private
lawsuits, nor whether they will have a material negative impact on the Company.
Public trust and confidence are critical to the Company's business and any
material loss of investor and/or client confidence could result in a significant
decline in assets under management by the Company, which would have an adverse
effect on the Company's future financial results. If the Company finds that it
bears responsibility for any unlawful or inappropriate conduct that caused
losses to the Fund, it is committed to making the Fund or its shareholders
whole, as appropriate. The Company is committed to taking all appropriate
actions to protect the interests of its funds' shareholders.

Exhibit (A)



FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS

CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND

SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS




I. COVERED OFFICERS AND PURPOSE OF THE CODE


This code of ethics (the "Code")1 is for the investment companies within
the complex registered with the United States Securities & Exchange Commission
("SEC") (collectively, "FT Funds") applies to each FT Fund's Principal Executive
Officers, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer (the
"Covered Officers" each of whom are set forth in Exhibit A) for the purpose of
promoting:


o     Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
relationships;


o     Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;


o     Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;


o     The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

o     Accountability for adherence to the Code.


Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest.


II.   COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS OF
INTEREST


OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered
Officer's private interest interferes with the interests of, or his
service to, the FT Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise
if a Covered Officer, or a member of his family, receives improper
personal benefits as a result of his position with the FT Funds.


Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the FT Funds and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company
Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the FT Funds. The FT Funds'
and the investment advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.


Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the FT Funds, the investment advisers and the fund administrator of
which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser, the administrator,
or for all three), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is recognized by the FT Funds' Boards of Directors ("Boards") that the
Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.


Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the FT Funds.



Each Covered Officer must:



o     Not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the FT Funds
whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment of
the FT Funds;


o     Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take action, for the
individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the benefit
the FT Funds;


o     Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential violations that
are made in good faith;


o     Report at least annually the following affiliations or other
relationships:2


o     all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
required to file reports with the SEC;


o     any direct or indirect business relationship with any independent
directors;


o     any direct or indirect business relationship with any independent public
accounting firm; and


o     any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
affiliates of Franklin Resources).


There are some conflict of interest situations that should always be
approved in writing by FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel, if
material. Examples of these include3:


o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;


o The receipt of any gifts in excess of $100;


o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
has current or prospective business dealings unless such entertainment is
business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and place, and
not so frequent as to raise any question of impropriety. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Covered Officers must obtain prior approval for any
entertainment with a value in excess of $1000.


o Any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
thereof;


o A direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for effecting portfolio
transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or
equity ownership.


FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a report to
the FT Funds Audit Committee of any approvals granted at the next regularly
scheduled meeting.


III.  DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE


o     Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself with the disclosure
requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;


o     Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to
misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;


o     Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his area of
responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the FT Funds,
the adviser and the administrator with the goal of promoting full, fair,
accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and
documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other
public communications made by the FT Funds; and


o     It is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
regulations.


IV. REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY



Each Covered Officer must:



o     Upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that he has received,
read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);


o     Annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he has complied with the
requirements of the Code; and


o     Notify FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel promptly if he knows
of any violation of this Code. Failure to do so is itself is a violation
of this Code.


FT's General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are responsible for
applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are presented under
it and have the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation.4
However, the Independent Directors of the respective fund will consider any
approvals or waivers5 sought by any Chief Executive Officers of the Funds.


The FT Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:


o     FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take all appropriate
action to investigate any potential violations reported to him;


o     If, after such investigation, FT's General Counsel or Deputy General
Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, FT's General Counsel is
not required to take any further action;


o     Any matter that FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
a violation will be reported to the Independent Directors of the
appropriate FT Fund;


o     If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred, it will
inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the appropriate Funds,
which will consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
notification to appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its
board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;


o     The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting waivers, as
appropriate; and


o     Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
disclosed as provided by SEC rules.


V.    OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies there under. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-l under the Investment Company Act and more
detailed policies and procedures set forth in FT's Employee Handbook are
separate requirements applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are not
part of this Code.


VI.   AMENDMENTS
Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved or ratified by a majority vote of the FT Funds' Board including a
majority of independent directors.


VII.  CONFIDENTIALITY
All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.


VIII. INTERNAL USE
The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the FT Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any FT Funds, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

1 Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has adopted a code of ethics that applies to the registrant's principal
executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party. If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so. The
registrant must also: (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an exhibit to
its annual report; (2) post the text of the code on its Internet website and
disclose, in its most recent report on Form N-CSR, its Internet address and the
fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or (3) undertake in
its most recent report on Form N-CSR to provide to any person without charge,
upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which such request
may be made. Disclosure is also required of amendments to, or waivers (including
implicit waivers) from, a provision of the code in the registrant's annual
report on Form N-CSR or on its website. If the registrant intends to satisfy the
requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting such information on
its website, it will be required to disclose its Internet address and this
intention.


2 Reporting of these affiliations or other relationships may be made separately
by completing the Directors and Officers Questionnaire and returning to FT's
General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel. 3 Any activity or relationship that
would present a conflict for a Covered

Officer would likely also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if a
member of the Covered Officer's immediate family engages in such an activity
or has such a relationship. The Cover Person should also obtain written
approval by FT's General Counsel in such situations.


4 FT's General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are authorized to consult, as
appropriate, with members of the Audit Committee, counsel to the FT Funds and
counsel to the Independent Directors, and are encouraged to do so. 5 Item 2 of
Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
a material departure from a provision of the code of ethics" and "implicit
waiver," which must also be disclosed, as "the registrant's failure to take
action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material departure from
a provision of the code of ethics that has been made known to an executive
officer" of the registrant.

Franklin Templeton Investment Funds ("FTIF")
IMPORTANT INFORMATION

Franklin Templeton Investment Funds (the "Fund") is an umbrella fund and contains different sub-funds with different risk profiles that invest in equities, fixed income securities, money market instruments and derivatives.
Some sub-funds may invest up to 100% of their total net assets in structured products, mortgage- and asset-backed securities and derivatives (such as credit default swaps, forwards and options) and may significantly invest in non-investment grade debt securities. These investments involve significant liquidity and counterparty default risks which may result in loss of part or entire amount of your investment.
Some sub-funds may invest in defaulted debt securities on which the issuers are not currently making interest payment and in securities of companies undergoing restructuring. These investments are subject to significant liquidity and counterparty default risks.
Some sub-funds may invest in emerging market securities which are exposed to higher risk of economic, political and regulatory changes that may pose additional risk to the sub-funds.
Some sub-funds may invest primarily in a single market or sector or in small-sized companies. These investments are subject to higher concentration risk and are more volatile than funds following a more diversified policy.
Some sub-funds may invest extensively in financial derivative instruments for hedging purposes as well as investment purposes which may expose the sub-funds to the potential for significant losses and as a result may be subject to counterparty and volatility risk.
Some sub-funds may invest in investment funds, i.e. Underlying Funds, which will be subject to the risks associated with such Underlying Funds. There is no assurance on the Underlying Funds that (1) the liquidity will always be sufficient to meet redemption requests; and (2) the investment objective and strategy will be successfully achieved while the sub-funds do not have control of the investments of the Underlying Funds.
Some sub-funds may distribute income gross of expense and/or at its discretion pay dividend out of the capital of the sub-funds.
Payment of dividends out of capital amounts to a return or withdrawal of part of an investor’s original investment or from any capital gains attributable to that original investment.
Any distributions involving payment of dividends out of the sub-funds’ capital or payment of dividends effectively out of the sub-funds’ capital (as the case may be) may result in an immediate reduction of the net asset value per share.
Investors should not invest in the Fund unless the intermediary who sells it to you has advised you that it is suitable for you and has explained how it is consistent with your investment objectives.

Important Legal Information


Distributions are made to those who are registered shareholders of the fund on the record date. Distributions are paid on the pay date. Estimates can change prior to the record date depending on market conditions and number of shares outstanding. All dates and distributions are subject to board approval. Net investment income distribution estimates do not include short- or long-term capital gain distributions the funds may be making. The actual amounts of net investment income shareholders will receive will be reported, along with any short-term capital gain distributions, as Ordinary Dividends on Form 1099-DIV.
