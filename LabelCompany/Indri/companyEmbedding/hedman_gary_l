                                    Patents by Inventor Ronald Hedman
                                




                    Ronald Hedman has filed for patents to protect the following inventions. This listing includes patent applications that are pending as well as patents that have already been granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
                







Gel air freshener and method of unsealing such gel air freshener



Patent number:  8141793
                                            

Abstract:  The present invention is a gel air freshener article of manufacture comprising a gel air freshener composition and a container that provides a method for unsealing and opening without undue exertion by the consumer. The article of manufacture according to the present invention includes the gel air freshener composition and a container comprising a base portion and axially displaceable cover in telescopic registry, wherein the cover is axially displaced away from the base portion by rotation. The unsealing of the container is achieved through the coordination of camming locks, which comprise an upper ramped surface, with spike-shaped locking wedges that comprise a beveled toe portion, elongated shaft portion and camming head portion. Rotation of the cover in a first direction relative to the base portion locks the toe end and shaft portions of the spike-shaped locking wedges beneath the camming locks.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Grant
                                            

Filed: 
                        July 14, 2009
                    

Date of Patent: 
                                                        March 27, 2012
                        

Assignee: 
                                                                        The Dial Corporation
                                

Inventors: 
                                                                
                                Judith A. Wallis, Elizabeth Polaski, Steven Carter, Deborah J. Cowan, Gary L. Berge, Ronald Hedman
                            





Liquid product pouring and measuring package with drain-back spout fitment and tight-sealing measuring cup assembly



Patent number:  7959034
                                            

Abstract:  An improved dispensing package for liquids is described comprising a combination pouring spout fitment, a closure that functions as a measuring cup when removed and inverted, and a bottle. The improved liquid seal between the closure and the fitment is made possible through mismatched bevels on the closure and fitment respectively wherein the sharper angled bevel on one of the parts buries into the wider angled bevel of the other part. The applied torque is prevented from loosening prematurely through a thread configuration form that allows the closure to seat securely into the spout fitment with the closure threads pushing back up against the bottom surfaces of the fitment threads in a “locked” arrangement. The correct alignment of the fitment on the bottle is made possible through the coordination of a thread stop on the fitment and corresponding locking lug on the neck of the bottle.

Filed:

                                                        June 14, 2011
                        

Assignee:

Inventors:

GEL AIR FRESHENER AND METHOD OF UNSEALING SUCH GEL AIR FRESHENER



Publication number:  20110011947
