Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc. (BCEI) down -2.92 per cent in the past week, is under coverage of 25 analysts who collectively recommend a sell rating on stock. 1 of the analysts have a buy or better rating; the 1 sells versus 3 underperforms. The 20 equity analysts who rate the stock have an average target price at $2.92, with individual targets ranging between $1 and $6.78. The shares closed last trade at $3.33, implying that analysts see shares falling about -12.31 per cent in 12 months’ time.
Insider Activity: Insiders look mixed about the prospects of the company that they seem to trade shares both ways while they are -36.81 down so far this year. A Director at Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc. (BCEI) sold shares in the company in a transaction completed on Wednesday December 02, 2015. Chronister Marvin M offloaded 5,315 shares in the company at an average price of $8.33 and ended up generating $44,300 in proceeds. Chronister Marvin M retains 45,077 shares in the company after this transaction. A Sr. VP, Planning & Reserves in the company, Boone Lynn, on Friday December 05, 2014 spent $231,100 from the purchase of 11,000 shares at $8.33 each. Insiders are expected to know better about the health and prospects of their company, which is why insiders’ move deserves attention.
Earnings to Watch: Investors considering BCEI stock at the going market price of $3.33/share should know the stock will next release quarterly results for the June 2016 quarter. For the reporting quarter, analysts expect the company to deliver -$0.29 in earnings per share (EPS). That would represent a 107.14% year-over-year increase. Revenue for the same period is expected to arrive at $53.42M.
Earnings Roundup: In the last fiscal quarter alone, Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc. generated around $44.17M in revenue and net income of -$0.46/share. That compares with the consensus estimate $48.13M and -$0.64/share, respectively. For the prior quarter revenue for the company hit $72.15M, with earnings at -$0.17/share.
Analyst Coverage: Macquarie has been a brokerage house following shares of Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc. (BCEI), so its rating change is noteworthy. The stock was downgraded to Underperform from Neutral, wrote analysts at Macquarie, in a note issued to clients on Monday May 09, 2016. There was another key note issued by Credit Suisse on Tuesday March 08, 2016. The firm lowered its rating on BCEI from Outperform to Neutral.
Price Momentum: Despite the -11.9% decrease in value, the stock’s new closing price represents a -86.09% fall in value from company’s one year high of $23.1. The stock is currently holding below its 50 day moving average of $30.69 and above its 200 day moving average of $2.8. Over the last three months and over the last six months, the shares of Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc. (BCEI), have changed -29.02% and 3.89%, respectively.
