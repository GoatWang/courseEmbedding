                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch to Rate Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2014-GC23 Commercial Mtg P-T Certs; Presale Issued | Business Wire


























































      Fitch to Rate Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2014-GC23 Commercial 
      Mtg P-T Certs; Presale Issued
    





July 15, 2014 12:40 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued its presale report on Citigroup Commercial 
      Mortgage Trust 2014-GC23 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$49,642,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$85,798,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$300,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$345,240,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$81,766,000 class A-AB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$957,932,000* class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$80,084,000* class X-B 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$95,486,000b class A-S 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$80,084,000b class B 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$224,853,000b class PEZ 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$49,283,000b class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$24,641,000*a class X-C 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$64,683,000a class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$24,641,000a class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$9,241,000a class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (*) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      (a) Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      (b) The class A-S, class B and class C certificates may be exchanged for 
      class PEZ certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for 
      the class A-S, class B and class C certificates.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of July 8, 2014. Fitch does not expect to rate the $55,443,996*a class 
      X-D, and the $46,202,996a class G certificates.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 83 loans secured by 99 commercial properties 
      having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.23 billion as 
      of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust by Citigroup 
      Global Markets Realty Corp.; Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company; GS 
      Commercial Real Estate LP; MC-Five Mile Commercial Mortgage Finance LLC; 
      Redwood Commercial Mortgage Corporation; and Rialto Mortgage Finance, 
      LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 79.5% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 87%, and asset summary reviews of 88.8% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Improved Leverage from Recent Transactions: The pool's Fitch debt 
      service coverage ratio (DSCR) and loan to value (LTV) are 1.25x and 
      99.4%, respectively, are better than the 2013 and 2014 year-to-date 
      (YTD) averages of 1.29x and 101.6% and 1.19x and 105.6%, respectively.
    

      Large High Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loan: The largest loan in the 
      pool, 28-40 West 23rd (11.4%), has a Fitch credit opinion of 'A-sf' on a 
      stand-alone basis. In the context of the pool, the loan's credit opinion 
      is 'AAAsf'. The loan is collateralized by a 571,205 square foot (sf) 
      mixed-use office and retail building located in Manhattan.
    

      Limited Additional Debt: No loans have subordinate debt in place. The 
      pool has one pari passu loan, Selig Portfolio (7.9%), with the 
      controlling $100 million note securitized in the GSMS 2014-GC21 
      transaction.
    

      Below-Average Amortization: Three of the top five loans are full-term 
      interest-only. As such, the pool has a significantly above-average 
      proportion of interest-only loans (24.4% of the pool balance versus the 
      2013 average of 17.1%) and above-average concentration of partial 
      interest loans (43.7% versus the 2013 average of 34%). The pool is 
      scheduled to amortize 11% prior to maturity.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 10.8% below the 
      most recent net operating income (NOI) (for properties for which 
      historical NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during the most recent reporting period). Unanticipated further declines 
      in property-level NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted loans, and could result in potential rating actions on the 
      certificates. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to 
      CGCMT 2014-GC23 certificates and found that the transaction displays 
      slightly above-average sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a 
      scenario in which NCF declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a 
      downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'Asf' could result. In a 
      more severe scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's 
      NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could 
      result. The presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional 
      stresses and sensitivities on pages 74 - 75.
    

      The master servicer will be Midland Loan Services, Inc., rated 'CMS1' by 
      Fitch. The special servicer will be Rialto Capital Advisors, LLC, rated 
      'CSS2-' by Fitch.
