IRadimed
Innovators in MRI Patient Care
        The value of Non–Magnetic patient care products may not be readily apparent until an adverse event occurs. IRadimed is the world's first 
        and only provider of Non–Magnetic* IV infusion pumps designed specifically for MRI use. Infusing IV medications at the MRI bore can improve patient safety, staff 
        safety and the patient MRI care cycle. Infusing critical patient medications, anesthetics and fluids at the MRI bore with the MRidium™ eliminates projectile 
        risks and introduces the same patient bedside practices to the MRI that are common throughout the rest of the hospital.

          MRidium™ 3860+
          The Worlds Only 'Non–Magnetic'   IV Infusion Pump

          The MRidium™ 3860+ and its ability to infuse medications in the MRI room extends the same quality of bedside care experienced in 
          other areas of the hospital right into the MRI suite.
        

          The MRidium™ 3860+ helps replace 'work around' solutions like running long lines from conventional pumps through a sealed MRI door or wave guide. 
          The 'work around' practice of placing long lines from outside the MRI control room may lead to questionable flow rates and alarm delays due to line occlusions, 
          increased infection rates and costly medication waste.
        

          Cleared by the FDA for use with up to 3T MR scanners the MRidium™ MRI Infusion System is designed for the continuous delivery of fluids 
          and medications for your patients within the MRI environment. The MRidium™ 3860+ allows clinicians to safely and reliably run both volumetric 
          and syringe dosed infusions by way of Syringe, Bags, and Bottles.
        

          The Wireless Remote eliminates the delays caused by stopping a crucial scan just to review, titrate or deliver a bolus. The MRidium™  3865 
          is a valuable tool to help decrease the amount of time a patient spends in the MR scanner which may lead to improved throughput and care.
        

          The MRidium™ 3860+ 'Dose Error Reduction System' provides a comprehensive safety solution at the patients 
          'point of care'. Designed to reduce infusion errors, the DERS custom drug library 
          enhances the quality of patient care, maintains compliance with National Safety Standards and provides potential cost savings. Clinically approved and validated by your 
          pharmacy, the DERS custom drug library with its pre-programmed hard and soft 'SafeGuards' helps prevent infusion errors by defining clinically acceptable dosing ranges.
        

MRidium™ MRI Infusion System provides the 'Safety, Accuracy and Reliability' you expect for patient's requiring continuous infusion's within the MRI environment.

Have more than one IV to infuse?
          The MRidium™ 3861 Sidecar Channel provides an optional 2nd channel of continuous fluid delivery. The addition of an MRidium™ 3861 Sidecar allows hospitals 
          to convert their single channel MRidium™ 3860+ infusion pump into a Dual-Channel System designed for simultaneous delivery of both small and large 
          volumetric fluids.
          Full functionality with the MRidium™ 3865 Bi-Directional Wireless Remote Control provides clinicians with the flexibility to control both infusion channels from a single 
          remote. By simply attaching the MRidium™ 3861 Sidecar Channel to the main unit clinicians may Program, Titrate and View up to two separate infusions simultaneously.

  Performing Secondary Infusions with the MRidium 3860

                  In Clinical practice, the terms secondary and piggyback are used interchangeably to describe the intravenous administration of intermittent medications.
                  A secondary/piggyback intravenous infusion is the delivery of an additional fluid or medication through a ´single´ primary intravenous line from a 
                  second source of fluid with a secondary set of intravenous tubing. Secondary delivery requires only a single channel on the MRidium™ 3860+ MRI infusion system.
NOTE: The Secondary/Piggyback infusion option is only available when programming the MRidium™ 3860+ MRI Pump in the basic Rate/Volume (mL/hr) mode. 
                  When the DERS Drug Library or the Dose Rate Calculator features are used the Secondary/Piggyback option is not available.
                  This infusion practice offers a convenient method of administering an intermittent infusion or a One-time IV medication dose (typically electrolytes or antibiotics), 
                  because it enables a primary continuous infusion to automatically resume and flush the secondary medication in the primary tubing after the secondary infusion has 
                  been completed.
                  The MRidium™ 3860+ MRI Infusion System supports secondary infusions in the form of automatic sequential piggybacking. When setting up the MRidium™ 3860+ 
                  MRI pump for a secondary infusion the following are required:
                  1. Standard IV Administration Set with an integrated ´backcheck´ valve. (hospital supplied)*
                  2. Standard Secondary Infusion Set (hospital supplied)*
                  3. MRidium™ 1058 MRI IV Extension Set**
                  4. Non-Magnetic Hanger*
                  *For instructions on setting up the Primary and Secondary infusions please refer to your hospitals ´Policy and Procedure´ guidelines.
                  **For instructions setting up the MRidium™ 1058 MRI IV Extension Set and Programming the MRidium™ 3860+ IV Pump for Secondary infusions; 
                  please refer to the MRidium™ 3860/3860+ 
                  MRI Monitor/Infusion System Operation Manual, Part Number 1138; Section 4.4 Secondary Infusion Configuration.

Zacks Rank:

Style Scores:



B Value | B Growth | D Momentum | B VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

          MRidium™ 3860+
          The Worlds Only 'Non–Magnetic'   IV Infusion Pump

          The MRidium™ 3860+ and its ability to infuse medications in the MRI room extends the same quality of bedside care experienced in 
          other areas of the hospital right into the MRI suite.

          and syringe dosed infusions by way of Syringe, Bags, and Bottles.
        

          The Wireless Remote eliminates the delays caused by stopping a crucial scan just to review, titrate or deliver a bolus. The MRidium™  3865 
          is a valuable tool to help decrease the amount of time a patient spends in the MR scanner which may lead to improved throughput and care.
        

          The MRidium™ 3860+ 'Dose Error Reduction System' provides a comprehensive safety solution at the patients 
          'point of care'. Designed to reduce infusion errors, the DERS custom drug library 
          enhances the quality of patient care, maintains compliance with National Safety Standards and provides potential cost savings. Clinically approved and validated by your 
          pharmacy, the DERS custom drug library with its pre-programmed hard and soft 'SafeGuards' helps prevent infusion errors by defining clinically acceptable dosing ranges.
        

MRidium™ MRI Infusion System provides the 'Safety, Accuracy and Reliability' you expect for patient's requiring continuous infusion's within the MRI environment.
