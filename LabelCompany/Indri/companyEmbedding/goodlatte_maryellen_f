Maryellen F. Goodlatte
Glenn, Feldmann, Darby & Goodlatte
Roanoke

Title:  Shareholder/officer
Other legal specialties:  Land use and commercial transactions
Birthplace:  Norwood, Mass.
Education: Bachelor’s degree, Bates College ; law degree, Washington & Lee University School of Law
Husband:  U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-6th District)
Children:   Jennifer Goodlatte Barblan, 27; Rob Goodlatte, 24
Hobbies:  Reading 
First job as lawyer:  Associate with Roanoke firm of Wetherington, Flippin, Melchionna, Bosserman & Burton
Fan of:  Virginia Tech Hokies
Favorite vacation spot:  Almost anywhere in the Shenandoah Valley
Recently read book:  “The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company That Is Connecting the World” by David Kirkpatrick
Career Mentor:  Bob Glenn (senior partner and current president of the Virginia Board of Bar Examiners)
What types of clients do you represent? 
“Industrial and commercial developers, lenders, nonprofit institutions, closely held businesses and their principals.”
What is the outlook for the commercial real estate industry in Virginia next year?  
“I believe the outlook continues to be challenging.  Strong and lean organizations should be poised to take advantage of opportunities that will develop.  Over the next year, I believe that commercial lenders will continue to tighten controls on real estate-based loans. As confidence returns to the marketplace and the uncertainty associated with current government policies is resolved, the Virginia real estate industry will rebound.”

About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.

About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
