Charter Communications said it struck a new partnership with 605, a data and analytics company that is controlled by Dolan Family Ventures. As part of the pact, Charter will appoint two members to the smaller company’s board of directors.
Under the terms of the deal,  Charter will  provide 605 with aggregated and anonymized television platform data from all of its cable system operations nationally. Charter will not share customers’ personally identifiable data with 605. In turn, 605 will utilize its proprietary data infrastructure and analytics capabilities to enhance advertising and campaign measurement solutions for Spectrum Reach, the advertising sales division of Charter.







“We believe our efforts can accelerate the transformation in the advertising industry’s approach to measurement and accountability by moving beyond traditional ratings to include impressions in buying decisions,” said  Kristin Dolan, CEO and founder of 605, in a statement. “Given our close and longstanding relationship with their management team, we are pleased to have Charter as our strategic partner at 605.”
In May, Spectrum Reach introduced a new product developed in partnership with 605 for linear media planning and optimization called the AudienceApp. The AudienceApp makes it possible  to better identify and target specific audiences on linear television and execute more effective campaigns. Spectrum Reach will launch the product in Austin on August 15, and complete the roll out across the company’s entire footprint by mid-2018.
605 was established by Dolan Family Ventures through its acquisition of Analytics Media Group in November 2016. Investment banking firm PJT Partners is providing consulting services to Dolan Family Ventures and provided advisory support for the Charter partnership.
The initial Board of Directors for 605 will be comprised of: James L. Dolan, Executive Chairman, The Madison Square Garden Company; Kristin Dolan, Managing Partner, Dolan Family Ventures and Founder & CEO, 605;  David Kline, Executive Vice President, Charter and President of Spectrum Reach; and James Blackley, Executive Vice President, Engineering and Information Technology, Charter Communications

Late to the party again? Cable still doesn’t get it. You have to put customer experience first. Millennials and cord cutters are more likely to buy in if they are rewarded by lower subscriber rates. Search and social media understands how to trade services for behavioral data, cable doesn’t!
Cable’s missed revenue opportunities from targeted ads are astronomical. I along with others have well documented it in publications over the past twenty years.
Amazon, Google, Facebook, Twitter have all used a form of artificial intelligence influenced targeted ads to create market values that now exceed cable. They found a niche that cable missed. Cable lost control of content cost by raising rates with impunity to a tipping point. While social media and search are controlled by ad dollar, much like the early days of broadcast TV.
Google search and YouTube have developed a targeted ad based model with over a billion hours of content watched daily.
Cable TV’s target marketing ad ventures are fundamentally flawed. They focus on demographics, and fail to identify the individual behavioral current and future household interests. All voluntary given to social media for the benefits of “free” services.
Have to make the connection between the social media and MSO subscriber records and communicating behavioral marketing – business advertising, discounts, specific videos/groups, family albums – providing subscriber awareness of TV programming — movies, products, etc. similar to Amazon and Groupon. This would make subscriber stickier and substantially reduce turnover.
Millennial consumers are the largest generational group to be widely targeted by marketers, and for good reason. They shop quite differently than older age groups, and online retailers must learn to relate to them in order to capture their loyalty.
But again, cable has a reputation of not rewarding loyalty.

Simple Website Flaw Exposed Data Of Charter Internet Customers

[Photo: Flickr user Mrhayata]By Daniel Stuckey5 minute ReadA security flaw discovered in the website of Charter Communications, a cable and Internet provider active in 28 states, may have exposed the personal account details of its customers.advertisementSecurity researcher Eric Taylor discovered the cable provider’s vulnerability as part of his research, and demonstrated how a simple header modification performed with a browser plug-in could reveal details about Charter’s Internet subscribers. After Fast Company notified Charter of the issue, the company said it had installed a fix within hours.The vulnerability could reveal personal information of “millions” of the company’s subscribers, claimed Taylor, chief information officer for Cinder, an Internet startup. But a spokesperson for Charter told Fast Company that “the vast majority of Charter customers use a version of the site on which this security vulnerability was not an issue,” and that the number of customers affected was less than one million. The company is auditing its systems, he said, and has so far “seen no evidence of any password or data hacks.” The exposed data did not include credit card numbers.Taylor, 18, discovered the issue with his colleague Blake Welsh, after recently finding a similar vulnerability in Verizon’s online customer service system. Luckily for Verizon, he said, that flaw “only exposed user IDs, phone numbers, and device names.” But the amount of user information exposed in Charter’s case, Taylor said, was “way way way more.”Sensitive account information exposed by the simple hack includes payment details, modem serial numbers, device names, account numbers, home addresses, and more.With 4.7 million residential Internet customers, Connecticut-based Charter is the nation’s fourth-largest cable operator. The company announced Monday it’s going through with a $10.4 billion deal to acquire Si Newhouse Jr.’s Syracuse, N.Y.-based Bright House Networks, the nation’s sixth-largest cable company. The deal will expand Charter’s customer base by more than 2 million, bumping its rank to the third-largest cable operator in the country.How A Hacker Could Impersonate SubscribersCharter’s site identified its customers through their IP addresses, akin to the way automated customer support hotlines identify customers by their phone numbers when they call. Thus, obtaining a subscriber’s IP address is all an attacker would need to see their account details. (IP addresses are the unique numbers for all Internet-connected devices and applications, and are increasingly easy to gather.)advertisementUsing a lightweight add-on for Firefox to modify HTTP headers, called “X-Forwarded-For Header,” an attacker essentially could pass off a Charter customer’s IP address as their own. The plug-in, as its description explains, “Inserts a X-Forwarded-For field into the HTTP Request header. Some servers look at this field to identify the originating IP address.”Such a trick can be easily automated, not unlike a vulnerability that Andrew “weev” Auernheimer used to glean 114,000 iPad users’ email addresses from AT&T’s website in 2010.“In theory, anyone with minor programming skills could code an automated program that scans every Charter IP and returns the customers billing info,” Taylor explained. Because ISPs like Charter distribute Internet services through blocks of IP addresses, an ambitious hacker could have incrementally added the number 1 to the end of a targeted address and see a different Charter customer’s account details each time.“Personal information leakage as a result of such a vulnerability opens customers up to being attacked on other services such as email providers, cellular providers, and work-related functions with many untold consequences,” said Hector “Sabu” Monsegur, a former black hat hacker and security consultant.After using a subscriber’s IP address to make the simple header modification, visiting a generic URL on Charter’s website to request a forgotten user name exposed a pre-filled form containing that user’s last name and home address data:

From there, clicking “Next” would expose the account holder’s user name.advertisementAs well, visiting a basic URL to create a new user name would allow the creation of secondary user accounts and email addresses:
After a new email address is set up, Taylor explained the subscriber’s sensitive information could be accessed via API links or viewing part of the site’s source code. “For any regular black hat that just wants to wreak havoc on a certain person, this exploit will allow them to take full control over Charter customer accounts,” said the teenage researcher.He also theorized that such access to user information could be a sneaky way for law enforcement to “link customer billing info with nothing more than an IP address and no court order.”“Having a serial number to customer modems could allow attackers with enough access to monitor traffic at the ISP level. It could also help rogue law enforcement agents who are looking to circumvent the justice system,” Monsegur said, adding that this type of problem is precisely what U.S. attorneys are pursuing: large corporations who fail to protect customer data.Stewart Baker, former general counsel at NSA and assistant policy secretary at DHS under President George W. Bush, said he was skeptical that the vulnerability was meant to benefit law enforcement. “In fact, because it operates automatically and doesn’t require a subpoena, most well-advised ISPs wouldn’t adopt this as a way to give data to law enforcement.”Baker, who hosts a podcast on cyberlaw, said the flaw might still have been intentional, “for the benefit of customer service reps who can easily do a lookup of a customer complaining about service problems. But I confess that I’m guessing.”advertisementCharter isn’t the only company that’s left doors open to its subscriber accounts, according to Taylor. He describes the issue as a pattern he’s found with other large ISPs that identify customers by IP addresses. “I first found the same exploit in Comcast in 2013,” he said. “I would spoof my IP address and go to the ‘forgot username’ page, and it would pull up the address on file and then the user names and phone number on the account.” Taylor said he reported that bug to Comcast privately.Cyber attacks are on the rise. A survey by PriceWaterhouseCoopers found that last year the number of detected incidents leapt 48% over 2013, to a total of 42.8 million, and the number of respondents reporting losses of $20 million or more almost doubled. In a recent report, Juniper Research warned of the rising cost that hacking poses to global industry, estimating businesses will see damages of more than 2 trillion dollars by 2019.“Keeping our customers and network secure is priority number one at Charter,” the company spokesperson said.advertisementRelated StoriesIdeasThis Dam Has Been A Disaster–Can Turning It Into a Solar Plant Save It?TechnologyHow Will We Police The Police?LeadershipAverage Trump Cabinet Member Stands To Gain Potential $313K From Obamacare Tax RepealadvertisementVideoIdeasIdeasThis Dam Has Been A Disaster–Can Turning It Into a Solar Plant Save It?IdeasAutomated Buses Are Here, Now We Have To Decide How They Will Reshape Our CitiesIdeasHow Al Gore’s “An Inconvenient Sequel” Plans To Convert Viewers Into ActivistsEntertainmentEntertainmentKesha Goes Back Into Old Home Movies In New Anti-Nostalgic Music VideoEntertainmentPanorama Is Around The Corner: This Week In MusicEntertainmentAngelina Jolie’s Casting Strategy Is Either Meaningful Or ExploitativeCo.DesignProductOMG!

The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Sues Time Warner Cable, Charter Communications, Inc. and DBA Spectrum, Inc. for Firing an Employee with a Disability
Jul 6 17
The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed suit on July 6, 2017 charging that Time Warner Cable and Charter Communications, DBA Spectrum, Inc. violated federal discrimination law by refusing to accommodate an employee with a disability and firing her days after learning of her diagnosis. According to the EEOC's lawsuit, Time Warner Cable initially granted the employee unpaid leave when she requested an accommodation to seek medical attention for her disability. The EEOC alleges that once Time Warner Cable learned of the employee's disability diagnosis, they failed to provide her additional unpaid leave so that she could undergo treatment for her medical condition. Such alleged conduct violates the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended. The EEOC filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (EEOC versus Time Warner Cable, Inc. and Charter Communications, Inc. DBA Spectrum) after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. The agency's suit seeks back pay, along with compensatory and punitive damages for the individual, as well as injunctive relief intended to prevent any future discrimination and harassment in the workplace.
