William Pevear, President and Co-Founder

Mr. Pevear has 40 years experience in system integration and end-to-end development of image-based commercial products.  Before co-founding GeoVantage, Mr. Pevear was Director of Product Development for TASC (now a subsidiary of Northrup-Grumman) Information Division where he was the chief architect of new business ventures built upon the creative application of advanced technologies.  Mr. Pevear performed requirements analysis for technology driven products, led development and prototyping of new product concepts involving digital hardware/software architectures. In this role at TASC, Mr Pevear was the key business architect for TASC’s entry into commercial remote sensing targeted at the precision agriculture market. This endeavor resulted in the sale of all remote sensing operations to agriculture giant, Conagra, and the eventual sale by Conagra of all camera system technology to Applanix, a subsidiary of Trimble.
From 1986 to 1988, Mr. Pevear reported to the president of ICAD, Inc. (now a subsidiary of Oracle) responsible for supporting business and product development of ICAD’s knowledge-based automated mechanical design and manufacturing system.  From 1982 to 1986 Mr. Pevear was Vice President of Engineering at Siemens-Allis Automation, Inc. where he developed a control product line for automated manufacturing utilizing computer controlled assembly for robotic machining centers.  This product line included unique software, digital communications, and distributed control concepts.  Mr. Pevear held research positions at Polaroid Corporation in the 70’s directing Polaroid activities in image processing and image-based process control. This work included extensive pioneering efforts in digital image processing, image sensor technology, and development of imagery-based solutions for commercial applications. Mr. Pevear received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Northeastern University in 1968.

Matthew Herring, Senior Vice President and Co-Founder


Mr. Herring has spent the last thirteen years running GeoVantage’s sales and marketing from a start-up camera technology company to an agriculture and forestry focused imagery service provider. He worked in this position through the 2005 sale of GeoVantage to John Deere Agri Services at which time Herring took over Deere’s forest imagery services sales team. In 2008, Mr. Herring purchased GeoVantage back from Deere with Mr. Pevear. Prior to joining GeoVantage Inc. Mr. Herring spent ten years managing sales and marketing in business to business environments. The majority of that time as with LVMH’s premier beverage importer Clicquot Inc. Mr. Herring managed a region of Clicquot’s Inc’s sales program for their exclusive portfolio of beverage brands handled by an extensive network of channel partners throughout the Midwestern United States. Matthew holds a BA in Psychology from the College of Wooster. Email me

GeoVantage Weed Pressure - GeoVantage

Weed Pressure
Home Weed Pressure 

























Weed Detection
Weeds have a negative impact on yields. “Even one weed per 100 feet of (soybean) row can impact yield,” says Rich Keller, Editor, AgProfessional Magazine in the article Even one weed impacts yield.
Research from The South Dakota State University showed that early season weed competition for resources (light, water, etc…) resulted in as much as 40 bushels per acre yield loss. This is certainly not a small matter!
The difficult part is identifying areas in the field where weed pressure exists. Conventional scouting methods can certainly find instances of weed pressure, but it is extremely difficult to see each and every part of each and every field from an economic perspective.
One of, if not the, most economical and effective means of identifying weed pressure is with an aerial image, especially an NDVI. The below set of images shows that there is a variation in the field. At first glance, it looks like a very small portion of the field is extremely “healthy,” as shown by the dark green color in the image. Upon further investigation in the field, the scout found that there was indeed something causing the variability, weeds!
NDVI – Notice the darker green spots in the south east quadrant of the field

Irrigation Application Case Study



Irrigation Application
Water is certainly a finite resource, and the decision to utilize irrigation is a major one. In Nebraska, for example, over 5 million acres are under irrigation. It can be quite expensive to irrigate, so ensuring the water gets applied properly is essential. As The University of Nebraska Lincoln puts it:

“The objective of irrigation management is to provide supplemental water needed by the plant while maximizing the value of water.”

In order to “maximize the value of water,” the grower needs to know that the water is being applied properly. Determining if there are issues with the application of water is sometimes difficult to determine during the extremely busy growing season. One economic and efficient method to monitoring the application of water is the utilization of aerial imagery. Below is an NDVI of a field under pivot irrigation. This image was taken in the summer of 2013 and immediately showed both the agronomist and irrigation manager that nozzles were clogged and not supplying water to the field. Knowing this information enabled the expedient repair to the nozzle so the proper amount of water could then be applied.

[caption id="attachment_1843" align="aligncenter" width="486"] NDVI Image of Field Under Pivot Irrigation[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_1844" align="aligncenter" width="344"] NDVI of Field Under Hose Irrigation[/caption]

Whether you are investigating irrigation management or currently managing irrigation, an image provides near real-time information on the application of water on a field by field basis. For further reading on irrigation management, below are a couple of links.

GeoVantage and Mapshots Announce Software Integration



Share Article

















GeoVantage, a leading provider of aerial imagery for the agriculture industry, and MapShots, a leading provider of precision agriculture software, today announced an integrated imagery ordering capability between GeoVantage’s AgOrder and MapShots’ AgStudio product lines.






Peabody, MA (PRWEB)
February 04, 2014
 Mapshots and GeoVantage Announce Software Communication Link Streamlining the Aerial Imagery Order Process
GeoVantage, a leading provider of aerial imagery for the agriculture industry, and MapShots, a leading provider of precision agriculture software, today announced an integrated imagery ordering capability between GeoVantage’s AgOrder and MapShots’ AgStudio product lines.
The integration of imagery order and automatic delivery capabilities between the two programs, AgOrder and AgStudio, enables customers to quickly and efficiently order and utilize aerial imagery to aid in making more informed crop management decisions thereby increasing profit or reducing costs.
The agriculture marketplace is seeing a continued trend toward the adoption of precision agriculture techniques. As such, there is a strong demand for precision agriculture software services that help agricultural enterprises extract the most value from the data sets collected. Farms are getting larger and more geographically disperse while the available time for field work has remained the same. Aerial imagery allows customers to “see” all of their fields and respond rapidly to changing conditions. 
“I am pleased to announce that GeoVantage’s aerial imagery can now be ordered, delivered and utilized within MapShots products. GeoVantage’s aerial imagery service is known for its quality and timeliness, and MapShots software is considered a market leader. This is a perfect fit,” said Nate Taylor, GeoVantage Agriculture Sales and Marketing Manager.
“We are pleased to provide our AgStudio users with easy access to GeoVantage’s imagery products,” said Ted Macy, Vice-President of Operations at MapShots. “Having the GeoVantage data combined with other agronomic data in AgStudio will enable better crop management decisions.”
