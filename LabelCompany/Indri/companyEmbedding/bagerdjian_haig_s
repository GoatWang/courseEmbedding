Quarterly Shareholders Conference Call
February 11, 2016, 01:00 PM ET
Executives
Haig Bagerdjian - Chairman, President and CEO
Alan Steel - Chief Financial Officer
Analysts
Operator
Good day, everyone. And welcome to today's Quarterly Shareholders Conference Call. At this time participants are in a listen-only mode. Later you will have the opportunity ask questions, during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note this call is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure to turn today’s program over to Haig Bagerdjian. Please go ahead sir.
Haig Bagerdjian
Thank you. Good morning. And thank you for joining us today. With me is Alan Steel, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we answer any questions, you may have regarding the press release, I will ask Alan to discuss forward-looking statements and to briefly review the numbers that were released this morning. Then, I will make few comments, and we'll open the lines for your questions. Alan?
Alan Steel
Thanks, Haig. Certain statements in this conference call may contain forward-looking statements concerning the company’s projected revenues, earnings and cash flow, the planned focus on internal and external growth, new markets, sales initiatives, steps to reduce costs, improving customer service, and new business. Now such statements are inherently subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from those expected or anticipated in the forward-looking statements.
In addition to the factors described in the company’s SEC filings, the following among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this conference. Lower-than-expected new sales, operating income and earnings; less-than-expected growth; actions of competitors including business combinations, technological breakthroughs, new product offerings and promotional successes; the risks that anticipated new business may not occur or will be delayed and general economic conditions that may adversely impact our business.
Hopefully, all of you have had a chance to see the press release, so I’ll only cover a few items. Sales for the second quarter were $9.7 million and for the first half of the fiscal – of fiscal 2016 were $20.5 million, each of those numbers is about double that of the prior year due to the July, 2015 acquisition of Modern VideoFilm.
The quarter in six months variations in gross margin was due to continuing improvement in Point.360, offset by a lower margin associated with Modern. Modern margins were affected by some costs which have since been eliminated and Haig will talk more about these in a minute.
From a financial reporting perspective, the acquisition of Modern's assets were treated as a bargain purchase. This is the result of the appraised value of the purchased assets being greater than the appraised fair value of the stock and warrants paid for those assets. Bottom line, we reported net income for the six month period of $3.1 million. Haig?
Haig Bagerdjian
Thank you, Alan. As Alan mentioned, our quarterly revenues were $9.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, compared to $5.5 million in the same period last year. $4.2 million of the increase was due to addition of Modern VideoFilm operations which were acquired in early July.
For the six months period Modern accounted for $9.4 million of the total increase of $10 million over the same period last year. Since the Modern purchase, we have concentrated on the integration of Point.360 and Modern facilities, personnel, administration and customer relations.
We continue to evaluate work processes and deployment of acquired assets. So far on annualized basis we have eliminated $3.2 million of rent and about $5 million personal related cost.

Modern's footprint has been reduced from 138,000 square foot to 38,000 square foot and are currently consolidating some light operations in Point.360 to other facility. The later is expected to be completed this summer. Operating losses in a three and six month’s period relating to those efforts.
The statement of operations also includes $6.8 million of income which represents for the positive difference between a fair market value of the purchase amount on assets and the stock and warrants given up for the assets. Including the gain, net income for the first half of fiscal 2016 was $3.1 million.
Operator, you can open the line for question-and-answer session.
Question-and-Answer Session

Haig Bagerdjian
Thank you, everyone that is online and those of you that are going to listen later, the recording will be on our website, Alan, for how long?

Haig Bagerdjian

Q3 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call
May 11, 2017, 01:00 PM ET
Executives
Haig Bagerdjian - Chairman, President and CEO
John Schweizer - Vice President, Controller
Analysts
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to today’s Quarterly Shareholder Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this call may be recorded. I’ll be standing by if you should need any assistance.
It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Haig Bagerdjian. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is open.
Haig Bagerdjian
Thank you. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. With me is John Schweizer, our Vice President and Controller. Before we answer any questions you may have regarding the press release, I will ask John to discuss forward-looking statements and to briefly review the numbers that were given this morning in our press release. After, I will make few comments and we will open the lines for questions. John?
John Schweizer
Hi, good morning and thanks Haig. Certain statements in this conference call may contain forward-looking statements concerning the Company’s projected revenues, earnings, and cash flow, the planned focus on internal and external growth, new markets, sales initiatives, steps to reduce costs, and improving customer service, and new business. Such statements are inherently subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors which may cause actual results to be materially different from those expected or anticipated in the forward-looking statements.
In addition to the factors described in the Company’s SEC filings, the following among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this conference: Lower than expected new sales, operating income and earnings; less than expected growth; actions of competitors including business combinations, technological breakthroughs, new product offerings and promotional successes; the risks that anticipated new business may not occur or will be delayed; and general economic conditions that may be adversely impacted – impacting our business.
Hopefully, you’ve all seen the press release, so I’ll mention only a few items. Revenues for the third quarter were $6.7 million, compared to $8.9 million in last year's quarter. For the nine months ended March 31, 2017, revenues were $21.2 million, compared to $29.3 million last year.
Our third quarter’s gross margin was 18% of sales. SG&A expenses were about $3.4 million. We also recorded a $0.4 million impairment charge associated with the company's abandonment of the Movie Q business. In the nine month period, total operating costs have been reduced by 18% when compared to the same period last year.
Just sort of reminder that with respect to the unusual gain and last year’s nine month period, other income included $4.1 million, which represented the $6.8 million difference between the aggregate fair values assigned to the purchased assets of Modern VideoFilm, Inc. and the fair value of the common shares and the warrants given as consideration for the purchase, net of a $2.7 million deferred income tax benefit recorded in connection with the recognition of the gain. Haig?
Haig Bagerdjian
Thank you, John. And in the past, I will keep my comments brief to allow more time to answer your questions. As John mentioned, our revenues were at $6.7 million in third quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to $8.9 million in the last year's third quarter. While third quarter revenues represent an increase over the quarter ended December 31, ’17, nine months revenues were lower than expected due to one customer taking a portion of their business back in-house and loss of some future cost to the competition.

We just ended third quarter. We have seen increase in our localization, specialized quality control and TV Post. We are continuing to consolidate services among our two facilities to attract additional business. We also closed down our Movie Q business at the end of the most recent quarter, as the remaining as the remaining two store leases expired. We believe those moves will further contribute to the bottom line.
We are still experiencing pressure on our cash resources and continue to adjust our cost structure. Total operating costs have been reduced by $6.3 million in the first nine months of the current fiscal year when compared to last year. This includes 35% reduction in our operating costs.
Operator, I would like to address any questions that the conference participants have. So please open the lines.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we do have a question from Stephen Lobo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst
Hello. Hi, good morning. Alan Steel was with your company for many years and I’ve listened to you and Alan many times in the conference calls. What was the reason for his departure?
Haig Bagerdjian
He’s desire to retire. Alan being with us long time and he is employed as a consultant. We are very - how I say, respectful of his decision and saddened that you know, he decided to spend more time with his aging mother.
But Alan has been you know, one of the keystones of our continued operations and control and management of the finances. So John is a steady hand, John being with the company for a long time and he's being you know, in the training program so to speak to become our CEO.
And I think you know, we are moving in that direction. Unfortunately that succession planning has to be altered just because as I indicated Alan decided to expedite his retirement even though he'd been the retirement age for the last two years, he was still part of the organization, training and advising, counselling John to take the helm to speak.
So John is our succession planning person and we will not be doing an external search for that job, but rather keep flowing [ph] Alan in a capacity of consultant and arming John with the capabilities that he needs to assume that role. So nothing in a way of disagreement or help whether age and the desire to spend more time with his ailing mother. She happened to be over 90 years old, so.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Thanks a lot. Post- Modern acquisition the balance sheet has weakened, the gross margin have maybe used, and losses are mounting and it looks like you are in punch [ph] situation right now, how confident are you for weathering this tough period?
Haig Bagerdjian
We are tight, but optimistic and have a game plan. We are executing the game plan, as indicated we have reduced our booking costs by 35% and we are doing things that are you know, basically got a dual throng approach.
We are hiring capable people that are effective in attracting new businesses to replace the businesses that are either unprofitable, abandoned or that are highly competitive and lower margin or simply competition can outbid us you know, and outperform in a sense as either because they are global player or they use a particular service as a loss leader in order to attract a bigger package.
So for those reasons we are investing on one hand, on the other hand we are looking ways to reduce the cash burn or negative margins and doing that we've been able to stabilize the business and increase the revenues.
We had an incredibly difficult time in this previous quarter. As I indicated in our previous phone call, November and December of 2016 were challenging because either a decision by competitors to postpone or not do certain services with us. We saw revenues really dip in at 16, 17 you know level per month and that obviously created humongous negative burn.

We have somewhat recovered. In the quarter we just reported, we saw numbers go up about two and you know, in the month of March we're about two to four. So you know it has been a recovery. We are seeing a decent growth in our localization, our TV Post and our high-end QC and we have every indications to count on the growth of it.
Obviously it's a balancing act trying to see and optimize our operating costs, at the same time find ways to invest in the areas that we see highest probability of growth and margin expansion.
So you know by no means it is easy task, but we believe that we have the game plan and methods to be able to achieve both and that's where we need to and reduce cost, where we have to and a combination of those two should be able to put us in a better life than we are today.
Unidentified Analyst
Thanks, Haig. Those were the questions I had. And all the best for the upcoming quarters. Thank you.
Haig Bagerdjian
Thank you.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And it appears we have no further questions at this time.
Haig Bagerdjian
So thank you all the participants that are on the line but not asking questions. And thank you for asking questions, double thank you because more questions you ask more we’ll be able to give you the color on the numbers but we are looking forward talking to you in the near future when we have other events to report or quarterly reporting again. So thank you and have a wonderful day.
John Schweizer
Thanks. Have a good day.
Haig Bagerdjian
Operator, you can close the line.
Operator
And this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

We provide a lot of sensitive information that can be used to satisfy your curiosity, protect your family, and find the truth about the people in your life. You may not use our service or the information it provides to make decisions about consumer credit, employers, insurance, tenant screening, or any other purposes that would require FCRA compliance.
