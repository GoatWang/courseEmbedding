Local Buffer and Public Cloud for Growth and Usage Spikes

HPE Flexible Capacity prepares you for growth and gives you the agility to get applications to market right away—in minutes—without waiting months to expand the IT infrastructure and budget. So how does it work?
HPE works with you to forecast current and projected capacity—for a minimum commitment—and then creates a local buffer of IT resources beyond what you need now, that you can dip into as needed. The extra capacity is ready to be activated when you need more capacity, and it can easily expand into the Azure public cloud when needed. This ensures you have extra capacity deployed ahead of any oncoming demand.

Cloud-like Economics

The traditional mode of purchasing IT infrastructure often results in provisioning capacity that’s too high or too low for your IT needs. For example, you may spend money on unused capacity to handle unexpected growth, or struggle to meet demand when you don’t have enough capacity, or both.
HPE Flexible Capacity is a service for consumption-based IT payment that aligns cash flow to actual metered capacity usage. By deploying a flexible amount of capacity ahead of oncoming demand, you end up paying only for what you use with no upfront capital outlay.

ST. LOUIS, Feb. 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Enterprise Financial Services Corp (NASDAQ:   EFSC), the holding company for Enterprise Bank & Trust (Enterprise), today announced the completion of its acquisition of Jefferson County Bancshares, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiary Eagle Bank and Trust Company of Missouri (Eagle). The acquisition transforms Enterprise into a $5 billion bank and the fourth-largest community bank in St. Louis. Eagle adds approximately $935 million in assets, $700 million in loans and $770 million in deposits.








"This combination allows us to better serve our combined customer base and continue our shared heritage of investing in our communities," said Peter Benoist, CEO of Enterprise Financial Services Corp. "Together, our strong earning power, expanded scale and position in the St. Louis market enables us to accelerate our growth as we continue to provide the highest level of service to our retail and business customers."
Eagle's 13 branches in the St. Louis metropolitan area, its branch in Perryville, Mo., and five limited-service facilities will continue to operate as Eagle locations until Enterprise completes the integration of the Eagle banking systems. This integration is expected to occur in mid-2017, and at that time all Eagle facilities will be rebranded as Enterprise Bank & Trust. Eagle and Enterprise customers then will have access the full range of products and services, and will also be able to transact business at the combined organization's 34 locations. 
Enterprise Bank & Trust President Scott Goodman will remain in his current role for the combined bank. Eagle CEO Mike Walsh will serve as chairman of the combined bank's St. Louis region. James Graser will remain president of the region. Jim Lally will succeed Peter Benoist as CEO of Enterprise Financial Services Corp, as guided by the succession plan established by the board of directors, effective at the annual shareholders meeting on May 2, 2017. 
About EnterpriseEnterprise Financial Services Corp (NASDAQ:   EFSC), with approximately $5 billion in assets, is a bank holding company headquartered in Clayton, Mo. Enterprise Bank & Trust operates 29 branch offices plus five limited-service facilities in the St. Louis, Kansas City and Phoenix metropolitan areas. EFSC offers a range of business and personal banking services, and wealth management services. Enterprise Trust, a division of Enterprise Bank & Trust, provides financial planning, estate planning, investment management, and trust services to businesses, individuals, institutions, retirement plans and non-profit organizations. Additional information is available at enterprisebank.com.

Local Buffer and Public Cloud for Growth and Usage Spikes

HPE Flexible Capacity prepares you for growth and gives you the agility to get applications to market right away—in minutes—without waiting months to expand the IT infrastructure and budget. So how does it work?
HPE works with you to forecast current and projected capacity—for a minimum commitment—and then creates a local buffer of IT resources beyond what you need now, that you can dip into as needed. The extra capacity is ready to be activated when you need more capacity, and it can easily expand into the Azure public cloud when needed. This ensures you have extra capacity deployed ahead of any oncoming demand.

Cloud-like Economics

The traditional mode of purchasing IT infrastructure often results in provisioning capacity that’s too high or too low for your IT needs. For example, you may spend money on unused capacity to handle unexpected growth, or struggle to meet demand when you don’t have enough capacity, or both.
HPE Flexible Capacity is a service for consumption-based IT payment that aligns cash flow to actual metered capacity usage. By deploying a flexible amount of capacity ahead of oncoming demand, you end up paying only for what you use with no upfront capital outlay.
