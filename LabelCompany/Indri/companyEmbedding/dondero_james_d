What to look for in February PMI data

A Tradable Bounce for US Equities?
By James Dondero | February 16, 2016 While stocks finished last week in the red the broad market averages closed strongly, which suggests the bulls may have wrestled the ball back from the bears. Market internals were also encouraging, showing roughly 50% fewer new 52-week lows than just a few weeks ago. The reason for the strength was due to a long overdue bounce in the... Read More...

A Possible Short-Term Bottom for Stocks, However Credit Continues to Loom
By James Dondero | October 2, 2015 Stocks finally had a good week, as both the S&P 500 and NASDAQ held their August 24th lows. Even more important is that both exchanges saw few new 52-wk lows in the (testing) process, which suggests the market has likely put a short term bottom “in place.” That being said, widening credit spreads remain not only a headwind –...

By James Dondero | September 21, 2015 Markets were quite volatile last week, with stocks reacting negatively to the Fed’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged. While the FOMC did make it clear rates were likely to rise by year end, “lower for longer” is the message to which markets are now adjusting. Bonds however, are benefitting from the announcement as the relatively high yields on... Read More... Read More

Markets Await Federal Reserve Decision
By Jim Dondero | September 14, 2015 US stocks finally had a quiet week, ahead of one of the most widely anticipated FOMC meetings ever. While the broad market averages have bounced off their mini-meltdown lows, bottoming is typically a process rather than event and those lows may well see further testing in the days and weeks ahead. Looking around the world, developed markets remain in... Read More... Read More

By James Dondero | September 08, 2015 US stocks finished the week lower, unable to build on their rally off the Aug 24th lows. Stepping back, while stocks could be quite oversold here, market bottoms are typically a process versus an event, and further bouncing and testing around the August lows would be quite normal. One key to the stock market going forward may be the... Read More... Read More

Technically speaking, stocks have now decisively broken key areas of support such as 2,050 on the S&P 500 and 1,200 on the Russell 2000. Naturally, US Treasuries benefitted from the volatility, pushing yields on the 10-yr Note below 2% on Monday. Yields traded as... Read More... Read More

Possible Breakouts at Hand!
By James Dondero | April 23, 2015 Among the bigger developments this week has been the continued strength in crude oil, which is close to breaking through the key $58/barrel level.

The strength in crude helped interest rates firm... Read More... Read More

 Credit Still Matters…

14 Dec 2015 

By James Dondero | December 14, 2015

Last week demonstrated a tone of “risk off” in the markets, as investors prepare for the potential of rising interest rates from the FOMC for the first time in 10 years. Both stocks and high-yield bonds were off sharply, in favor of the relative safety of US Treasuries.
While the bears have clearly wrestled the ball from the bulls, the question now is whether or not they can move it down the field. Several key canaries such as the Value Line Index and Dow Jones Transportation Average remain weak, and suggest they do have a chance.
Looking overseas, developed markets (such as those in Europe & Japan) are also finally starting to feel the impact from stress in the credit and emerging markets. While still in better shape than the BRIC’s, what happens in the BRIC’s could be key going forward.
Finally, the reason for all the volatility could be fears over global deflation, which certainly seem founded given the weakness in commodities and strength in the US Dollar. Sentiment is getting quite extreme however, and stabilization in copper & crude would go far in calming markets globally.

      Last Updated:
    

May 21, 2007 

United States of America, Plaintiff, v. James D. Dondero, c/o Highland Capital Management, L.P., Defendant. United States District Court for the District of Columbia 

      FTC Matter/File Number:
    

        0510184      



      Enforcement Type:
    

        Civil Penalty (7a)      


    Case Summary  

In 2007, the Commission requested that the Department of Justice file a complaint seeking civil penalties against James D. Dondero for violating the filing requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Pre-Merger Notification Act. A stipulation and proposed final judgment was also filed requiring Dondero, parent of Highland Capital Management, L.P., a hedge fund, to pay $250,000 to settle the charges. According to the Commission, Highland failed to file the appropriate premerger documents in 2003 when it acquired shares of Neighborcare, Inc, then known as Genesis Health Ventures, bringing its holdings above the $50 million filing threshold. Upon realizing the error, a corrective filing was made, and Highland outlined steps to avoid future violations. However, in 2005, Highland reported another such violation involving shares of Motient Corporation.

DALLAS, Oct. 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- James Dondero, co-founder and president of Highland Capital Management, L.P., announced this week that the firm has awarded a $1 million challenge grant to help The Family Place, Dallas' leading organization supporting victims of family violence, raise the final $2.8 million for its Legacy Campaign in the next six months. The announcement was made during The Family Place's 21st Annual Texas Trailblazer Awards Luncheon at the Hilton Anatole in Dallas, Texas.








The grant, administered through Highland Dallas Foundation, Inc., the philanthropic arm of Highland Capital Management, will match 50 percent of any funds raised for the capital campaign up to $1 million from now until April 4, 2017.
Since the October 4 announcement, The Family Place has already raised an additional $200,000 toward the Legacy Campaign, which will be matched with $100,000 thanks to Highland's grant. With $2.8 million needed to reach the campaign fundraising goal of $16.5 million, Highland's challenge grant ensures The Family Place finishes the campaign strong.
Dondero said the grant answers a call to action by Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings and Dallas Police Chief David Brown for the community to help solve this life-threatening issue in Dallas.
"The civic community in Dallas gets things done," Dondero said. "We at Highland Capital Management were impressed by the way The Family Place, through avid philanthropic support, took this concept from inception to the final stage of this campaign in just a year. We are proud to invest alongside many of the most generous and thoughtful in the community."
"For anyone considering this effort to provide lifesaving shelter and life-changing services to family violence victims, this is a tremendous opportunity to multiply the impact of their gift," said The Family Place CEO Paige Flink.
The Family Place Legacy Campaign supports the construction and operations of a new Central Dallas Counseling Center for family violence victims named in honor of Ann Moody. Designed by leading architecture and design firm Corgan, Ann Moody Place includes 13 emergency shelter bedrooms, a medical and dental clinic, a centralized hotline/call center, multiple private and group counseling rooms for children and adults, and multipurpose spaces for job-training.
The building will serve more than 2,000 victims annually providing critical emergency shelter space since The Family Place's existing emergency shelter already operates at capacity. Ann Moody Place will also house the agency's Be Project, which provides bullying and teen dating violence prevention education reaching more than 6,000 students each year. The facility will have an animal shelter for families who will not leave abusive relationships for fear of leaving behind beloved family pets. It will also provide an on-site child development center.
The continuum of care provided in this new facility—designed specifically for the delivery of services to family violence victims—is vital to saving lives.
