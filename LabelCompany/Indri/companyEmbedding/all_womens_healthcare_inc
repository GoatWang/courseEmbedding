The Treatment That's Helping Transform the Lives of Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia









We are actively developing treatments for our patients in six important therapeutic areas: Cardiovascular & Metabolism, Immunology, Infectious Diseases & Vaccines, Neuroscience, Oncology and Pulmonary Hypertension.




Immunology
Our vision is a world free from immune diseases. To achieve this, we will translate internal and external science to deliver products that address immune-mediated diseases. 






We have a strong history of delivering novel medicines for immunological diseases. We continue to build a pipeline of innovative biologic and oral therapies in core disease areas: rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases and psoriasis. Through our ongoing efforts in discovery, biomarkers, clinical research and external innovation, we are poised for continued leadership and growth, bringing transformational medicines to patients and healthcare professionals around the world.

Our vision is a world free from immune diseases. To achieve this, we will translate internal and external science to deliver products that treat, cure, intercept, and prevent immune-mediated diseases.

— Sue Dillon,
Global Therapeutic Head, Immunology, Janssen



















Cardiovascular & Metabolic Disease 
Our vision is to improve the lives of the millions of people with cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and to work tirelessly to eliminate these diseases.






Every year, more than 19 million people around the world die from cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. This tremendous global burden compels us to develop new therapies that will change the face of these diseases with the goal to eliminate them. We focus on finding and developing truly transformational therapies that target underlying disease pathways, important pathways, and novel mechanisms of action. We continue to seek and develop the next generation of transformational cardiovascular & metabolic therapies. 
Visit the Janssen Website












Our deep scientific expertise and demonstrated clinical development capabilities support our commitment to aggressively develop and launch transformational therapies for patients with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.

— James List, M.D., Ph.D.,
Global Therapeutic Area Head, Cardiovascular & Metabolism



















Pulmonary Hypertension
For almost two decades, Actelion, a Janssen Pharmaceutical Company of Johnson & Johnson, has been working to fundamentally change the way pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is treated. 






Pulmonary hypertension refers to high blood vessel pressure in the lungs, and PAH is a rare, progressive form of this often-debilitating condition. While the disease affects more women than men, it can also develop in children of any age and across all ethnicities. About 15 people out of every million are affected by PAH. Our understanding of the complex pathways and molecular mechanisms of PAH has enabled us to develop tailored medicines to improve patient outcomes and make a difference for people around the world living with this disorder.

We are actively developing treatments for our patients in six important therapeutic areas, including Infectious Diseases & Vaccines, Neuroscience, and Oncology.




Infectious Diseases & Vaccines
We strive to discover and develop novel therapeutics and vaccines to treat and cure infectious diseases worldwide, improving treatment outcomes and patients’ lives. 






Our vision is to advance human health by helping to achieve a world free of life-threatening infectious diseases. We will do this by discovering and developing transformational therapies and vaccines that prevent, treat and cure some of the world’s most life-threatening infectious diseases such as HIV, viral hepatitis, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza and Ebola.

11
11 of our prescription medicines are on the World Health Organization’s list of Essential Medications.












Neuroscience
Our mission is to reduce the burden, disability and devastation caused by serious neuro psychiatric diseases and pain conditions. 






The research priorities of our Neuroscience Therapeutic Area include Alzheimer’s Disease, Mood Disorders and Schizophrenia. Across neuroscience, our researchers are exploring the emerging science of synaptic plasticity and cellular resilience, with an emphasis on developing novel therapeutics for the treatment of severe mood disorders and neurodegenerative dementias. We are deeply committed to patients with these conditions and to the health care professionals and loved ones who care for them.

Janssen is leading efforts to discover and develop innovative therapeutic solutions for people with brain disorders and to eliminate the social stigma about these diseases.

— Husseini Manji, M.D., F.R.C.P.C.,
Global Therapeutic Area Head, Neuroscience



















Oncology
We envision a world where cancer is a preventable chronic or curable disease. To get there, we’re focused on developing solutions that prolong and improve patient lives. 






Cancer claims millions of lives every year and the number continues to rise. We aim to transform cancer to a preventable or curable disease by delivering diagnostic and therapeutic solutions that prolong and improve patients’ lives. We are committed to delivering targeted therapies to fight the devastation of cancer.

Reference NPI Information

Description





                                NPI
                            

                                1821070061
                            

                                10-position all-numeric identification number assigned by the NPS to uniquely identify a health care provider.
                            



                                Entity Type
                            

                                Organization
                            

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Organization Subpart
                            

                                N
                            

                                The "Is the organization a subpart?" question must be answered. If the organization is a subpart, the Parent Organization Legal Business Name (LBN) and Parent Organization Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) fields must be completed. The Parent Organization LBN and TIN fields can only be completed if the answer to the subpart question is Yes.
Many organization health care providers who apply for NPIs are not legal entities themselves but are parts of other organization health care providers that are legal entities (the "parents"). 
Here are three examples of organization health care providers that may be considered subparts and may apply for NPIs if so directed by their "parents": 
(1) The psychiatric unit in a hospital is not a legal entity but is part of the hospital (the "parent"), which is a legal entity. The legal entity must obtain an NPI. The psychiatric unit is an example of a subpart that could have its own NPI if the hospital determines that it should. 
(2) A group practice that is not a sole proprietorship has a main location and could have other offices in different locations, but each office is not a separate legal entity; instead, each office is part of the corporation (the "parent") which is a legal entity. The offices are examples of subparts that could have their own NPIs if the main location determines that they should. 
(3) A pharmacy fills prescriptions for patients whose physicians have prescribed medications for them and may also rent or sell durable medical equipment to patients whose physicians have ordered such equipment for them. Neither the pharmacy line of business nor the DME line of business represent legal entities; instead, both lines of business are part of an organization (the "parent") that is a legal entity. Each line of business represents a different Healthcare Provider Taxonomy or area of specialization that often submits its own electronic claims to health plans. 
The "parent"-we don't know who the parent is in this example-must ensure that each subpart that submits its own claims to health plans has its own NPI.
                            



                                Provider Organization Name (Legal Business Name)
