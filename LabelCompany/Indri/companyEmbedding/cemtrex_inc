                                NEW LINE OF EMISSIONS MONITORING ANALYZER
            


            January 8, 2008
        




Cemtrex Inc. has launched an in-situ emission monitor product line with Tunable Diode Laser (TDL)-based laser gas analyzer for continuous measurements of ammonia, hydrogen chloride and nitrogen oxides in flue gases emitted from power plants and incinerators. The in-situ system in the Cemtrex Model No. ZSS eliminates the need for transferring measuring gas to an analyzer through a chiller sampling system. The ZSS model comes in a dust-resistant construction and can be installed before a bag filter where gas sampling could not be conducted previously. “This is the first laser gas analyzer system produced for emission monitoring in various processes by a domestic manufacturer, which is less costly and more reliable,” said Aron Govil, Cemtrex president and CEO, “and in SCR outlet applications where sampling is very difficult due to salt formations in sampling line, our model ZSS would offer tremendous advantage.” Cemtrex manufactures and sells the most advanced instruments for emission monitoring of particulate, opacity, mercury, ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, etc. The company also provides turnkey services for carbon creation projects from abatement of greenhouse gases pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol and assists project owners in the selling of carbon credits globally.

                                IR-09 greenhouse gas monitoring system
            


            December 20, 2009
        




The IR-09 multi-gas infrared analyzer for greenhouse gas (GHG) monitoring and reporting comes in line with the U.S. EPA’s new regulation known as the Final Rule that is making it mandatory for GHGs to be monitored from all large emission sources.

                                NEW LINE OF EMISSIONS MONITORING ANALYZER
            


            January 8, 2008
        




Cemtrex Inc. has launched an in-situ emission monitor product line with Tunable Diode Laser (TDL)-based laser gas analyzer for continuous measurements of ammonia, hydrogen chloride and nitrogen oxides in flue gases emitted from power plants and incinerators. The in-situ system in the Cemtrex Model No. ZSS eliminates the need for transferring measuring gas to an analyzer through a chiller sampling system. The ZSS model comes in a dust-resistant construction and can be installed before a bag filter where gas sampling could not be conducted previously. “This is the first laser gas analyzer system produced for emission monitoring in various processes by a domestic manufacturer, which is less costly and more reliable,” said Aron Govil, Cemtrex president and CEO, “and in SCR outlet applications where sampling is very difficult due to salt formations in sampling line, our model ZSS would offer tremendous advantage.” Cemtrex manufactures and sells the most advanced instruments for emission monitoring of particulate, opacity, mercury, ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, etc. The company also provides turnkey services for carbon creation projects from abatement of greenhouse gases pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol and assists project owners in the selling of carbon credits globally.
