LOWELL, Mass., July  20, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Enterprise Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company") (NASDAQ:EBTC), parent of Enterprise Bank, announced net income for the three months ended June 30, 2017 of $5.6 million, an increase of $824 thousand, or 17%, compared to the same three-month period in 2016.  Diluted earnings per share were $0.48 for the three months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of 7%, compared to the same three-month period in 2016.  Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2017 amounted to $11.2 million, an increase of $2.1 million, or 23%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Diluted earnings per share were $0.96 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of 12%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter and the first six months of 2017 include the full dilutive impact of the Company's equity offering issued on June 23, 2016.  
As previously announced on July 18, 2017, the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.135 per share to be paid on September 1, 2017 to shareholders of record as of August 11, 2017.  The 2017 dividend rate represents a 3.8% increase over the 2016 dividend rate.
Chief Executive Officer Jack Clancy commented, "The increase in our 2017 earnings compared to 2016 has been positively impacted by our growth over the last twelve months.  Total assets, loans, and customer deposits have increased 9%, 11%, and 7%, respectively, as compared to June 30, 2016.  This growth continues to be driven by the collective efforts and contributions of our dedicated Enterprise team, active community involvement, relationship building and a customer-focused mindset, market expansion, and ongoing enhancements to our state-of-the-art product and service offerings."
Mr. Clancy continued, "Strategically, our focus remains on organic growth and continually planning for and investing in our future.  We look forward to opening our 24th branch in Windham, NH in the next few weeks.  The relocation of our branch in Salem, NH to its new location is anticipated to occur in mid-August.  We expect the relocation of our Leominster branch to be completed in early 2018.  The relocation of our branches in Salem, NH and Leominster, MA will provide improved and state-of-the-art branches in those communities to better serve our customers."
Founder and Chairman of the Board George Duncan commented, "This quarter represents our 111th consecutive profitable quarter.  Our ability to continually grow our franchise has been a key factor in our success.  Our strategic expansion has added key markets to our franchise which has ultimately led to increased shareholder value.  As our assets under management have now exceeded $3.5 billion - a significant milestone for any financial institution - we are extremely grateful for the support we have received from our customers, shareholders, and the communities in which we operate."

Results of Operations

Net interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2017 amounted to $23.5 million, an increase of $2.2 million, or 11%, compared to the same period in 2016.  Net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2017 amounted to $46.4 million, an increase of $4.0 million, or 9%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016.  The increase in net interest income was due primarily to loan growth.  Average loan balances (including loans held for sale) increased $216.4 million and $200.2 million for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, compared to the 2016 respective period averages.  Net interest margin was 3.90% for both the three months ended June 30, 2017 and March 31, 2017, while net interest margin was 4.02% for the three months ended June 30, 2016.  Net interest margin was 3.90% for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to 4.02% for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
For the three months ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016, the provision for loan losses amounted to $280 thousand and $267 thousand, respectively.  For the six months ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016, the provision for loan losses amounted to $405 thousand and $1.1 million, respectively.  The decrease in the provision for the six months ended June 30, 2017, was due primarily to generally improved credit quality metrics and underlying collateral values, partially offset by increased loan growth compared to prior year.
Contributing to the provision for loan losses were:

Total non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans (a measure of credit risk) amounted to 0.63% at June 30, 2017, compared to 0.54% at June 30, 2016.  Impacting the current period, among other changes, were new impaired/non-accrual status classification changes of two larger commercial relationships totaling approximately $4.5 million, which, based on a review of their individual business circumstances, management determined that no reserves were necessary on these relationships as of June 30, 2017.  
The balance of the allowance for loan losses allocated to impaired and adversely classified loans decreased by $745 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2017, and increased $840 thousand during the six months ended June 30, 2016.  
The Company recorded net recoveries of $211 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to net recoveries of $220 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2016. 
Loan growth for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $91.7 million, compared to $39.2 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016. 

The allowance for loan losses to total loans ratio was 1.51% at June 30, 2017, 1.55% at December 31, 2016 and 1.60% at June 30, 2016.
Non-interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2017 amounted to $3.9 million, an increase of $357 thousand, or 10%, compared to the same quarter last year.  Non-interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2017 amounted to $8.1 million, an increase of $1.3 million, or 19%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016.  The quarter and year-to-date increases were due primarily to increases in net gains on the sales of investment securities and deposit and interchange fees. 
Non-interest expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 amounted to $18.8 million, an increase of $1.2 million, or 7%, compared to the same quarter in the prior year.  For the six months ended June 30, 2017, non-interest expense amounted to $38.2 million, an increase of $3.8 million, or 11%, over the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Increases in expenses over the same periods in the prior year primarily related to the Company's strategic growth and market expansion initiatives, particularly increases in salaries and benefits expenses.
In the first quarter of 2017, the Company adopted a new accounting standard, ASU No. 2016-09 "Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718) Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting," which among other aspects relates to the tax treatment of employee and director equity compensation.  The adoption of this standard reduced the provision for income taxes and increased earnings by approximately $788 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2017.

Key Financial Highlights


Total assets amounted to $2.66 billion at June 30, 2017, compared to $2.53 billion at December 31, 2016, an increase of $130.3 million, or 5%.  Since March 31, 2017, total assets have increased $84.2 million, or 3%.

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this "Form 10-Q") contains certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements concerning plans, objectives, future events or performance and assumptions and other statements that are other than statements of historical fact. Forward-looking statements may be identified by reference to a future period or periods or by use of forward-looking terminology such as "anticipates," "believes," "expects," "intends," "may," "plans," "pursue," "views" and similar terms or expressions. Various statements contained in Item 2 - "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Item 3 - "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" of this Form 10-Q including, but not limited to, statements related to management's views on the banking environment and the economy, competition and market expansion opportunities, the interest rate environment, credit risk and the level of future non-performing assets and charge-offs, potential asset and deposit growth, future non-interest expenditures and non-interest income growth, and borrowing capacity are forward-looking statements. The Company cautions readers that such forward-looking statements reflect numerous assumptions and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward looking statement. The forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q are based on information available to the Company as of the date of hereof, and the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or otherwise revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. The following important factors, among others, could cause the Company's results for subsequent periods to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement made in this Form 10-Q: (i) changes in interest rates could negatively impact net interest income; (ii) changes in the business cycle and downturns in the local, regional or national economies, including deterioration in the local real estate market, could negatively impact credit and/or asset quality and result in credit losses and increases in the Company's allowance for loan losses; (iii) changes in consumer spending could negatively impact the Company's credit quality and financial results; (iv) increasing competition from larger regional and out-of-state banking organizations as well as non-bank providers of various financial services could adversely affect the Company's competitive position within its market area and reduce demand for the Company's products and services; (v) deterioration of securities markets could adversely affect the value or credit quality of the Company's assets and the availability of funding sources necessary to meet the Company's liquidity needs; (vi) changes in technology, including the increased cyber-security risk and identity theft, could adversely impact the Company's operations and increase technology-related expenditures; (vii) increases in employee compensation and benefit expenses could adversely affect the Company's financial results; (viii) changes in laws and regulations that apply to the Company's business and operations, including without limitation, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the "JOBS Act"), the Basel III rules adopted by the federal banking regulators and the additional regulations that will be forthcoming as a result thereof, could cause the Company to incur additional costs and adversely affect the Company's business environment, operations and financial results; (ix) changes in accounting standards, policies and practices, as may be adopted or established by the regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"), or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board could negatively impact the Company's financial results; (x) our ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals; (xi) future regulatory compliance costs, including any increase caused by new regulations imposed by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau; and (xii) the risks and uncertainties described in the documents that the Company files or furnishes to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including those discussed under "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Therefore, the Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking information and statements.  Table of Contents  Overview  Executive Summary  Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $4.7 million, an increase of $422 thousand, or 10%, compared to the same three-month period in 2015. Diluted earnings per share were $0.41 for both the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $13.8 million, an increase of $2.4 million, or 21%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Diluted earnings per share were $1.27 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of 15%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In 2016, diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 fully includes the dilutive impact of the Company's recent equity offering and the nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes the dilutive effect from June 23 to September  The increase in our 2016 earnings compared to 2015 is largely driven by our growth over the last twelve months. Loans, total assets, and deposits, excluding brokered deposits, have increased 11%, 13%, and 17%, respectively, as compared to September 30, 2015.  Strategically, our focus remains on organic growth and continually planning for and investing in our future. Our 23rd branch, on Route 101A in Nashua, NH, opened in early July 2016. We have also recently announced that we anticipate opening our 24th branch office in Windham, NH in 2017, which will fill a gap in our New Hampshire footprint.  Composition of Earnings  The Company's earnings are largely dependent on its net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and the cost of funding (primarily deposits and borrowings). Net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest earning assets is referred to as net interest margin. The Company reports net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis ("margin").  Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $21.8 million, an increase of $1.9 million, or 9%, compared to the same period in 2015. Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $64.2 million, an increase of $6.6 million, or 11%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net interest income was due primarily to loan growth. Average loan balances (including loans held for sale) increased $185.6 million and $181.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same 2015 period averages. Net interest margin was 3.86% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 3.98% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The third quarter of 2016 was impacted by higher balances in low-yielding interest-earning assets from short-term customer deposits. Net interest margin was 3.96% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 3.97% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the provision for loan losses amounted to $1.4 million and $250 thousand, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the provision for loan losses amounted to $2.5 million and $2.1 million, respectively.  Table of Contents  The allowance for loan losses to total loans ratio was 1.59% at September 30, 2016, 1.56% at December 31, 2015 and 1.57% at September 30, 2015. In general, the credit quality of the loan portfolio is improving, in part due to improved economic conditions over the past twelve months; however, individual loan downgrades, such as those noted above, which will occur due to individual business circumstances, slightly increased the allowance to total loan ratio. For further information regarding loan quality statistics and the allowance for loan losses, see the sections below under the heading "Financial Condition" titled "Asset Quality" and "Allowance for Loan Losses."  Non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $3.9 million, an increase of $764 thousand, or 24%, compared to the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily due to an increase in net gains on the sales of investment securities. Non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $10.7 million, a decrease of $151 thousand, or 1%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was due primarily to a decrease in net gains on the sales of investment securities, partially offset by increases in deposit and interchange fees and income on bank-owned life insurance.  Non-interest expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $17.4 million, an increase of $866 thousand, or 5%, compared to the same quarter in the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, non-interest expense amounted to $51.8 million, an increase of $2.8 million, or 6%, over the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Increases in expenses over the prior year primarily related to increases in the Company's strategic growth and market expansion initiatives, particularly salaries and benefits and technology expenses.  Sources and Uses of Funds  The Company's primary sources of funds are customer and brokered deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") borrowings, current earnings and proceeds from the sales, maturities and pay-downs on loans and investment securities. The Company may also, from time to time, utilize overnight borrowings from correspondent banks. Additionally, funding for the Company may be generated through equity transactions, including the dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan or exercise of stock options, and occasionally the issuance of debt securities or the sale of new stock. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company completed an offering of shares of its common stock through a rights offering to its existing stockholders and a supplemental community offering to new members ("share offering"), raising approximately $20.0 million in new capital ($19.7 million, net of offering costs), and contributed the net proceeds to the Bank. These funds are intended to be used to originate loans, purchase investment securities, conduct operations, expand the branch network, and pay dividends to stockholders.  The investment portfolio is primarily used to provide liquidity, manage the Company's asset-liability position and to invest excess funds, providing additional sources of revenue. Total investments, one of the key components of interest earning assets, amounted to $349.1 million at September 30, 2016, and comprised 14% of total assets at September 30, 2016 compared to 13% at December 31, 2015.  Enterprise's main asset strategy is to grow loans, the largest component of interest earning assets, with a focus on high quality commercial loans. Total loans increased $125.9 million, since December 31, 2015 and amounted to $1.99 billion at September 30, 2016, comprising 80% of total assets at September 30, 2016, compared to 81% at December 31, 2015. Total commercial loans amounted to $1.71 billion, or 86% of gross loans, at September 30, 2016, which was consistent with the composition at December 31, 2015.  Management's preferred strategy for funding asset growth is to grow relationship-based deposit balances, preferably transactional deposits (comprised of demand deposit accounts, interest and business checking accounts and traditional savings accounts). Asset growth in excess of transactional deposits is typically funded through non-transactional deposits (comprised of money market accounts, commercial tiered rate or "investment savings" accounts and term certificates of deposit) and wholesale funding (brokered deposits and borrowed funds).  At September 30, 2016, total deposits, excluding brokered deposits, amounted to $2.16 billion, an increase of $250.9 million, or 13%, from December 31, 2015 balances. Non-brokered deposit growth since December 31, 2015 occurred in all deposit categories with the largest growth noted in money markets and checking accounts.  Wholesale funding amounted to $60.0 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $160.4 million at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $100.4 million, or 63%. Wholesale funding included FHLB advances of $671 thousand and $40.7 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and brokered deposits of $59.3 million and $106.8 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2015, the Company also had an overnight  Table of Contents  borrowing of $13.0 million with a correspondent bank. Borrowed fund balances, FHLB advances and other borrowings, have declined $53.0 million since December 31, 2015. Brokered deposits, comprised solely of CDs, have decreased $47.4 million, or 44%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company's level of wholesale funding has declined over the current year as deposit growth has exceeded loan growth.  Opportunities and Risks  The Company's ability to achieve its long-term strategic growth and market share objectives will depend in part upon the Company's continued success in differentiating itself in the market place and its ability to strengthen its competitive position. Enterprise faces robust competition to attract and retain customers within existing and neighboring geographic markets. National and larger regional banks have a local presence in the Company's market area. These larger banks have certain competitive advantages, including greater financial resources and the ability to make larger loans to a single borrower. Numerous local savings banks, commercial banks, cooperative banks and credit unions also compete in the Company's market area. The expanded commercial lending capabilities of credit unions and the shift to commercial lending by traditional savings banks means that both of these types of traditionally consumer-orientated institutions now compete for the Company's targeted commercial customers. In addition, the non-taxable status of credit unions allows them certain advantages as compared to taxable institutions such as Enterprise. Competition for loans, deposits and cash management services, investment advisory assets, and insurance business also comes from other businesses that provide financial services, including consumer finance companies, mortgage brokers and lenders, private lenders, insurance companies, securities brokerage firms, institutional mutual funds, registered investment advisors, internet based banks, non-bank payment and funding channels, and other financial intermediaries. Consolidation within the industry, customer disenfranchisement with larger national/international banks, banks exiting certain business lines and/or markets, the cost of compliance with new government regulations, and the continued low interest rate environment have and are expected to continue to have an impact on the regional competitive market. The Company also faces increasing competition within its marketplace on the pricing of loans. This is expected to be an ongoing competitive challenge; however, the Company is committed to maintaining asset quality and focuses its sales efforts on building long-term relationships, rather than competing for individual transactions or easing loan terms. In addition, the increased use and advances in technology such as internet and mobile banking, non-bank payment channels, electronic transaction processing and cyber-security, are expected to have a significant impact on the future competitive landscape confronting financial service businesses.  The Company's business model is to provide a full range of diversified financial products and services through a highly-trained staff of knowledgeable banking professionals, with in-depth understanding of our markets, commitment to open and honest communication with clients and dedication to active community service. Management believes the Company has differentiated itself from the competition by building a solid reputation within the local market as a dependable commercial-focused community bank, delivering consistent and exceptional customer service, offering competitive products and taking an active role in support of the communities we serve. The Company's banking professionals are committed to upholding the Company's core values, including significant and active involvement in many charitable and civic organizations, and community development programs throughout our service area. This long-held commitment to community not only contributes to the welfare of the communities we serve, it also helps to fuel the local economy and has led to a strong referral network with local businesses, non-profit organizations and community leaders. Management believes the Company's community service reputation and culture positions the Company to be a leading provider of banking, investment advisory and wealth management, trust and insurance services in its growing market area.  The Company actively seeks to increase deposit share and strengthen its competitive position through continuous reviews of deposit product offerings, cash management and ancillary services and state-of-the-art delivery channels, targeted to businesses, non-profits, professional practice groups, municipalities and consumers' needs. These products and services are delivered by experienced local banking professionals who possess strong technical skills, and function as trusted advisors to clients. In addition, Enterprise carefully plans deposit expansion through new branch development, identifying offices strategically located to complement existing locations while expanding the Company's geographic market footprint. In early July 2016, our 23rd branch, on Route 101A in Nashua, NH, opened and the Company recently announced the anticipated opening of its 24th branch office in Windham, NH, in 2017. Branch expansion is aimed at achieving not only deposit market share growth, but also is intended to contribute to loan originations and generate referrals for investment advisory and wealth management, trust and insurance services, residential mortgages and cash management products.  Management believes that Enterprise is also well equipped to capitalize on market potential to grow both the commercial and residential loan portfolios through strong business development efforts, while utilizing a disciplined and consistent lending approach and credit review practices, which have served to provide quality asset growth over varying economic cycles during the Company's history. The Company has a skilled lending sales force with a broad breadth of business knowledge and depth of lending experience to draw upon, supported by a highly qualified and experienced commercial credit review function.  Table of Contents  The Company's investment services, including advisory, customized investment management, trust and brokerage services, provide for additional income diversification. The Company's investment advisory and management services channel derives revenues primarily from investment management fees based on assets under management. The Company's brokerage services channel revenue is split between fees based on assets under management and commissions. Management believes that the Company's investment services are distinguished from the competition by a client-centric open architecture approach in which clients work with a dedicated portfolio manager to hand-select funds with styles that match the client's investment goals. The Company's goal is to design and maintain portfolios that provide the income, growth potential, and risk tolerances that match the clients' comfort levels and exceeds their financial expectations. The Company's investment advisory team consists of a variety of certified financial and licensed brokerage professionals adept in a number of financial and investment disciplines dedicated to providing personalized investment service to each client.  Management continues to undertake significant strategic initiatives, including investments in employee training and development, marketing and public relations, technology and electronic delivery methods, ongoing improvements, renovations or strategic relocation of existing facilities and the continued development of recently added branches. Industry consolidation also provides management the opportunity to recruit experienced banking professionals with market knowledge who complement the Enterprise sales and service culture. While management recognizes that such investments increase expenses in the short term, Enterprise believes that such initiatives are a necessary investment in the long-term growth and earnings potential of the Company and help the Company to capitalize on opportunities in the current marketplace for community banks such as Enterprise. However, lower than expected returns on these investments, such as slower than anticipated loan and deposit growth in new branches and/or lower than expected fee or other income generated from new technology or initiatives, could decrease anticipated revenues and net income on such investments in the future.  Any prolonged deterioration of the general economic environment in the national or local New England economy could have adverse repercussions on local industries, leading to increased unemployment and mortgage foreclosures, deterioration of local commercial real estate values, and other unforeseen consequences, which could have a severe negative impact on the Company's financial condition, capital position, liquidity, and performance. In addition, the loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, and commercial construction loans. These types of loans are typically larger and are generally viewed as having more risk of default than owner occupied residential real estate loans or consumer loans. Any significant deterioration in the credit quality of the commercial loan portfolio or underlying collateral values due to a downturn in the economic environment, or other factors, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. The risk of loss due to customers' non-payment of loans or lines of credit is called "credit risk." Credit risk management is reviewed below in this Item 2 under the headings "Credit Risk," "Asset Quality" and "Allowance for Loan Losses."  The value of the investment portfolio as a whole, or individual securities held, including restricted FHLB capital stock, could be negatively impacted by any sustained volatility in the financial markets or in credit markets, or fundamental deterioration in credit quality of the individual security, fund or issuer, which could possibly result in the recognition of additional other-than-temporary-impairment ("OTTI") charges in the future.  A decline in the aggregate balance of the assets under management could decrease investment advisory fee income. The Company's ability to maintain or increase investment assets under management is subject to a number of factors, including competition from investment management companies and alternative investment options, fluctuations in financial markets and various economic conditions, among others.  In addition, a sustained low interest rate environment could negatively impact the Company's net interest income and results of operations. Interest rate risk is reviewed in more detail under the heading Item 3, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk," below.  Liquidity management is the coordination of activities so that cash needs are anticipated and met, readily and efficiently. Liquidity management is reviewed further below in this Item 2 under the heading "Liquidity."  Federal banking agencies require the Company and the Bank to meet minimum capital requirements. Effective January 1, 2015, the Company and the Bank implemented the Basel III regulatory capital framework. For information regarding the current capital requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank and their respective capital levels at September 30, 2016, in addition to the recent capital raised through a share offering, see the section entitled "Capital Resources" contained in this Item 2 below. As of September 30, 2016, the Company met the definition of "well capitalized" under the applicable Federal Reserve Board regulations and the Bank qualified as "well capitalized" under the prompt corrective action regulations of Basel  . . .
