Global Macro

















































Greater Volatility in Markets Ahead?
What Investors Should [Can] DoMany of you are familiar with my partners at Altegris, provider of premier alternative investments, and the recent addition of Jack L. Rivkin as the new Chief Investment Officer. Since joining Altegris in December, Jack has been busy diligently offering commentary about global economic and political events, trends, investing and alternative investments. His thoughts are heavily weighted in the investment community and I have had many fascinating conversations regarding the global market environment and his outlook for the short and long term. I highly encourage you to read this article.
There is no guarantee that any investment product will achieve its objectives, generate profits or avoid losses.  Equity securities are subject to the risk of decline due to adverse news or general economic decline. International stocks are often more risky than domestic stocks due to adverse economic, social and political factors; commodities are affected by adverse weather, geopolitical, and regulatory conditions; global macro strategies are subject to foreign investment risks, market risk, and volatility due to speculative trading and use of leverage.

Altegris Advisors L.L.C. is an SEC-registered investment adviser that advises alternative strategy mutual funds that may pursue investment returns through a combination of managed futures, equities, fixed income and/or other investment strategies.

PAST RESULTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.  THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT ANY INVESTMENT WILL ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES, GENERATE PROFITS OR AVOID LOSSES.
        


Hedge funds, commodity pools and other alternative investments involve a high degree of risk and can be illiquid due to restrictions on transfer and lack of a secondary trading market.  They can be highly leveraged, speculative and volatile, and an investor could lose all or a substantial amount of an investment.  Alternative investments may lack transparency as to share price, valuation and portfolio holdings.  Complex tax structures often result in delayed tax reporting.  Compared to mutual funds, hedge funds and commodity pools are subject to less regulation and often charge higher fees.  Mutual funds involve risk including possible loss of principal.  Alternative investment managers typically exercise broad investment discretion and may apply similar strategies across multiple investment vehicles, resulting in less diversification.  Trading may occur outside the United States which may pose greater risks than trading on U.S. exchanges and in U.S. markets. 
The Altegris group of affiliated companies is wholly-owned and controlled by (i) private equity  funds managed by Aquiline Capital Partners LLC and its affiliates (“Aquiline”), and by Genstar  Capital Management, LLC and its affiliates (“Genstar”), and (ii) certain senior management of  Altegris and other affiliates. Established in 2005, Aquiline focuses its investments exclusively in  the financial services industry. Established in 1988, Genstar focuses its investment efforts across a variety of industries and sectors,  including financial services. The Altegris companies include Altegris Investments, Altegris  Advisors, and Altegris Clearing Solutions. As of March 31, 2017, Altegris and its affiliates have approximately $2.43 billion in client assets.

Global Macro

















































Greater Volatility in Markets Ahead?
What Investors Should [Can] DoMany of you are familiar with my partners at Altegris, provider of premier alternative investments, and the recent addition of Jack L. Rivkin as the new Chief Investment Officer. Since joining Altegris in December, Jack has been busy diligently offering commentary about global economic and political events, trends, investing and alternative investments. His thoughts are heavily weighted in the investment community and I have had many fascinating conversations regarding the global market environment and his outlook for the short and long term. I highly encourage you to read this article.
There is no guarantee that any investment product will achieve its objectives, generate profits or avoid losses.  Equity securities are subject to the risk of decline due to adverse news or general economic decline. International stocks are often more risky than domestic stocks due to adverse economic, social and political factors; commodities are affected by adverse weather, geopolitical, and regulatory conditions; global macro strategies are subject to foreign investment risks, market risk, and volatility due to speculative trading and use of leverage.

Altegris Advisors L.L.C. is an SEC-registered investment adviser that advises alternative strategy mutual funds that may pursue investment returns through a combination of managed futures, equities, fixed income and/or other investment strategies.
