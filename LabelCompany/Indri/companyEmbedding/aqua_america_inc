History



Aqua Pennsylvania was founded as the Springfield Water Company on January 4, 1886, when a group of Swarthmore College professors received a charter to supply water to the residents of Springfield Township, Delaware County. They built a small pumping station and laid pipes to their homes. Initially, new customers were welcomed openly, but as the number of potential customers increased, so did the association’s operating responsibilities. It was then that the association made the decision to incorporate.
By 1925, the company had grown to meet the needs of 58 municipalities in three counties, and shareholders changed the name to Philadelphia Suburban Water Company.
In 1968, the water company board voted to create a holding company, Philadelphia Suburban Corporation (PSC). By July 1971, Aqua America, Aqua Pennsylvania’s parent company, was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Growth slowed between 1985 and 1990, but then the company purchased three Chester County water systems. These acquisitions gave birth to the company’s “growth-through-acquisition” strategy, which began to accelerate at the end of 1992. Between 1992 and 1999, it purchased 29 water systems and three wastewater systems — a business it entered in 1996. The company also completed several other growth ventures, including main extensions to pick up additional customers, bulk water sales, and operating and management contracts. Together, these acquisitions added approximately 56,000 customers to the system.
In March 1999, Aqua America acquired Consumers Water Company and the utility’s operations in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, New Jersey and Maine, adding more than 225,000 customer connections in five states, including 41,000 in Pennsylvania.
January 1, 2002, Philadelphia Suburban Water Company merged into Pennsylvania Suburban Water Company. Two years later effective January 16, 2004, Pennsylvania Suburban Water Company changed its name to Aqua Pennsylvania, Inc. to reflect its statewide presence. The parent company name was changed from PSC to Aqua America, reflecting its national presence.
Aqua Pennsylvania continued to grow the company and by year-end 2015, provided water and wastewater service to more than 445,000 customers (approximately 1.4 million people) in 32 counties.

Drinking Water Notice for Aqua Ohio's Masury Public Water System

Jul 12, 2017DRINKING WATER NOTICE
Aqua Ohio’s Masury Public Water Systemhas levels of TOTAL HALOACETIC ACIDS (HAAS)
Above Drinking Water Standards
Our water system recently violated the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for TOTAL HALOACETIC ACIDS (HAAS). The average level of TOTAL HALOACETIC ACIDS (HAAS) over the last four quarters was 0.061 mg/L. The standard for TOTAL HALOACETIC ACIDS (HAAS) is 0.060 mg/L.
What should I do?
You do not need to use an alternative (e.g., bottled) water supply. However, if you have specific health concerns, consult your doctor.
What does this mean?
The levels detected do not pose an immediate risk to your health. However, some people who drink water containing haloacetic acids in excess of the MCL over many years may have an increased risk of getting cancer.
What is being done?
We are investigating and taking the necessary steps to correct the problem as soon as possible. Additional information may be obtained by contacting Tom Schwing, Aqua Ohio’s Environmental Compliance Manager at:

History



Aqua Ohio’s history dates back to 1853 when the Massillon Water Supply Company was formed. The company was incorporated on May 27, 1926, as the Massillon Water Service Company. The name Ohio Water Service Company was adopted on February 6, 1928.
Between 1926 and 1930, Ohio Water Service Company acquired the operating properties of Massillon Water Supply Company, Ohio Water Service Corporation (Circleville and Washington Court House), the Marysville Water Company, the Mahoning Valley Water Company, and the Trumbull and Mahoning Water Company. 
The period between the 1930s and the 1970s marked an era of development for Ohio Water Service Company. In 1973, the company merged with Consumers Water Company of Portland, Maine making Ohio Water Service Company a wholly owned subsidiary of Consumers Water Company. Ohio Water Service became known as Consumers Ohio Water Company in 1993. In March 1999, Consumers Water Company merged with Philadelphia Suburban Corporation (PSC) making COWC a subsidiary of one of the largest investor-owned water utilities in the nation. PSC was renamed Aqua America, Inc., in 2004 and COWC became Aqua Ohio, Inc.
On May 1, 2012, Aqua America, Inc. completed the purchase of all of American Water Works Company, Inc.’s regulated operations in Ohio, yielding Aqua America eight additional water systems and three wastewater system in Ohio. The newly purchased operations serve approximately 50,730 water and approximately 6,550 wastewater connections in parts of nine counties primarily in central and northeast Ohio.

Frequently Asked Questions
Have a question about our North Carolina operations? We’ve compiled some frequently asked questions to help you learn about issues specific to your state such as hard water and drought. If you have a question not addressed here, you can reach us via the link at the bottom of this page. 
Why is my water discolored, and what is Aqua doing to fix it?

Please refer to this document, which discusses naturally occuring minerals in the groundwater.

Why is my water hard? 

Hardness is often a characteristic of groundwater and occurs naturally.
As the water travels through the ground and enters the aquifer, minerals such as calcium and magnesium that are present in the bedrock dissolve into the water supply. 
These minerals that leach into the water give the water what is commonly called “hard” water. Other minerals that can cause hardness and discoloration issues are caused by iron and manganese.

 What can I do to soften my water? 

Minerals often build up in home hot water heaters. The higher the temperature, the more likely these minerals are to build up in your hot water heater.
Reduce the temperature of your hot water heater.
Flush your hot water heater regularly.
Purchase an in-home water softener.  

How can I stop the staining that comes from my hard water? 

A product called Red B-Gone can be purchased from some local plumbing supply stores.  

Why does my water smell like rotten eggs? 

Sulfates are a naturally occurring mineral in some areas of North Carolina.
By themselves, sulfates are not a problem.
However, when non-harmful, sulfur-reducing bacteria — which are also naturally present in the water — feed on the sulfates, it gives an odor to the water that is often said to smell like rotten eggs.

What is the drought status? 

In most cases, we have enough supply for reasonable use. However, some customers do not use water reasonably.
The mandatory restrictions that impact all customers were mandated by the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC). 

How do you handle drought violators? 

The NCUC has charged Aqua with policing violators. If an Aqua employee witnesses a violation in the regular course of our business, we will engage the customer to make them aware of their action. Aqua will then send the customer a letter that gets copied to the NCUC. The letter informs the customer that if we witness the violation a second time, Aqua will ask the NCUC to allow us to turn off their service. 

What are you doing to find more water sources?

In most cases, we have adequate supply for reasonable demand according to the Department of Environmental Health, which equates to 400 gallons per day for a 12-hour day. 

Who’s responsible for the maintenance of grinder pumps?

In most cases, Aqua owns and maintains your grinder pump.
You can help keep costs down by not putting things like grease, dental floss, kitty litter, etc., into sinks, toilets and drains.

History



Aqua New Jersey was created through the merger of several individual water companies previously owned by the former Consumers Water Company of Portland, Maine in the early 1960s. In 1969, Consumers merged The Peoples Water Company of Phillipsburg, the Hamilton Square Water Company and the Blackwood Water Company to create the Garden State Water Company. In 1995, after having acquired several other local water companies, Garden State changed its name to Consumers New Jersey Water Company (CNJ). 
In 1999, the Woolwich Water Company and Woolwich Sewer Company were purchased and merged into the company. In March 1999, CNJ’s parent company, Consumers Water Company, merged with Philadelphia Suburban Corporation (PSC). In January 2004, PSC changed its name to Aqua America, Inc. and changed the name of CNJ to Aqua. Several small system acquisitions were made during this time, expanding Aqua’s expertise into Sussex and Monmouth counties. 
In November 2005, Aqua acquired the assets of the Berkeley Water Company, the company’s first venture into Ocean County.
In July 2009, Aqua acquired the Lawrenceville Water Company in Lawrence Township, expanding the company’s existing footprint in Mercer County. Later that year, in November, Aqua acquired the assets of the Harkers Hollow Heights Water Association, a small community water system serving a portion of Harmony Township and Lopatcong Township in Warren County.
In March 2010, Aqua acquired the assets of the Bloomsbury Borough Water Utility in Hunterdon County, which is the first municipal acquisition in New Jersey in the company’s history. In November 2010, Aqua acquired the assets of Vernon Water Company in Vernon Township. In December 2010, Aqua acquired the Wallkill Water & Sewer Company in Hardyston Township.
Aqua New Jersey’s corporate offices are located in Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey.

Coverage begins after manufacturer warranty expires
It's a no-lemon policy: If a product breaks down for the same reason three times during the coverage, the product will be replaced for free. No hidden fees. No deductibles

        20 bucks to get the job done.
Picked this up for a camping trip and was very happy with the way it functioned. I will likely buy a couple more for water storage "just in case".

Spigot. Stackable. Prefer square jugs as opposed to the round ones. Can lay on its side to use spigot.

        Great size and quality
We usually take our water from home when we go camping for our coffee. This solved our issues with having to take several containers with us. Holds 7 gal. and we liked it so much we bought another one.

        Great Product
Living in Florida I have stored water in the past in 2 liter bottles for emergencies. This is not how to prepare for hurricanes or tropical storms. I have been looking for a good product that I could use not only for storage, but for periodic trips where potable water isn't available. This product fits the bill.The Reliance Aqua-Tainer Water Container lives up to its reputation as a great product for storm preparation.

        Need all the parts...
This was sold to us without the small cap that seals the vent cap. Thought I heard it rattling inside, but it was the spigot. I'll have to watch Dick's service more closely next time.

        Works well.
Bought this for camping. The spigot will screw to ether side of the cap so so hides out of the way during travel. The cube shape helps it stay put in the back of the truck. No leaks out of spigot.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
