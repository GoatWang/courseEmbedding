JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Oct. 1, 2014 /PRNewswire/ — Landstar System, Inc. (NASDAQ: LSTR), a worldwide, asset-light provider of integrated transportation management solutions delivering safe, specialized transportation logistics services, announced today that its Board of Directors has named James B. Gattoni President and Chief Executive Officer, effective December 29, 2014.  Henry H. Gerkens, who currently serves as Chairman of the Board and CEO, will continue to serve as Executive Chairman of the Board through the Company’s Annual Shareholder Meeting scheduled for May, 2015, pursuant to his existing letter agreement with the Company. 
“Since joining the Company in 1995, Jim quickly emerged as a key player on the management team,” said Lead Independent Director, Diana Murphy. “His financial expertise and commitment to excellence in customer service will serve the Company and its shareholders well into the future.  Jim’s promotion is a testament to Landstar’s on-going succession planning process and is well deserved. The Board is delighted he will succeed Henry.”
“Landstar has greatly benefited from Henry’s many contributions and leadership over the years,” said David Bannister, Landstar’s longest-serving Board member and Chair of the Compensation Committee. “He has played an integral part in solidifying Landstar’s position as an industry leader since Landstar’s inception in 1988.  His passion for the Landstar business model is evident by the Company’s growth and success under his tenure.”  
“Jim has proven time and time again that he is a solutions-oriented leader,” said Gerkens.  “He understands the Company’s safety first culture and is well respected within the organization. His commitment to the long-term success of Landstar agents, BCOs and other third party capacity providers will continue to drive our success in servicing Landstar customers well into the future.”
“I am honored to follow in Henry’s footsteps and to further build on the Company’s momentum,” said Gattoni. “It is my privilege to guide Landstar into the future as we write the next chapters in Landstar’s success story.”

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
