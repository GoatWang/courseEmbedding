Page Title













  


Basic Building MaterialsAuscrete aerated concrete is a light-weight cement/sand product that has a specially developed foaming agent applied during manufacture. This enables the product to have millions of small air bubble ‘aggregates’ introduced and evenly distributed throughout the cast sections.  Then there is the XPS insulation amalgamation with the final result being a concrete that is light, strong, of extremely high insulation value and is highly fire resistant. It also has excellent sound proofing qualities.






FIRE RESISTANTTotally incombustible, Auscrete AC offers much greater fire protection than that of normal concrete. It is Ideal for firewalls and also provides excellent fire protection for structural steel.






LIGHTWEIGHTIn its standard density of 90 - 105 lbs. per cu. ft., the weight of Auscrete AC is almost one half that of normal concrete. Panels can be handled with ease making it economical to transport in large sections.






STRONGAuscrete AC has a high strength to weight ratio. Standard sections have a mean compressive strength in excess of 2,500 psi. when fully cured. It allows Architects and engineers new design and constructions concepts.






THERMAL INSULATIONAAC's insulation is much greater than normal concrete. Expensive energy is saved by Auscrete AC as it cuts both heating and air conditioning needs offering greater comfort in a wide range of climatic conditions.






SOUND REDUCTIONAuscrete AC provides excellent sound reduction, superior to that of a number of commonly used building materials. Auscrete AC designers have achieved considerable sound reduction  in independent panelized system tests.






WORKABILITYNails can be driven and electric routers can be used to groove for electrical conduits and plumbing and the material can be sawn. Fixing of all joinery, hand basins and other fittings is fast and simple.

Green InitiativeAuscrete is on the cutting edge of the GREEN MOVEMENT. Our concrete product is perceived to be very green, in part because of the minimal impact on the environment and its energy efficiency, two of the most important values for today’s needs and mindset. Auscrete's specialized concrete construction products are basically cement and sand, two of the most abundant raw materials. The mixture uses a non toxic bio-degradable surfactant to produce the injected bubble aggregates. The insulating value consists of an homogeneous integration of  the cementitious product and XPS, which can be re-used simply by melting and reconstitution.The use of these basic materials makes the company's products  environmentally friendly and non-toxic. To be "Green" a product must create energy reducing properties. Most of the pollution in the world is created from energy producing sources. The technology in Auscrete's products have significantly reduced energy use for heating and cooling through the use of high level insulation and therefore reducing energy pollution.Watch 12 year old Canadian, Severn Cullis-Suzuki who, at 9 years of age, started the Environmental Children's Organization (ECO), a small group of children committed to learning and teaching other kids about environmental issues. In 1992 She addressed the UN's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro to appeal to the world for climatic reform. Click on her photo at left.HistoryAuscrete Corporation possesses certain proprietary technology in cellular lightweight concrete manufacturing that has been assigned to the corporation. Auscrete Cellular Concrete (“ACC”) is the culmination of the refinements made to a technology developed in Australia in the mid 1980’s.The Australian product has been used in many parts of the world in construction, and Auscrete has further developed it in the US by creating a thermally efficient building system.A pilot plant was commenced in 2007 at Rufus, OR and trial products, such as houses, commercial building and amenities facilities were constructed.Since commencing re-development of the basic technology almost ten years ago, Auscrete's engineers have refined and modified the basic ACC formula utilizing various bubble producing machines that create the infusion of millions of tiny air bubbles into a special inert concrete mix thus producing a lightweight product without sacrificing strength or structural integrity.A number of specialized machines have been fabricated for the manufacturing of ACC including machinery that can produce various sized bubbles, hydraulically operated casting beds, concrete batching plant, materials handling equipment, specialized finishing machines and a “Hot Box” materials                         thermal testing cabinet that gives thermal “R” ratings of materials to ASTM specifications. Additionally, many sample panels have been                         produced for testing and for the construction of structures.                   Future Planning                         Auscrete intends to sequentially bring on line a further 6 downsized production facilities around the country to secure the future, within 1,000 miles of target markets,  for the company’s products. Projected sites include San Antonio TX, Merced CA, Jackson MS, Boston MA, Rockford IL, and Atlanta GA.See the City of Rufus icon at left to visit Rufus, Oregon.

ConstructionProcedure 
Auscrete’s Manufacturing Plant Produces housing that is affordable and in reach of that group of people wanting to participate in the “American Dream”, but are unable to afford construction of housing at today’s prices. The solution for them will be to purchase their own beautiful, solid, energy efficient, virtually fire-proof, Auscrete home, similar in style to these homes built in Australia.There is no magic required to produce very affordable, quality homes. We cast large panels of our light-weight insulated concrete in a quality controlled factory environment. To construct affordable homes, we produce the materials in a “mass production” format by table casting the outer and inner wall and roof sections. 
Each wall panel incorporates a cast-in skeletal reinforcing frame containing the vertical steel tubes through which the hold down bolts pass, to secure the panel to the concrete slab base. Electrical conduits are also installed at this stage. 
 Wall and roof panels as well as other components are shipped to the building site on step deck trailers. 
 Exterior and Internal walls are lowered into position and secured using a 2 mm (.080") adhesive sealant. 
 Outer walls are secured to the inner walls and to the floor slab with a variety of long bolts and attachments, creating a very stable and strong assembly that has much better earthquake and tornado resistance than the average home built of wood. 
After receiving internal ducting and utility services, the roof is fitted. The house is then applied with stucco or alternate finish. Interior cabinets and fixtures are fitted, and the house is ready for move in.

The house is up in a matter of days, not months, so there are major labor savings at both the factory and the building site.Additionally, savings are enhanced by the use of lower cost raw materials (cement & sand etc.) as opposed to expensive and labor-intensive lumber products.

CONSTRUCTION 
            This complex technology incorporates expanded insulating resources and the infusion of millions of tiny air bubbles into a special inert concrete mix enabling the creation of a lightweight product without sacrificing strength or structural integrity.It generally uses only one half of the raw materials needed  in standard concrete construction. It is environmentally friendly, non-toxic, pest free and uses materials that are the most available in the world. The biggest advantage is that it can be produced as large panels at very low cost in a factory atmosphere with controlled simple casting techniques.Our metal fabrication plant produces the various reinforcing and steel trusses that might be used in the home’s construction. By constructing the wall and roof sections with insulated aerated concrete, the panels are of lighter weight, making them easier to handle and can be cast in large sections, typically 16’ by 8’ for easier transportation and faster construction at the building site. By using this method of manufacture, the various sections are quality controlled in a factory atmosphere.

Page Title













  


Basic Building MaterialsAuscrete aerated concrete is a light-weight cement/sand product that has a specially developed foaming agent applied during manufacture. This enables the product to have millions of small air bubble ‘aggregates’ introduced and evenly distributed throughout the cast sections.  Then there is the XPS insulation amalgamation with the final result being a concrete that is light, strong, of extremely high insulation value and is highly fire resistant. It also has excellent sound proofing qualities.






FIRE RESISTANTTotally incombustible, Auscrete AC offers much greater fire protection than that of normal concrete. It is Ideal for firewalls and also provides excellent fire protection for structural steel.






LIGHTWEIGHTIn its standard density of 90 - 105 lbs. per cu. ft., the weight of Auscrete AC is almost one half that of normal concrete. Panels can be handled with ease making it economical to transport in large sections.






STRONGAuscrete AC has a high strength to weight ratio. Standard sections have a mean compressive strength in excess of 2,500 psi. when fully cured. It allows Architects and engineers new design and constructions concepts.






THERMAL INSULATIONAAC's insulation is much greater than normal concrete. Expensive energy is saved by Auscrete AC as it cuts both heating and air conditioning needs offering greater comfort in a wide range of climatic conditions.






SOUND REDUCTIONAuscrete AC provides excellent sound reduction, superior to that of a number of commonly used building materials. Auscrete AC designers have achieved considerable sound reduction  in independent panelized system tests.






WORKABILITYNails can be driven and electric routers can be used to groove for electrical conduits and plumbing and the material can be sawn. Fixing of all joinery, hand basins and other fittings is fast and simple.



Quality in Energy Efficient Affordable Housing

BBB Tip: Contractors (General)



 







BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
