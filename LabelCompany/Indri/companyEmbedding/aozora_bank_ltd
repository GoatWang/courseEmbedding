AOZORA BANK,LTD. Company Profile

   Aozora Bank hopes that the clouds have passed and blue skies are ahead. Aozora (which means blue sky in Japanese) was the second Japanese credit bank nationalized in the wake of Asia's financial crisis (after Shinsei Bank). Bad loans and Japan's "Big Bang" financial deregulation added to its troubles. Now a full-service commercial bank, Aozora has some 20 branches in Japan and three offices overseas (New York, Shanghai, and Singapore). It provides a host of retail and business banking services, as well as corporate banking services (loans and derivative products, consulting and advisory) and specialty finance and financial markets offerings. Aozora is seeking to expand in Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia.

History[edit]
Aozora Bank is the successor of the Nippon Credit Bank (NCB), which was founded in 1957 as the Nippon Fudosan Bank under a special government trust banking license alongside the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan (LTCB). Nippon Fudosan Bank was itself based on the remaining assets of the Bank of Joseon in Japan.
In December 1998, NCB was brought under government control in order to deal with its extraordinary amount of bad debt left over from the crash of the Japanese asset price bubble in the early 1990s: at the time, the bank was approximately ¥270 billion in debt.
An investor group led by Softbank, Orix and Tokio Marine & Fire Insurance Co. purchased NCB in 2000 for ¥80 billion.[6] As part of this deal, the government included a "defect warranty provision" (瑕疵担保条項, kashi tanpo jōkō) to the effect that NCB could demand within the next three years that the government purchase any claims which had fallen by twenty percent or more from value. A similar provision had controversially been offered to the purchasers of LTCB, which had recently been similarly purchased from the government and renamed Shinsei Bank.[6] Aozora applied this provision conservatively in order to write off ¥400 billion in bad debts owed by about 100 companies, in contrast to Shinsei Bank, the contemporaneous successor of the Long-Term Credit Bank, which wrote off nearly three times as much and was criticized in political circles for doing so.
The sale of NCB to Softbank was viewed as a precedent for the licensing of Sony Bank, Seven Bank and other new banking platforms in Japan.[6]
The bank was renamed "Aozora" in 2001. Softbank initially planned to make Aozora an investment bank for internet-related companies. However, Softbank was unsuccessful in obtaining the cooperation of the Financial Services Agency, and sold its 49% stake to Cerberus Capital Management in September 2003 for ¥101 billion.[7] Aozora launched operations as a retail bank on April 1, 2006, and opened its first new branch in Nihonbashi on November 20.
Aozora Bank was listed as the No. 1 unsecured creditor to Lehman Brothers with about $463 million USD in bank loans to the investment bank as it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September 2008. By comparison, the second largest unsecured creditor was Mizuho Bank with $289 million, and third largest Citibank (Hong Kong branch) with $275 million.
On December 16, 2008, Aozora Bank announced that it had ¥12.4 billion exposure to the Bernard L. Madoff ponzi scheme.[8]
On April 25, 2009, Aozora Bank and Shinsei Bank announced negotiations to integrate their operations in the summer of 2010, with an eye toward an eventual merger. Banks had been hit by losses in the US subprime market.[9] The talks collapsed in May 2010 amid disputes over capitalization and business strategy, as well as the abatement of the 2008 financial crisis.[10]
Aozora acquired Japan Wealth Management Securities in 2011, merging it with existing subsidiary Aozora Securities in 2012.[11]
In January 2013, Cerberus announced that it would sell most of its stake in Aozora, cutting its total share from 58 percent to 7.7 percent.[12] Cerberus sold this last portion of its stake to Barclays for distribution to other investors in August 2013, ending Cerberus's shareholding in Aozora.[13]
Locations[edit]




Aozora headquarters in Tokyo


Aozora's head office is located in the Kudan area of Chiyoda City, Tokyo, near Yasukuni Shrine.
The bank has retail branches in Chiba, Fukuoka, Hiroshima, Kanazawa, Kyoto, Nagoya, Osaka (Namba and Umeda), Sapporo, Sendai, Takamatsu, Tokyo (Ikebukuro, Jiyugaoka, Nihonbashi, Shibuya, Shinjuku and Ueno) and Yokohama.

History[edit]
Aozora Bank is the successor of the Nippon Credit Bank (NCB), which was founded in 1957 as the Nippon Fudosan Bank under a special government trust banking license alongside the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan (LTCB). Nippon Fudosan Bank was itself based on the remaining assets of the Bank of Joseon in Japan.
In December 1998, NCB was brought under government control in order to deal with its extraordinary amount of bad debt left over from the crash of the Japanese asset price bubble in the early 1990s: at the time, the bank was approximately ¥270 billion in debt.
An investor group led by Softbank, Orix and Tokio Marine & Fire Insurance Co. purchased NCB in 2000 for ¥80 billion.[6] As part of this deal, the government included a "defect warranty provision" (瑕疵担保条項, kashi tanpo jōkō) to the effect that NCB could demand within the next three years that the government purchase any claims which had fallen by twenty percent or more from value. A similar provision had controversially been offered to the purchasers of LTCB, which had recently been similarly purchased from the government and renamed Shinsei Bank.[6] Aozora applied this provision conservatively in order to write off ¥400 billion in bad debts owed by about 100 companies, in contrast to Shinsei Bank, the contemporaneous successor of the Long-Term Credit Bank, which wrote off nearly three times as much and was criticized in political circles for doing so.
The sale of NCB to Softbank was viewed as a precedent for the licensing of Sony Bank, Seven Bank and other new banking platforms in Japan.[6]
The bank was renamed "Aozora" in 2001. Softbank initially planned to make Aozora an investment bank for internet-related companies. However, Softbank was unsuccessful in obtaining the cooperation of the Financial Services Agency, and sold its 49% stake to Cerberus Capital Management in September 2003 for ¥101 billion.[7] Aozora launched operations as a retail bank on April 1, 2006, and opened its first new branch in Nihonbashi on November 20.
Aozora Bank was listed as the No. 1 unsecured creditor to Lehman Brothers with about $463 million USD in bank loans to the investment bank as it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September 2008. By comparison, the second largest unsecured creditor was Mizuho Bank with $289 million, and third largest Citibank (Hong Kong branch) with $275 million.
On December 16, 2008, Aozora Bank announced that it had ¥12.4 billion exposure to the Bernard L. Madoff ponzi scheme.[8]
On April 25, 2009, Aozora Bank and Shinsei Bank announced negotiations to integrate their operations in the summer of 2010, with an eye toward an eventual merger. Banks had been hit by losses in the US subprime market.[9] The talks collapsed in May 2010 amid disputes over capitalization and business strategy, as well as the abatement of the 2008 financial crisis.[10]
Aozora acquired Japan Wealth Management Securities in 2011, merging it with existing subsidiary Aozora Securities in 2012.[11]
In January 2013, Cerberus announced that it would sell most of its stake in Aozora, cutting its total share from 58 percent to 7.7 percent.[12] Cerberus sold this last portion of its stake to Barclays for distribution to other investors in August 2013, ending Cerberus's shareholding in Aozora.[13]

Aozora Bank, Ltd. v Deutsche Bank Sec. Inc.


2016 NY Slip Op 02511 [137 AD3d 685]


March 31, 2016


Appellate Division, First Department


Published by New York State Law Reporting
Bureau pursuant to Judiciary Law § 431.

As corrected through Wednesday, April 27, 2016


[*1]
 Aozora Bank, Ltd., Appellant,vDeutsche
Bank Securities Inc. et al., Respondents.
Kirby McInerney LLP, New York (Andrew M. McNeela of counsel), for
appellant.
Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, New York (Jessica S. Carey of
counsel), for respondents.
Order, Supreme Court, New York County (Jeffrey K. Oing, J.), entered January 21,
2015, which, to the extent appealed from as limited by the briefs, granted defendants'
motion to dismiss the fraud claims, and order, same court and Justice, entered March 31,
2015, which, to the extent appealed from, denied plaintiff's motion for leave to file an
amended complaint, unanimously affirmed.
This case is yet another action arising from the worldwide financial crisis that began
in 2007. Plaintiff Aozora Bank, Ltd. is a Japanese commercial bank with its principal
offices in Tokyo.[FN1] Aozora invested in complex financial
products backed by mortgages, including collateralized debt obligations
(CDOs).[FN2]
In December 2006, Aozora invested in a CDO called Blue Edge, a $1.25 billion
CDO that included residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). Defendants
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG (together, Deutsche Bank or
defendants) structured and sold the CDO; Aozora bought $30 million of the CDO's Class
A-3 tranche. Aozora alleges that although Deutsche Bank selected the RMBS that were
to be included in the CDO, Deutsche Bank actually held negative views about those
securities.
For example, Aozora alleges, Deutsche Bank's global head of CDOs, Greg
Lippmann, made numerous disparaging comments internally about the RMBS included
in Blue Edge, referring to them as, among other things, "weak" and "horrible." Similarly,
defendants' internal emails allegedly show that Lippman and other Deutsche Bank
insiders knew, and were [*2]sometimes pressured, not to
disclose their negative views on RMBS in order to promote client interest in defendants'
CDO products. The underlying assets included in Blue Edge were subject to Deutsche
Bank's approval, and Deutsche Bank generally approved third-party collateral manager
selections for Deutsche Bank-arranged CDOs, even where they included the very same
RMBS that defendants internally disparaged.
Beginning in late 2005, Deutsche Bank began accumulating a short position with
respect to subprime RMBS in Blue Edge, and urged some of its non-CDO investor
clients to do the same. According to Aozora, Deutsche Bank sold credit default swap
protection on RMBS to their hedge fund clients so as to hedge those clients' exposure to
the underperforming RMBS, while shifting the long position—in this case, the
riskier position—to Deutsche Bank-arranged CDOs such as Blue Edge.
In connection with marketing, selling, and offering Blue Edge to investors, Deutsche
Bank created, drafted, and disseminated various marketing and offering documents; these
documents allegedly contained material misrepresentations, misleading statements, and
omissions. Specifically, Aozora alleges, the marketing and offering documents did not
disclose defendants' negative views of Blue Edge's underlying RMBS assets. The
marketing and offering documents also indicated that Deutsche Bank would hold Blue
Edge's collateral portfolio on its own books until closing of the CDO, thereby ensuring
Deutsche Bank's selection of top-quality collateral. However, Deutsche Bank was
allegedly engaged in decreasing its own RMBS exposure at the same time it was
encouraging clients to invest in CDOs. Further, the marketing and offering documents
indicate that at least 66.7% of Blue Edge's collateral portfolio would be prime RMBS
(that is, lower risk), and less than 10% would consist of subprime RMBS (that is, higher
risk). However, Aozora alleges that Blue Edge's asset pool was far riskier than Deutsche
Bank represented, and that only 27% of the collateral assets were prime RMBS, while
47.6% of the portfolio consisted of riskier subprime, "midprime," and "Alt-A"
RMBS.
Aozora filed a summons with notice on June 18, 2013. In its complaint, filed January
7, 2014, Aozora asserted causes of action for common law fraud, aiding and abetting
fraud, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, negligent
misrepresentation, and unjust enrichment.
With respect to the claims for common law fraud and negligent misrepresentation,
Aozora asserted that it reasonably relied on Deutsche Bank's misrepresentations and
omissions. Specifically, Aozora alleged, it conducted its own due diligence and risk
analysis, scrutinizing, among other things, Blue Edge's collateral portfolio and its
structural protections against collateral losses. Aozora stated that it also reviewed the
marketing materials and concluded that the investment, as represented by Deutsche Bank,
was appropriate. However, Aozora insisted, it did not know, and could not have known,
that the marketing materials and offering documents contained material
misrepresentations and omissions, that Blue Edge's portfolio was filled with RMBS that
defendants internally disparaged, or that Deutsche Bank had understated the degree to
which Blue Edge was collateralized by higher-risk, lower-quality assets. Aozora alleged
that absent Deutsche Bank's misconduct, it never would have made its investment in
Blue Edge, and that Deutsche Bank's misconduct caused Aozora to suffer a 100%
principal loss on its investment.
Deutsche Bank moved to dismiss the complaint under CPLR 3211 (a) (5) and (7). On
the motion, Deutsche Bank argued, among other things, that all of Aozora's claims were
time-barred because Aozora filed its action more than six years after it bought Blue Edge
and more than two [*3]years after it should have
discovered the alleged fraud in the exercise of reasonable diligence. To support this
argument, Deutsche Bank attached details of numerous publications, testimony, and
lawsuits regarding the financial crisis; the earliest of this material was dated from March
2007—nearly seven years before Aozora commenced this action in January 2014.
Indeed, Deutsche Bank noted, beginning in early 2008 it was well publicized that banks,
including Deutsche Bank, were under investigation for their involvement in creating
defective mortgage products. Deutsche Bank also attached excerpts from an April 13,
2011 report of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the United States
Senate entitled "Wall Street and the Financial Crisis: Anatomy of a Financial Collapse"
(Senate Report). Finally, Deutsche Bank attached proof that Moody's had downgraded
Blue Edge to junk status in June 2008. All this information, Deutsche Bank asserted, put
Aozora on notice of its claims years before it commenced this action.
In opposition to the motion to dismiss, Aozora submitted the affidavit of the general
manager of its international division in Tokyo, Justin Hirsch (Hirsch affidavit). In his
affidavit, Hirsch noted that his averments were not based on his personal knowledge, but
on his review of Aozora's files and records. Hirsch stated that Aozora did not arrange,
originate, or structure any CDOs, but rather, invested in CDOs in the United States.
Moreover, Hirsch noted, plaintiff's office in New York was small, with never more than
four employees during the relevant period. The New York office primarily facilitated
client services in the United States; its employees were not structured finance
professionals, and were not involved in plaintiff's decision to invest in structured finance
products.
According to Hirsch, when Aozora began to experience CDO losses, it believed
those losses were the result of the United States subprime mortgage crisis. However, in
September 2012, a former employee of Aozora contacted the bank, stating that several
other banks had recently brought successful claims against structured finance arrangers
and inquiring whether Aozora wanted its portfolio reviewed to determine whether it
might have viable claims.
Thereafter, Hirsch stated, as part of Aozora's due diligence efforts in November and
December 2012, it spoke with several United States-based law firms regarding its
potential claims; in March 2013, Aozora retained its current counsel. After reviewing
Aozora's investments, counsel informed Aozora that Deutsche Bank had been discussed
in the April 2011 Senate Report. While the Senate Report did not mention the Blue Edge
CDO by name, Hirsch asserted that Aozora's counsel "analyzed the Blue Edge CDO's
asset portfolio, discovering that certain of the [RMBS] that were contained in the Blue
Edge CDO portfolio were mentioned in the Senate Report." According to Hirsch, it was
then that Aozora realized that it might have actionable claims against defendants, and
commenced this action.
The IAS court found that Aozora's fraud claims were untimely under the two-year
discovery rule. In so doing, the court concluded that Aozora was on inquiry notice of the
alleged fraud by no later than April 2011, when the Senate Report was released. Indeed,
the court noted, the Senate investigation of the financial crisis began in April 2010.
Further, the court found, Aozora failed to raise an issue of fact as to whether it had
exercised reasonable diligence in an effort to discover its fraud claims. In that regard, the
court noted that the information publicly available by 2010 should have alerted Aozora
that something was amiss with its investment. Thus, the court concluded, Aozora should
have begun an investigation well before it actually did. The court also specifically noted
that the Hirsch affidavit failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether, given the
circumstances surrounding [*4]the investment and the
financial crisis, Aozora had engaged in reasonable diligence.[FN3]
The parties do not dispute that plaintiff's fraud causes of action were not timely under
New York's six-year limitations period and, to be timely, must have been commenced
within two years from the time plaintiff discovered the fraud, or with reasonable
diligence could have discovered it (CPLR 213 [8]).
As this Court has held, "[W]here the circumstances are such as to suggest to a person
of ordinary intelligence the probability that he has been defrauded, a duty of inquiry
arises, and if he omits that inquiry when it would have developed the truth, and shuts his
eyes to the facts which call for investigation, knowledge of the fraud will be imputed to
him" (CIFG Assur. N. Am., Inc.
v Credit Suisse Sec. [USA] LLC, 128 AD3d 607, 608 [1st Dept 2015]; see also Gutkin v Siegal, 85
AD3d 687, 688 [1st Dept 2011] ["(t)he test as to when fraud should with reasonable
diligence have been discovered is an objective one"]). Thus, public reports and lawsuits
of alleged fraud are sufficient to put a plaintiff on inquiry notice of fraud (see CIFG
Assur. N. Am., 128 AD3d at 608; Aldrich v Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc., 52 AD3d
435, 436 [1st Dept 2008], lv denied 11 NY3d 716 [2009]). Similarly, losses
that a plaintiff sustains may put it on notice of possible fraud (see Ghandour v
Shearson Lehman Bros., 213 AD2d 304, 306 [1st Dept 1995], lv denied 86
NY2d 710 [1995]).
Accordingly, Deutsche Bank made a prima facie case that Aozora was on inquiry
notice of its fraud claims before June 18, 2011 (that is, two years before it filed the
summons with notice). The burden then shifted to Aozora to establish that, even if it had
exercised reasonable diligence, it could not have discovered the basis for its claims
before that date.
But Aozora failed to carry its burden, as there was a wealth of public information
that should have put it on inquiry notice of the alleged fraud. First, in 2008, Blue Edge
was downgraded to junk status and plaintiff incurred substantial losses on its investment.
Second, there was considerable publicity about the subprime mortgage crisis from news
reports, investor lawsuits, and government investigations well before June 2011. Indeed,
by April 2011, defendants had been sued multiple times in connection with RMBS and
CDOs, including in connection with a Deutsche Bank CDO known as Gemstone, which
plaintiff discusses in its complaint as involving wrongdoing by defendants "identical" to
that involved with respect to Blue Edge (see Ghandour, 213 AD2d at 304, 306
[the plaintiff was on notice where his brother made the same investments and
commenced a timely fraud action six years earlier]).
Third, one of the most significant sources of public information putting plaintiff on
notice of its fraud claims is the Senate Report and its associated emails, which actually
form the centerpiece of plaintiff's complaint. In fact, the Senate Report contains a
45-page section on Deutsche Bank entitled "Running the CDO Machine: Case Study of
Deutsche Bank." Taken with all the other information available in the public domain, the
Senate Report is more than sufficient to have placed Aozora on inquiry notice of possible
fraud by April 2011 at the latest (see Aldrich, 52 AD3d at 436; cf. CSAM Capital, Inc. v
Lauder, 67 AD3d 149 [1st Dept 2009]). That Blue Edge was not mentioned by
name in the Senate Report does not change this result. [*5]Aozora had more than $430 million invested in Blue Edge
and other CDOs; it could have, and should have, considered whether Blue Edge's
underlying assets fell within the Senate Report's ambit.
Also significant is that Aozora's counsel actually did investigate Aozora's potential
claims in 2012 or 2013. However, Aozora provides no explanation for why it could not
have performed that same investigation before June 18, 2011, when losses from the
subprime mortgage crisis were receiving considerable attention in the press (see
CIFG Assur. N. Am., 128 AD3d at 608).
The proposed amended complaint does not cure the statute of limitations defects in
the original complaint, as it does not gainsay that Aozora was on inquiry notice of
alleged fraud more than two years before it filed the summons with notice (see K-Bay Plaza, LLC v Kmart
Corp., 132 AD3d 584, 590 [1st Dept 2015]; Meimeteas v Carter Ledyard & Milburn LLP, 105 AD3d
643 [1st Dept 2013]). Concur—Acosta, J.P., Renwick, Andrias and
Moskowitz, JJ.

Debit card payments include one-time and recurring payments of bills made with your debit card that post during the fee period. - Not Included: Any transaction at an ATM (Wells Fargo or non-Wells Fargo) and ACH (Automated Clearing House) transactions.

A qualifying direct deposit is a direct deposit of your salary, pension, Social Security, or other regular monthly income electronically deposited to this checking account by your employer or an outside agency. Transfers from one account to another, or deposits made at a banking location or ATM, do not qualify as a direct deposit. 4. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the bonus interest rate on all eligible savings accounts, and discounts or fee waivers on other products and services will discontinue and revert to the Bank's then- current applicable rate or fee.  For bonus interest rates on time accounts, this change will occur upon renewal.

History[edit]
Aozora Bank is the successor of the Nippon Credit Bank (NCB), which was founded in 1957 as the Nippon Fudosan Bank under a special government trust banking license alongside the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan (LTCB). Nippon Fudosan Bank was itself based on the remaining assets of the Bank of Joseon in Japan.
In December 1998, NCB was brought under government control in order to deal with its extraordinary amount of bad debt left over from the crash of the Japanese asset price bubble in the early 1990s: at the time, the bank was approximately ¥270 billion in debt.
An investor group led by Softbank, Orix and Tokio Marine & Fire Insurance Co. purchased NCB in 2000 for ¥80 billion.[6] As part of this deal, the government included a "defect warranty provision" (瑕疵担保条項, kashi tanpo jōkō) to the effect that NCB could demand within the next three years that the government purchase any claims which had fallen by twenty percent or more from value. A similar provision had controversially been offered to the purchasers of LTCB, which had recently been similarly purchased from the government and renamed Shinsei Bank.[6] Aozora applied this provision conservatively in order to write off ¥400 billion in bad debts owed by about 100 companies, in contrast to Shinsei Bank, the contemporaneous successor of the Long-Term Credit Bank, which wrote off nearly three times as much and was criticized in political circles for doing so.
The sale of NCB to Softbank was viewed as a precedent for the licensing of Sony Bank, Seven Bank and other new banking platforms in Japan.[6]
The bank was renamed "Aozora" in 2001. Softbank initially planned to make Aozora an investment bank for internet-related companies. However, Softbank was unsuccessful in obtaining the cooperation of the Financial Services Agency, and sold its 49% stake to Cerberus Capital Management in September 2003 for ¥101 billion.[7] Aozora launched operations as a retail bank on April 1, 2006, and opened its first new branch in Nihonbashi on November 20.
Aozora Bank was listed as the No. 1 unsecured creditor to Lehman Brothers with about $463 million USD in bank loans to the investment bank as it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September 2008. By comparison, the second largest unsecured creditor was Mizuho Bank with $289 million, and third largest Citibank (Hong Kong branch) with $275 million.
On December 16, 2008, Aozora Bank announced that it had ¥12.4 billion exposure to the Bernard L. Madoff ponzi scheme.[8]
On April 25, 2009, Aozora Bank and Shinsei Bank announced negotiations to integrate their operations in the summer of 2010, with an eye toward an eventual merger. Banks had been hit by losses in the US subprime market.[9] The talks collapsed in May 2010 amid disputes over capitalization and business strategy, as well as the abatement of the 2008 financial crisis.[10]
Aozora acquired Japan Wealth Management Securities in 2011, merging it with existing subsidiary Aozora Securities in 2012.[11]
In January 2013, Cerberus announced that it would sell most of its stake in Aozora, cutting its total share from 58 percent to 7.7 percent.[12] Cerberus sold this last portion of its stake to Barclays for distribution to other investors in August 2013, ending Cerberus's shareholding in Aozora.[13]
Locations[edit]

History[edit]
Aozora Bank is the successor of the Nippon Credit Bank (NCB), which was founded in 1957 as the Nippon Fudosan Bank under a special government trust banking license alongside the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan (LTCB). Nippon Fudosan Bank was itself based on the remaining assets of the Bank of Joseon in Japan.
In December 1998, NCB was brought under government control in order to deal with its extraordinary amount of bad debt left over from the crash of the Japanese asset price bubble in the early 1990s: at the time, the bank was approximately ¥270 billion in debt.
An investor group led by Softbank, Orix and Tokio Marine & Fire Insurance Co. purchased NCB in 2000 for ¥80 billion.[6] As part of this deal, the government included a "defect warranty provision" (瑕疵担保条項, kashi tanpo jōkō) to the effect that NCB could demand within the next three years that the government purchase any claims which had fallen by twenty percent or more from value. A similar provision had controversially been offered to the purchasers of LTCB, which had recently been similarly purchased from the government and renamed Shinsei Bank.[6] Aozora applied this provision conservatively in order to write off ¥400 billion in bad debts owed by about 100 companies, in contrast to Shinsei Bank, the contemporaneous successor of the Long-Term Credit Bank, which wrote off nearly three times as much and was criticized in political circles for doing so.
The sale of NCB to Softbank was viewed as a precedent for the licensing of Sony Bank, Seven Bank and other new banking platforms in Japan.[6]
The bank was renamed "Aozora" in 2001. Softbank initially planned to make Aozora an investment bank for internet-related companies. However, Softbank was unsuccessful in obtaining the cooperation of the Financial Services Agency, and sold its 49% stake to Cerberus Capital Management in September 2003 for ¥101 billion.[7] Aozora launched operations as a retail bank on April 1, 2006, and opened its first new branch in Nihonbashi on November 20.
Aozora Bank was listed as the No. 1 unsecured creditor to Lehman Brothers with about $463 million USD in bank loans to the investment bank as it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September 2008. By comparison, the second largest unsecured creditor was Mizuho Bank with $289 million, and third largest Citibank (Hong Kong branch) with $275 million.
On December 16, 2008, Aozora Bank announced that it had ¥12.4 billion exposure to the Bernard L. Madoff ponzi scheme.[8]
On April 25, 2009, Aozora Bank and Shinsei Bank announced negotiations to integrate their operations in the summer of 2010, with an eye toward an eventual merger. Banks had been hit by losses in the US subprime market.[9] The talks collapsed in May 2010 amid disputes over capitalization and business strategy, as well as the abatement of the 2008 financial crisis.[10]
Aozora acquired Japan Wealth Management Securities in 2011, merging it with existing subsidiary Aozora Securities in 2012.[11]
In January 2013, Cerberus announced that it would sell most of its stake in Aozora, cutting its total share from 58 percent to 7.7 percent.[12] Cerberus sold this last portion of its stake to Barclays for distribution to other investors in August 2013, ending Cerberus's shareholding in Aozora.[13]
Locations[edit]

Aozora's head office is located in the Kudan area of Chiyoda City, Tokyo, near Yasukuni Shrine.
