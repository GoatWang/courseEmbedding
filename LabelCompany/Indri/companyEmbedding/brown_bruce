 Bruce Hardwood Floors  




Bruce Hardwood floors are recognized throughout North America as one of the top brands in hardwood floors. It’s the “tried-and-true”
                                    name in hardwood flooring that homeowners know and trust. And with good reason – Bruce Hardwood floors have been manufactured
                                    for more than a century. Bruce Hardwood planks and strips are made of 100% solid wood, with a ¾” thick construction for nail-down
                                    installation on the first floor and above. Bruce Hardwoods are available in a variety of wood species, including domestic
                                    and exotic hardwoods, at all price points.
                                 
Bruce hardwood floors can be purchased at both independent retailer stores and home centers. To ensure your Bruce hardwood
                                    floor is installed correctly, Armstrong recommends hiring a professional, certified installer.

Customer Questions & Answers








            How much waste?
        

            I need 435 square feet. Should I get 19 or 20 boxes?
        
Asked by: Hickpop

            Add 10% to your total square footage for saw cuts ,blemishes and wrong cuts.
435 x .10 = 43.10 =478.5 / 23.5 = 20.4 boxes

            Board Length -Maximum and average
        

            What is the maximum board Length and average board length. The website states this: &quot;3/4 in. Thickness x 5 in. Width x Random Length Planks up to 84 in.&quot; However, a previous question was answered that &quot; no board is longer than 48&quot;. Please elaborate.
        
Asked by: Henry

            Average I would say is 3' but some 5' and many 1'. It is random. I bought extra boxes to get what I wanted and then combined what was left to create a new box for return. Also to handle the pieces that had a bad grove or tongue.

            Can this ever be sanded down and refinished in the future?
        
Asked by: Maria

            Yes it will be able to since it is solid hardwood. Means that it is the same throughout the wood and not just a laminate top.

The only thing I can tell you is run. Don't let the beauty of this wood trick you into buying it. Yes, it is beautiful but oh so delicate. I dropped my keys on the floor and ended up with a big gash. If you have a dog, forget it. We have to walk as if on eggshells. Also, if you don't like your floor talking back to you every time you take a step then this is not the floor for you. It squeaks terribly. After looking for weeks for the perfect flooring we decided on this and spent $10,000 plus installation and it was the biggest waste of money we have ever spent. I can't wait to have it replaced but I can't afford to yet so I am stuck with it.

        Beautiful flooring, but I'll never recommend them again!
I ordered this flooring and installed it in a customer's home. I've installed 1000s of sq ft of flooring in the past, and will not recommend a Bruce product to anyone. Every last case of flooring I ordered had a width variance between 4 7/8" and 5 1/8". I had to go thru every single case and make stacks of same width product just to install this flooring. If it were for my personal home, or if it wasn't for the tight deadline on this particular job, I would have sent every last bit back to the factory.

I had some concerns about this product based on the reviews.  I did some research including talking to some specialty shops and calling Armstrong.  I learned that the industry standard is 5% per case of damaged or off spec wood.  Armstrong assured me that they would refund me if any box was more than 5%.  I took the risk and purchased 8 boxes.  Ended up only needing 6.  The off spec percent was closer about 1%.  I was very pleased with the quality and the look especially at this price point.  Would definitely recommend.  My only complaint is that Home Depot and Armstrong does not provide any information regarding a matching wood filler.

As an overall, I’m disappointed. My disappointment is driven by two major factors:
1) Damage during delivery/shipping
2) Product quality
3) Refund policy

DELIVERY: wood arrived severely damaged during shipping. I had to return 25% of my order to the store even without opening the boxes because of severe damage imposed on the product during shipping. Replacement I received was in a bit better shape, but also many planks were damaged (inside of the boxes!) by ignorant shipping. Ordering in pallets won’t help: many outside boxes receive damage anyway. If a side of the box is damaged, it means you’re throwing away at least half of the box, because there are not so many planks inside (these are the wider planks – less quantity inside of the box). I had to deal with all kinds of issues caused by improper shipping: split tongue/groove sides, cracked plank ends, cracked planks, etc.
Not just shipping to home made my order inconvenient, it brought extra burden and nerves:
1) Shipping carrier lost most part of my order and had no clue where it was. I spent plenty of time on the phone with Home Depot and shipping carrier trying to find it.
2) Since my delivery turned into three parts (instead of one), I had to meet the delivery three times instead of one. Each time they give you ½ day time slot, so you’re really stuck.
3) You have to help yourself in case you have to return your order. Get a car/truck, load boxes into it, get to home depot.

All in all, SHIPPING TO HOME turned out into tremendous WASTE OF TIME instead of providing time savings.

Shipping to home – never again.


PRODUCT QUALITY: 
a) GAPS. Be prepared for a good piece of extra work! I mean it. Unless you don’t care about gaps. This product is NOT the case shown on most videos when you just use your rubber mallet and then nail it… If you want to have no gaps, you’ll have to apply some imagination and special tooling to make them stick to each other seamlessly. LOTS OF EXTRA EFFORT.
b) FINISH. Some of the planks happened to have damaged finish out of the box. Some had wood filler. Some had bark on the reverse side.
c) WIDTH. Some planks have different width at their ends. Watch out!
d) LENGTH. Not excited about planks length. Even if you happen to reveal some longer planks inside of the boxes, most of them are extra trouble to fit (see point #a above)
e) COLOR variation. Colors and texture vary significantly. Even putting some obviously gray planks aside (yes, something you wouldn’t expect to get as “select” grade), you either ignore colors and texture variation or spend even more time dealing with it. I just pulled plug on it at some point.
f) WASTE. I had to try really hard in order to minimize waste. I had to assemble, disassemble and assemble again each row for several times due to gaps, uneven planks, damaged planks, planks not fitting into each other, damaged/incomplete tongues, etc.

As a bottom line – I would stick to another product if I knew I would experience issues above. I would be okay to deal with points #b)-f) above if planks would fit easy. Point #a (gaps) is the major time consumer which made my project drag a LOT LONGER THAN EXPECTED.

NEVERTHELESS I have to admit that after all this hard work, the RESULT LOOKS AWESOME! 

REFUND POLICY: watch out as they may not refund you taxes you paid! That is my case. They just provided refund for the product price, but not the taxes. This is the very first time ever I experience that.

As a bottom line: my project turned out to last LOT LONGER due to EXTRA EFFORT I had put into making planks fit seamlessly. You got what you pay for. Though the resulting floor looks great and awesome, I will definitely stick to different product and likely buy it right from the store/warehouse should I do next project of the kind.

The Oak flooring was very nice and easy to install. The finish was great. This was a continuation of a project with leftovers from a different manufacturer and seemed to have a slight difference in the natural colors. The tongue and grove was a little different and had a little trouble with lining up. Overall I was satisfied with the product but suggest you stick with one manufacturer.

Very hard oak. I have 2 90 lbs dogs and they have yet to scratch this. They are black labs so this floor hides all of the clumps of hair scattered around the room. Love the 5in wide planks. Installation was a breeze. Make sure you pull planks from different boxes to make sure the shades are mixed up.
