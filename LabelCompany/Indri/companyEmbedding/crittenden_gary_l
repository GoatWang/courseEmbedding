Early life and education[edit]
Crittenden was raised in Ogden, UT. He was the student body president at Ogden High School in 1971. He served a two-year mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Germany, and graduated from BYU's Marriott School of Management with a bachelor of science degree in management in 1976. He went on to earn an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1979.[4][5]
Career[edit]
Crittenden began his career as a consultant at Bain and Company where he worked on various strategic projects in the United States and Germany. Crittenden served as CFO and executive Vice President at Melville Corp.[6] While at Melville, he was the architect of the breakup of the company that led a significant increase in share price as the company was split into three firms.[7][8] He was the CFO of Sears Roebuck and Company from 1997 to 1998. He then served as the CFO of Monsanto Company from 1998 to 2000. At Monsanto, Crittenden led the efforts to acquire seed companies DeKalb Genetics Corporation, and the Delta and Pine Land Company.[9] He also played a key role in the eventual sale of Monsanto to Pharmacia & Upjohn.[10] Prior to joining Citigroup, Crittenden was Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of American Express, as well as the head of the company's Global Network Services division.[7]
In 2007, Crittenden joined Citigroup as CFO.[11] At Citigroup, he led the reengineering effort that cut 75,000 jobs, reduced assets by around $500 billion, and helped guide the firm through the financial crisis.[11][12] In 2010 Crittenden and the company settled claims of unintentional disclosure errors brought by the SEC, without admitting wrongdoing on the part of Crittenden, in connection with Citigroup's exposure to subprime mortgage assets.[13][14][15]
In April 2012, Crittenden was named CEO of Huntsman Gay Global Capital.[16] In his first year at HGGC, Crittenden oversaw the sale of the utilities services holding company Power Holdings to Kelso & Co. for $380 million.[17] Prior to Crittenden’s arrival, Huntsman Gay Global Capital created Power Holdings by acquiring several utilities services throughout the United States. In just over two years, Power Holdings grew from approximately 90 utility crews to more than 200 crews. Crittenden and HGGC completed the sale via the $1.1 billion Huntsman Gay Capital Partners Fund I LP.
In 2013, Crittenden became the chairman of Huntsman Gay Global Capital (HGGC) after co-founder Richard Lawson took over as chief executive.[18] As chairman of HGCC, Crittenden oversaw the establishment of the firm’s second vehicle, Fund II. Fund II will generally adhere to HGGC investment criteria such as revenues of $100 million or more, enterprise values of $100–500 million, and EBITDA of at least $15 million.[19]
In December 2013, Crittenden oversaw the acquisition of Lucent Polymers by the HGGC company Citadel Plastics Holdings, a top global thermoplastics and thermoset resins compounder.[20] The acquisition gave Citadel Plastics access to a portfolio of over 1,400 formulations and enhanced its position in the engineered resins sector. Crittenden heralded the acquisition as a prime example of growth via strategic acquisition and integration of successful, complementary businesses. According to Crittenden, Citadel Plastics will benefit greatly from the financial strength and blue-chip customer base of Lucent, as well as its numerous development initiatives. The Lucent acquisition was Citadel’s seventh since 2007 and the 31st overall acquisition for HGGC.
Crittenden currently serves as the chairman of iQor, a global business process outsourcing services provider based in New York City.[21] In January 2014, iQor acquired the aftermarket services business of Jabil Circuit, Inc. for $725 million. Headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida, Jabil Aftermarket Services stands as the top aftermarket services provider in industries such as consumer devices, mobility, telecommunications, medical devices, and computing. The transaction boosts iQor revenues to over $1.5 billion and increases its employee count to more than 31,000 individuals across 16 countries. According to Crittenden, the acquisition helps iQor’s customers benefit from a “considerably larger global footprint and additional financial resources.”[21]
Crittenden has served on a number of corporate boards in his professional life, including Filene's Basement, where he was CFO early in his career, Wilson's Leather, Sears of Mexico and Sears Canada (where he was CFO of the parent company, Sears Roebuck and Company), Ryerson, Inc., TJX Companies (parent company to TJMaxx and Marshall's), Staples, and Primerica.[7][22] Additionally, he is chairman of the board of the HGGC portfolio companies: Power Holdings, iQor, and Citadel.[7][23]
Personal life[edit]
Crittenden is married to the former Catherine Jean Cox and they have three children.[24] He is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and served a two-year mission in Germany as a youth. He has served in several leadership positions in the church including bishop, stake president, and area seventy.[25] In 2017, Crittenden became managing director of the LDS Church's Missionary Department.[citation needed]
Awards and honors[edit]

In 2007, Crittenden joined Citigroup as CFO.[11] At Citigroup, he led the reengineering effort that cut 75,000 jobs, reduced assets by around $500 billion, and helped guide the firm through the financial crisis.[11][12] In 2010 Crittenden and the company settled claims of unintentional disclosure errors brought by the SEC, without admitting wrongdoing on the part of Crittenden, in connection with Citigroup's exposure to subprime mortgage assets.[13][14][15]
In April 2012, Crittenden was named CEO of Huntsman Gay Global Capital.[16] In his first year at HGGC, Crittenden oversaw the sale of the utilities services holding company Power Holdings to Kelso & Co. for $380 million.[17] Prior to Crittenden’s arrival, Huntsman Gay Global Capital created Power Holdings by acquiring several utilities services throughout the United States. In just over two years, Power Holdings grew from approximately 90 utility crews to more than 200 crews. Crittenden and HGGC completed the sale via the $1.1 billion Huntsman Gay Capital Partners Fund I LP.
In 2013, Crittenden became the chairman of Huntsman Gay Global Capital (HGGC) after co-founder Richard Lawson took over as chief executive.[18] As chairman of HGCC, Crittenden oversaw the establishment of the firm’s second vehicle, Fund II. Fund II will generally adhere to HGGC investment criteria such as revenues of $100 million or more, enterprise values of $100–500 million, and EBITDA of at least $15 million.[19]
In December 2013, Crittenden oversaw the acquisition of Lucent Polymers by the HGGC company Citadel Plastics Holdings, a top global thermoplastics and thermoset resins compounder.[20] The acquisition gave Citadel Plastics access to a portfolio of over 1,400 formulations and enhanced its position in the engineered resins sector. Crittenden heralded the acquisition as a prime example of growth via strategic acquisition and integration of successful, complementary businesses. According to Crittenden, Citadel Plastics will benefit greatly from the financial strength and blue-chip customer base of Lucent, as well as its numerous development initiatives. The Lucent acquisition was Citadel’s seventh since 2007 and the 31st overall acquisition for HGGC.
Crittenden currently serves as the chairman of iQor, a global business process outsourcing services provider based in New York City.[21] In January 2014, iQor acquired the aftermarket services business of Jabil Circuit, Inc. for $725 million. Headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida, Jabil Aftermarket Services stands as the top aftermarket services provider in industries such as consumer devices, mobility, telecommunications, medical devices, and computing. The transaction boosts iQor revenues to over $1.5 billion and increases its employee count to more than 31,000 individuals across 16 countries. According to Crittenden, the acquisition helps iQor’s customers benefit from a “considerably larger global footprint and additional financial resources.”[21]
Crittenden has served on a number of corporate boards in his professional life, including Filene's Basement, where he was CFO early in his career, Wilson's Leather, Sears of Mexico and Sears Canada (where he was CFO of the parent company, Sears Roebuck and Company), Ryerson, Inc., TJX Companies (parent company to TJMaxx and Marshall's), Staples, and Primerica.[7][22] Additionally, he is chairman of the board of the HGGC portfolio companies: Power Holdings, iQor, and Citadel.[7][23]
Personal life[edit]
Crittenden is married to the former Catherine Jean Cox and they have three children.[24] He is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and served a two-year mission in Germany as a youth. He has served in several leadership positions in the church including bishop, stake president, and area seventy.[25] In 2017, Crittenden became managing director of the LDS Church's Missionary Department.[citation needed]

Early life and education[edit]
Crittenden was raised in Ogden, UT. He was the student body president at Ogden High School in 1971. He served a two-year mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Germany, and graduated from BYU's Marriott School of Management with a bachelor of science degree in management in 1976. He went on to earn an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1979.[4][5]
Career[edit]
Crittenden began his career as a consultant at Bain and Company where he worked on various strategic projects in the United States and Germany. Crittenden served as CFO and executive Vice President at Melville Corp.[6] While at Melville, he was the architect of the breakup of the company that led a significant increase in share price as the company was split into three firms.[7][8] He was the CFO of Sears Roebuck and Company from 1997 to 1998. He then served as the CFO of Monsanto Company from 1998 to 2000.

Crittenden currently serves as the chairman of iQor, a global business process outsourcing services provider based in New York City.[21] In January 2014, iQor acquired the aftermarket services business of Jabil Circuit, Inc. for $725 million. Headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida, Jabil Aftermarket Services stands as the top aftermarket services provider in industries such as consumer devices, mobility, telecommunications, medical devices, and computing. The transaction boosts iQor revenues to over $1.5 billion and increases its employee count to more than 31,000 individuals across 16 countries. According to Crittenden, the acquisition helps iQor’s customers benefit from a “considerably larger global footprint and additional financial resources.”[21]
Crittenden has served on a number of corporate boards in his professional life, including Filene's Basement, where he was CFO early in his career, Wilson's Leather, Sears of Mexico and Sears Canada (where he was CFO of the parent company, Sears Roebuck and Company), Ryerson, Inc., TJX Companies (parent company to TJMaxx and Marshall's), Staples, and Primerica.[7][22] Additionally, he is chairman of the board of the HGGC portfolio companies: Power Holdings, iQor, and Citadel.[7][23]
Personal life[edit]
Crittenden is married to the former Catherine Jean Cox and they have three children.[24] He is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and served a two-year mission in Germany as a youth. He has served in several leadership positions in the church including bishop, stake president, and area seventy.[25] In 2017, Crittenden became managing director of the LDS Church's Missionary Department.[citation needed]
Awards and honors[edit]

Honorary doctorate from Weber State University in 2003[26]
Named one of Institutional Investor’s Best CFOs in America in 2004 and 2006[27]

Crittenden served as CFO and executive Vice President at Melville Corp.[6] While at Melville, he was the architect of the breakup of the company that led a significant increase in share price as the company was split into three firms.[7][8] He was the CFO of Sears Roebuck and Company from 1997 to 1998. He then served as the CFO of Monsanto Company from 1998 to 2000. At Monsanto, Crittenden led the efforts to acquire seed companies DeKalb Genetics Corporation, and the Delta and Pine Land Company.[9] He also played a key role in the eventual sale of Monsanto to Pharmacia & Upjohn.[10] Prior to joining Citigroup, Crittenden was Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of American Express, as well as the head of the company's Global Network Services division.[7]In 2007, Crittenden joined Citigroup as CFO.[11] At Citigroup, he led the reengineering effort that cut 75,000 jobs, reduced assets by around $500 billion, and helped guide the firm through the financial crisis.[11][12] In 2010 Crittenden and the company settled claims of unintentional disclosure errors brought by the SEC, without admitting wrongdoing on the part of Crittenden, in connection with Citigroup's exposure to subprime mortgage assets.[13][14][15]In April 2012, Crittenden was named CEO of Huntsman Gay Global Capital.[16] In his first year at HGGC, Crittenden oversaw the sale of the utilities services holding company Power Holdings to Kelso & Co. for $380 million.[17] Prior to Crittenden’s arrival, Huntsman Gay Global Capital created Power Holdings by acquiring several utilities services throughout the United States. In just over two years, Power Holdings grew from approximately 90 utility crews to more than 200 crews. Crittenden and HGGC completed the sale via the $1.1 billion Huntsman Gay Capital Partners Fund I LP.In 2013, Crittenden became the chairman of Huntsman Gay Global Capital (HGGC) after co-founder Richard Lawson took over as chief executive.[18] As chairman of HGCC, Crittenden oversaw the establishment of the firm’s second vehicle, Fund II. Fund II will generally adhere to HGGC investment criteria such as revenues of $100 million or more, enterprise values of $100–500 million, and EBITDA of at least $15 million.[19]In December 2013, Crittenden oversaw the acquisition of Lucent Polymers by the HGGC company Citadel Plastics Holdings, a top global thermoplastics and thermoset resins compounder.[20] The acquisition gave Citadel Plastics access to a portfolio of over 1,400 formulations and enhanced its position in the engineered resins sector. Crittenden heralded the acquisition as a prime example of growth via strategic acquisition and integration of successful, complementary businesses. According to Crittenden, Citadel Plastics will benefit greatly from the financial strength and blue-chip customer base of Lucent, as well as its numerous development initiatives. The Lucent acquisition was Citadel’s seventh since 2007 and the 31st overall acquisition for HGGC.Crittenden currently serves as the chairman of iQor, a global business process outsourcing services provider based in New York City.[21] In January 2014, iQor acquired the aftermarket services business of Jabil Circuit, Inc. for $725 million. Headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida, Jabil Aftermarket Services stands as the top aftermarket services provider in industries such as consumer devices, mobility, telecommunications, medical devices, and computing. The transaction boosts iQor revenues to over $1.5 billion and increases its employee count to more than 31,000 individuals across 16 countries. According to Crittenden, the acquisition helps iQor’s customers benefit from a “considerably larger global footprint and additional financial resources.”[21]Crittenden has served on a number of corporate boards in his professional life, including Filene's Basement, where he was CFO early in his career, Wilson's Leather, Sears of Mexico and Sears Canada (where he was CFO of the parent company, Sears Roebuck and Company), Ryerson, Inc., TJX Companies (parent company to TJMaxx and Marshall's), Staples, and Primerica.[7][22] Additionally, he is chairman of the board of the HGGC portfolio companies: Power Holdings, iQor, and Citadel.[7][23]Personal lifeCrittenden is married to the former Catherine Jean Cox and they have three children.[24] He is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and served a two-year mission in Germany as a youth. He has served in several leadership positions in the church including bishop, stake president, and area seventy.[25] In 2017, Crittenden became managing director of the LDS Church's Missionary Department.[citation needed]Awards and honorsHonorary doctorate from Weber State University in 2003[26]Named one of Institutional Investor’s Best CFOs in America in 2004 and 2006[27]References^ "Gary Crittenden Leaves Citi, Joining Huntsman Gay".

For Crittenden, a Bad Time to Be at Citigroup


				By Cyrus Sanati			
July 29, 2010 7:50 pm
July 29, 2010 7:50 pm





Gary L. Crittenden, the former chief financial officer of Citigroup, joined the bank in February 2007, a few months before the subprime mortgage crisis erupted, shaking the financial system. At the time he told The New York Times that this was “the best job I could ever imagine.”
Three years later, it is probably safe to assume that Mr. Crittenden feels a bit differently about being the chief financial officer of Citigroup. He has agreed to pay a $100,000 fine to the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle claims that he violating federal disclosure rules. Citigroup itself has agreed to pay $75 million to settle  claims that it failed to disclose roughly $43 billion in holdings of subprime mortgage investments that crippled the bank during the financial crisis. 
Mr. Crittenden was not an accountant by training but had been chief financial officer of other companies before joining Citigroup. He graduated from Brigham Young University in 1976 with a degree in management and then went on to Harvard Business School to earn his masters in business administration in 1979.
Mr. Crittenden began his career as a consultant at Bain & Company where he worked on a number of strategic consulting projects. His first job as chief financial officer was for Sears Roebuck in 1997. He then left Sears in 1998 to be the chief financial officer of Monsanto. Then in 2000, Mr. Crittenden took the chief financial officer role at American Express, where he would stay until he joined Citigroup in 2007.
American Express is a financial firm, but it is very different from Citigroup. The mortgage-backed collateralized debt obligations and other complex securitized products that Citigroup handled were probably foreign to Mr. Crittenden.
“I don’t pretend to have any deep insight into Citi,” Mr. Crittenden told The Times when he became the bank’s chief financial officer, ”but what I do know is the company has scope and scale and a brand that is very impressive.”
Mr. Crittenden was replaced as chief financial officer in March 2009 and made chief executive of Citi Holdings, which is a depository for billions of dollars in assets that Citigroup plans to sell in its effort to trim its bloated balance sheet. Mr. Crittenden did not spend too long in that role, leaving just five months later to join a number of his former Bain colleagues over at Huntsman Gay Global Capital, a private equity firm. Mr. Crittenden remains at Huntsman Gay, which raised more than $1 billion last year to do buyouts in the middle market.
The S.E.C. settlement comes a year after Mr. Crittenden left Citigroup, but the $100,000 fine will probably tarnish Mr. Crittenden’s name more than it will hurt his pocket book.
In 2007, he took home nearly $20 million in total compensation from Citigroup, even though the company’s stock had fallen nearly 50 percent that year. He then took home another $12 million worth of stock in 2008 even though the bank nearly collapsed. Citigroup’s stock in total fell around 95 percent during Mr. Crittenden’s time at the bank.

Biography
Early life and education
Crittenden was raised in Ogden, UT. He served a two-year mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Germany, and graduated from BYU's Marriott School of Management with a bachelor of science degree in management in 1976. He went on to earn an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1979.[2][4] Crittenden has served as a bishop, stake president, and area seventy in the LDS Church.[5]
Career
Crittenden began his career as a consultant at Bain and Company where he worked on various strategic projects in the United States and Germany. Crittenden served as CFO and executive Vice President at Melville Corp.[6] While at Melville, he was the architect of the breakup of the company that led a significant increase in share price as the company was split into three firms.[2][7] He was the CFO of Sears Roebuck and Company from 1997 to 1998. He then served as the CFO of Monsanto Company from 1998 to 2000. At Monsanto, Crittenden led the efforts to acquire seed companies DeKalb Genetics Corporation, and the Delta and Pine Land Company.[8] He also played a key role in the eventual sale of Monsanto to Pharmacia & Upjohn.[9] Prior to joining Citigroup, Crittenden was Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of American Express, as well as the head of the company's Global Network Services division.[2]
In 2007, Crittenden joined Citigroup as CFO.[10] At Citigroup, he led the reengineering effort that cut 75,000 jobs, reduced assets by around $500 billion, and helped guide the firm through the financial crisis.[10][11] In 2010 Crittenden settled claims made by the SEC without admitting wrongdoing in connection with Citigroup's exposure to subprime mortgage assets.[12][13]
In April 2012, Crittenden was named CEO of Huntsman Gay Global Capital.[14] In his first year at HGGC, Crittenden oversaw the sale of the utilities services holding company Power Holdings to Kelso & Co. for $380 million.[15] Prior to Crittenden’s arrival, Huntsman Gay Global Capital created Power Holdings by acquiring several utilities services throughout the United States. In just over two years, Power Holdings grew from approximately 90 utility crews to more than 200 crews. Crittenden and HGGC completed the sale via the $1.1 billion Huntsman Gay Capital Partners Fund I LP.
In 2013, Gary Crittenden became the chairman of Huntsman Gay Global Capital (HGGC) after co-founder Richard Lawson took over as chief executive.[16] As chairman of HGCC, Crittenden oversaw the establishment of the firm’s second vehicle, Fund II. Fund II will generally adhere to HGGC investment criteria such as revenues of $100 million or more, enterprise values of $100–500 million, and EBITDA of at least $15 million.[17]
In December 2013, Gary Crittenden oversaw the acquisition of Lucent Polymers by the HGGC company Citadel Plastics Holdings, a top global thermoplastics and thermoset resins compounder.[18] The acquisition gave Citadel Plastics access to a portfolio of over 1,400 formulations and enhanced its position in the engineered resins sector. Crittenden heralded the acquisition as a prime example of growth via strategic acquisition and integration of successful, complementary businesses. According to Crittenden, Citadel Plastics will benefit greatly from the financial strength and blue-chip customer base of Lucent, as well as its numerous development initiatives. The Lucent acquisition was Citadel’s seventh since 2007 and the 31st overall acquisition for HGGC.
Gary Crittenden currently serves as the chairman of iQor, a global business process outsourcing services provider based in New York City.[19] In January 2014, iQor acquired the aftermarket services business of Jabil Circuit, Inc. for $725 million. Headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida, Jabil Aftermarket Services stands as the top aftermarket services provider in industries such as consumer devices, mobility, telecommunications, medical devices, and computing. The transaction boosts iQor revenues to over $1.5 billion and increases its employee count to more than 31,000 individuals across 16 countries. According to Crittenden, the acquisition helps iQor’s customers benefit from a “considerably larger global footprint and additional financial resources.”[20]
Corporate boards
Crittenden has served on a number of corporate boards in his professional life, including Filene's Basement, where he was CFO early in his career, Wilson's Leather, Sears of Mexico and Sears Canada (where he was CFO of the parent company, Sears Roebuck and Company), Ryerson, Inc., TJX Companies (parent company to TJMaxx and Marshall's), Staples, and Primerica.[2][21] Additionally, he is chairman of the board of the HGGC portfolio companies: Power Holdings, iQor, and Citadel.[2][22]
Awards and Recognition
Crittenden has been recognized and won or been nominated for several awards, including:

He received an honorary doctorate from Weber State University in 2003.[23]
He was named one of Institutional Investor’s Best CFOs in America in 2004 and 2006.[24]
