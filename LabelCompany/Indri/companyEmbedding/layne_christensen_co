WATER RESOURCES_6 MGD RO System, Hutchinson, Kansas


WATER RESOURCES - 6 MGD RO System




   



   






SITUATION
Located 39 miles northwest of Wichita, the City of Hutchinson, Kansas has a population of over 40,000. The public water supply is derived from 20 municipal wells, most of which have been installed and maintained by Layne.  The City discovered that carbon tetrachloride and other Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) had contaminated one of its well sites. Further, high levels of inorganic chlorides (salts) were present. VOCs are typically treated by air stripping, however, this strategy was complicated by the chlorides, which cannot be removed through air stripping processes.
SOLUTION
An engineering firm was brought in to devise a treatment strategy. The resulting facility treats water from the contaminated well, removing iron and manganese with manganese dioxide pressure filters, removing chlorides through Reverse Osmosis (RO), then removing CO2 and VOCs in a degasifier concealed in the clock tower. The resulting pure water is blended with city water, resulting in a peak production capability of 10 MGD.  In June of 2007 Layne was awarded a contract from the General Contractor to assist in the design and fabrication of a 6 MGD RO system, including 5 micron cartridge filters, Clean-in-Place equipment, and chemical feed equipment.  The four RO skids were fabricated in Layne's Lakeland, Florida manufacturing facility, while chemical feed equipment was fabricated in Layne's Kansas City facility.  There are four RO trains comprised of 24 x 12 -7M arrays, using Hydranautics ESPA 2 membranes. Each train is capable of producing 1.5 MGD of permeate from 2 MGD of influent. The RO trains provide a combined 6 MGD of RO water from 8 MGD of feed.

HEAVY CIVIL - Intake and Pump Station Construction


HEAVY CIVIL - Intake and Pump Station




    



    






SITUATION
An additional high capacity, 8.5 MGD, river intake raw water supply was required.  Traditional intake structures would create a hazard to barge traffic on the river.  The proposed pump station site was small and behind a frequently used railroad track directly along the river bank.   The design could not be finished without input from the construction team.
SOLUTION
A CMAR, Construction Manager At Risk, delivery mode was utilized to allow design and construction to progress simultaneously. Layne was experienced in the  open face shielded tunnel method, and used this method to mine a horizontal tunnel 200 feet through bedrock to a point under the river.  This tunnel carried the two intake pipes to the wet well shaft, passing under the railroad tracks.  Using Layne's marine capability, vertical rock shafts were drilled down in the wet from barges to intercept the horizontal tunnel.  The intake vertical pipes and screens were inserted by divers and grouted in place.  The intake screens were set at an elevation below barge traffic.
Extensive site work was performed prior to starting the wet well construction.  Approximately 10,000 cubic yards of material was excavated, loaded, and hauled off site to make room for the new pump station facility. The process equipment included in the project included 4 vertical turbine pumps, 2 sludge pumps, 1 hydroburst system, and 2 wedgewire intake screens (located in the river).

SITUATION
Gold Slickline had
previously been using shaft boring machines to complete raised bores for
ventilation shafts. The process had been frustrating due to the deviations
encountered with that method, requiring them to mine over to the borehole
rather than intersect the tunnel with the borehole. Meetings with Layne
 and IDS (Layne's Directional Drilling Division) led to Layne being
hired. 
SOLUTION
IDS was commissioned to directionally drill a pilot hole to intersect the tunnel and then ream the pilot hole to 14 7/8 inches.  The Layne Team then installed and cemented 8 inch casing throughout the borehole into the top of the tunnel, secured with a rock-bolted plate and sealant.  The directional hole set up directly over the underground tunnel and remained vertically
straight to 2000 feet; the directional drilling stopped at 1920 feet.  The intent was to install and cement casing in the borehole to facilitate material
transport into the mine tunnel. The surface collar pipe was set at approximately
60 feet.  The plan was to drill a 6 1/4 inch diameter pilot hole conventionally to
500 feet and continue until the inclination threatened to take the path of the hole
outside the desired column of a 5 feet radius. At just beyond 500 feet, the hole had
reached 1.3° deviation and was at the outer limits of that column.
The directional
equipment was then employed, and although the hole did move out of the column,
it was quickly brought back into the desired zone and kept there for the
remainder of the hole. In two
instances the directional drill adjustable bent housing had to be changed to combat the formation influence, but it was generally maintained at a
1.15° bend.  This was achieved by using what is known as the performance
drilling method, where the drill string is oriented to bend the hole
in a desired direction, the entire assembly is slid to adjust the inclination
or azimuth and then the assembly is rotated when no adjustment is needed. At
the end of the project, the hole managed to break out only 30 inches from dead center
of the column.  This was true success for both Layne and the client.

HEAVY CIVIL - Water Treatment Plant Construction


HEAVY CIVIL - KY American Water Treatment Plant Construction




    



    






SITUATION
This high profile, project is part of an overall $150 million long term water supply solution for the Central KY Region.   The extensive project consisted of constructing an all new 20 MGD surface water treatment facility including raw water intake from the Kentucky River Pool 3, pipeline, and involved state of the art components including high rate plate settlers and on-site sodium hypochlorite generation.
The proposed site of the plant presented many design challenges. Also, the World Equestrian Games were being held in 2010, which would place a great demand on the regional water supply.
SOLUTION
Layne decided to pool resources to ensure on-time completion. A Joint Venture was formed with W. Rogers Co. of Lexington, KY. Facilitated partnering was engaged to coach all members of the team in solving issues in a true partnering mindset. This project was successful because of the full collaboration of our project team, and was built in less than 2 ½ years, making it online in time for the 2010 World Equestrian Games.
Layne worked with the design engineer and owner on early conceptual designs and constructability issues. Unique construction techniques were suggested for the deep river intake in rock, raw water pipelines with significant elevation changes and a sharp turn in direction. The 20 MGD plant design employed state of the art components including high rate plate settlers and on-site sodium hypochlorite generation.
Design included a unique pipeline anchor system to allow the raw water transmission line to traverse the bluff and carry process and electric utilities between facilities. Process treatment includes rapid mixers, horizontal reel flocculation, plate settler clarifiers and mixed media dual cell filters. Structures consisted of Chemical Building, Sludge Dewatering Building, Primary Clarifiers, Aeration Tanks, Secondary Clarifiers, and Effluent Plant PS with future UV provisions and Clearwell. SCADA design incorporated a fully automated system. For redundancy, the electrical system design takes medium voltage service from the utility and provides a redundant service utilizing 5kV and 480 volt distribution networks.

WATER RESOURCES - Membrane Aeration Removes Entrained Air




    



    






SITUATION
Many public water supplies have entrained air that causes the water to appear “milky” or “cloudy”.  Conventional methods to remove entrained air can result in headloss reduced capacity, and – in the case of stilling basins - add significantly to a plant's footprint and require additional construction.  However, left untreated, entrained air can adversely affect flow capacity and result in lower water pressures and reduced fireflow capacity.  United Water New York (UWNY) owns and operates the water supply, treatment and distribution system that serves most of Rockland County, New York, including 45 wells. Some of these wells contain high levels of entrained / dissolved air and must be operated below capacity.
SOLUTION
Following the successful pilot test of Membrane Liqui-Cel Contactor, UWNY contracted with Layne for design and construction of deaeration systems for two wells.  The challenge was to optimize the use of these wells while minimizing capital and operating expenditures.  One well was designed to operate at a flow of 1700 gpm; the other at 1000 pgm.   The treatment trains installed by Layne were designed for peak capacities of 2400 and 1200 GPM, respectively, and are providing reduced capital and operations expenditures compared to typical technologies used for dissolved air removal.

In the news[edit]
In 2010, Layne Christensen assisted in the rescue of 33 miners trapped for 69 days as a result of the Copiapó mining accident in Chile.[15]
In 2012, it was announced that certain officers and directors at Layne Christensen Company were under investigation in connection with allegations that certain payments by the company to customs clearing agents in connection with importing equipment into the Democratic Republic of Congo potentially might have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Layne voluntarily alerted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and U.S. Department of Justice of the possible discrepancies.[16] Necessary disciplinary actions were taken toward involved parties.
On Thursday, August 30, 2012, the CEO of Layne Christensen Co., Rene Robichaud rang the opening bell at the Nasdaq Stock Market in honor of the company's 130 anniversary.[17]
Chilean miner rescue[edit]
See also: 2010 Copiapó mining accident
On August 5, 2010, a cave in traps 33 miners underground, and rescue efforts were deployed immediately. Through a joint effort, Layne and their Latine American affiliate, Geotec, the Chilean miners were rescued after 69 days underground.
Large escape boreholes were drilled simultaneously using different equipment provided by multiple international corporations with three different strategies.

Plan A, the Strata 950 (702 meter target depth at 90°),
Plan B, the Schramm T130XD (638 meter target depth at 82°),
Plan C, a RIG-421 drill (597 meter target depth at 85°).[18]

The Layne and Geotec team applied experience from worldwide operations and well over 100 years of drilling experience; Minera Collahuasi and Minera Escondida funded the project and also provided a team of geologists and engineers. On August 15, Geotec uses a Schramm Inc. 685W and two diamond rigs (CS 3001 and CS 4002) for the first drilling stage. Then on August 26, Geotec works to ensure that the 5 1/2-inch 6C pilot hole is drilling to reach the underground workshop. After five days of constant drilling, the third attempt succeeds. As drilling progresses, the T-130XD comes to a halt at 880 feet when the "nose" of the 12-inch hammer bit breaks. It's a setback when the metal piece blocks the well. At this time, Layne drillers flown from Afghanistan and helpers flown from the U.S. arrive. The entire team is now complete and works to clear the hole. Reaming the hole to 12 inches is completed at 2,040 feet, proving the theory of following the 5 1/2-inch hole to the mine workshop and then the hole is reamed to 28 inches to allow for the rescue pod, ''Fénix'' capsules. On October 9, cheers go up as the Plan B drill rig reaches its target - the mine workshop, allowing the rescue to begin. Finally, on October 12, final preparations and test runs are carried out. Rescuers begin pulling miners to safety in the ''Fénix'' capsules.The whole world watched as the miners emerged to safety, culminating a multinational, multi-disciplined team effort involving coordination and cooperation between the teams.
Following the rescue operations Layne and Geotec received official recognition from U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House.[19][20]

Layne provides total water management solutions for government agencies, commercial water suppliers, industrial facilities, and energy companies. Their teams are responsible for effectively managing water in every phase of its lifecycle – supply, treatment, delivery and maintenance.[citation needed] Throughout each phase, Layne works to ensure compliance with complex state and federal regulations, and to meet increasingly high standards for quality, reliability and efficiency.[citation needed]
Construction[edit]
The geotechnical capabilities of Layne allows them to improve soil conditions and support subterranean structures in underground construction projects where effective water management is critical, such as dams and levees, tunnels, water lines, subways, highways and marine facilities.
Drilling[edit]
Layne specialists are able to define the source, depth, magnitude and overall feasibility of water aquifers, and drill high-volume wells suitable for supplying water to government agencies, industrial and agricultural customers. Their mineral exploration teams extract contaminant-free samples that accurately reflect the underlying mineral deposits. Also, Layne is able to drill deep injection wells to facilitate the disposal of treated wastewater.[citation needed]
Divisions[edit]
Water Resources[edit]
Water Resources provides sustainable solutions for every aspect of water supply system development and technology applications for heavy civil construction, hydrology, water treatment systems and services, as well as pipelines and transmission mains.
Mineral Exploration[edit]
Mineral Exploration Division conducts primarily above ground drilling activities, including all phases of core drilling, reverse circulation, dual tube, hammer and rotary air-blast methods. Layne's service offerings include both exploratory and directional drilling for major gold, copper and other base metal producers.
Energy Services[edit]
Energy Services offers water solutions to the Oil & Gas industry concerning sourcing, transfer services, treatment and vibration technology.
Inliner[edit]
Layne Inliner, LLC is the second largest cured-in-place pipe (CIPP) lining company in the United States. Layne began as the first U.S. licensee of the Inliner technology in 1991 and since that time have acquired the technology company, Inliner Technologies, LLC, and the liner manufacturer, Liner Products, LLC.
Markets[edit]
Water[edit]
Layne identifies and develops new water sources, delivers usable water to communities and facilities around the world, recycles water from oil and gas operations, rehabilitates existing pipelines, and safely returns wastewater to the natural environment. They work to procure a responsible solution for any water challenge.[citation needed] Layne's teams effectively manage water in every phase of its lifecycle.[citation needed]
Mineral[edit]
Layne's service offerings include both exploratory and definitional drilling for major gold, copper and other base metal producers. They conduct primarily above ground drilling activities, including all phases of core drilling, reverse circulation, dual tube, hammer and rotary air-blast methods.
Energy[edit]
Layne works to create solutions that include sourcing, delivery, storage, treatment, recycling and disposal in Upstream Oil and Gas operations. Making safe, environmentally sound and socially responsible decisions that are on time, and on budget with execution along the complete lifecycle of water is one of Layne's priorities.[dubious – discuss]
History[edit]
Layne started in 1882 as a water-well drilling company in South Dakota. Through various acquisitions, proprietary rights ownerships, and expansions, Layne now has over 40 offices and affiliates in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and South America.[1] During its growth, Layne has evolved from a water-well drilling company to global water management, construction and drilling company that provides services to the water, mineral and energy sectors.

In the news[edit]
In 2010, Layne Christensen assisted in the rescue of 33 miners trapped for 69 days as a result of the Copiapó mining accident in Chile.[15]
In 2012, it was announced that certain officers and directors at Layne Christensen Company were under investigation in connection with allegations that certain payments by the company to customs clearing agents in connection with importing equipment into the Democratic Republic of Congo potentially might have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Layne voluntarily alerted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and U.S. Department of Justice of the possible discrepancies.[16] Necessary disciplinary actions were taken toward involved parties.
On Thursday, August 30, 2012, the CEO of Layne Christensen Co., Rene Robichaud rang the opening bell at the Nasdaq Stock Market in honor of the company's 130 anniversary.[17]
Chilean miner rescue[edit]
See also: 2010 Copiapó mining accident
On August 5, 2010, a cave in traps 33 miners underground, and rescue efforts were deployed immediately. Through a joint effort, Layne and their Latine American affiliate, Geotec, the Chilean miners were rescued after 69 days underground.
Large escape boreholes were drilled simultaneously using different equipment provided by multiple international corporations with three different strategies.

Plan A, the Strata 950 (702 meter target depth at 90°),
Plan B, the Schramm T130XD (638 meter target depth at 82°),
Plan C, a RIG-421 drill (597 meter target depth at 85°).[18]

The Layne and Geotec team applied experience from worldwide operations and well over 100 years of drilling experience; Minera Collahuasi and Minera Escondida funded the project and also provided a team of geologists and engineers. On August 15, Geotec uses a Schramm Inc. 685W and two diamond rigs (CS 3001 and CS 4002) for the first drilling stage. Then on August 26, Geotec works to ensure that the 5 1/2-inch 6C pilot hole is drilling to reach the underground workshop. After five days of constant drilling, the third attempt succeeds. As drilling progresses, the T-130XD comes to a halt at 880 feet when the "nose" of the 12-inch hammer bit breaks. It's a setback when the metal piece blocks the well. At this time, Layne drillers flown from Afghanistan and helpers flown from the U.S. arrive. The entire team is now complete and works to clear the hole. Reaming the hole to 12 inches is completed at 2,040 feet, proving the theory of following the 5 1/2-inch hole to the mine workshop and then the hole is reamed to 28 inches to allow for the rescue pod, ''Fénix'' capsules. On October 9, cheers go up as the Plan B drill rig reaches its target - the mine workshop, allowing the rescue to begin. Finally, on October 12, final preparations and test runs are carried out. Rescuers begin pulling miners to safety in the ''Fénix'' capsules.The whole world watched as the miners emerged to safety, culminating a multinational, multi-disciplined team effort involving coordination and cooperation between the teams.
Following the rescue operations Layne and Geotec received official recognition from U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House.[19][20]

Layne provides total water management solutions for government agencies, commercial water suppliers, industrial facilities, and energy companies. Their teams are responsible for effectively managing water in every phase of its lifecycle – supply, treatment, delivery and maintenance.[citation needed] Throughout each phase, Layne works to ensure compliance with complex state and federal regulations, and to meet increasingly high standards for quality, reliability and efficiency.[citation needed]
Construction[edit]
The geotechnical capabilities of Layne allows them to improve soil conditions and support subterranean structures in underground construction projects where effective water management is critical, such as dams and levees, tunnels, water lines, subways, highways and marine facilities.
Drilling[edit]
Layne specialists are able to define the source, depth, magnitude and overall feasibility of water aquifers, and drill high-volume wells suitable for supplying water to government agencies, industrial and agricultural customers. Their mineral exploration teams extract contaminant-free samples that accurately reflect the underlying mineral deposits. Also, Layne is able to drill deep injection wells to facilitate the disposal of treated wastewater.[citation needed]
Divisions[edit]
Water Resources[edit]
Water Resources provides sustainable solutions for every aspect of water supply system development and technology applications for heavy civil construction, hydrology, water treatment systems and services, as well as pipelines and transmission mains.
Mineral Exploration[edit]
Mineral Exploration Division conducts primarily above ground drilling activities, including all phases of core drilling, reverse circulation, dual tube, hammer and rotary air-blast methods. Layne's service offerings include both exploratory and directional drilling for major gold, copper and other base metal producers.
Energy Services[edit]
Energy Services offers water solutions to the Oil & Gas industry concerning sourcing, transfer services, treatment and vibration technology.
Inliner[edit]
Layne Inliner, LLC is the second largest cured-in-place pipe (CIPP) lining company in the United States. Layne began as the first U.S. licensee of the Inliner technology in 1991 and since that time have acquired the technology company, Inliner Technologies, LLC, and the liner manufacturer, Liner Products, LLC.
Markets[edit]
Water[edit]
Layne identifies and develops new water sources, delivers usable water to communities and facilities around the world, recycles water from oil and gas operations, rehabilitates existing pipelines, and safely returns wastewater to the natural environment. They work to procure a responsible solution for any water challenge.[citation needed] Layne's teams effectively manage water in every phase of its lifecycle.[citation needed]
Mineral[edit]
Layne's service offerings include both exploratory and definitional drilling for major gold, copper and other base metal producers. They conduct primarily above ground drilling activities, including all phases of core drilling, reverse circulation, dual tube, hammer and rotary air-blast methods.
Energy[edit]
Layne works to create solutions that include sourcing, delivery, storage, treatment, recycling and disposal in Upstream Oil and Gas operations. Making safe, environmentally sound and socially responsible decisions that are on time, and on budget with execution along the complete lifecycle of water is one of Layne's priorities.[dubious – discuss]
History[edit]
Layne started in 1882 as a water-well drilling company in South Dakota. Through various acquisitions, proprietary rights ownerships, and expansions, Layne now has over 40 offices and affiliates in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and South America.[1] During its growth, Layne has evolved from a water-well drilling company to global water management, construction and drilling company that provides services to the water, mineral and energy sectors.

In the news[edit]
In 2010, Layne Christensen assisted in the rescue of 33 miners trapped for 69 days as a result of the Copiapó mining accident in Chile.[15]
In 2012, it was announced that certain officers and directors at Layne Christensen Company were under investigation in connection with allegations that certain payments by the company to customs clearing agents in connection with importing equipment into the Democratic Republic of Congo potentially might have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Layne voluntarily alerted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and U.S. Department of Justice of the possible discrepancies.[16] Necessary disciplinary actions were taken toward involved parties.
On Thursday, August 30, 2012, the CEO of Layne Christensen Co., Rene Robichaud rang the opening bell at the Nasdaq Stock Market in honor of the company's 130 anniversary.[17]
Chilean miner rescue[edit]
See also: 2010 Copiapó mining accident
On August 5, 2010, a cave in traps 33 miners underground, and rescue efforts were deployed immediately. Through a joint effort, Layne and their Latine American affiliate, Geotec, the Chilean miners were rescued after 69 days underground.
Large escape boreholes were drilled simultaneously using different equipment provided by multiple international corporations with three different strategies.

Plan A, the Strata 950 (702 meter target depth at 90°),
Plan B, the Schramm T130XD (638 meter target depth at 82°),
Plan C, a RIG-421 drill (597 meter target depth at 85°).[18]

The Layne and Geotec team applied experience from worldwide operations and well over 100 years of drilling experience; Minera Collahuasi and Minera Escondida funded the project and also provided a team of geologists and engineers. On August 15, Geotec uses a Schramm Inc. 685W and two diamond rigs (CS 3001 and CS 4002) for the first drilling stage. Then on August 26, Geotec works to ensure that the 5 1/2-inch 6C pilot hole is drilling to reach the underground workshop. After five days of constant drilling, the third attempt succeeds. As drilling progresses, the T-130XD comes to a halt at 880 feet when the "nose" of the 12-inch hammer bit breaks. It's a setback when the metal piece blocks the well. At this time, Layne drillers flown from Afghanistan and helpers flown from the U.S. arrive. The entire team is now complete and works to clear the hole. Reaming the hole to 12 inches is completed at 2,040 feet, proving the theory of following the 5 1/2-inch hole to the mine workshop and then the hole is reamed to 28 inches to allow for the rescue pod, ''Fénix'' capsules. On October 9, cheers go up as the Plan B drill rig reaches its target - the mine workshop, allowing the rescue to begin. Finally, on October 12, final preparations and test runs are carried out. Rescuers begin pulling miners to safety in the ''Fénix'' capsules.The whole world watched as the miners emerged to safety, culminating a multinational, multi-disciplined team effort involving coordination and cooperation between the teams.
Following the rescue operations Layne and Geotec received official recognition from U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House.[19][20]

Layne began as the first U.S. licensee of the Inliner technology in 1991 and since that time have acquired the technology company, Inliner Technologies, LLC, and the liner manufacturer, Liner Products, LLC.
Markets[edit]
Water[edit]
Layne identifies and develops new water sources, delivers usable water to communities and facilities around the world, recycles water from oil and gas operations, rehabilitates existing pipelines, and safely returns wastewater to the natural environment. They work to procure a responsible solution for any water challenge.[citation needed] Layne's teams effectively manage water in every phase of its lifecycle.[citation needed]
Mineral[edit]
Layne's service offerings include both exploratory and definitional drilling for major gold, copper and other base metal producers. They conduct primarily above ground drilling activities, including all phases of core drilling, reverse circulation, dual tube, hammer and rotary air-blast methods.
Energy[edit]
Layne works to create solutions that include sourcing, delivery, storage, treatment, recycling and disposal in Upstream Oil and Gas operations. Making safe, environmentally sound and socially responsible decisions that are on time, and on budget with execution along the complete lifecycle of water is one of Layne's priorities.[dubious – discuss]
History[edit]
Layne started in 1882 as a water-well drilling company in South Dakota. Through various acquisitions, proprietary rights ownerships, and expansions, Layne now has over 40 offices and affiliates in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and South America.[1] During its growth, Layne has evolved from a water-well drilling company to global water management, construction and drilling company that provides services to the water, mineral and energy sectors.

In the news[edit]
In 2010, Layne Christensen assisted in the rescue of 33 miners trapped for 69 days as a result of the Copiapó mining accident in Chile.[15]
In 2012, it was announced that certain officers and directors at Layne Christensen Company were under investigation in connection with allegations that certain payments by the company to customs clearing agents in connection with importing equipment into the Democratic Republic of Congo potentially might have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Layne voluntarily alerted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and U.S. Department of Justice of the possible discrepancies.[16] Necessary disciplinary actions were taken toward involved parties.
On Thursday, August 30, 2012, the CEO of Layne Christensen Co., Rene Robichaud rang the opening bell at the Nasdaq Stock Market in honor of the company's 130 anniversary.[17]
Chilean miner rescue[edit]
See also: 2010 Copiapó mining accident
On August 5, 2010, a cave in traps 33 miners underground, and rescue efforts were deployed immediately. Through a joint effort, Layne and their Latine American affiliate, Geotec, the Chilean miners were rescued after 69 days underground.
Large escape boreholes were drilled simultaneously using different equipment provided by multiple international corporations with three different strategies.

Plan A, the Strata 950 (702 meter target depth at 90°),
Plan B, the Schramm T130XD (638 meter target depth at 82°),
Plan C, a RIG-421 drill (597 meter target depth at 85°).[18]

The Layne and Geotec team applied experience from worldwide operations and well over 100 years of drilling experience; Minera Collahuasi and Minera Escondida funded the project and also provided a team of geologists and engineers. On August 15, Geotec uses a Schramm Inc. 685W and two diamond rigs (CS 3001 and CS 4002) for the first drilling stage. Then on August 26, Geotec works to ensure that the 5 1/2-inch 6C pilot hole is drilling to reach the underground workshop. After five days of constant drilling, the third attempt succeeds. As drilling progresses, the T-130XD comes to a halt at 880 feet when the "nose" of the 12-inch hammer bit breaks. It's a setback when the metal piece blocks the well. At this time, Layne drillers flown from Afghanistan and helpers flown from the U.S. arrive. The entire team is now complete and works to clear the hole. Reaming the hole to 12 inches is completed at 2,040 feet, proving the theory of following the 5 1/2-inch hole to the mine workshop and then the hole is reamed to 28 inches to allow for the rescue pod, ''Fénix'' capsules. On October 9, cheers go up as the Plan B drill rig reaches its target - the mine workshop, allowing the rescue to begin. Finally, on October 12, final preparations and test runs are carried out. Rescuers begin pulling miners to safety in the ''Fénix'' capsules.The whole world watched as the miners emerged to safety, culminating a multinational, multi-disciplined team effort involving coordination and cooperation between the teams.
Following the rescue operations Layne and Geotec received official recognition from U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House.[19][20]

Layne Christensen builds water infrastructure in Delaware

Business opportunities continue to flow out of the Permian Basin’s oil patch.
One company that helps meet the water needs of oil and gas operators drilling in the Delaware Basin is among those that have seized an opportunity.
Houston-based Layne Christensen Co. recently announced a new energy infrastructure business designed to “satisfy the monstrous and growing need for water for oil and gas operations,” said J. Michael Anderson, the company’s chief financial officer.
The new $18 million system should be in operation in August. Situated on approximately 1,000 acres that the company purchased last year near Pecos, the infrastructure will include water wells, pump stations, in-ground storage facilities and a high-capacity water pipeline stretching 20 miles north from Pecos to Orla, Anderson said in a phone interview from his office in The Woodlands. The Layne Christensen project is different from similar projects because the company owns the water and infrastructure, Anderson said.
The system initially will be capable of producing and delivering 100,000 barrels of water per day. The opportunity exists for significant expansion as demand warrants, he said. The expansion could be by Christensen alone, or in partnership with other companies producing water in the region, he said.

“We’re in a nice part of the aquifer, but as you move north, it dries up pretty rapidly,” Anderson said. “(The pipeline) can take water from where it’s plentiful to Orla, where it’s dry and water is difficult to come by.”
The company will have its own storage pits and customers will also have their own storage pits, and the water can be taken that last mile to the drilling site through temporary frac hoses, either by the company or its customer, he said. The pipeline will reduce truck traffic, he said, and added that trucks could not handle the amounts of water needed to hydraulically fracture a Delaware Basin well. If a well required 600,000 barrels of water, he said it would require 6,000 trucks to haul in that water.
Michael J. Caliel, the company’s president and chief executive officer, estimates many fracturing operations require between 500,000 and 700,000 barrels of water per completion, and his company expects water usage within the energy sector to more than double over the next two years.
Anderson stressed that the water the company is providing is non-potable.
“Layne Christensen is focused on sustainability and doing the right thing. We’re not taking water that could be used for drinking.
“Producers are excited to be able to get large quantities of water,” Anderson said.
They also appreciate working with a company that has 135 years of experience providing water infrastructure solutions to municipal, agriculture and industrial sectors, he said.
Layne Christensen, which was established in Kansas City, Kansas, moved to the Houston area in 2013 because the company felt its future growth would come from the energy sector.
“In Houston, we’re just down the street from customers like Anadarko who are active in the Delaware,” Anderson said.
The company has had operations in Midland for six years, he said.
While the initial infrastructure will serve the Delaware, he said the company believes the Midland Basin also will be “a nice place to be” and will be looking for opportunities there.
Looking further down the road, Anderson said the company sees opportunities in offering water treatment services.
“Layne also has a long history in water treatment. This infrastructure is new, but once the water is used in fracturing, it comes back over time in produced water. In the future, we can provide great solutions for treating and reusing that water.”

Layne Christensen builds water infrastructure in Delaware

Business opportunities continue to flow out of the Permian Basin’s oil patch.
One company that helps meet the water needs of oil and gas operators drilling in the Delaware Basin is among those that have seized an opportunity.
Houston-based Layne Christensen Co. recently announced a new energy infrastructure business designed to “satisfy the monstrous and growing need for water for oil and gas operations,” said J. Michael Anderson, the company’s chief financial officer.
The new $18 million system should be in operation in August. Situated on approximately 1,000 acres that the company purchased last year near Pecos, the infrastructure will include water wells, pump stations, in-ground storage facilities and a high-capacity water pipeline stretching 20 miles north from Pecos to Orla, Anderson said in a phone interview from his office in The Woodlands. The Layne Christensen project is different from similar projects because the company owns the water and infrastructure, Anderson said.
The system initially will be capable of producing and delivering 100,000 barrels of water per day. The opportunity exists for significant expansion as demand warrants, he said. The expansion could be by Christensen alone, or in partnership with other companies producing water in the region, he said.

“We’re in a nice part of the aquifer, but as you move north, it dries up pretty rapidly,” Anderson said. “(The pipeline) can take water from where it’s plentiful to Orla, where it’s dry and water is difficult to come by.”
The company will have its own storage pits and customers will also have their own storage pits, and the water can be taken that last mile to the drilling site through temporary frac hoses, either by the company or its customer, he said. The pipeline will reduce truck traffic, he said, and added that trucks could not handle the amounts of water needed to hydraulically fracture a Delaware Basin well. If a well required 600,000 barrels of water, he said it would require 6,000 trucks to haul in that water.
Michael J. Caliel, the company’s president and chief executive officer, estimates many fracturing operations require between 500,000 and 700,000 barrels of water per completion, and his company expects water usage within the energy sector to more than double over the next two years.
Anderson stressed that the water the company is providing is non-potable.
“Layne Christensen is focused on sustainability and doing the right thing. We’re not taking water that could be used for drinking.
“Producers are excited to be able to get large quantities of water,” Anderson said.
They also appreciate working with a company that has 135 years of experience providing water infrastructure solutions to municipal, agriculture and industrial sectors, he said.
Layne Christensen, which was established in Kansas City, Kansas, moved to the Houston area in 2013 because the company felt its future growth would come from the energy sector.
“In Houston, we’re just down the street from customers like Anadarko who are active in the Delaware,” Anderson said.
The company has had operations in Midland for six years, he said.
While the initial infrastructure will serve the Delaware, he said the company believes the Midland Basin also will be “a nice place to be” and will be looking for opportunities there.
Looking further down the road, Anderson said the company sees opportunities in offering water treatment services.
“Layne also has a long history in water treatment. This infrastructure is new, but once the water is used in fracturing, it comes back over time in produced water. In the future, we can provide great solutions for treating and reusing that water.”

Investor Relations




	Layne is a global water management, construction and drilling company, providing responsible solutions for water, mineral and energy challenges. We offer innovative, sustainable products and services with an enduring commitment to safety, excellence and integrity. We operate throughout North America, as well as Africa, Australia, Europe, Brazil, and through our affiliates in other South American countries. Layne's customers include government agencies, investor-owned utilities, industrial companies, global mining companies, consulting engineering firms, heavy civil construction contractors, oil and gas companies, power companies and agribusiness.


        Water Management

Helping to solve the world's water challenges.
Layne provides total water management solutions for government agencies, commercial water suppliers, industrial facilities, and energy companies.
Our teams are responsible for effectively managing water in every phase of its lifecycle â€“ supply, treatment, delivery and maintenance. Throughout each phase, we work to ensure compliance with complex state and federal regulations, and to meet increasingly high standards for quality, reliability and efficiency.
We engage in the development and deployment of new and innovative water technologies to make these standards possible, and to continue improving on the safety and sustainability of our work.
Whether we're identifying and developing a new water source, delivering usable water to communities and facilities around the world, recycling water from oil and gas resources, rehabilitating an existing pipeline, or safely returning wastewater to the natural environment, Layne has a responsible solution for any water management challenge.

        Construction

Well designed. Well constructed. Well done.
Layne provides specialized construction solutions for the responsible management of water in just about any industry or environment.
With extensive heavy civil expertise and a proven reputation for safety, we design and construct comprehensive, end-to-end water management systems, as well as individual intakes, reservoirs, pump stations, pipelines and plants tailored to our clients' needs.
Our broad national footprint and well-maintained equipment fleet enables flexible scheduling and efficient delivery of both underground preparations and finished infrastructure construction. If a project involves water and/or soil conditions, Layne designs, constructs and delivers the optimal solutions.

        Drilling

Layne provides comprehensive turnkey drilling solutions for mineral exploration, water management and specialty drilling needs.
We employ a team of specialists to help us understand specific site characteristics and proactively overcome and plan for any challenges.
Our experts are able to define the source, depth, magnitude and overall feasibility of water aquifers, and drill high-volume wells suitable for supplying water to government agencies, industrial and agricultural customers.
Our mineral exploration teams extract contaminant-free samples that accurately reflect the underlying mineral deposits. We also drill deep injection wells to facilitate the disposal of treated wastewater. For any drilling need, we make safe, environmentally sound and socially responsible decisions at all times, and achieve the desired results for each and every project.
