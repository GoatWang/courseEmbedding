Doctors Recommend Perserving Newborn Stem Cells With CBR
Watch to find out what some doctors think about newborn stem cell preservation and why they recommend CBR.







Your Baby's Stem Cells Are:








SPECIAL
Newborn stem cells are different from adult stem cells like those found in bone marrow. CBR® preserves newborn stem cells when they're at their peak, so their unique advantages may be used in the future.37,45,88








SMART

Stem cells “know” how to find injured cells and tissue in the body and initiate a healing process.80








POWERFUL

Today, cord blood stem cells have been used in more than 35,000 transplants worldwide to regenerate healthy blood and immune systems, like in a bone marrow transplant.89






        

  Call 1.888.932.1388 to learn more








Ultimate use of newborn stem cells will be determined by the treating physician who will consider if they are applicable for the condition and should come from the patient or a suitable donor (siblings of the same biological parents have a 25% chance of being a perfect match and a 50% chance of being a partial match; biological parents will always be a partial match). There is no guarantee that treatments being studied in the laboratory, clinical trials, or other experimental treatments (including regenerative medicine applications) will be available in the future.

Doctors Recommend Cord Blood Banking






The use of umbilical cord blood stem cells has increased significantly in the past 20 years.38 Today, doctors all over the world are realizing the power of newborn stem cells and recommending family banking to their patients. 
			

When faced with the illness of a child or loved one, families want hope and doctors want options. Banking newborn stem cells provides both.
Doctors recommend banking for a variety of reasons. Umbilical cord blood is used today to treat many life-threatening diseases including leukemia, certain other cancers and blood, immune and metabolic disorders. And using your own family’s cord blood can have significant advantages in treatments, including fewer complications and improved medical outcomes.28,29


What Doctors Say About Banking Newborn Stem Cells

Potentially Lifesaving Purchase
"There's only two things that (you can) potentially buy your new baby that are lifesaving: One is a good car seat and the other is cord blood." 

~ Dr. Marra Francis, Ob/Gyn, CBR medical consultant
More Uses Than We Know
"Just like we didn't envision the powers of PCs thirty years ago, we may not be seeing all the uses of cord blood yet." 
~ Dr. LeeAnn Jensen, Immunologist National Institutes of Health
Potential to Heal the Body in New Ways
"A really exciting area that's just now in the basic science lab, is the area where stem cells...can be used for going over to muscle cells like your heart muscle if you had a heart attack...or brain cells if you had Parkinson's Disease...Hopefully, in 20 or 30 or 40 years...these might be potential applications for stem cells including umbilical cord blood stem cells."

~ Dr. Stanton Goldman, Pediatric Hematologist Oncologist and stem cell transplant Physician, Medical City, Dallas, Texas
A Chance of Nervous System Repair
"Through cultivation of stem cells extracted from the cord blood, patients with spinal injuries have a great chance of having their damaged nervous system repaired, helping them to rise on their feet again."

~ Dr. Chiang Yung-hsiao, Ph.D., Chairman of Neurosurgery, Tri-Service General Hospital, Tapei, Taiwan
Might Be Useful For Brain and Spinal Cord Injuries
"[Cord blood stem cells] might be suitable for transplantation in neurodegenerative diseases, gene delivery to the central nervous system, and repair of brain and spinal cord injuries."

~ Juan R. Sanchez-Ramos, Shijie Song, Siddharth G. Kamath, et al. Experimental Neurology, 171, 2001
Significant for Ethnic Minorities and Families with History of Cancer
"The ultimate goal is for all usable umbilical cord blood to be banked in a national cord blood [bank] similar to the National Bone Marrow Donor Program or saved for an individual's or family's own potential use. The latter may prove especially significant for those with a family history of leukemia or cancer or for minority ethnic patients." 

~ Nursing Spectrum, February 24, 1997
A Better Chance for a Healthy Recovery
"Recipients of cord-blood transplants from HLA-identical siblings have a lower incidence rate of acute and chronic GVHD than recipients of bone marrow transplants from HLA-identical siblings." 
~ Drs. Vanderson Rocha, John E. Wagner, Jr., Eliane Gluckman, et. al. New England Journal of Medicine, June 22, 2000

Tiny cells.

Hugepotential.











Where do newborn stem cells come from?
Your baby's umbilical cord is made up of tissue and contains blood. Both cord blood and cord tissue are rich sources of powerful stem cells. Cord blood stem cells are currently used in transplant medicine to regenerate healthy blood and immune systems. Cord blood banking preserves these cells for potential treatment of 80 known diseases and disorders1, and perhaps more as research continues into these cells’ ability to act like a body’s personal repair kit.
Watch our videos:





Cord Blood 101






What's Up With Preserving Cord Tissue?







Discover the awesome powers of newborn stem cells.



Smart
They "know" how to find injured cells in the body and start a healing process.2 In other words, they may help the body help itself.80



Powerful
Today, cord blood stem cells have been used in more than 35,000 transplants worldwide to regenerate healthy blood and immune systems, like in a bone marrow transplant. 2* Find out which conditions have been treated here. 







A perfect match.
Your baby’s cord blood stem cells will always be a perfect match for him or her, but they aren’t the only one who may benefit from cord blood banking. Newborn stem cell preservation can potentially benefit siblings and parents, too. In many cord blood treatments, stem cells from a matched family member are preferred. Siblings of the same biological parents have a 25% chance of being a perfect match, and a 50% chance of being a partial match; biological parents will always be a partial match.

Doctors Recommend Perserving Newborn Stem Cells With CBR
Watch to find out what some doctors think about newborn stem cell preservation and why they recommend CBR.







Your Baby's Stem Cells Are:








SPECIAL
Newborn stem cells are different from adult stem cells like those found in bone marrow. CBR® preserves newborn stem cells when they're at their peak, so their unique advantages may be used in the future.37,45,88








SMART

Stem cells “know” how to find injured cells and tissue in the body and initiate a healing process.80








POWERFUL

Today, cord blood stem cells have been used in more than 35,000 transplants worldwide to regenerate healthy blood and immune systems, like in a bone marrow transplant.89






        

  Call 1.888.932.1388 to learn more








Ultimate use of newborn stem cells will be determined by the treating physician who will consider if they are applicable for the condition and should come from the patient or a suitable donor (siblings of the same biological parents have a 25% chance of being a perfect match and a 50% chance of being a partial match; biological parents will always be a partial match). There is no guarantee that treatments being studied in the laboratory, clinical trials, or other experimental treatments (including regenerative medicine applications) will be available in the future.

Health Umbilical Cord Blood Banking Market Global Industry Forecast - 2025






Transparency Market Research Report Added "Umbilical Cord Blood Banking Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, & Forecast 2017 - 2025"
 


PR-Inside.com: 2017-07-21 09:07:44
Global Umbilical Cord Blood Banking Market: Snapshot

Umbilical cord blood banking or cord blood banking is the practice of preserving blood from the umbilical cord for future use. Such preserved cord blood is used in medical therapies in the similar approach as that of stem cells derived from bone marrow. Umbilical cord blood banking is practiced for using the cord blood stem cells for the purpose or re-populating blood and treating various medical conditions. Umbilical cord blood is observed to be a potential source of progenitor cells, which can be used for reconstitution of tissue, organs and other functional areas.







The first successful umbilical cord blood transplantation was performed in 1988 and since then thousands of unrelated donor cord blood transplants have taken place worldwide. Cord blood transplantation is being recommended for a variety of diseases which include conditions such as sarcoma, leukemia, immune conditions, lymphoma, and even metabolic disorders. The first ever cord blood bank was established in 1991 and in the same decade several private and public cord blood banks began to be established worldwide.

Transparency Market Research projects that the global umbilical cord blood banking market, which was pegged at US$3,124.4 mn in 2016, will expand at an 11.4% CAGR from 2017 to 2025, rising to a valuation of US$8,178.1 mn in 2025.

Private Cord Blood Banks to Remain First Choice of Donors

Based on type of storage, private cord blood banks accounted for approximately 65.0% of the global market in 2016. Private cord blood banks offer cord blood storage for personal use of the donor’s family with charges for storage. The average cost for processing, testing, and storage of cord blood units in private banks is around US$1,500 and an additional US$150 per year for storage continuation.

Despite such high costs, the segment of private cord blood banks is expected to remain the first choice of parents to store cord blood. Exhibiting a CAGR of 12.5% from 2017 to 2025, the segment is expected to witness a notable rise in its share in the global market by the end of the forecast period. Several factors, such as complete ownership rights preserved by the donor, flexible collection sites, and assured and secured access one’s cells give private cord blood banks significant leverage over public cord blood banks, resulting in the high preference to the former despite high costs.

North America to Remain Dominant Regional Market

Geographically, the North America market for umbilical cord blood banking leads the global market, commanding more than 38.2% share in the global market in 2016. The North America market is expected to continue its strong growth in the next few years as well, chiefly owing to the rising demand for umbilical cord blood in stem cell research. Demand for cord blood banking in North America is high in the U.S., which held 83.8% market share in 2016, followed by Canada. Higher market share of the U.S. is attributed to the presence of highly established research and development infrastructure and rising investments by pharmaceutical giants in stem cell research.

Asia Pacific is expected to dominate in terms of growth rate in the global umbilical cord blood banking market over the report’s forecast period. Although the region currently holds a nominal share in the global market, it exhibits enormous growth potential owing to vast improvement in health care reforms and increasing awareness of stem cell banking in select countries of Asia Pacific, such as India, Malaysia China, and Indonesia. Also, Asia Pacific is a relatively untapped regional market compared to developed regions, which is why it presents better opportunity for growth for companies.

Some of the leading players operating in the global umbilical cord blood banking market are CBR Systems, Inc., ViaCord Inc., China Cord Blood Corporation, Cord Blood America, Inc., Cryo-Cell International, Inc., Cryo-Save AG, Cordlife Group Ltd., Vita 34 AG, LifeCell, and StemCyte Inc.

Doctors Recommend Perserving Newborn Stem Cells With CBR
Watch to find out what some doctors think about newborn stem cell preservation and why they recommend CBR.







Your Baby's Stem Cells Are:








SPECIAL
Newborn stem cells are different from adult stem cells like those found in bone marrow. CBR® preserves newborn stem cells when they're at their peak, so their unique advantages may be used in the future.37,45,88








SMART

Stem cells “know” how to find injured cells and tissue in the body and initiate a healing process.80








POWERFUL

Today, cord blood stem cells have been used in more than 35,000 transplants worldwide to regenerate healthy blood and immune systems, like in a bone marrow transplant.89






        

  Call 1.888.932.1388 to learn more








Ultimate use of newborn stem cells will be determined by the treating physician who will consider if they are applicable for the condition and should come from the patient or a suitable donor (siblings of the same biological parents have a 25% chance of being a perfect match and a 50% chance of being a partial match; biological parents will always be a partial match). There is no guarantee that treatments being studied in the laboratory, clinical trials, or other experimental treatments (including regenerative medicine applications) will be available in the future.

Doctors Recommend Cord Blood Banking






The use of umbilical cord blood stem cells has increased significantly in the past 20 years.38 Today, doctors all over the world are realizing the power of newborn stem cells and recommending family banking to their patients. 
			

When faced with the illness of a child or loved one, families want hope and doctors want options. Banking newborn stem cells provides both.
Doctors recommend banking for a variety of reasons. Umbilical cord blood is used today to treat many life-threatening diseases including leukemia, certain other cancers and blood, immune and metabolic disorders. And using your own family’s cord blood can have significant advantages in treatments, including fewer complications and improved medical outcomes.28,29


What Doctors Say About Banking Newborn Stem Cells

Potentially Lifesaving Purchase
"There's only two things that (you can) potentially buy your new baby that are lifesaving: One is a good car seat and the other is cord blood." 

~ Dr. Marra Francis, Ob/Gyn, CBR medical consultant
More Uses Than We Know
"Just like we didn't envision the powers of PCs thirty years ago, we may not be seeing all the uses of cord blood yet." 
~ Dr. LeeAnn Jensen, Immunologist National Institutes of Health
Potential to Heal the Body in New Ways
"A really exciting area that's just now in the basic science lab, is the area where stem cells...can be used for going over to muscle cells like your heart muscle if you had a heart attack...or brain cells if you had Parkinson's Disease...Hopefully, in 20 or 30 or 40 years...these might be potential applications for stem cells including umbilical cord blood stem cells."

~ Dr. Stanton Goldman, Pediatric Hematologist Oncologist and stem cell transplant Physician, Medical City, Dallas, Texas
A Chance of Nervous System Repair
"Through cultivation of stem cells extracted from the cord blood, patients with spinal injuries have a great chance of having their damaged nervous system repaired, helping them to rise on their feet again."

~ Dr. Chiang Yung-hsiao, Ph.D., Chairman of Neurosurgery, Tri-Service General Hospital, Tapei, Taiwan
Might Be Useful For Brain and Spinal Cord Injuries
"[Cord blood stem cells] might be suitable for transplantation in neurodegenerative diseases, gene delivery to the central nervous system, and repair of brain and spinal cord injuries."

~ Juan R. Sanchez-Ramos, Shijie Song, Siddharth G. Kamath, et al. Experimental Neurology, 171, 2001
Significant for Ethnic Minorities and Families with History of Cancer
"The ultimate goal is for all usable umbilical cord blood to be banked in a national cord blood [bank] similar to the National Bone Marrow Donor Program or saved for an individual's or family's own potential use. The latter may prove especially significant for those with a family history of leukemia or cancer or for minority ethnic patients." 

~ Nursing Spectrum, February 24, 1997
A Better Chance for a Healthy Recovery
"Recipients of cord-blood transplants from HLA-identical siblings have a lower incidence rate of acute and chronic GVHD than recipients of bone marrow transplants from HLA-identical siblings." 
~ Drs. Vanderson Rocha, John E. Wagner, Jr., Eliane Gluckman, et. al. New England Journal of Medicine, June 22, 2000

Where do newborn stem cells come from?
Your baby's umbilical cord is made up of tissue and contains blood. Both cord blood and cord tissue are rich sources of powerful stem cells. Cord blood stem cells are currently used in transplant medicine to regenerate healthy blood and immune systems. Cord blood banking preserves these cells for potential treatment of 80 known diseases and disorders1, and perhaps more as research continues into these cells’ ability to act like a body’s personal repair kit.

What's Up With Preserving Cord Tissue?







Discover the awesome powers of newborn stem cells.



Smart
They "know" how to find injured cells in the body and start a healing process.2 In other words, they may help the body help itself.80



Powerful
Today, cord blood stem cells have been used in more than 35,000 transplants worldwide to regenerate healthy blood and immune systems, like in a bone marrow transplant. 2* Find out which conditions have been treated here. 







A perfect match.
Your baby’s cord blood stem cells will always be a perfect match for him or her, but they aren’t the only one who may benefit from cord blood banking. Newborn stem cell preservation can potentially benefit siblings and parents, too. In many cord blood treatments, stem cells from a matched family member are preferred. Siblings of the same biological parents have a 25% chance of being a perfect match, and a 50% chance of being a partial match; biological parents will always be a partial match.

Ultimate use of newborn stem cells will be determined by the treating physician who will consider if they are applicable for the condition and should come from the patient or a suitable donor (siblings of the same biological parents have a 25% chance of being a perfect match and a 50% chance of being a partial match; biological parents will always be a partial match). There is no guarantee that treatments being studied in the laboratory, clinical trials, or other experimental treatments (including regenerative medicine applications) will be available in the future.

MAZE CORD BLOOD





The Maze Cord Blood Story
When Michael A. Werner, MD, went into private practice over 20 years ago, cord blood science was in its infancy. Yet it’s his original and steadfast commitment to children, family and advancing science that’s brought Maze to the forefront of cord blood banking.







ESTABLISHED, SECURE, PERSONALLY COMMITTED

Few decisions in life are as important — or as personal — as those you will make about having a child or keeping it healthy in the years ahead. So we’d like to share some personal reflections by Maze Cord Blood’s founder, Dr. Michael Werner.
“My older brother, Howie, died at the age of 2 from a rare blood disorder- a disease that we might have been able to treat with the stem cells from cord blood today. Howie’s death impacted my entire family immeasurably. It is one of the main reasons I chose to pursue medicine. And it certainly taught me to care personally about family — not just my family, but all families.
“We don’t always know why we choose a path. But, looking back, I can see that my decision to specialize in fertility and sexual health (at a time when few doctors did) was an expression of my love for family. And when you love something deeply, you pour your soul into it. So when I opened my practice in 1994, it had a state-of-the-art laboratory in house. Because I would want that level of care for my family.
“I also started a cryobank for sperm, offering patients with uncertain future sperm production options to have children someday. So, when cord-blood banking matured as a science, it was a logical extension of the services I already provided to families. Umbilical cord blood doesn’t just nourish a baby in utero, it can protect that child after birth, too.
“Given the enormous potential of cord blood and cord tissue, my path was clear. In 2004, I decided to make the highest quality cord-blood banking affordable to as many parents as possible. As a scientist and as a proud parent of four sons (Matt, Adam, Zack & Evan), it just feels right. I welcome your questions, your comments and hopefully, your decision to become part of the Maze family.”

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
