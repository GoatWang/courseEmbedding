Strategy | ABT Holdings




















































































 






























Strategy
As a Company, we bring strong financial and operational skill sets, a measured disciplined approach which is combined with creative investing in businesses and products that will allow us a long and successful track record of creating shareholder value.Our Investment Philosophy
Our company's senior management team has deep experience in investing in information technology businesses, including real time mobile claim management system, financial information technology, software development, enterprise and application software; and other traditional businesses where we unlock target company valuation through technology and creative destruction.
Our target portfolio companies are designed to be market leaders by providing critical products and services in respective sectors that enable them to re-imagine their current revenue model, improve customer service, and streamline decision making process.Focus Areas


Mobile App Sector
Mobile tech is our strength and main focus as it has become the leading digital platform, with total activity on smartphones and tablets accounting for 60 percent of digital media time spent in the U.S. The fuel driving mobile’s relentless growth is primarily app usage, which alone makes up a majority of total digital media engagement at 52 percent.46 percent of app users report having paid for their apps, consequently, by 2017, its expected that over 268 billion downloads will generate $77 billion worth of revenue.
                                                                        With more than 10 vehicle accidents every minute and over 90% of the accident victims using a smartphone, our recent acquisition in this space through the AutoClaim App gives us tremendous growth opportunity in this untapped vertical as we expect to enjoy the first-mover advantage in the Mobile Claims Management business.



FinTech Industry
IN TECH or Financial Informtion Technology is an extremely important area where we are seeing an era of rapid technological change, we have the capacity, knowledge and expertise to offer a range of services to help financial services firms improve business performance, reduce operational risk and develop compelling value propositions for their customers. Our main target clients include leading banks, insurers, asset managers and payments players in all major markets.

We are focusing with financial institutions on IT effectiveness and strategy; mobile documentation and management systems, front-end - platforms for direct market access, improving back-office performance; smart-sourcing; risk management; and sales and marketing effectiveness. Our unique value proposition is concentrated on providing solutions that create business value, both at strategic and operational level.


Hyper-Efficient Logistics
HYPER-EFFICIENT LOGISTICS industry is growing rapidly with increase in on-demand economy and changing consumer habits. With the dawn of mobile apps and other Internet-enabled platforms, ABT's subsidiary, Scoobeez, has entered in the initial frontiers of On-Demand Hyper-Efficient Logistics. As we have witnessed recently, several major online retailers have successfully completed same day delivery pilot programs in major cities. We are strongly positioned to benefit from this trend by becoming a premier delivery service provider for several major retailers.ABT specializes in the "On-Demand Logistics System and operations” space, where all types of retailers are seeking immediate customized door-to-door capabilities in hopes of winning loyalty from online shoppers. We merge retailers’ online and store operations with our creative delivery system to complete the full cycle of e-commerce.


Traditional Sectors
TRADITIONAL SECTORS such as logistics, mining and others can have a paradigm shift where software, information technology and other innovation can differentiate or disrupt their current business model. We have the capacity and expertise to be the Chief of Software Development for such traditional sectors seeking to improve their operational efficiencies and increasing their market share. We understand that in these traditional sectors, which are primarily driven by hardware, it is difficult to attract the talent needed for cutting-edge software R&D teams. This is where we fill the gap for our clients.  Industries from manufacturing to consumer goods have used software and information technology into their traditional product offerings and have created a way in redefining the category and raising the bar for competitors.

Why Abbott Laboratories (ABT), GNC Holdings Inc (GNC) and Symantec Corporation (SYMC) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks

    InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading
    Tips

The bulls held on as long as they could after this
  morning's lackluster gross domestic product report for the
  first quarter of the year. But the longer the news had to fester,
  the longer traders had to decide there's simply more risk than
  reward in owning stocks today. The
  S&P 500 

  ended the session at 2075.81, down 0.92%.





  Leading the charge lower were
  Abbott Laboratories

  (NYSE:
  
ABT


  ),
  GNC Holdings Inc

  (NYSE:
  
GNC


  ) and 
  Symantec Corporation

  (NASDAQ:
  
SYMC


  ).
Here's a closer look at each one's demise.
Abbott Laboratories (ABT)
At another time and in a different situation, an acquisition
  may have been a big hit with investors. With a great deal of
  uncertainty on the horizon, however, Abbott Laboratories
  shareholders were more concerned than thrilled with the company's
  decision to
  acquire cardiovascular medical technology name
  Saint Jude Medical

  .
The premise and logic of the deal mustered a few supporters.
  Mostly though, professionals and amateurs alike don't see a ton
  of upside given the $19.3 billion price tag on the union.


5 Stocks to Sell for May



BMO Capital Markets analyst Joanne Wuensch
  asked

   the following: "St. Jude is in more mature cardiac rhythm
  management markets, so does this really become additive to the
  overall Abbott revenue growth rate?" Meanwhile, Morningstar's
  Debbie Wang worried, "Once they make those purchases, it does not
  seem like management is very good at producing meaningful
  innovation."
The near-8% loss ABT shares logged today says the majority of
  shareholders have the same concerns.
GNC Holdings Inc (GNC)
GNC Holdings shares lost a whopping 29% today following
  the company's Q1 earnings report and news that it was aiming to
  close more than 80 company-owned stores.
In its first fiscal quarter of 2016, nutritional supplement
  company GNC Holdings
  reported a profit of 69 cents per share

  on revenue of $668.9 million. The pros, however, were calling for
  a bottom line of 75 cents per share and a top line of $671.5
  million.
The real red flag that did most of the damage on Thursday,
  however, was the announcement that GNC intended to sell 84 of its
  company-owned units
  as a prelude to the sale of around 1,000 GNC
  stores

  . That much interest in discarding company-owned stores is an
  indirect hint that the organization lacks confidence in its
  plausible future.
Symantec Corporation (SYMC)
Last but not least, cybersecurity outfit Symantec dished out a
  double-sized dose of bad news to SYMC shareholders on Thursday,
  reporting a disappointing fourth-quarter forecast, and
  underscoring that bad news by announcing its CEO was stepping
  down.


3 Shiny Dividend Stocks With Horrid
      Fundamentals


Per this morning's news release, Symantec Corporation now
  believes it's
  going to earn 22 cents per share on $873 million
  in revenue for the quarter ending in March

  . The top-line outlook fell short of previous guidance of $885
  million to $915 million, while the bottom-line ended up short of
  the previously forecasted per-share earnings of 24 to 27 cents
  per share.
On average, analysts had been calling for a profit of 25 cents
  per share on sales of $901.2 million.
To what extent the tepid numbers were the reason isn't clear,
  but along with the revised forecast, Chief Executive Officer
  Michael Brown announced he would be
  stepping down from his post

  as soon as a replacement is found.
SYMC ended the day down 7%.



As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position
    in any of the aforementioned securities.
