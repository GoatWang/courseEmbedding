Operations[edit]
The company is the largest private-owned marine-fuel provider in Northern China with about 25% market share of Bohai Bay.[5] The marine fuel production and sales market in China is relatively fragmented and limited.

History[edit]
The company was incorporated in July 2009 and one month later it acquired Goodwill Rich, a company in HongKong, as its wholly owned subsidiary. In March of the same year, Goodwill created a subsidiary named Fusheng Consulting Company in Dalian.[8]
Xing Yuan, another subsidiary of the company, was founded in September 2001. In March, 2009, the committee of the company reached an agreement that Goodwill Rich was entitled to the operations and benefits of Xing Yuan and its subsidiaries.[8]

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

     		  (NASDAQ:AMCF)    Andatee China Marine Fuel Services Corporation, through its subsidiaries, engages in production, storage, distribution, and trading of blended marine fuel oil for cargo and fishing vessels in the People's Republic of China. The company also produces blended marine fuel according to customer specifications. Its blend of marine diesel oil is used as substitute for the traditional diesel oil. The company sells its products to retail customers through distributors primarily in Liaoning, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces, as well as in Tianjin City. Andatee China Marine Fuel Services Corporation is based in Shanghai, the People's Republic of China.    	Website: http://www.ir-site.com/andatee/index.asp  	==========================================================================================================================================================================================  AMCF's subsidiary is a joint venture with CNPC, the largest petroleum company in China.  Andatee China Marine Fuel Services Corporation ("Andatee" or the "Company") through its operating subsidiary Dalian Xing Yuan Marine Bunker Co. Ltd. (Xing Yuan) is engaged in the production, storage, distribution and wholesale purchases and sales of blended marine fuel oil for cargo and fishing vessels.  Xing Yuan was founded in 2001 by Mr. An Fengbin as a joint venture with CNPC Corp's Dalian subsidiary (China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation), the largest petroleum company in China. Andatee is in the process of relocating its headquarters from Dalian, Liaoning province, to Shanghai, which is more central to the Company’s operations expanding throughout China. The Company will maintain its presence in the city of Dalian and employs 142 people across its operations in Shanghai and in the Guangdong, Liaoning, Shandong, Tianjin, and Zhejiang provinces in the PRC.  	China’s marine fuel market is expected to more than double between 2008 and 2013. The national market for small and medium vessels is highly fragmented and largely served by small fuel trading companies. This market is characterized by limited competition as well as uneven product quality and service. Andatee's "Xing Yuan" brand is well recognized for its superior product quality and competitive pricing compared to other marine fuels in the underserved small & medium fishing and cargo vessels market. The Company's internal innovation capabilities and stringent quality control allows the Company to enter new provinces very quickly. Andatee has been actively building and acquiring proprietary sites and distribution infrastructure to become the leader in the industry.  	The Company’s strategy of vertical integration has allowed Andatee to become the largest privately owned company engaging in marine fuel production and distribution in Northern China. Andatee’s goal is to become a “one-stop-shop” for marine port services by providing petroleum products, maintenance, payment services, and marine supplies for boat operators. The corporation believes that their “Andatee Marine Service Depot” for vessels will increase their customer base as they enter the value-added port services industry.   http://www.ir-site.com/andatee/overview.asp  CNPC~~ China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation, the largest petroleum company in China.  http://www.cnpc.com.cn/en/aboutcnpc/  Warren Buffet made $3.5 billion profit from CNPC stock   Buffett revealed he made US$3.5 billion from CNPC stocks and was looking to find a new company with similar circumstances.   http://www.china.org.cn/business/2012-05/07/content_25322077.htm  	=========================================================================================================================================================================================== 	   	    AMCF, Third Quarter 2013 Highlights: PROFIT INCREASED 6900%  Revenue in the third quarter of 2013 was $61.5 million, a 95% increase from the second quarter of 2012 Gross profit increased around 6900% year over year to $4.9 million as compared to $0.07 million in the same period of 2012, while gross profit margin during the quarter improved 780 base points year over year to 8% from 0.2% 	Operating income in the third quarter of 2013 was approximately $1.0 million, a 159% increase from the corresponding period in 2012 	The Company ended the quarter with cash balance of approximately $11.3 million and restricted cash of $69.3 million.  http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2013/11/14/590099/10058051/en/Andatee-China-Marine-Fuel-Services-Reports-Third-Quarter-Financial-Results.html  The Company has 9,860,159 shares of common stock outstanding.  http://google.brand.edgar-online.com/DisplayFiling.aspx?TabIndex=2&FilingID=9613744&companyid=810870&ppu=%252fdefault.aspx%253fsym%253dAMCF  	================================================================== LAST 4 YEARS SHARE STRUCTURE ALMOST THE SAME BETWEEN 9.52 AND 9.86 MILLION  	==================================================================  Insiders hold 50.2% of shares  Executive Officers and Directors  	An Fengbin 4,890,451 49.6% 	Wang Hao 0 * 	Wen Jiang (4) 30,750 * 	Yudong Hou (4) 27,000 * 	Zhenyu Wu 0 * 	All directors and executive officers as a group (4 people) 4,948,201 50.2%   	5% or more Shareholders Star Blessing Enterprises Ltd.

Operations[edit]
The company is the largest private-owned marine-fuel provider in Northern China with about 25% market share of Bohai Bay.[5] The marine fuel production and sales market in China is relatively fragmented and limited. The company is one of the companies that provides blended marine fuel products to ships and vessels in China and has a relatively influential brand in the customer market.[6] On January 7, 2014, the company announced a series of executive management changes including a new CEO(Wang Hao) was appointed.[7]
History[edit]
The company was incorporated in July 2009 and one month later it acquired Goodwill Rich, a company in HongKong, as its wholly owned subsidiary. In March of the same year, Goodwill created a subsidiary named Fusheng Consulting Company in Dalian.[8]
Xing Yuan, another subsidiary of the company, was founded in September 2001. In March, 2009, the committee of the company reached an agreement that Goodwill Rich was entitled to the operations and benefits of Xing Yuan and its subsidiaries.[8]
The company completed initial public offering on NASDAQ in Jan. 2010.[9]
