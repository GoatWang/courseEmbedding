both in investment analysis and
management of our business.









Discipline

We invest with discipline to
increase potential return and
protect capital.









Partnership

We align our interests with those
of our clients through significant
personal investment in our strategies.














Our Mission
At Diamond Hill, we serve our clients by providing investment strategies that deliver lasting value through a shared commitment to our intrinsic value-based investment philosophy, long-term perspective, disciplined approach and alignment with our clients’ interests.

About Us 





Home > About Us

Founded in 2000, we are an independent investment management firm headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. We provide investment management services to institutions and individuals through mutual funds, separate accounts, exchange traded funds, and private investment funds.
We place our fiduciary duty to our clients at the top of our corporate objectives, and we invest the capital you entrust to us with the same care that we invest our own capital. All of our portfolio managers are significant investors in the same portfolios in which our clients invest, and Diamond Hill employees and affiliates are collectively one of the largest investors in our strategies, ensuring that our interests are aligned with those of our clients.
We have not only grown assets under management in strong markets but have also retained a loyal client base through challenging economic periods. We are committed to achieving excellent long-term results and providing outstanding client service to existing and new clients.
