Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/25/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

A U.S. watchdog group filed a lawsuit in a federal court on Tuesday to force the Environmental Protection Agency to release communications with billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who it says tried to influence biofuels policy for personal gain.

















                                                    Democratic lawmakers raise pressure on EPA over Icahn's biofuels role
                                                


                                                    Reuters –

U.S. Democratic lawmakers asked Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt on Wednesday to disclose procedures to prevent billionaire Carl Icahn from influencing U.S. biofuels policy for ...

















                                                    U.S. senators press EPA for documents on Icahn's biofuel dealings

                                                    5:09 PM ET 06/06/2017
                                                


Five Democratic senators asked the Environmental Protection Agency in a letter on Tuesday to hand over documents relating to the role of Carl Icahn, a refining company owner, in shaping biofuels policy at the agency. Lawmakers have for months raised concerns that Icahn's dual role as a high-powered investor and an adviser to President Donald Trump on regulation could lead to conflicts of interest.

On Monday, shares in Sugar Land, Texas headquartered CVR Energy Inc. (CVI) recorded a trading volume of 450,372 shares. http://dailystocktracker.com/registration/?symbol=CVI.

















                                                    U.S. CFTC says it is not probing Icahn's activity in biofuels credits
                                                


                                                    Reuters – 
                                                    5:08 PM ET 06/05/2017
                                                


The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission informed eight Democratic U.S. senators last month that it is not investigating biofuels credits after the lawmakers had urged it to probe billionaire Carl Icahn's activity in that market, according to a copy of a letter seen by Reuters on Monday.

















                                                    U.S. Democratic senators seek probe into Icahn’s biofuel credit dealings
                                                


                                                    Reuters – 
                                                    5:11 PM ET 05/09/2017
                                                


Eight Democratic senators asked U.S. regulators on Tuesday to launch an investigation into billionaire Carl Icahns activities in the U.S. biofuels blending credit market, saying the activist investor may have violated trading laws since becoming an adviser to President Donald Trump.

















                                                    Big short position on biofuels generated profit for Icahn's refiner
                                                


                                                    Reuters – 
                                                    6:36 PM ET 05/01/2017
                                                


Carl Icahn's big bet on falling prices for biofuels credits generated a rare profit in that area last quarter for the billionaire investor's refining company CVR Energy (CVI), according to public filings.

You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.
