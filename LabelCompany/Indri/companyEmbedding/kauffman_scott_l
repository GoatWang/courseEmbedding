Early life and education[edit]
He was born in Princeton, New Jersey to Ellwood and Shirley Kauffman, and grew up with his sister Jane, and brothers Geoffrey and Matthew.
Kauffman holds an A.B. in English from Vassar College and an MBA in marketing from New York University's Stern School of Business.
In 1973, he appeared briefly in Steven E. de Souza's first film, Arnold's Wrecking Co.[3]
Career[edit]
Throughout his career, Kauffman has worked for a variety of media companies including Benton & Bowles, Newsweek, and Time Warner in the founding of Entertainment Weekly.[3]
His next job was as a vice-president of CompuServe, where he worked on all of the online brands and pioneered SpryNet, CompuServe's ISP service.[4][5] With help from Goldman Sachs, Kauffman participated in the development of one of the first IPOs of the Internet industry.[6] He left CompuServe in 1997 to become president and CEO of ClickOver, a company focused on developing management solutions for Internet advertising.[7][8] ClickOver later became Adknowledge after acquiring Focalink.[citation needed] Before leaving AdKnowledge and the company was sold to CMGI, AdKnowledge grew to over 80 employees with more than 100 customers.[9]
Kauffman then spent time with eCoverage, a direct-to-consumer online insurance company; Coremetrics, which was acquired by IBM in 2010; and MusicNow, an online music service partnered with FullAudio that was later sold to Circuit City.[6]
In 2005, he became CEO of the San Francisco-based digital-magazine service provider Zinio.[10][11]
In 2006, Scott was named President and Chief Operating Officer of BlueLithium.[10] On December 4, 2008, he was named CEO of Geeknet, the owner of SourceForge.net, ThinkGeek, Slashdot, and Freecode.[12]
Kauffman became chairman of the Board of Directors of MDC Partners in 2006. He was appointed CEO in 2015 after then-CEO Miles Nadal was investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.[13][14]
Other activities[edit]
Kauffman is the chairman of the board of directors of both ChooseEnergy.com and Lotame, as well as a board member of Vindicia.[6][15]
In addition, he is actively involved in supporting ALS research after his son was diagnosed at the age of 27. In addition to being involved with multiple ALS-related organizations, he serves on the board of the ALS Association.[16] Furthermore, Kauffman is founder and chairman of his own ALS organization, Iron Horse Foundation.[17]
Personal life[edit]
Kauffman resides in Palo Alto, California with his wife Nanci, son Stephen and daughter Sarah.

	Scott Kauffman






Scott Kauffman – Personal Injury Attorney, Owner and Managing Partner
For more than 30 years, personal injury attorney Scott Kauffman has fought to help his injured clients seek equitable financial compensation. Scott’s long-time passion for fighting for the rights of injured victims is what drew him to open his law firm, Kauffman & Associates, and specialize in personal injury law. Scott solely represents clients who have been injured in motor vehicle accidents, pedestrian accidents, slip and falls, product liability accidents and wrongful death situations. He has handled literally thousands of bodily injury cases and has a proven track record of obtaining excellent settlements.
 
After earning his law degree in Southern California in the early 1980s, Scott Kauffman began his career as a summer intern in a legal clinic serving the needs of indigent clients. He quickly realized that his true core sympathies and values were not in representing large corporate clients or insurance companies, but rather helping victims who had been harmed as a result of others’ negligence.
 
Attorney Scott Kauffman is a member of the State Bar of California, Consumer Attorneys of California, San Francisco Bar Association, Marin County Chamber of Commerce, Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, and Business Networking International.He is fluent in Russian. His firm, Kauffman & Associates, is located in San Rafael, CA and serves clients primarily in Northern California.





What People Are Saying… 

“Attorney Kauffman helped me tremendously after I was hit by a Muni bus in San Francisco while crossing the street. I suffered horrible injuries and have lost the use of my arm, but Scott and his office worked tirelessly on my case and recovered over $1 million for me. I would have truly been lost without his assistance. I am told that this is the largest settlement Muni ever paid out on a case like this.” – Vlad R.


“After suffering second-degree burns when a waiter spilled coffee on me, I contacted Scott's office not knowing what to expect. Scott and his staff were there for me through every step of my treatment, and were able to recover over $200,000 for my case even though I was lucky enough not to have any permanent scarring. Thanks to his office I was able to get the medical care needed to avoid any permanent injury.” – Adam D.


“After being rear-ended on the freeway, I suffered severe neck injuries which eventually required surgery. Had it not been for Scott Kauffman and his staff I know that I would not only have received a lot less money for my suffering, but also that I would not have gotten the medical care I truly needed. After fighting on my behalf for over two years they were able to settle the case for its maximum dollar value. Although this does not make up for all of the suffering I had to endure it was comforting knowing that I had somebody fighting in my corner to get me the most for my loss.” – Marte S.


“While I was pulling a driver out of his truck, I suffered injuries that made my already bad carpal tunnel much worse. Since I wasn't involved in a car crash, I didn't even think that I could get a settlement until I contacted Scott's office. Not only was he able to secure a favorable settlement on my behalf, he was able to recover over $100,000 to cover the cost of my medical expenses.”– Maria N.

NEW YORK, July 20, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- (NASDAQ:   MDCA; TSX: MDZ.A) - MDC Partners Inc. ("MDC Partners" or the "Company") announced today that Miles S. Nadal has retired as the Company's Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Nadal is also stepping down from his position on the Board of Directors as Chairman.  Scott L. Kauffman, who has served as Presiding Director on the Company's Board of Directors, has been named the Company's new Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  Irwin Simon, a current member of the Board, has been appointed as MDC's Presiding Director.
"Scott is an experienced chief executive who for years has led complex entrepreneurial companies at the crossroads of advertising, technology, and data," said Simon.  "He has intimate knowledge of MDC Partners and, importantly, a passion for the unique model, culture, philosophy and initiatives that have driven MDC's success as a network.  In partnership with the MDC management team, Scott is ideally positioned to continue to drive the Company's industry-leading performance, client results, and support for agency partners."
The Board believes that its selection of Mr. Kauffman, working together with the Company's existing management team, will ensure a seamless transition as the Company successfully moves forward with its growth strategy.  Mr. Kauffman has been a Board member of MDC Partners for nine years and has served as Presiding Director since March 2012.  Mr. Kauffman has a long history of operating at the intersection of media and technology.  He started his career in advertising as a media planner for Benton & Bowles.  Later in his career, he migrated to Silicon Valley and has served in leadership roles at a number of emerging technology companies – in many cases recruited by the board to replace the founding CEO.  Active in advertising technology since its inception, Mr. Kauffman has served as Chairman or CEO of AdKnowledge, Coremetrics and Lotame.  He was also the COO of Blue Lithium at the time of its sale to Yahoo!
Mr. Kauffman stated, "Miles Nadal founded MDC Partners and for more than three decades guided the Company's strong growth.  Without his vision and leadership, MDC Partners would not have achieved the exceptional success we enjoy today.  The Company is strategically well placed to remain on a path of profitable growth and is in a very strong financial and operational position.  I look forward to leading the Company through its next phase of growth."
In connection with the ongoing SEC investigation, Mr. Nadal has agreed to repay to MDC Partners all expenses that were requested to be repaid by the Special Committee of the Board of Directors, including an additional $1.88 million that was recently identified.  In connection with his retirement, Mr. Nadal is required under the Company's Incentive/Retention agreements to repay $10.58 million in retention amounts received between 2012 and 2015.  In addition, Mr. Nadal is not eligible for any compensation payments or severance.
The Company also announced that Michael Sabatino, formerly Chief Accounting Officer of MDC Partners, has resigned.  Mr. Sabatino has agreed to repay the Company $208,535 in cash bonus payments received between 2012 and 2014.
The Company does not expect there will be any material impact to its previously issued financial statements as a result of these additional repayments.
The Company today is also reaffirming its annual financial guidance and, based on a preliminary review, believes its second quarter 2015 results are tracking consistent with internal expectations. The Company will announce its results for the period ending June 30, 2015, on August 6, 2015.
Mr. Nadal stated, "MDC Partners is an exceptional organization.  I'm gratified knowing that after 35 years, I am leaving the Company in a strong position, with brilliant partners, exceptional talent, dedicated employees, wonderful clients, a strong shareholder base, and an incredible culture and reputation as 'The Place Where Great Talent Lives'.  I have every confidence that the Company's deep leadership team will build on this strong foundation in the years ahead."
