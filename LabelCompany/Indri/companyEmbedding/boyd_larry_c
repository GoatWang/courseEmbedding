We do our best to be able to schedule appointments the same day and to have all of our patients in and out within one hour. So when sickness slows you down, you don’t have to wait for expert care. This 2,508 square foot rural health clinic contains eight physicians offices, 23 patient exam rooms, and four procedure rooms. We currently have seven physicians whose specialities include family practice, internal medicine, nephrology, and pediatrics. Your whole family can be treated in the same place, by physicians you know and trust.Family PracticeHaving a baby changes everything, but it doesn’t have to be inconvenient. We know that you want only the best care for you and your baby, and that’s why we have two practicing OBGYNs right here at Yoakum County Hospital. Not only do these physicians provide prenatal care for you and your baby, but their family medicine practices are here too, so they will be with you through every stage, close to home. Not only do we guarantee the very best care with the physicians on staff, but our two brand new birthing rooms utilize only the most up-to-date and state-of-the-art equipment to ensure your safety, comfort, and peace of mind.Emergency CareLife happens when you’re least expecting it, and when life involves accidents and injuries, time matters. In an emergency, every second counts and time spent driving to another city could be life-altering. Yoakum County Hospital is proud to serve as a Level IV Trauma Center with a 24-hour Emergency Room. We have everything to care for you when life’s accidents happen, but are willing and able to transfer patients to other facilities if needed.RadiologistX-RaysUltrasoundWhen routine visits result in a need for testing or outpatient surgery, there’s no need to go any further than down the hall. With our full-service lab, X-ray, anesthesia services, DEXA scanner, spiral CT, and 3-D ultrasound, we are prepared for any treatment or testing you may need. We are proud to always offer excellent patient care and unrivaled convenience through our Outpatient Care.InternistsInternal MedicineUrologySmall town life can often times be equated with inconvenience, but at Yoakum County Hospital, we offer a wide range of medical services close to home.

Our recently remodeled labor and delivery rooms and Dialysis Center house the newest technology to ensure the highest quality of care for our patients. We also provide a wide range of services from OBGYN to home health and are trained to care for all stages of life.PodiatristsGeneral PodiatryAt Yoakum County Hospital, we pride ourselves on the quality of care we provide for our patients. Not only do we pursue excellence in medical treatments, but we also provide the patient with the best all-around experience. Whether it’s the convenience of short wait times, one-on-one care from physicians, the finest fitness accommodations in the area, or bringing physicians in from out of town who specialize in cardiology, dermatology, urology, and podiatry, quality and convenience are our greatest concerns.DermatologistsDermatologyPhysical TherapistsSports MedicineSend to PhoneLarry C Boyd MD415 N Avenue F, Denver City, TX 79323(806) 592-9501Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailLarry C Boyd MD415 N Avenue F, Denver City, TX 79323(806) 592-9501Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend
