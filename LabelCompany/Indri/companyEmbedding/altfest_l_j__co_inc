Financial Planning
At Altfest Personal Wealth ManagementSM, we do more than manage our clients’ investments – we also help you with the day-to-day and long-term financial issues you seek to resolve.
For example:

Will I be able to retire with financial security?
How can I most effectively leave assets to my children?
How do I best adjust financially to a major life change – marriage, children/grandchildren, divorce, or death of a spouse or partner?
How can I optimize my company pension or executive benefits?
Should I refinance my mortgage?
What about a will and health proxy?
How can I get my financial life in order?

We do not provide advice just for your needs today.  Rather, our ongoing monitoring and service strives to both enhance decision-making in a wide variety of financial areas, and ensure constant progress towards meeting your goals.
Our financial planning analyses, and in particular our retirement planning analyses, are highly sophisticated. Many members of the firm hold CFP® certificates – the leading designation in the field.  In addition to this depth of general planning knowledge, we have specialists in a number of targeted areas who can help answer your specific questions.  As with our investment work, quantitative knowledge constitutes only half the value we provide for clients. The other half is qualitative – our ability to listen, to understand your needs and then develop solutions that make financial sense in addition to providing personal comfort and satisfaction to you.

Lewis taught me what I needed to know in financial planning. He brought his Pace University students to the firm's Park Avenue office to give a hands-on view of what was being taught in the classroom. His deep level of knowledge and in depth writings helped break down complex financial planning theories into easier to understand conversations and case studies. He's a wealth of knowledge.







In the more than ten years that my family and I have known the professionals at Altfest Personal Wealth Management, we have always been impressed by their depth of knowledge and client-first approach. Their educational seminars have provided me with a deeper understanding of my financial planning needs and have helped me find my investing comfort zone. I consider myself lucky to know Karen and Lewis Altfest and to be able to seek advice from their impressive staff. I am comfortable to say that I can place my utmost trust in their well researched approach to investing.







I've worked with Lew and Karen for the past 20 years.  They are recognized industry leaders who are as well respected as anyone in our industry.  Besides being extremely smart they are very personable with a focus on how to help the clients.  Their office is recognized year in and year out as being one of the best in the country.  As someone who works with advisors throughout the country and has a very visible firm, I highly recommend L.J. Altfest for their advice, integrity, and ability to translate complicated financial planning/investments into an understandable plan of action.







My wife and I have been clients of Altfest Personal Wealth Management for over 25 years. This firm has always put our financial health as their first priority. They have protected us and managed to preserve our retirement savings through the dot com and deep recession eras. When other advisers were being pressured by their clients to get them into dot com stocks, Altfests saw to it that we did not get into these risky investments.  Likewise, they had us hold tight in the recession and bought stocks when the market was very low.  Suffice it to say we have fared extremely well now that we are in our retirement years.
We have a well diversified portfolio that includes stocks, mutual funds, real estate funds, real estate and oil partnerships and municipal bonds. Also, it is important to note that they carefully balance your mutual fund investments so there is minimal overlap in investment sectors and minimum costs and fees for each fund.
The best thing about the Alfests is that they take a personal interest in each of their clients.  We are friends with a number of other clients who share this same experience.
As far as access is concerned, we have always found the firm ready to answer our questions and meet with us at a moments notice.
On a personal note, the Alfests are the most ethical people we have ever met.  They are also very philanthropic. Karen Altfest has received numerous awards for her charitable work including as one of the founders of the New York Pantry for the poor. They have also set up scholarship funds at Pace University and City College.
We recommend them with enthusiasm!!!







BAD FINANCIAL PLANNING, DETROYED PORTFOLIO, UNSUITABLE INVESTMENTS, UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT

1. Destroyed portfolio with over 1/3 value lost
2. Ignore client
3. Main owner, Lew,  lost temper when question as to why did he things the way he did them. That is Lew.(I don't know what a PHD in Finance from City College gets ya but not an ego that big) He does not like being questions about his decisions.

If you go with this outfit, do NOT, sign over full decision making rights to this financial firm.

4. Unsuitable investments and risk for a retirement person age
5. Promises of retirement planning, puts it off, then asks for big money. There is no way to properly invest without doing cash flow analysis or coordinating with other investments

6. Alleging that he takes a cookie cut approach and does not tailor things to the risk levels and ages of his clients or wealth level
7. Neglects small clients
8.  They changed their company's name from LJ Altfest. Lew and Karen are husband and wife. They have various underlyings their too. Their son worked their for a while. 
I hope he headed for greener pastures.

On the whole, I would say stay away. Do not sign his arbitration agreement it binds you to expensive arbitration. Make sure he writes out what he is going to do for how much money, who bears the cost of trading etc.

I would even venture to say you are better off with Fidelity so long as they came in at less than 1%.  This guy was no better than a petty broker and had a temperament of one to boot.  This is one person's opinion based on a factual client interaction

 I am sure Vanguard, Blackrock, Bernstein, UBS would be fine too.

I hope he headed for greener pastures.On the whole, I would say stay away. Do not sign his arbitration agreement it binds you to expensive arbitration. Make sure he writes out what he is going to do for how much money, who bears the cost of trading etc.I would even venture to say you are better off with Fidelity so long as they came in at less than 1%.  This guy was no better than a petty broker and had a temperament of one to boot.  This is one person's opinion based on a factual client interaction I am sure Vanguard, Blackrock, Bernstein, UBS would be fine too.

Lewis taught me what I needed to know in financial planning. He brought his Pace University students to the firm's Park Avenue office to give a hands-on view of what was being taught in the classroom. His deep level of knowledge and in depth writings helped break down complex financial planning theories into easier to understand conversations and case studies. He's a wealth of knowledge.







In the more than ten years that my family and I have known the professionals at Altfest Personal Wealth Management, we have always been impressed by their depth of knowledge and client-first approach. Their educational seminars have provided me with a deeper understanding of my financial planning needs and have helped me find my investing comfort zone. I consider myself lucky to know Karen and Lewis Altfest and to be able to seek advice from their impressive staff. I am comfortable to say that I can place my utmost trust in their well researched approach to investing.







I've worked with Lew and Karen for the past 20 years.  They are recognized industry leaders who are as well respected as anyone in our industry.  Besides being extremely smart they are very personable with a focus on how to help the clients.  Their office is recognized year in and year out as being one of the best in the country.  As someone who works with advisors throughout the country and has a very visible firm, I highly recommend L.J. Altfest for their advice, integrity, and ability to translate complicated financial planning/investments into an understandable plan of action.







My wife and I have been clients of Altfest Personal Wealth Management for over 25 years. This firm has always put our financial health as their first priority. They have protected us and managed to preserve our retirement savings through the dot com and deep recession eras. When other advisers were being pressured by their clients to get them into dot com stocks, Altfests saw to it that we did not get into these risky investments.  Likewise, they had us hold tight in the recession and bought stocks when the market was very low.  Suffice it to say we have fared extremely well now that we are in our retirement years.
We have a well diversified portfolio that includes stocks, mutual funds, real estate funds, real estate and oil partnerships and municipal bonds. Also, it is important to note that they carefully balance your mutual fund investments so there is minimal overlap in investment sectors and minimum costs and fees for each fund.
The best thing about the Alfests is that they take a personal interest in each of their clients.  We are friends with a number of other clients who share this same experience.
As far as access is concerned, we have always found the firm ready to answer our questions and meet with us at a moments notice.
On a personal note, the Alfests are the most ethical people we have ever met.  They are also very philanthropic. Karen Altfest has received numerous awards for her charitable work including as one of the founders of the New York Pantry for the poor. They have also set up scholarship funds at Pace University and City College.
We recommend them with enthusiasm!!!







BAD FINANCIAL PLANNING, DETROYED PORTFOLIO, UNSUITABLE INVESTMENTS, UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT

1. Destroyed portfolio with over 1/3 value lost
2. Ignore client
3. Main owner, Lew,  lost temper when question as to why did he things the way he did them. That is Lew.(I don't know what a PHD in Finance from City College gets ya but not an ego that big) He does not like being questions about his decisions.

If you go with this outfit, do NOT, sign over full decision making rights to this financial firm.

4. Unsuitable investments and risk for a retirement person age
5. Promises of retirement planning, puts it off, then asks for big money. There is no way to properly invest without doing cash flow analysis or coordinating with other investments

6. Alleging that he takes a cookie cut approach and does not tailor things to the risk levels and ages of his clients or wealth level
7. Neglects small clients
8.  They changed their company's name from LJ Altfest. Lew and Karen are husband and wife. They have various underlyings their too. Their son worked their for a while. 
I hope he headed for greener pastures.

On the whole, I would say stay away. Do not sign his arbitration agreement it binds you to expensive arbitration. Make sure he writes out what he is going to do for how much money, who bears the cost of trading etc.

I would even venture to say you are better off with Fidelity so long as they came in at less than 1%.  This guy was no better than a petty broker and had a temperament of one to boot.  This is one person's opinion based on a factual client interaction

 I am sure Vanguard, Blackrock, Bernstein, UBS would be fine too.

                    Many investors today believe the exit from quantitative easing will expose unintended consequences from the misallocation of capital over the past 8 years. As a consequence they seek to allocate to alternative asset classes…

Lewis taught me what I needed to know in financial planning. He brought his Pace University students to the firm's Park Avenue office to give a hands-on view of what was being taught in the classroom. His deep level of knowledge and in depth writings helped break down complex financial planning theories into easier to understand conversations and case studies. He's a wealth of knowledge.

In the more than ten years that my family and I have known the professionals at Altfest Personal Wealth Management, we have always been impressed by their depth of knowledge and client-first approach. Their educational seminars have provided me with a deeper understanding of my financial planning needs and have helped me find my investing comfort zone. I consider myself lucky to know Karen and Lewis Altfest and to be able to seek advice from their impressive staff. I am comfortable to say that I can place my utmost trust in their well researched approach to investing.

I've worked with Lew and Karen for the past 20 years.  They are recognized industry leaders who are as well respected as anyone in our industry.  Besides being extremely smart they are very personable with a focus on how to help the clients.  Their office is recognized year in and year out as being one of the best in the country.  As someone who works with advisors throughout the country and has a very visible firm, I highly recommend L.J. Altfest for their advice, integrity, and ability to translate complicated financial planning/investments into an understandable plan of action.

My wife and I have been clients of Altfest Personal Wealth Management for over 25 years. This firm has always put our financial health as their first priority. They have protected us and managed to preserve our retirement savings through the dot com and deep recession eras. When other advisers were being pressured by their clients to get them into dot com stocks, Altfests saw to it that we did not get into these risky investments.  Likewise, they had us hold tight in the recession and bought stocks when the market was very low.  Suffice it to say we have fared extremely well now that we are in our retirement years.We have a well diversified portfolio that includes stocks, mutual funds, real estate funds, real estate and oil partnerships and municipal bonds. Also, it is important to note that they carefully balance your mutual fund investments so there is minimal overlap in investment sectors and minimum costs and fees for each fund.The best thing about the Alfests is that they take a personal interest in each of their clients.  We are friends with a number of other clients who share this same experience.As far as access is concerned, we have always found the firm ready to answer our questions and meet with us at a moments notice.On a personal note, the Alfests are the most ethical people we have ever met.  They are also very philanthropic. Karen Altfest has received numerous awards for her charitable work including as one of the founders of the New York Pantry for the poor. They have also set up scholarship funds at Pace University and City College.We recommend them with enthusiasm!!!

BAD FINANCIAL PLANNING, DETROYED PORTFOLIO, UNSUITABLE INVESTMENTS, UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT1. Destroyed portfolio with over 1/3 value lost2. Ignore client3. Main owner, Lew,  lost temper when question as to why did he things the way he did them. That is Lew.(I don't know what a PHD in Finance from City College gets ya but not an ego that big) He does not like being questions about his decisions.If you go with this outfit, do NOT, sign over full decision making rights to this financial firm.4. Unsuitable investments and risk for a retirement person age5. Promises of retirement planning, puts it off, then asks for big money. There is no way to properly invest without doing cash flow analysis or coordinating with other investments6. Alleging that he takes a cookie cut approach and does not tailor things to the risk levels and ages of his clients or wealth level7. Neglects small clients8.  They changed their company's name from LJ Altfest. Lew and Karen are husband and wife. They have various underlyings their too. Their son worked their for a while. I hope he headed for greener pastures.On the whole, I would say stay away. Do not sign his arbitration agreement it binds you to expensive arbitration. Make sure he writes out what he is going to do for how much money, who bears the cost of trading etc.I would even venture to say you are better off with Fidelity so long as they came in at less than 1%.  This guy was no better than a petty broker and had a temperament of one to boot.  This is one person's opinion based on a factual client interaction I am sure Vanguard, Blackrock, Bernstein, UBS would be fine too.

Lewis taught me what I needed to know in financial planning. He brought his Pace University students to the firm's Park Avenue office to give a hands-on view of what was being taught in the classroom. His deep level of knowledge and in depth writings helped break down complex financial planning theories into easier to understand conversations and case studies. He's a wealth of knowledge.







In the more than ten years that my family and I have known the professionals at Altfest Personal Wealth Management, we have always been impressed by their depth of knowledge and client-first approach. Their educational seminars have provided me with a deeper understanding of my financial planning needs and have helped me find my investing comfort zone. I consider myself lucky to know Karen and Lewis Altfest and to be able to seek advice from their impressive staff. I am comfortable to say that I can place my utmost trust in their well researched approach to investing.







I've worked with Lew and Karen for the past 20 years.  They are recognized industry leaders who are as well respected as anyone in our industry.  Besides being extremely smart they are very personable with a focus on how to help the clients.  Their office is recognized year in and year out as being one of the best in the country.  As someone who works with advisors throughout the country and has a very visible firm, I highly recommend L.J. Altfest for their advice, integrity, and ability to translate complicated financial planning/investments into an understandable plan of action.







My wife and I have been clients of Altfest Personal Wealth Management for over 25 years. This firm has always put our financial health as their first priority. They have protected us and managed to preserve our retirement savings through the dot com and deep recession eras. When other advisers were being pressured by their clients to get them into dot com stocks, Altfests saw to it that we did not get into these risky investments.  Likewise, they had us hold tight in the recession and bought stocks when the market was very low.  Suffice it to say we have fared extremely well now that we are in our retirement years.
We have a well diversified portfolio that includes stocks, mutual funds, real estate funds, real estate and oil partnerships and municipal bonds. Also, it is important to note that they carefully balance your mutual fund investments so there is minimal overlap in investment sectors and minimum costs and fees for each fund.
The best thing about the Alfests is that they take a personal interest in each of their clients.  We are friends with a number of other clients who share this same experience.
As far as access is concerned, we have always found the firm ready to answer our questions and meet with us at a moments notice.
On a personal note, the Alfests are the most ethical people we have ever met.  They are also very philanthropic. Karen Altfest has received numerous awards for her charitable work including as one of the founders of the New York Pantry for the poor. They have also set up scholarship funds at Pace University and City College.
We recommend them with enthusiasm!!!







BAD FINANCIAL PLANNING, DETROYED PORTFOLIO, UNSUITABLE INVESTMENTS, UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT

1. Destroyed portfolio with over 1/3 value lost
2. Ignore client
3. Main owner, Lew,  lost temper when question as to why did he things the way he did them. That is Lew.(I don't know what a PHD in Finance from City College gets ya but not an ego that big) He does not like being questions about his decisions.

If you go with this outfit, do NOT, sign over full decision making rights to this financial firm.

4. Unsuitable investments and risk for a retirement person age
5. Promises of retirement planning, puts it off, then asks for big money. There is no way to properly invest without doing cash flow analysis or coordinating with other investments

6. Alleging that he takes a cookie cut approach and does not tailor things to the risk levels and ages of his clients or wealth level
7. Neglects small clients
8.  They changed their company's name from LJ Altfest. Lew and Karen are husband and wife. They have various underlyings their too. Their son worked their for a while. 
I hope he headed for greener pastures.

On the whole, I would say stay away. Do not sign his arbitration agreement it binds you to expensive arbitration. Make sure he writes out what he is going to do for how much money, who bears the cost of trading etc.

I would even venture to say you are better off with Fidelity so long as they came in at less than 1%.  This guy was no better than a petty broker and had a temperament of one to boot.  This is one person's opinion based on a factual client interaction

 I am sure Vanguard, Blackrock, Bernstein, UBS would be fine too.

Lewis taught me what I needed to know in financial planning. He brought his Pace University students to the firm's Park Avenue office to give a hands-on view of what was being taught in the classroom. His deep level of knowledge and in depth writings helped break down complex financial planning theories into easier to understand conversations and case studies. He's a wealth of knowledge.

In the more than ten years that my family and I have known the professionals at Altfest Personal Wealth Management, we have always been impressed by their depth of knowledge and client-first approach. Their educational seminars have provided me with a deeper understanding of my financial planning needs and have helped me find my investing comfort zone. I consider myself lucky to know Karen and Lewis Altfest and to be able to seek advice from their impressive staff. I am comfortable to say that I can place my utmost trust in their well researched approach to investing.

I've worked with Lew and Karen for the past 20 years.  They are recognized industry leaders who are as well respected as anyone in our industry.  Besides being extremely smart they are very personable with a focus on how to help the clients.  Their office is recognized year in and year out as being one of the best in the country.  As someone who works with advisors throughout the country and has a very visible firm, I highly recommend L.J. Altfest for their advice, integrity, and ability to translate complicated financial planning/investments into an understandable plan of action.

My wife and I have been clients of Altfest Personal Wealth Management for over 25 years. This firm has always put our financial health as their first priority. They have protected us and managed to preserve our retirement savings through the dot com and deep recession eras. When other advisers were being pressured by their clients to get them into dot com stocks, Altfests saw to it that we did not get into these risky investments.  Likewise, they had us hold tight in the recession and bought stocks when the market was very low.  Suffice it to say we have fared extremely well now that we are in our retirement years.We have a well diversified portfolio that includes stocks, mutual funds, real estate funds, real estate and oil partnerships and municipal bonds. Also, it is important to note that they carefully balance your mutual fund investments so there is minimal overlap in investment sectors and minimum costs and fees for each fund.The best thing about the Alfests is that they take a personal interest in each of their clients.  We are friends with a number of other clients who share this same experience.As far as access is concerned, we have always found the firm ready to answer our questions and meet with us at a moments notice.On a personal note, the Alfests are the most ethical people we have ever met.  They are also very philanthropic. Karen Altfest has received numerous awards for her charitable work including as one of the founders of the New York Pantry for the poor. They have also set up scholarship funds at Pace University and City College.We recommend them with enthusiasm!!!

Lewis taught me what I needed to know in financial planning. He brought his Pace University students to the firm's Park Avenue office to give a hands-on view of what was being taught in the classroom. His deep level of knowledge and in depth writings helped break down complex financial planning theories into easier to understand conversations and case studies. He's a wealth of knowledge.







In the more than ten years that my family and I have known the professionals at Altfest Personal Wealth Management, we have always been impressed by their depth of knowledge and client-first approach. Their educational seminars have provided me with a deeper understanding of my financial planning needs and have helped me find my investing comfort zone. I consider myself lucky to know Karen and Lewis Altfest and to be able to seek advice from their impressive staff. I am comfortable to say that I can place my utmost trust in their well researched approach to investing.







I've worked with Lew and Karen for the past 20 years.  They are recognized industry leaders who are as well respected as anyone in our industry.  Besides being extremely smart they are very personable with a focus on how to help the clients.  Their office is recognized year in and year out as being one of the best in the country.  As someone who works with advisors throughout the country and has a very visible firm, I highly recommend L.J. Altfest for their advice, integrity, and ability to translate complicated financial planning/investments into an understandable plan of action.







My wife and I have been clients of Altfest Personal Wealth Management for over 25 years. This firm has always put our financial health as their first priority. They have protected us and managed to preserve our retirement savings through the dot com and deep recession eras. When other advisers were being pressured by their clients to get them into dot com stocks, Altfests saw to it that we did not get into these risky investments.  Likewise, they had us hold tight in the recession and bought stocks when the market was very low.  Suffice it to say we have fared extremely well now that we are in our retirement years.
We have a well diversified portfolio that includes stocks, mutual funds, real estate funds, real estate and oil partnerships and municipal bonds. Also, it is important to note that they carefully balance your mutual fund investments so there is minimal overlap in investment sectors and minimum costs and fees for each fund.
The best thing about the Alfests is that they take a personal interest in each of their clients.  We are friends with a number of other clients who share this same experience.
As far as access is concerned, we have always found the firm ready to answer our questions and meet with us at a moments notice.
On a personal note, the Alfests are the most ethical people we have ever met.  They are also very philanthropic. Karen Altfest has received numerous awards for her charitable work including as one of the founders of the New York Pantry for the poor. They have also set up scholarship funds at Pace University and City College.
We recommend them with enthusiasm!!!







BAD FINANCIAL PLANNING, DETROYED PORTFOLIO, UNSUITABLE INVESTMENTS, UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT

1. Destroyed portfolio with over 1/3 value lost
2. Ignore client
3. Main owner, Lew,  lost temper when question as to why did he things the way he did them. That is Lew.(I don't know what a PHD in Finance from City College gets ya but not an ego that big) He does not like being questions about his decisions.

If you go with this outfit, do NOT, sign over full decision making rights to this financial firm.

4. Unsuitable investments and risk for a retirement person age
5. Promises of retirement planning, puts it off, then asks for big money. There is no way to properly invest without doing cash flow analysis or coordinating with other investments

6. Alleging that he takes a cookie cut approach and does not tailor things to the risk levels and ages of his clients or wealth level
7. Neglects small clients
8.  They changed their company's name from LJ Altfest. Lew and Karen are husband and wife. They have various underlyings their too. Their son worked their for a while. 
I hope he headed for greener pastures.

On the whole, I would say stay away. Do not sign his arbitration agreement it binds you to expensive arbitration. Make sure he writes out what he is going to do for how much money, who bears the cost of trading etc.

I would even venture to say you are better off with Fidelity so long as they came in at less than 1%.  This guy was no better than a petty broker and had a temperament of one to boot.  This is one person's opinion based on a factual client interaction

 I am sure Vanguard, Blackrock, Bernstein, UBS would be fine too.

BAD FINANCIAL PLANNING, DETROYED PORTFOLIO, UNSUITABLE INVESTMENTS, UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT

1. Destroyed portfolio with over 1/3 value lost
2. Ignore client
3. Main owner, Lew,  lost temper when question as to why did he things the way he did them. That is Lew.(I don't know what a PHD in Finance from City College gets ya but not an ego that big) He does not like being questions about his decisions.

If you go with this outfit, do NOT, sign over full decision making rights to this financial firm.

4. Unsuitable investments and risk for a retirement person age
5. Promises of retirement planning, puts it off, then asks for big money. There is no way to properly invest without doing cash flow analysis or coordinating with other investments

6. Alleging that he takes a cookie cut approach and does not tailor things to the risk levels and ages of his clients or wealth level
7. Neglects small clients
8.  They changed their company's name from LJ Altfest. Lew and Karen are husband and wife. They have various underlyings their too. Their son worked their for a while. 
I hope he headed for greener pastures.

On the whole, I would say stay away. Do not sign his arbitration agreement it binds you to expensive arbitration. Make sure he writes out what he is going to do for how much money, who bears the cost of trading etc.

I would even venture to say you are better off with Fidelity so long as they came in at less than 1%.  This guy was no better than a petty broker and had a temperament of one to boot.  This is one person's opinion based on a factual client interaction

 I am sure Vanguard, Blackrock, Bernstein, UBS would be fine too.







Lewis taught me what I needed to know in financial planning. He brought his Pace University students to the firm's Park Avenue office to give a hands-on view of what was being taught in the classroom. His deep level of knowledge and in depth writings helped break down complex financial planning theories into easier to understand conversations and case studies. He's a wealth of knowledge.







In the more than ten years that my family and I have known the professionals at Altfest Personal Wealth Management, we have always been impressed by their depth of knowledge and client-first approach. Their educational seminars have provided me with a deeper understanding of my financial planning needs and have helped me find my investing comfort zone. I consider myself lucky to know Karen and Lewis Altfest and to be able to seek advice from their impressive staff. I am comfortable to say that I can place my utmost trust in their well researched approach to investing.







I've worked with Lew and Karen for the past 20 years.  They are recognized industry leaders who are as well respected as anyone in our industry.  Besides being extremely smart they are very personable with a focus on how to help the clients.  Their office is recognized year in and year out as being one of the best in the country.  As someone who works with advisors throughout the country and has a very visible firm, I highly recommend L.J. Altfest for their advice, integrity, and ability to translate complicated financial planning/investments into an understandable plan of action.







My wife and I have been clients of Altfest Personal Wealth Management for over 25 years. This firm has always put our financial health as their first priority. They have protected us and managed to preserve our retirement savings through the dot com and deep recession eras. When other advisers were being pressured by their clients to get them into dot com stocks, Altfests saw to it that we did not get into these risky investments.  Likewise, they had us hold tight in the recession and bought stocks when the market was very low.  Suffice it to say we have fared extremely well now that we are in our retirement years.
We have a well diversified portfolio that includes stocks, mutual funds, real estate funds, real estate and oil partnerships and municipal bonds. Also, it is important to note that they carefully balance your mutual fund investments so there is minimal overlap in investment sectors and minimum costs and fees for each fund.
The best thing about the Alfests is that they take a personal interest in each of their clients.  We are friends with a number of other clients who share this same experience.
As far as access is concerned, we have always found the firm ready to answer our questions and meet with us at a moments notice.
On a personal note, the Alfests are the most ethical people we have ever met.  They are also very philanthropic. Karen Altfest has received numerous awards for her charitable work including as one of the founders of the New York Pantry for the poor. They have also set up scholarship funds at Pace University and City College.
We recommend them with enthusiasm!!!

Lewis taught me what I needed to know in financial planning. He brought his Pace University students to the firm's Park Avenue office to give a hands-on view of what was being taught in the classroom. His deep level of knowledge and in depth writings helped break down complex financial planning theories into easier to understand conversations and case studies. He's a wealth of knowledge.







In the more than ten years that my family and I have known the professionals at Altfest Personal Wealth Management, we have always been impressed by their depth of knowledge and client-first approach. Their educational seminars have provided me with a deeper understanding of my financial planning needs and have helped me find my investing comfort zone. I consider myself lucky to know Karen and Lewis Altfest and to be able to seek advice from their impressive staff. I am comfortable to say that I can place my utmost trust in their well researched approach to investing.







I've worked with Lew and Karen for the past 20 years.  They are recognized industry leaders who are as well respected as anyone in our industry.  Besides being extremely smart they are very personable with a focus on how to help the clients.  Their office is recognized year in and year out as being one of the best in the country.  As someone who works with advisors throughout the country and has a very visible firm, I highly recommend L.J. Altfest for their advice, integrity, and ability to translate complicated financial planning/investments into an understandable plan of action.







My wife and I have been clients of Altfest Personal Wealth Management for over 25 years. This firm has always put our financial health as their first priority. They have protected us and managed to preserve our retirement savings through the dot com and deep recession eras. When other advisers were being pressured by their clients to get them into dot com stocks, Altfests saw to it that we did not get into these risky investments.  Likewise, they had us hold tight in the recession and bought stocks when the market was very low.  Suffice it to say we have fared extremely well now that we are in our retirement years.
We have a well diversified portfolio that includes stocks, mutual funds, real estate funds, real estate and oil partnerships and municipal bonds. Also, it is important to note that they carefully balance your mutual fund investments so there is minimal overlap in investment sectors and minimum costs and fees for each fund.
The best thing about the Alfests is that they take a personal interest in each of their clients.  We are friends with a number of other clients who share this same experience.
As far as access is concerned, we have always found the firm ready to answer our questions and meet with us at a moments notice.
On a personal note, the Alfests are the most ethical people we have ever met.  They are also very philanthropic. Karen Altfest has received numerous awards for her charitable work including as one of the founders of the New York Pantry for the poor. They have also set up scholarship funds at Pace University and City College.
We recommend them with enthusiasm!!!







BAD FINANCIAL PLANNING, DETROYED PORTFOLIO, UNSUITABLE INVESTMENTS, UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT

1. Destroyed portfolio with over 1/3 value lost
2. Ignore client
3. Main owner, Lew,  lost temper when question as to why did he things the way he did them. That is Lew.(I don't know what a PHD in Finance from City College gets ya but not an ego that big) He does not like being questions about his decisions.

If you go with this outfit, do NOT, sign over full decision making rights to this financial firm.

4. Unsuitable investments and risk for a retirement person age
5. Promises of retirement planning, puts it off, then asks for big money. There is no way to properly invest without doing cash flow analysis or coordinating with other investments

6. Alleging that he takes a cookie cut approach and does not tailor things to the risk levels and ages of his clients or wealth level
7. Neglects small clients
8.  They changed their company's name from LJ Altfest. Lew and Karen are husband and wife. They have various underlyings their too. Their son worked their for a while. 
I hope he headed for greener pastures.

On the whole, I would say stay away. Do not sign his arbitration agreement it binds you to expensive arbitration. Make sure he writes out what he is going to do for how much money, who bears the cost of trading etc.

I would even venture to say you are better off with Fidelity so long as they came in at less than 1%.  This guy was no better than a petty broker and had a temperament of one to boot.  This is one person's opinion based on a factual client interaction

 I am sure Vanguard, Blackrock, Bernstein, UBS would be fine too.

In the more than ten years that my family and I have known the professionals at Altfest Personal Wealth Management, we have always been impressed by their depth of knowledge and client-first approach. Their educational seminars have provided me with a deeper understanding of my financial planning needs and have helped me find my investing comfort zone. I consider myself lucky to know Karen and Lewis Altfest and to be able to seek advice from their impressive staff. I am comfortable to say that I can place my utmost trust in their well researched approach to investing.







Lewis taught me what I needed to know in financial planning. He brought his Pace University students to the firm's Park Avenue office to give a hands-on view of what was being taught in the classroom. His deep level of knowledge and in depth writings helped break down complex financial planning theories into easier to understand conversations and case studies. He's a wealth of knowledge.

I consider myself lucky to know Karen and Lewis Altfest and to be able to seek advice from their impressive staff. I am comfortable to say that I can place my utmost trust in their well researched approach to investing.







I've worked with Lew and Karen for the past 20 years.  They are recognized industry leaders who are as well respected as anyone in our industry.  Besides being extremely smart they are very personable with a focus on how to help the clients.  Their office is recognized year in and year out as being one of the best in the country.  As someone who works with advisors throughout the country and has a very visible firm, I highly recommend L.J. Altfest for their advice, integrity, and ability to translate complicated financial planning/investments into an understandable plan of action.







My wife and I have been clients of Altfest Personal Wealth Management for over 25 years. This firm has always put our financial health as their first priority. They have protected us and managed to preserve our retirement savings through the dot com and deep recession eras. When other advisers were being pressured by their clients to get them into dot com stocks, Altfests saw to it that we did not get into these risky investments.  Likewise, they had us hold tight in the recession and bought stocks when the market was very low.  Suffice it to say we have fared extremely well now that we are in our retirement years.
We have a well diversified portfolio that includes stocks, mutual funds, real estate funds, real estate and oil partnerships and municipal bonds. Also, it is important to note that they carefully balance your mutual fund investments so there is minimal overlap in investment sectors and minimum costs and fees for each fund.
The best thing about the Alfests is that they take a personal interest in each of their clients.  We are friends with a number of other clients who share this same experience.
As far as access is concerned, we have always found the firm ready to answer our questions and meet with us at a moments notice.
On a personal note, the Alfests are the most ethical people we have ever met.  They are also very philanthropic. Karen Altfest has received numerous awards for her charitable work including as one of the founders of the New York Pantry for the poor. They have also set up scholarship funds at Pace University and City College.
We recommend them with enthusiasm!!!







BAD FINANCIAL PLANNING, DETROYED PORTFOLIO, UNSUITABLE INVESTMENTS, UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT

1. Destroyed portfolio with over 1/3 value lost
2. Ignore client
3. Main owner, Lew,  lost temper when question as to why did he things the way he did them. That is Lew.(I don't know what a PHD in Finance from City College gets ya but not an ego that big) He does not like being questions about his decisions.

If you go with this outfit, do NOT, sign over full decision making rights to this financial firm.

4. Unsuitable investments and risk for a retirement person age
5. Promises of retirement planning, puts it off, then asks for big money. There is no way to properly invest without doing cash flow analysis or coordinating with other investments

6. Alleging that he takes a cookie cut approach and does not tailor things to the risk levels and ages of his clients or wealth level
7. Neglects small clients
8.  They changed their company's name from LJ Altfest. Lew and Karen are husband and wife. They have various underlyings their too. Their son worked their for a while. 
I hope he headed for greener pastures.

On the whole, I would say stay away. Do not sign his arbitration agreement it binds you to expensive arbitration. Make sure he writes out what he is going to do for how much money, who bears the cost of trading etc.

I would even venture to say you are better off with Fidelity so long as they came in at less than 1%.  This guy was no better than a petty broker and had a temperament of one to boot.  This is one person's opinion based on a factual client interaction

 I am sure Vanguard, Blackrock, Bernstein, UBS would be fine too.

When other advisers were being pressured by their clients to get them into dot com stocks, Altfests saw to it that we did not get into these risky investments.  Likewise, they had us hold tight in the recession and bought stocks when the market was very low.  Suffice it to say we have fared extremely well now that we are in our retirement years.We have a well diversified portfolio that includes stocks, mutual funds, real estate funds, real estate and oil partnerships and municipal bonds. Also, it is important to note that they carefully balance your mutual fund investments so there is minimal overlap in investment sectors and minimum costs and fees for each fund.The best thing about the Alfests is that they take a personal interest in each of their clients.  We are friends with a number of other clients who share this same experience.As far as access is concerned, we have always found the firm ready to answer our questions and meet with us at a moments notice.On a personal note, the Alfests are the most ethical people we have ever met.  They are also very philanthropic. Karen Altfest has received numerous awards for her charitable work including as one of the founders of the New York Pantry for the poor. They have also set up scholarship funds at Pace University and City College.We recommend them with enthusiasm!!!

BAD FINANCIAL PLANNING, DETROYED PORTFOLIO, UNSUITABLE INVESTMENTS, UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT1. Destroyed portfolio with over 1/3 value lost2. Ignore client3. Main owner, Lew,  lost temper when question as to why did he things the way he did them. That is Lew.(I don't know what a PHD in Finance from City College gets ya but not an ego that big) He does not like being questions about his decisions.If you go with this outfit, do NOT, sign over full decision making rights to this financial firm.4. Unsuitable investments and risk for a retirement person age5. Promises of retirement planning, puts it off, then asks for big money. There is no way to properly invest without doing cash flow analysis or coordinating with other investments6. Alleging that he takes a cookie cut approach and does not tailor things to the risk levels and ages of his clients or wealth level7. Neglects small clients8.  They changed their company's name from LJ Altfest. Lew and Karen are husband and wife. They have various underlyings their too. Their son worked their for a while. I hope he headed for greener pastures.On the whole, I would say stay away. Do not sign his arbitration agreement it binds you to expensive arbitration. Make sure he writes out what he is going to do for how much money, who bears the cost of trading etc.I would even venture to say you are better off with Fidelity so long as they came in at less than 1%.  This guy was no better than a petty broker and had a temperament of one to boot.  This is one person's opinion based on a factual client interaction I am sure Vanguard, Blackrock, Bernstein, UBS would be fine too.

I've worked with Lew and Karen for the past 20 years.  They are recognized industry leaders who are as well respected as anyone in our industry.  Besides being extremely smart they are very personable with a focus on how to help the clients.  Their office is recognized year in and year out as being one of the best in the country.  As someone who works with advisors throughout the country and has a very visible firm, I highly recommend L.J. Altfest for their advice, integrity, and ability to translate complicated financial planning/investments into an understandable plan of action.







Lewis taught me what I needed to know in financial planning. He brought his Pace University students to the firm's Park Avenue office to give a hands-on view of what was being taught in the classroom. His deep level of knowledge and in depth writings helped break down complex financial planning theories into easier to understand conversations and case studies. He's a wealth of knowledge.







In the more than ten years that my family and I have known the professionals at Altfest Personal Wealth Management, we have always been impressed by their depth of knowledge and client-first approach. Their educational seminars have provided me with a deeper understanding of my financial planning needs and have helped me find my investing comfort zone. I consider myself lucky to know Karen and Lewis Altfest and to be able to seek advice from their impressive staff. I am comfortable to say that I can place my utmost trust in their well researched approach to investing.

We have a well diversified portfolio that includes stocks, mutual funds, real estate funds, real estate and oil partnerships and municipal bonds. Also, it is important to note that they carefully balance your mutual fund investments so there is minimal overlap in investment sectors and minimum costs and fees for each fund.
The best thing about the Alfests is that they take a personal interest in each of their clients.  We are friends with a number of other clients who share this same experience.
As far as access is concerned, we have always found the firm ready to answer our questions and meet with us at a moments notice.

We recommend them with enthusiasm!!!







BAD FINANCIAL PLANNING, DETROYED PORTFOLIO, UNSUITABLE INVESTMENTS, UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT

1. Destroyed portfolio with over 1/3 value lost
2. Ignore client
3. Main owner, Lew,  lost temper when question as to why did he things the way he did them. That is Lew.(I don't know what a PHD in Finance from City College gets ya but not an ego that big) He does not like being questions about his decisions.

If you go with this outfit, do NOT, sign over full decision making rights to this financial firm.

4. Unsuitable investments and risk for a retirement person age
5. Promises of retirement planning, puts it off, then asks for big money. There is no way to properly invest without doing cash flow analysis or coordinating with other investments

6. Alleging that he takes a cookie cut approach and does not tailor things to the risk levels and ages of his clients or wealth level
7. Neglects small clients
8.  They changed their company's name from LJ Altfest. Lew and Karen are husband and wife. They have various underlyings their too. Their son worked their for a while. 
I hope he headed for greener pastures.

On the whole, I would say stay away. Do not sign his arbitration agreement it binds you to expensive arbitration. Make sure he writes out what he is going to do for how much money, who bears the cost of trading etc.

I would even venture to say you are better off with Fidelity so long as they came in at less than 1%.  This guy was no better than a petty broker and had a temperament of one to boot.  This is one person's opinion based on a factual client interaction

 I am sure Vanguard, Blackrock, Bernstein, UBS would be fine too.

I've worked with Lew and Karen for the past 20 years.  They are recognized industry leaders who are as well respected as anyone in our industry.  Besides being extremely smart they are very personable with a focus on how to help the clients.  Their office is recognized year in and year out as being one of the best in the country.  As someone who works with advisors throughout the country and has a very visible firm, I highly recommend L.J. Altfest for their advice, integrity, and ability to translate complicated financial planning/investments into an understandable plan of action.

Lewis taught me what I needed to know in financial planning. He brought his Pace University students to the firm's Park Avenue office to give a hands-on view of what was being taught in the classroom. His deep level of knowledge and in depth writings helped break down complex financial planning theories into easier to understand conversations and case studies. He's a wealth of knowledge.

In the more than ten years that my family and I have known the professionals at Altfest Personal Wealth Management, we have always been impressed by their depth of knowledge and client-first approach. Their educational seminars have provided me with a deeper understanding of my financial planning needs and have helped me find my investing comfort zone. I consider myself lucky to know Karen and Lewis Altfest and to be able to seek advice from their impressive staff. I am comfortable to say that I can place my utmost trust in their well researched approach to investing.

My wife and I have been clients of Altfest Personal Wealth Management for over 25 years. This firm has always put our financial health as their first priority. They have protected us and managed to preserve our retirement savings through the dot com and deep recession eras. When other advisers were being pressured by their clients to get them into dot com stocks, Altfests saw to it that we did not get into these risky investments.  Likewise, they had us hold tight in the recession and bought stocks when the market was very low.  Suffice it to say we have fared extremely well now that we are in our retirement years.We have a well diversified portfolio that includes stocks, mutual funds, real estate funds, real estate and oil partnerships and municipal bonds. Also, it is important to note that they carefully balance your mutual fund investments so there is minimal overlap in investment sectors and minimum costs and fees for each fund.The best thing about the Alfests is that they take a personal interest in each of their clients.  We are friends with a number of other clients who share this same experience.As far as access is concerned, we have always found the firm ready to answer our questions and meet with us at a moments notice.On a personal note, the Alfests are the most ethical people we have ever met.  They are also very philanthropic. Karen Altfest has received numerous awards for her charitable work including as one of the founders of the New York Pantry for the poor. They have also set up scholarship funds at Pace University and City College.We recommend them with enthusiasm!!!

BAD FINANCIAL PLANNING, DETROYED PORTFOLIO, UNSUITABLE INVESTMENTS, UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT1. Destroyed portfolio with over 1/3 value lost2. Ignore client3. Main owner, Lew,  lost temper when question as to why did he things the way he did them. That is Lew.(I don't know what a PHD in Finance from City College gets ya but not an ego that big) He does not like being questions about his decisions.If you go with this outfit, do NOT, sign over full decision making rights to this financial firm.4. Unsuitable investments and risk for a retirement person age5. Promises of retirement planning, puts it off, then asks for big money.

I hope he headed for greener pastures.On the whole, I would say stay away. Do not sign his arbitration agreement it binds you to expensive arbitration. Make sure he writes out what he is going to do for how much money, who bears the cost of trading etc.I would even venture to say you are better off with Fidelity so long as they came in at less than 1%.  This guy was no better than a petty broker and had a temperament of one to boot.  This is one person's opinion based on a factual client interaction I am sure Vanguard, Blackrock, Bernstein, UBS would be fine too.

Lewis taught me what I needed to know in financial planning. He brought his Pace University students to the firm's Park Avenue office to give a hands-on view of what was being taught in the classroom. His deep level of knowledge and in depth writings helped break down complex financial planning theories into easier to understand conversations and case studies. He's a wealth of knowledge.







In the more than ten years that my family and I have known the professionals at Altfest Personal Wealth Management, we have always been impressed by their depth of knowledge and client-first approach. Their educational seminars have provided me with a deeper understanding of my financial planning needs and have helped me find my investing comfort zone. I consider myself lucky to know Karen and Lewis Altfest and to be able to seek advice from their impressive staff. I am comfortable to say that I can place my utmost trust in their well researched approach to investing.







I've worked with Lew and Karen for the past 20 years.  They are recognized industry leaders who are as well respected as anyone in our industry.  Besides being extremely smart they are very personable with a focus on how to help the clients.  Their office is recognized year in and year out as being one of the best in the country.  As someone who works with advisors throughout the country and has a very visible firm, I highly recommend L.J. Altfest for their advice, integrity, and ability to translate complicated financial planning/investments into an understandable plan of action.







My wife and I have been clients of Altfest Personal Wealth Management for over 25 years. This firm has always put our financial health as their first priority. They have protected us and managed to preserve our retirement savings through the dot com and deep recession eras. When other advisers were being pressured by their clients to get them into dot com stocks, Altfests saw to it that we did not get into these risky investments.  Likewise, they had us hold tight in the recession and bought stocks when the market was very low.  Suffice it to say we have fared extremely well now that we are in our retirement years.
We have a well diversified portfolio that includes stocks, mutual funds, real estate funds, real estate and oil partnerships and municipal bonds. Also, it is important to note that they carefully balance your mutual fund investments so there is minimal overlap in investment sectors and minimum costs and fees for each fund.
The best thing about the Alfests is that they take a personal interest in each of their clients.  We are friends with a number of other clients who share this same experience.
As far as access is concerned, we have always found the firm ready to answer our questions and meet with us at a moments notice.
On a personal note, the Alfests are the most ethical people we have ever met.  They are also very philanthropic. Karen Altfest has received numerous awards for her charitable work including as one of the founders of the New York Pantry for the poor. They have also set up scholarship funds at Pace University and City College.
We recommend them with enthusiasm!!!







BAD FINANCIAL PLANNING, DETROYED PORTFOLIO, UNSUITABLE INVESTMENTS, UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT

1. Destroyed portfolio with over 1/3 value lost
2. Ignore client
3. Main owner, Lew,  lost temper when question as to why did he things the way he did them. That is Lew.(I don't know what a PHD in Finance from City College gets ya but not an ego that big) He does not like being questions about his decisions.

If you go with this outfit, do NOT, sign over full decision making rights to this financial firm.

4. Unsuitable investments and risk for a retirement person age
5. Promises of retirement planning, puts it off, then asks for big money. There is no way to properly invest without doing cash flow analysis or coordinating with other investments

6. Alleging that he takes a cookie cut approach and does not tailor things to the risk levels and ages of his clients or wealth level
7. Neglects small clients
8.  They changed their company's name from LJ Altfest. Lew and Karen are husband and wife. They have various underlyings their too. Their son worked their for a while. 
I hope he headed for greener pastures.

On the whole, I would say stay away. Do not sign his arbitration agreement it binds you to expensive arbitration. Make sure he writes out what he is going to do for how much money, who bears the cost of trading etc.

I would even venture to say you are better off with Fidelity so long as they came in at less than 1%.  This guy was no better than a petty broker and had a temperament of one to boot.  This is one person's opinion based on a factual client interaction

 I am sure Vanguard, Blackrock, Bernstein, UBS would be fine too.

In the more than ten years that my family and I have known the professionals at Altfest Personal Wealth Management, we have always been impressed by their depth of knowledge and client-first approach. Their educational seminars have provided me with a deeper understanding of my financial planning needs and have helped me find my investing comfort zone. I consider myself lucky to know Karen and Lewis Altfest and to be able to seek advice from their impressive staff. I am comfortable to say that I can place my utmost trust in their well researched approach to investing.

I've worked with Lew and Karen for the past 20 years.  They are recognized industry leaders who are as well respected as anyone in our industry.  Besides being extremely smart they are very personable with a focus on how to help the clients.  Their office is recognized year in and year out as being one of the best in the country.  As someone who works with advisors throughout the country and has a very visible firm, I highly recommend L.J. Altfest for their advice, integrity, and ability to translate complicated financial planning/investments into an understandable plan of action.

My wife and I have been clients of Altfest Personal Wealth Management for over 25 years. This firm has always put our financial health as their first priority. They have protected us and managed to preserve our retirement savings through the dot com and deep recession eras. When other advisers were being pressured by their clients to get them into dot com stocks, Altfests saw to it that we did not get into these risky investments.  Likewise, they had us hold tight in the recession and bought stocks when the market was very low.  Suffice it to say we have fared extremely well now that we are in our retirement years.We have a well diversified portfolio that includes stocks, mutual funds, real estate funds, real estate and oil partnerships and municipal bonds. Also, it is important to note that they carefully balance your mutual fund investments so there is minimal overlap in investment sectors and minimum costs and fees for each fund.The best thing about the Alfests is that they take a personal interest in each of their clients.  We are friends with a number of other clients who share this same experience.As far as access is concerned, we have always found the firm ready to answer our questions and meet with us at a moments notice.On a personal note, the Alfests are the most ethical people we have ever met.  They are also very philanthropic. Karen Altfest has received numerous awards for her charitable work including as one of the founders of the New York Pantry for the poor. They have also set up scholarship funds at Pace University and City College.We recommend them with enthusiasm!!!

BAD FINANCIAL PLANNING, DETROYED PORTFOLIO, UNSUITABLE INVESTMENTS, UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT1. Destroyed portfolio with over 1/3 value lost2. Ignore client3. Main owner, Lew,  lost temper when question as to why did he things the way he did them. That is Lew.(I don't know what a PHD in Finance from City College gets ya but not an ego that big) He does not like being questions about his decisions.If you go with this outfit, do NOT, sign over full decision making rights to this financial firm.4. Unsuitable investments and risk for a retirement person age5. Promises of retirement planning, puts it off, then asks for big money. There is no way to properly invest without doing cash flow analysis or coordinating with other investments6. Alleging that he takes a cookie cut approach and does not tailor things to the risk levels and ages of his clients or wealth level7. Neglects small clients8.  They changed their company's name from LJ Altfest. Lew and Karen are husband and wife. They have various underlyings their too. Their son worked their for a while. I hope he headed for greener pastures.On the whole, I would say stay away. Do not sign his arbitration agreement it binds you to expensive arbitration. Make sure he writes out what he is going to do for how much money, who bears the cost of trading etc.I would even venture to say you are better off with Fidelity so long as they came in at less than 1%.  This guy was no better than a petty broker and had a temperament of one to boot.  This is one person's opinion based on a factual client interaction I am sure Vanguard, Blackrock, Bernstein, UBS would be fine too.

I consider myself lucky to know Karen and Lewis Altfest and to be able to seek advice from their impressive staff. I am comfortable to say that I can place my utmost trust in their well researched approach to investing.







I've worked with Lew and Karen for the past 20 years.  They are recognized industry leaders who are as well respected as anyone in our industry.  Besides being extremely smart they are very personable with a focus on how to help the clients.  Their office is recognized year in and year out as being one of the best in the country.  As someone who works with advisors throughout the country and has a very visible firm, I highly recommend L.J. Altfest for their advice, integrity, and ability to translate complicated financial planning/investments into an understandable plan of action.







My wife and I have been clients of Altfest Personal Wealth Management for over 25 years. This firm has always put our financial health as their first priority. They have protected us and managed to preserve our retirement savings through the dot com and deep recession eras. When other advisers were being pressured by their clients to get them into dot com stocks, Altfests saw to it that we did not get into these risky investments.  Likewise, they had us hold tight in the recession and bought stocks when the market was very low.  Suffice it to say we have fared extremely well now that we are in our retirement years.
We have a well diversified portfolio that includes stocks, mutual funds, real estate funds, real estate and oil partnerships and municipal bonds. Also, it is important to note that they carefully balance your mutual fund investments so there is minimal overlap in investment sectors and minimum costs and fees for each fund.
The best thing about the Alfests is that they take a personal interest in each of their clients.  We are friends with a number of other clients who share this same experience.
As far as access is concerned, we have always found the firm ready to answer our questions and meet with us at a moments notice.
On a personal note, the Alfests are the most ethical people we have ever met.  They are also very philanthropic. Karen Altfest has received numerous awards for her charitable work including as one of the founders of the New York Pantry for the poor. They have also set up scholarship funds at Pace University and City College.
We recommend them with enthusiasm!!!







BAD FINANCIAL PLANNING, DETROYED PORTFOLIO, UNSUITABLE INVESTMENTS, UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT

1. Destroyed portfolio with over 1/3 value lost
2. Ignore client
3. Main owner, Lew,  lost temper when question as to why did he things the way he did them. That is Lew.(I don't know what a PHD in Finance from City College gets ya but not an ego that big) He does not like being questions about his decisions.

If you go with this outfit, do NOT, sign over full decision making rights to this financial firm.

4. Unsuitable investments and risk for a retirement person age
5. Promises of retirement planning, puts it off, then asks for big money. There is no way to properly invest without doing cash flow analysis or coordinating with other investments

6. Alleging that he takes a cookie cut approach and does not tailor things to the risk levels and ages of his clients or wealth level
7. Neglects small clients
8.  They changed their company's name from LJ Altfest. Lew and Karen are husband and wife. They have various underlyings their too. Their son worked their for a while. 
I hope he headed for greener pastures.

On the whole, I would say stay away. Do not sign his arbitration agreement it binds you to expensive arbitration. Make sure he writes out what he is going to do for how much money, who bears the cost of trading etc.

I would even venture to say you are better off with Fidelity so long as they came in at less than 1%.  This guy was no better than a petty broker and had a temperament of one to boot.  This is one person's opinion based on a factual client interaction

 I am sure Vanguard, Blackrock, Bernstein, UBS would be fine too.

Lewis taught me what I needed to know in financial planning. He brought his Pace University students to the firm's Park Avenue office to give a hands-on view of what was being taught in the classroom. His deep level of knowledge and in depth writings helped break down complex financial planning theories into easier to understand conversations and case studies. He's a wealth of knowledge.
