Philip Warren Anderson (born December 13, 1923) is an American physicist and Nobel laureate. Anderson has made contributions to the theories of localization, antiferromagnetism, symmetry breaking (including a seminal paper in 1962 discussing symmetry breaking in particle physics, leading to the development of the Standard Model around 10 years later), and high-temperature superconductivity, and to the philosophy of science through his writings on emergent phenomena.[3][4][5][6][7]

Education and early life[edit]
Anderson was born in Indianapolis, Indiana and grew up in Urbana, Illinois. He graduated from University Laboratory High School in Urbana in 1940. Afterwards, he went to Harvard University for undergraduate and graduate work, with a wartime stint at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in-between. In graduate school he studied under John Hasbrouck van Vleck.
Career and research[edit]
From 1949 to 1984 he was employed by Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, where he worked on a wide variety of problems in condensed matter physics. During this period he developed what is now called Anderson localization (the idea that extended states can be localized by the presence of disorder in a system); invented the Anderson Hamiltonian, which describes the site-wise interaction of electrons in a transition metal; proposed symmetry breaking within particle physics (this played a crucial role in the development of the Standard Model and the development of the theory behind the Higgs mechanism, which in turn generates mass in some elementary particles); created the pseudospin approach to the BCS theory of superconductivity; made seminal studies of non-s-wave pairing (both symmetry-breaking and microscopic mechanism) in the superfluidity of He3; and helped found the area of spin-glasses.[8][9][10][11][12][13][14] He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963.[15]
From 1967 to 1975, Anderson was a professor of theoretical physics at Cambridge University. In 1977 Anderson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his investigations into the electronic structure of magnetic and disordered systems, which allowed for the development of electronic switching and memory devices in computers. Co-researchers Sir Nevill Francis Mott and John van Vleck shared the award with him. In 1982, he was awarded the National Medal of Science. He retired from Bell Labs in 1984 and is currently Joseph Henry Professor of Physics, Emeritus at Princeton University.[16]
Anderson's writings include Concepts of Solids, Basic Notions of Condensed Matter Physics and The Theory of Superconductivity in the High-Tc Cuprates. Anderson currently serves on the board of advisors of Scientists and Engineers for America, an organization focused on promoting sound science in American government. He is a certified first degree-master of the Chinese board game Go.
Anderson has also made important conceptual contributions to the philosophy of science through his explication of emergent phenomena. In 1972 he wrote a now highly cited article called "More is Different" in which he emphasized the limitations of reductionism and the existence of hierarchical levels of science, each of which requires its own fundamental principles for advancement.[17]
A 2006 statistical analysis of scientific research papers by José Soler, comparing number of references in a paper to the number of citations, declared Anderson to be the "most creative" amongst ten most cited physicists in the world.[18]
Awards and honors[edit]
He was awarded the Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize in 1964, the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1977 and was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1980.[2] He was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1982.
Personal life[edit]
Anderson is an atheist[19] and was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto.[20]

Philip Warren Anderson (born December 13, 1923) is an American physicist and Nobel laureate. Anderson has made contributions to the theories of localization, antiferromagnetism, symmetry breaking (including a seminal paper in 1962 discussing symmetry breaking in particle physics, leading to the development of the Standard Model around 10 years later), and high-temperature superconductivity, and to the philosophy of science through his writings on emergent phenomena.[3][4][5][6][7]

Education and early life[edit]
Anderson was born in Indianapolis, Indiana and grew up in Urbana, Illinois. He graduated from University Laboratory High School in Urbana in 1940. Afterwards, he went to Harvard University for undergraduate and graduate work, with a wartime stint at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in-between. In graduate school he studied under John Hasbrouck van Vleck.
Career and research[edit]
From 1949 to 1984 he was employed by Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, where he worked on a wide variety of problems in condensed matter physics. During this period he developed what is now called Anderson localization (the idea that extended states can be localized by the presence of disorder in a system); invented the Anderson Hamiltonian, which describes the site-wise interaction of electrons in a transition metal; proposed symmetry breaking within particle physics (this played a crucial role in the development of the Standard Model and the development of the theory behind the Higgs mechanism, which in turn generates mass in some elementary particles); created the pseudospin approach to the BCS theory of superconductivity; made seminal studies of non-s-wave pairing (both symmetry-breaking and microscopic mechanism) in the superfluidity of He3; and helped found the area of spin-glasses.[8][9][10][11][12][13][14] He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963.[15]
From 1967 to 1975, Anderson was a professor of theoretical physics at Cambridge University. In 1977 Anderson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his investigations into the electronic structure of magnetic and disordered systems, which allowed for the development of electronic switching and memory devices in computers. Co-researchers Sir Nevill Francis Mott and John van Vleck shared the award with him. In 1982, he was awarded the National Medal of Science. He retired from Bell Labs in 1984 and is currently Joseph Henry Professor of Physics, Emeritus at Princeton University.[16]
Anderson's writings include Concepts of Solids, Basic Notions of Condensed Matter Physics and The Theory of Superconductivity in the High-Tc Cuprates. Anderson currently serves on the board of advisors of Scientists and Engineers for America, an organization focused on promoting sound science in American government. He is a certified first degree-master of the Chinese board game Go.
Anderson has also made important conceptual contributions to the philosophy of science through his explication of emergent phenomena. In 1972 he wrote a now highly cited article called "More is Different" in which he emphasized the limitations of reductionism and the existence of hierarchical levels of science, each of which requires its own fundamental principles for advancement.[17]
A 2006 statistical analysis of scientific research papers by José Soler, comparing number of references in a paper to the number of citations, declared Anderson to be the "most creative" amongst ten most cited physicists in the world.[18]
Awards and honors[edit]
He was awarded the Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize in 1964, the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1977 and was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1980.[2] He was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1982.
Personal life[edit]
Anderson is an atheist[19] and was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto.[20]

Philip Warren Anderson (born December 13, 1923) is an American physicist and Nobel laureate. Anderson has made contributions to the theories of localization, antiferromagnetism, symmetry breaking (including a seminal paper in 1962 discussing symmetry breaking in particle physics, leading to the development of the Standard Model around 10 years later), and high-temperature superconductivity, and to the philosophy of science through his writings on emergent phenomena.[3][4][5][6][7]

Education and early life[edit]
Anderson was born in Indianapolis, Indiana and grew up in Urbana, Illinois. He graduated from University Laboratory High School in Urbana in 1940. Afterwards, he went to Harvard University for undergraduate and graduate work, with a wartime stint at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in-between. In graduate school he studied under John Hasbrouck van Vleck.
Career and research[edit]
From 1949 to 1984 he was employed by Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, where he worked on a wide variety of problems in condensed matter physics. During this period he developed what is now called Anderson localization (the idea that extended states can be localized by the presence of disorder in a system); invented the Anderson Hamiltonian, which describes the site-wise interaction of electrons in a transition metal; proposed symmetry breaking within particle physics (this played a crucial role in the development of the Standard Model and the development of the theory behind the Higgs mechanism, which in turn generates mass in some elementary particles); created the pseudospin approach to the BCS theory of superconductivity; made seminal studies of non-s-wave pairing (both symmetry-breaking and microscopic mechanism) in the superfluidity of He3; and helped found the area of spin-glasses.[8][9][10][11][12][13][14] He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963.[15]
From 1967 to 1975, Anderson was a professor of theoretical physics at Cambridge University. In 1977 Anderson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his investigations into the electronic structure of magnetic and disordered systems, which allowed for the development of electronic switching and memory devices in computers. Co-researchers Sir Nevill Francis Mott and John van Vleck shared the award with him. In 1982, he was awarded the National Medal of Science. He retired from Bell Labs in 1984 and is currently Joseph Henry Professor of Physics, Emeritus at Princeton University.[16]
Anderson's writings include Concepts of Solids, Basic Notions of Condensed Matter Physics and The Theory of Superconductivity in the High-Tc Cuprates. Anderson currently serves on the board of advisors of Scientists and Engineers for America, an organization focused on promoting sound science in American government. He is a certified first degree-master of the Chinese board game Go.
Anderson has also made important conceptual contributions to the philosophy of science through his explication of emergent phenomena. In 1972 he wrote a now highly cited article called "More is Different" in which he emphasized the limitations of reductionism and the existence of hierarchical levels of science, each of which requires its own fundamental principles for advancement.[17]
A 2006 statistical analysis of scientific research papers by José Soler, comparing number of references in a paper to the number of citations, declared Anderson to be the "most creative" amongst ten most cited physicists in the world.[18]
Awards and honors[edit]
He was awarded the Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize in 1964, the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1977 and was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1980.[2] He was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1982.
Personal life[edit]
Anderson is an atheist[19] and was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto.[20]

Philip Warren Anderson (born December 13, 1923) is an American physicist and Nobel laureate. Anderson has made contributions to the theories of localization, antiferromagnetism, symmetry breaking (including a seminal paper in 1962 discussing symmetry breaking in particle physics, leading to the development of the Standard Model around 10 years later), and high-temperature superconductivity, and to the philosophy of science through his writings on emergent phenomena.[3][4][5][6][7]

Education and early life[edit]
Anderson was born in Indianapolis, Indiana and grew up in Urbana, Illinois. He graduated from University Laboratory High School in Urbana in 1940. Afterwards, he went to Harvard University for undergraduate and graduate work, with a wartime stint at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in-between. In graduate school he studied under John Hasbrouck van Vleck.
Career and research[edit]
From 1949 to 1984 he was employed by Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, where he worked on a wide variety of problems in condensed matter physics. During this period he developed what is now called Anderson localization (the idea that extended states can be localized by the presence of disorder in a system); invented the Anderson Hamiltonian, which describes the site-wise interaction of electrons in a transition metal; proposed symmetry breaking within particle physics (this played a crucial role in the development of the Standard Model and the development of the theory behind the Higgs mechanism, which in turn generates mass in some elementary particles); created the pseudospin approach to the BCS theory of superconductivity; made seminal studies of non-s-wave pairing (both symmetry-breaking and microscopic mechanism) in the superfluidity of He3; and helped found the area of spin-glasses.[8][9][10][11][12][13][14] He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963.[15]
From 1967 to 1975, Anderson was a professor of theoretical physics at Cambridge University. In 1977 Anderson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his investigations into the electronic structure of magnetic and disordered systems, which allowed for the development of electronic switching and memory devices in computers. Co-researchers Sir Nevill Francis Mott and John van Vleck shared the award with him. In 1982, he was awarded the National Medal of Science. He retired from Bell Labs in 1984 and is currently Joseph Henry Professor of Physics, Emeritus at Princeton University.[16]
Anderson's writings include Concepts of Solids, Basic Notions of Condensed Matter Physics and The Theory of Superconductivity in the High-Tc Cuprates. Anderson currently serves on the board of advisors of Scientists and Engineers for America, an organization focused on promoting sound science in American government. He is a certified first degree-master of the Chinese board game Go.
Anderson has also made important conceptual contributions to the philosophy of science through his explication of emergent phenomena. In 1972 he wrote a now highly cited article called "More is Different" in which he emphasized the limitations of reductionism and the existence of hierarchical levels of science, each of which requires its own fundamental principles for advancement.[17]
A 2006 statistical analysis of scientific research papers by José Soler, comparing number of references in a paper to the number of citations, declared Anderson to be the "most creative" amongst ten most cited physicists in the world.[18]
Awards and honors[edit]
He was awarded the Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize in 1964, the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1977 and was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1980.[2] He was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1982.
Personal life[edit]
Anderson is an atheist[19] and was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto.[20]

About Us
Healios Oncology Nutrition, LLC, is a Houston, Texas-based company that manufactures proprietary dietary supplements as an adjunctive nutritional support for cancer patients, dental patients, and others who are experiencing mucosal stress.
The company’s flagship product is Healios™ Glutamine Complex, a product designed to promote healthy mucosal tissues in patients receiving multiple therapies, including biological (for example which target the mTOR pathway), chemotherapy (for example doxorubicin and other agents known to cause mouth, throat or esophageal soreness), and radiation treatment (especially involving mouth, head, neck, and esophagus).
The benefits of supplementing one’s diet with the nutrients found in Healios™ has been clinically demonstrated in published scientific studies and the nutritional benefits of Healios™ are now being further studied at a world-class cancer hospital.
You can learn more about Healios as it relates to your requrements by by clicking on the menu options from the home page.

Who discovered Healios™ ?



Peter M. Anderson, MD, PhD
Peter M. Anderson, MD, PhD. who has served as a Professor, Department of Pediatrics Patient Care, Division of Pediatrics, Curtis Distinguished Professor, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX originally developed the science and patents that formed the foundation for Healios™. Dr. Anderson, is now a Staff Physician at the Cleveland Clinic.
Dr. Anderson discovered the benefits of supplementing the amino acid glutamine (a key ingredient in Healios™) as part of his cancer patients’ treatment to reduce the toxic side effects of therapy in the 1990’s. He was seeking to address the well-known side effects involving the mouth caused by cancer treatments. Biological regimens, chemotherapy, and radiation can have moderate or severe effects on the digestive tract where lost epithelial cells are not replaced at an adequate rate. The cumulative damage to the epithelial lining quickly leads to problems in mouth comfort and difficulty in swallowing, leading to decreased nutrient absorption and a pattern of diminished nutrition and increased damage.



How did Dr. Anderson discover the benefits of the Healios™ glutamine suspension for the treatment of cancer-related mucositis?

Dr. Anderson was able to find a way to greatly increase the absorption of glutamine by a factor of over 1,000 times by putting it in a suspension that would “feed the digestive lining” specifically in the mouth, throat, and esophagus. By combining glutamine with a blend of synergistic ingredients, he was able to achieve the desired effect, while still keeping the taste good and the suspension easy to use for patients. The concept was tested successfully in people with cancer in one pilot study and 3 larger randomized placebo, double-blind trials. The HEALIOS™ formula is an improved result of Dr. Anderson’s original research.



How did Healios™ Oncology Nutrition come together?

After years of patient testing and refining the formula, Dr. Anderson partnered with a team of top oncologists and a world-class nutraceutical company to achieve his dream of making Healios™ available to patients world-wide.  Dr. Anderson is on a mission to make Healios™ a part of the standard dietary regimen for those who need it, so that he can improve the lives of as many patients as possible.

Philip Anderson
Department/Program(s):
Physics
Position:  Professor Emeritus
Title: Joseph Henry Professor of Physics, Emeritus.  Senior Physicist.

Email: pwa@princeton.edu





I am a condensed matter theorist, a field in which I played the role  of a major agenda-setter for 40 or so years (in fact I believe a  colleague and I named the field in 1967 when we named our group in  Cambridge--before that it was "solid state theory"). On occasional  forays outside CMT I worked on pulsar glitches with David Pines and  invented the "Higgs" boson in 1962. Since 1987 I have worked in that  field almost exclusively on "High-Tc" superconductivity, a terribly  complex and controversial field in which my contributions have at least  the virtue of longevity. I became emeritus in 1997 at Princeton, where I  have been since 1975; but my longest association was with Bell Labs  1949-84.
I got into the Santa Fe Institute universe via the condensed matter  phenomenon of the "spin glass', which I named in 1970 and produced the  first theory with Sir Sam Edwards in 1975. Via work with Kirkpatrick and  palmer, and later Stein, we came to realise that this was an important  link between statistical physics and complex optimisation, and in the  latter guise it spawned algorithms(simulated annealing), work on  computational complexity, on neural nets (the Hopfield model etc), and  on evolution on rugged landscapes. This was part of the Santa Fe  Institute "toolkit" in the early days which for instance we showed off  to John Reed of Citicorp in 1986.
I also had developed an interest in economics via dilletantish  studies in Cambridge, and was glad to help organise the global economy  workshop in 1987, choosing a group of hard scientists to try to mesh  with Arrow's ten economists, apparently with some success. I retain a  watching interest in econ especially in pareto distributions on which I  have one article and lots of acknowledgements.
An older theme arose from my 1971 article "More is Different", which I  follow up by writing on topics in epistemology of science.
My earlier interests included Spectral Line Broadening, Magnetism,  Broken Symmetry, Superfluidity in 3He, Transport Theory and  Localization, Random Statistical Systems, and Prebiotic Evolution.



In 2009, I received an honorary degree from Tsinghua University in Beijing, China.  

Also in 2009, I received the Prange Award from the University of Maryland.
