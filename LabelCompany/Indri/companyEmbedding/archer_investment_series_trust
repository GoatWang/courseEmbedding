 1 ARCHER INVESTMENT SERIES TRUST ARCHER DIVIDEND GROWTH FUND Ticker Symbol ARDGX SUMMARY PROSPECTUS September 1, 2016 The Securities and Exchange Commission has not approved or disapproved these securities or determined if this prospectus is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.2 Table of Contents Fund Summary 1 Archer Dividend Growth Fund 1 Investment Objective 1 Fees and Expenses of Investing in the Fund 1 Portfolio Turnover 2 Principal Investment Strategies of the Fund 2 Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund 2 Past Performance 5 Management of the Fund 5 Portfolio Managers 63 FUND SUMMARY ARCHER DIVIDEND GROWTH FUND Investment Objective The Archer Dividend Growth Fund (the Fund ) seeks to provide income and, as a secondary focus, long-term capital appreciation. Fees and Expenses of Investing in the Fund This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the Fund. Shareholder Fees (fees paid directly from your investment) Redemption Fee (as a percentage of amount redeemed within 90 days of purchase) 1.00% Annual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment) Management Fee 0.75% Distribution and/or Service (12b-1) Fees None Other Expenses (1) 1.45% Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses 2.20% Fee Waiver and/or expenses reimbursement (2) (1.22%) Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses after Fee Waiver and/or Expense Reimbursement 0.98% 1 Expenses are based on estimated amounts for the Fund s current fiscal year. 2 The Advisor contractually has agreed to waive its management fee and/or reimburse certain Fund operating expenses, but only to the extent necessary so that the Fund s total operating expenses, excluding brokerage fees and commissions, any 12b-1 fees, borrowing costs (such as interest and dividend expenses on securities sold short), taxes, extraordinary expenses and any indirect expenses (such as Acquired Funds Fees and Expenses), do not exceed 0.98% of the Fund s average daily net assets. The contractual agreement is in place through December 31, Each waiver or reimbursement by the advisor is subject to repayment by the Fund within the three (3) fiscal years following the fiscal year in which the particular expense was incurred, provided that the current year s expense ratio is less than the prior year contractual expense cap that was in place when such prior year expenses were waived. The Management Services Agreement may, on sixty (60) days written notice, be terminated with respect to a Fund, at any time without the payment of any penalty, by the Board of Trustees or by a vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund, or by Management. The Management Services Agreement shall automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. The Expense Limitation Agreement may only be terminated by the Board of Trustees on sixty (60) days' written notice to Management or upon the termination of the Management Services Agreement between the Trust and Advisor. Example: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Archer Dividend Growth Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be: 14 1 YEAR 3 YEARS $100 $445 Portfolio Turnover The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or turns over its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Fund s performance. Because the Fund is new, it does not yet have portfolio turnover to report. Principal Investment Strategies of the Fund Under normal market conditions, the Fund seeks to achieve its objective to provide income and, as a secondary focus, long-term capital appreciation, by investing at least 80% of its net assets in equity securities of large-capitalization companies, primarily in dividend-paying equity securities, consisting of common stocks, preferred stocks and shares of beneficial interest of real estate investment trusts ("REITs"). These companies have market capitalizations in the range $500 million and up. The market capitalization range and composition of the companies in the Fund are subject to change. The Fund invests primarily in common stocks of companies that the investment manager believes have the potential to pay above-average, stable dividend and long-term, aboveaverage earnings growth. The Fund may from time to time emphasize one or more economic sectors in selecting its investments, including the consumer discretionary, health care, and information technology and technologyrelated sectors. The Fund may invest up to 30% of its total assets in foreign securities. The Fund may invest directly in foreign securities or indirectly through depositary receipts. The Fund may continue to own a security as long as the dividend or interest yields satisfy the Fund's objectives, and the Adviser believes the valuation is attractive and industry trends remain favorable. Once the Advisor believes a security does not meet the long-term objectives of the fund, it may sell the securities. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund The Archer Dividend Growth Fund is subject to management risk and the Fund may not achieve its objective if the Advisor s expectations regarding particular securities or interest rates are not met. An investment in this Fund or any other fund may not provide a complete investment program. The suitability of an investment in the Fund should be considered based on the investment objective, strategies and risks described in this prospectus, considered in light of all of the other investments in your portfolio, as well as your risk tolerance, financial goals and time horizons. You may want to consult with a financial advisor to determine if this Fund is suitable for you. Investors in the Fund should have a long-term perspective and, for example, be able to tolerate potentially sharp declines in value. The prices of securities held by the Fund may decline in response to certain events taking place around the world, including those directly involving the companies whose securities are owned by the Fund; conditions affecting the general economy; overall market changes; local, regional or global political, social or economic 25 instability; and currency, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations. The common stock and other equity type securities purchased by the Fund may involve large price swings and potential for loss. Investments in securities issued by entities based outside the United States may also be affected by currency controls; different accounting, auditing, financial reporting, and legal standards and practices; expropriation; changes in tax policy; greater market volatility; differing securities market structures; higher transaction costs; and various administrative difficulties, such as delays in clearing and settling portfolio transactions or in receiving payment of dividends. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets. Investments in securities issued by entities domiciled in the United States may also be subject to many of these risks. Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, entity or person. You may lose money by investing in the Fund. The Fund s performance could be hurt by: Active Management Risk. Due to its active management, the Fund s performance could underperform its benchmark index and/or other funds with similar investment objectives. Market Risk of Equity Securities. By investing in stocks, the Fund may expose you to a sudden decline in the share price of a particular portfolio holding or to an overall decline in the stock market. In addition, the Fund's principal market segment may underperform other segments or the market as a whole. The value of your investment in the Fund will fluctuate daily and cyclically based on movements in the stock market and the activities of individual companies in the Fund's portfolio. Common stocks are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations and to volatile increases and decreases in value as market confidence in and perceptions of their issuers change. Preferred stock is subject to the risk that the dividend on the stock may be changed or omitted by the issuer, and that participation in the growth of the issuer may be limited. Preferred stock typically has "preference" over common stock in the payment of distributions and the liquidation of a company's assets, but is subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments. In addition, preferred stock holders generally do not have voting rights with respect to the issuing company. Issuer Risk. An issuer in which the Fund invests or to which it has exposure may perform poorly, and the value of its securities may therefore decline, which would negatively affect the Fund s performance. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, breakthroughs in technology, reliance on suppliers, labor problems or shortages, corporate restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, natural disasters or other events, conditions or factors. Real Estate Risk. To the extent the Fund invests in REITs, it is subject to risks generally associated with investing in real estate, such as (i) possible declines in the value of real estate, (ii) adverse general and local economic conditions, (iii) possible lack of availability of mortgage funds, (iv) changes in interest rates, and (v) environmental problems. In addition, REITs are subject to certain other risks related specifically to their structure and focus such as: dependency upon management skills; limited diversification; the risks of locating and managing financing for projects; heavy cash flow dependency; possible default by borrowers; the costs and potential losses of self-liquidation of one or more holdings; the possibility of failing to maintain exemptions from securities registration; and, in many cases, relatively small market capitalization, which may result in less market liquidity and greater price volatility. Depositary Receipts Risk. Depositary receipts are receipts issued by a bank or trust company reflecting ownership of underlying securities issued by foreign companies. Some foreign securities are traded in the form 36 of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). Depositary receipts involve risks similar to the risks associated with investments in foreign securities, including those associated with investing in the particular country of an issuer, which may be related to the particular political, regulatory, economic, social and other conditions or events occurring in the country and fluctuations in its currency, as well as market risk tied to the underlying foreign company. In addition, ADR holders may have limited voting rights, may not have the same rights afforded typical company stockholders in the event of a corporate action such as an acquisition, merger or rights offering and may experience difficulty in receiving company stockholder communications. Foreign Securities Risk. Investments in or exposure to foreign securities involve certain risks not associated with investments in or exposure to securities of U.S. companies. Foreign securities subject the Fund to the risks associated with investing in the particular country of an issuer, including the political, regulatory, economic, social, diplomatic and other conditions or events occurring in the country or region, as well as risks associated with less developed custody and settlement practices. Foreign securities may be more volatile and less liquid than securities of U.S. companies, and are subject to the risks associated with potential imposition of economic and other sanctions against a particular foreign country, its nationals or industries or businesses within the country. In addition, foreign governments may impose withholding or other taxes on the Fund s income, capital gains or proceeds from the disposition of foreign securities, which could reduce the Fund s return on such securities. The performance of the Fund may also be negatively impacted by fluctuations in a foreign currency s strength or weakness relative to the U.S. dollar, particularly to the extent the Fund invests a significant percentage of its assets in foreign securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Growth Securities Risk. Growth securities typically trade at a higher multiple of earnings than other types of equity securities. Accordingly, the market values of growth securities may never reach their expected market value and may decline in price. In addition, growth securities, at times, may not perform as well as value securities or the stock market in general, and may be out of favor with investors for varying periods of time. Sector Emphasis. At times, the Fund may have a significant portion of its assets invested in securities of companies conducting business in a related group of industries within an economic sector, including the consumer discretionary, health care, and information technology and technology-related sectors. Companies in the same economic sector may be similarly affected by economic, regulatory, political or market events or conditions, which may make the Fund more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in that economic sector than funds that invest more broadly. Generally, the more broadly the Fund invests, the more it spreads risk and potentially reduces the risks of loss and volatility. The Fund may be more susceptible to the particular risks that may affect companies in the consumer discretionary sector than if it were invested in a wider variety of companies in unrelated sectors. Companies in the consumer discretionary sector are subject to certain risks, including fluctuations in the performance of the overall domestic and international economy, interest rate changes, increased competition and consumer confidence. Performance of such companies may be affected by factors including reduced disposable household income, reduced consumer spending, changing demographics and consumer tastes. The Fund may be more susceptible to the particular risks that may affect companies in the health care sector than if it were invested in a wider variety of companies in unrelated sectors. Companies in the health care sector are subject to certain risks, including restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, government approval of medical products and services, competitive pricing pressures, and the rising cost of medical products and services (especially for companies dependent upon a relatively limited number of products or services). Performance of such companies may be affected by factors including, government regulation, obtaining and protecting patents (or the failure to do so), product liability and other similar litigation as well as product obsolescence. 47 The Fund may be more susceptible to the particular risks that may affect companies in the information technology sector, as well as other technology-related sectors (collectively, the technology sectors) than if it were invested in a wider variety of companies in unrelated sectors. Companies in the technology sectors are subject to certain risks, including the risk that new services, equipment or technologies will not be accepted by consumers and businesses or will become rapidly obsolete. Performance of such companies may be affected by factors including obtaining and protecting patents (or the failure to do so) and significant competitive pressures, including aggressive pricing of their products or services, new market entrants, competition for market share and short product cycles due to an accelerated rate of technological developments. Such competitive pressures may lead to limited earnings and/or falling profit margins. As a result, the value of their securities may fall or fail to rise. In addition, many technology sector companies have limited operating histories and prices of these companies securities historically have been more volatile than other securities, especially over the short term. Cybersecurity Risk. Cybersecurity incidents may allow an unauthorized party to gain access to fund assets, customer data (including private shareholder information), or proprietary information, or cause the fund, the manager, any subadviser and/or its service providers (including, but not limited to, fund accountants, custodians, sub-custodians, transfer agents and financial intermediaries) to suffer data breaches, data corruption or lose operational functionality. Dividend Tax Treatment. There may be a significant change in legislation or policy affecting taxation on dividends, which may affect the performance of the Fund. Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund s investment strategy may result in a high portfolio turnover rate. High portfolio turnover would result in correspondingly greater brokerage commission expenses and may result in the distribution to shareholders of additional capital gains for tax purposes. These factors may negatively affect the Fund s performance. Past Performance Performance information is not available at this time because the Fund has not yet commenced operations as of the date of this Prospectus and therefore has less than a full calendar year of investment operations. In the future the Fund will include a bar chart and table which will include such information that will provide some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing the variability of performance and by comparing the Fund's performance to a broad measure of market performance. Remember, the Fund s past performance, before and after taxes, when such is provided is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future. Updated performance information will be available on the Fund s website at  or by calling the Fund toll-free at Management of the Fund Archer Investment Corporation serves as the Investment Advisor of the Fund under the terms of an Management Services Agreement with the Fund. Advisory Fees As the investment adviser, the firm oversees the asset management of the Fund. As compensation for these services, the firm receives a management fee which is paid monthly of 0.75% of the Fund s average daily net assets. 58 The Advisor has contractually agreed to waive and/or reimburse fees and/or expenses in order to limit the Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses After Fee Waivers and/or Expense Reimbursements (excluding any frontend or contingent deferred loads, any Rule 12b-1 fees, taxes, leverage, interest, brokerage commissions, expenses incurred in connection with any merger or reorganization, or extraordinary expenses such as litigation) as a percentage of daily net assets to 0.98% until December 31, 2018 (the contractual expense limitation agreement ). The Fund may have to repay some of these waivers and/or reimbursements to the Archer Investment Corporation in the following three (3) years provided that the current year s expense ratio is less than the prior year contractual expense cap that was in place when such prior year expenses were waived. The contractual expense limitation agreement may be terminated upon sixty (60) days written notice to the Advisor and will terminate automatically upon the termination of the Management Services Agreement. The Advisor may not terminate this agreement without the consent of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. The Fund s Advisor (not the Fund) may pay certain financial institutions (which may include banks, brokers, securities dealers and other industry professionals) a fee for providing distribution related services for the Fund s shareholders to the extent these institutions are allowed to do so by applicable statute, rule or regulation. A discussion regarding the basis of the Board of Trustees approval of the management agreement with Archer will be available in the Fund s annual Report for the fiscal period ending August 31, Portfolio Managers Investment Professional Troy C.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we‚Äôll set up your first campaign for you for free. We‚Äôll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We‚Äôre here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
