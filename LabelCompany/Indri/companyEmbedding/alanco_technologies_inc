Introduction

Alanco Technologies, Inc. (“Alanco” or the “Company”) recognizes and respects  that it has a responsibility to its stockholders for the stewardship of Company  assets and resources.  Alanco is  committed to compliance with the laws and regulations to which it is subject,  and to establishing Company policies and procedures to interpret and apply  those laws and regulations within all of its operations.  The Company's system of internal controls and  operating procedures are intended to detect and to prevent or deter improper or  illegal activities.  To insure a safe and  confidential environment and to comply with the terms of the Sarbanes-Oxley  Act, Alanco has established this Whistleblower Protection Policy (the “Policy”)  to assist in the reporting of any improper financial procedures. 

                              It is Alanco's policy to support and encourage its employees to report and  disclose improper or illegal activities, and to fully investigate such reports  and disclosures.  It is also Alanco's  policy to address any complaints that allege acts or attempted acts of  interference, reprisal, retaliation, threats, coercion or intimidation against  employees who report, disclose or investigate improper or illegal activities  and to protect those who come forward to report such activities.

                              This Policy governs the reporting and investigation of improper or illegal  activities at Alanco, as well as the protection afforded to those Alanco  employees who report them (the “Whistleblowers”).  This Policy DOES NOT apply to or change the  Company's policies and procedures for individual employee grievances or  complaints relating to job performance, terms and conditions of employment or  sexual harassment which will continue to be administered and reviewed by  Alanco's Human Resources Department.  

                              Reporting Improper or Illegal Activities

                              To provide an easily accessible, anonymous process whereby persons can report  complaints or concerns of improper or illegal activities relating to financial  impropriety of the Company without threat of retaliation, Alanco has  established the following alternatives.   Individuals are welcome to self identify, but it is not a requirement of  the policy, and the process is designed to be highly confidential. 


Call 480-948-3118.   This hotline is forwarded directly to an independent member of Alanco’s  Audit/Corporate Governance Committee, Tom LaVoy, at his place of employment.


Send an e-mail directly to Mr. LaVoy at tlavoy@isoray.com.  For ease of identification, please mark the  e-mail subject as “Alanco Whistleblower.”


Report to Mr. LaVoy via mail sent to:



Alanco Whistleblower
                                      c/o  IsoRay, Tom LaVoy
                                      350 Hills Street, Suite 106
                                      Richland, WA 99354-5411






Reports should be factual rather than speculative or conclusory, and contain as  much specific information as possible to allow for proper assessment and  urgency of investigative procedures.  The  motivation of a whistleblower in making a report is irrelevant to the  consideration of the validity of the allegations.  However, the intentional filing of a false  report is itself considered an improper activity that the Company has the right  to act upon.

                              To the extent possible within the limitations of law and policy and the need to  conduct a competent investigation, confidentiality of whistleblowers will be  maintained.  Whistleblowers who chose to  identify themselves are cautioned that their identity may become known for  reasons outside of the control of the investigators.  Similarly, the identity of the subject(s) of  the investigation will be maintained in confidence with the same limitations.

  




Roles, Rights, Responsibilities and Protection of Whistleblowers

1.    Compliance with laws, rules and regulations
All employees and directors  must respect and obey all laws that apply to our business, including state and  local laws in the areas in which the Company operates.  Any questions as to the applicability of any  law should be directed to the Company’s General Counsel. 
If a law conflicts with a  policy in this Code, employees and directors must comply with the law.  If a local custom or policy conflicts with a  policy in the Code, employees and directors must comply with the Code. 
2.    Insider trading
The Company has a securities  trading policy and all employees and directors must abide by its terms.  This policy, among other things, provides  that employees and directors may not buy or sell shares of the Company when  they are in possession of material, non-public information.  They also are prohibited from passing on such  information to others who might make an investment decision based on it. 
Employees and directors also  may not trade in stocks of other companies about which they learn material,  non-public information through the course of their employment or service.  Any questions as to whether information is  material or has been adequately disclosed should be directed to the Company’s  General Counsel. 
3.    Conflicts of interest
A conflict of interest occurs  when the private interest of an employee or director interferes or appears to  interfere in any way with the interests of the Company.  Conflicts of interest can occur when an  employee or director takes action or has interests that could reasonably be  expected to make it difficult to make objective decisions on behalf of the  Company or to perform his or her duties effectively.  Conflicts of interest also arise when an  employee or director, or a member of his or her family, receives improper  personal benefits as a result of his or her position with the Company.  An employee or director will not be deemed to  have a conflict of interest solely on the basis of his service on the board of  directors of a company, or other involvement with a company that is under  common ownership, or has a business relationship, with the Company, provided  such relationship or involvement is fully disclosed to the Company. 
Conflicts of interest are  prohibited as a matter of corporate policy, unless such conflicts are fully  disclosed to the Company’s Board of Directors, and if a director has the  potential conflict, such director does not vote on any matter related to the  potential conflict.  Any employee or  director who becomes aware of a conflict or potential conflict, or who has a  question about whether a conflict exists, should bring it to the attention of  the Company’s General Counsel or the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. 
4.    Corporate opportunities
Employees and directors are  prohibited from taking for themselves personally any opportunities that arise  through the use of corporate property, information or position and from using  corporate property, information or position for personal gain.  Employees and directors are further  prohibited from competing with the Company directly or indirectly.  Employees and directors owe a duty to the  Company to advance its legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so  arises. 
5.    Confidentiality
Employees and directors may  learn information about the Company that is not known to the general public or  to competitors. Confidential information includes all non-public information  that might be of use to competitors, or harmful to the Company or its customers  if disclosed, or information that associates of the Company have entrusted to  it. 
Employees and directors must  maintain the confidentiality of information entrusted to them by the Company or  its associates, except when disclosure is authorized or legally mandated.  This obligation to protect confidential  information does not end when an employee or director leaves the Company.  Any questions about whether information is  confidential should be directed to the Company’s General Counsel. 
6.    Fair dealing
Each employee and director  shall endeavor to deal fairly with the Company’s shareholders, competitors,  suppliers and employees.  No employee or  director shall take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation,  concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material  facts, or any other unfair practice. 
7.    Protection and proper use of Company assets
Theft, carelessness and waste  have a direct impact on the Company’s profitability.  Employees and directors have a duty to  safeguard Company assets and ensure their efficient use.  Company assets should be used only for  legitimate business purposes, and employees and directors should take measures  to ensure against their theft, damage, or misuse. 
Company assets include  intellectual property such as trademarks, business and marketing plans, salary  information and any unpublished financial data and reports.  Unauthorized use or distribution of this  information is a violation of Company policy. 
8.    Recordkeeping
All of the Company’s books,  records, accounts and financial statements must be maintained in reasonable  detail, must appropriately reflect the matters to which they relate and must  conform both to applicable legal requirements and to the Company’s system of  internal controls.  All assets of the  Company must be carefully and properly accounted for.  The making of false or misleading records or  documentation is strictly prohibited. 
The Company complies with all  laws and regulations regarding the preservation of records.  Records should be retained or destroyed only  in accordance with the Company’s document retention policies.  Any questions about these policies should be  directed to the Company’s General Counsel. 
9.    Interaction with public officials
When dealing with public  officials, employees and directors must avoid any activity that is or appears  illegal or unethical.  The giving of  gifts, including meals, entertainment, transportation, and lodging, to government  officials in the various branches of U.S. government, as well as state  and local governments, is restricted by law.   Employees and directors must obtain pre-approval from the Company’s  General Counsel before providing anything of value to a government official or  employee.  The foregoing does not apply  to personal lawful political contributions. 
In addition, the U.S. Foreign  Corrupt Practices Act prohibits giving anything of value, directly or  indirectly, to officials of foreign governments or foreign political candidates  in order to obtain or retain business.   Illegal payments to government officials of any country are strictly  prohibited.

          Alanco's TSI PRISM� Wins Ohio RFP

Pilot Installation at Ohio�s Ross Correctional Facility
          To Demonstrate New Inmate Management & Officer Safety System



          (Scottsdale, AZ - June 7, 2004) - Alanco Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALAN) 
announced today that 
          it was selected by the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and 
          Correction (ODRH) to provide its 
TSI PRISM 
          RFID inmate tracking and officer safety system for a pilot project at 
          the Ross Correctional Facility in Chillicothe, Ohio.  ODRH currently 
          operates thirty-three adult facilities collectively housing 
          approximately 44,000 inmates, and the 
TSI PRISM 
          technology will be evaluated for potential application throughout the 
          Ohio prison system.  The final contract award is subject to approval 
          by the Ohio Controlling Board, which is expected in the near future. 
          

Alanco Chairman and CEO, Robert R. Kauffman, said, �The 
          Ross pilot project represents a significant milestone toward 
          penetration of the large potential Ohio market for our RFID tracking 
          technology.  We look forward to this opportunity to establish 
TSI PRISM 
          as a new standard for inmate management and officer safety in the Ohio 
          prison system.�
Alanco
          Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALAN),
          headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, is the developer of the TSI
          PRISM RFID 
continuous tracking system for the corrections 
          industry, which tracks the location and movement of inmates and 
          officers, resulting in significant prison operating cost reductions 
          and dramatically enhanced officer safety and facility security.  
          Utilizing RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tracking technology 
          with proprietary software and patented hardware components, 
TSI PRISM 
          provides real-time inmate and officer identification, location and 
          tracking capabilities both indoors and out.  The 

TSI PRISM
system is currently utilized in prisons in Michigan, California 
          and Illinois.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Alanco Technologies, Inc. Company Profile

   Having failed to strike gold and feeling lost, Alanco Technologies is looking for a new business venture. The company once made pollution control systems, owned gold mines, and made unsuccessful forays into both the data storage and restaurant fryer businesses. It also made radio-frequency ID (RFID) tracking devices for correctional facilities through its TSI PRISM subsidiary until that line of business was sold in 2010 to Alabama-based Black Creek Integrated Systems for about $2 million in cash. Alanco then offered subscription-based GPS tracking data services for the refrigerated transport industry through StarTrak Systems (acquired for $15 million in 2006), but sold that business to ORBCOMM in 2011.

Alanco Technologies, Inc. Revenue and Financial Data

   Having failed to strike gold and feeling lost, Alanco Technologies is looking for a new business venture. The company once made pollution control systems, owned gold mines, and made unsuccessful forays into both the data storage and restaurant fryer businesses. It also made radio-frequency ID (RFID) tracking devices for correctional facilities through its TSI PRISM subsidiary until that line of business was sold in 2010 to Alabama-based Black Creek Integrated Systems for about $2 million in cash. Alanco then offered subscription-based GPS tracking data services for the refrigerated transport industry through StarTrak Systems (acquired for $15 million in 2006), but sold that business to ORBCOMM in 2011.
