Answer:

The best way to determine how much solar you need is to have the solar installer get up on you roof to evaluate it prior to providing you with a solar proposal. The size of the solar system is determined by your roof size, pitch and shading issues as well as the annual kilowatt (kW) usage for each individual home. You and your neighbor could have the exact same size home but entirely different electric usage habits and would each require a different sized system to offset your usage. An average size installation in the Bay Area is between...

Warranty
 
Clean Solar believes that long term relationships are the cornerstone of our business and we work hard to exceed our customer’s expectations. We go to great lengths to prevent problems from occurring with your solar power system.

The Longest Full Solar Warranty in the Industry

Clean Solar guarantees all workmanship and installation for 15 years – 5 years more than most other companies in the industry.
The 15 year full warranty includes parts and labor associated with replacing or repairing your system as well as all penetrations that we make to your roof. The 15 year term begins on the date of installation listed on the signed contract.
This 15 year warranty includes the entire portion of your roof that we cover with solar panels. Clean Solar installs extra flashings and the recommended urethane caulking to guarantee a clean and leak free installation.  Our competitors offer a limited one year warranty on your roof.
Leased solar systems are for the term of the lease agreement.

Solar Panel 25 Year Warranty
Clean Solar only uses the highest quality solar panels from the world’s leading solar panel manufacturers. Most of our photovoltaic panel manufacturers offer warranties of a very similar nature, guaranteeing energy production from their panels for 25 years . This is standard in the solar industry. If your solar panels malfunction or degrade past the normal variance, Clean Solar will replace the panel(s) for you.

As utility rates climb, the cost to install a solar panel system continues to fall, down 50% since 2007 alone. Even as costs fall, solar power remains a significant investment for any homeowner. To make things easier, we'll help you decide if solar is right for you by answering some frequently asked questions:  How much will I save on utility bills? How do I choose the right system? How do I select a provider?  1. How much will I save on utility bills? Solar protects you against rising utility rates, hidden fees, and surprise hikes in your electric bill. Savings quickly add up to thousands of dollars over the life of your system.   Your total savings depend on how high your electric rates are, how much sunshine you receive, and financial incentives like federal, state, and local tax credits. Even with those variables, the average U.S. homeowner could save $84 per month over their current electric bill. In some states, savings can top $150 per month.1 Over 20 years, savings can reach $20,000 or more.  Get an instant estimate         2. How do I choose the right system? It's important to find an experienced professional who can customize a system to your home's requirements. Here's what your installer will look for:   How much power do you need? Check your electric bills to determine how many kilowatts you use on an average day. Multiply that by .25 to find out how big your system should be. A typical system generates 5 kW per day, but your home may need less or more.   What's your climate?  The number of panels you need depends on how much solar radiation reaches the ground at your location in a given period of time. This is called insolation.   How much direct sun does your home get? In general, you'll need 100 square feet of south facing roof (or yard) space for every kilowatt of power your system generates, avoiding shadows from trees, chimneys or taller buildings.   3. How do I select a provider? Here are a few things to consider when choosing a solar professional:   Experience Be sure to find out how long the installer has been in business. An installer recommended by a national solar company will typically be around for the long haul, while smaller installers may come and go.    Reference Consider getting recent customer references. Check with the Better Business Bureau to make sure that no complaints have been filed, and look at customer reviews on websites like Angie's List and Yelp.   Credentials The installer should be licensed, bonded and insured. You can also ask about certification through the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners or completion of training programs accredited by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council.   Partnerships Look for installers who partner with brands you know, like national home improvement chains or warehouse clubs. That's usually a good sign that the company is a safe bet.    Warranty Look for an installer that offers warranties for your roof and other critical parts of your system, like the inverter. Ask if they guarantee system production.           Why Choose Sunrun?  Sunrun has over 18 years of quality solar installation experience, and builds a new solar power system every 10 minutes. We invented the solar lease as an affordable way to go solar, and install more than $2 million of solar every day.

Beamreach Solar (known as Solexel for the last nine years) has a new lightweight photovoltaic module, a new CEO, and a new business plan to go along with its new name and the $240 million in venture capital it has spent so far.

The first time the company unstealthed in 2012, it was focusing on its thin-silicon technology and looking to mass-produce 35-micron-thick high-performance, low-cost monocrystalline solar cells using a lift-off technology based on a reusable template and a porous silicon substrate. The startup hit an NREL-certified cell efficiency of 21.2 percent in 2014 with its back contact cell.

	Solexel aimed to ship 20-percent-efficient photovoltaic modules at a cost of $0.42 per watt by 2014.

	That didn't happen.

	The newly christened Beamreach is still a PV cell manufacturer, but the company's initial product is a bit of a pivot. It's going after the (almost-a-cliché-by-now) "underserved" commercial and industrial rooftop market with a lightweight, easy-to-install module. We spoke with the company in advance of its product unveiling at Intersolar Europe this week.

	Mark Kerstens, newly promoted to the role of CEO at Beamreach, told GTM the system "is much lighter than...a conventional system, thanks to the use of thinner front sheet glass (2 mm instead of more commonly used 3.2 mm), the use of a composite material for the frame and the integrated mounting structure...and, most importantly, the adhesion method to the low-slope commercial rooftop surface. As a result, there is no need for the use of heavy ballast (pavers, patio blocks, etc.)...or roof penetrations."

	Kerstens added, "This light weight can be achieved both with third-party-sourced cells (such as the front-contact PERC cells that we’re using in the product that we’re planning to start shipping in 3Q16), as well as with our proprietary back-contact monocrystalline silicon cells."

	He noted, "The Beamreach product uses four diodes instead of the more commonly used three-diode configuration. The two bottom rows of the panel are each on their own diode -- this reduces the impact of row-to-row shading. We anticipate deploying intra-module electronics in products that are targeting the residential market (e.g., building-integrated solar tiles and shingles) in 2017."



	Going commercial, addressing soft costs

	Beamreach's module economics and performance goals might have been convincing in 2007, but today, when First Solar, the thin-film solar leader, has manufacturing lines in Malaysia producing panels below $0.40 per watt at more than 16 percent efficiency, Beamreach needs to differentiate, rather than take on FSLR, China Module Inc. or SunPower head-on.

	Can light weight make the difference in commercial solar?

	The startup claims that up to 40 percent of today’s commercial roofs cannot support conventional PV panels, "resulting in a massive untapped commercial market for solar power."

	A report from the Photovoltaic Manufacturing Consortium backs that up: "In 4 selected sub-segments, over 339 million sq. ft. of commercial building roof space in New York state is potentially limited to < 3 psf of additional load. [...] Over 195 million is limited to < 2 psf [of additional load]."

	Certainly, the commercial market is finally ready to grow. In the recently published report U.S. Commercial Solar Landscape 2016-2020, GTM Research forecasts the U.S. commercial solar market to "rebound and nearly triple in size by 2020. This growth will be driven by the extension of the federal Investment Tax Credit, the growing adoption of solar among national corporations, the increasing availability of financing for small commercial systems, and an expanding market for community solar."

	And rather than take on commodity modules, Beamreach addresses a bigger cost-reduction target: soft costs. Kerstens notes that the installation requires "no tools and no grounding," with the promise of lower labor costs and savings on wire management, grounding, design and shipping.

	Kerstens also claims that install time is five times faster than with a conventional system. He said, "No one has seen anything like it," adding, "Labor cost is reduced dramatically."

	Here's a video that compares installation time of Beamreach modules to conventional racking.



	When Beamreach was a thin-silicon or high-efficiency player, it might have been competing against SunPower, Silevo, Suniva, Tetrasun, 1366 Technologies, or Crystal Solar. But with this shift, Beamreach looks a bit like tenKsolar, which offers high-efficiency photovoltaic systems for commercial rooftops, carports and ground-mount projects, or SunPower with its integrated solution.

	Scott Moskowitz, ace solar balance-of-system analyst with GTM Research, had this to say: "The Sprint solution is differentiated by its weight characteristics, but Beamreach is additionally part of a larger trend to integrate PV modules and racking for the purpose of accelerating installation and lowering overall system cost. We've seen integrated commercial rooftop systems from Zep Solar, which pioneered the use of integrated racking, as well as SunPower (an early investor in Solexel), whose Helix solution similarly enables a tool-free installation."

	He continued, "Though load constraint is certainly a factor for many customers and Beamreach may enable installations on additional rooftops, it is not clear how often load is the primary bottleneck for commercial installations. Customers with load constraints, age concerns or spatial constraints typically look to ground mounts or carports as alternatives. Carports in particular are typically built when no other suitable solution is available, and these systems typically make up 12 percent to 15 percent of commercial system installations in the United States in any given year."

	Beamreach has raised more than $240 million from investors including Riyadh Valley Company, the VC investment arm of King Saud University of Saudi Arabia, and GAF, a large roofing materials manufacturer, along with SunPower, KPCB, Technology Partners, The Westly Group, DAG Ventures, Gentry Ventures, Northgate Capital, GSV Capital, Jasper Ridge Partners, and Spirox. The firm's board of directors includes Ira Ehrenpreis of Technology Partners, Les Vadasz, and Jan van Dokkum of KPCB.

The size of the solar system is determined by your roof size, pitch and shading issues as well as the annual kilowatt (kW) usage for each individual home. You and your neighbor could have the exact same size home but entirely different electric usage habits and would each require a different sized system to offset your usage.

Warranty
 
Clean Solar believes that long term relationships are the cornerstone of our business and we work hard to exceed our customer’s expectations. We go to great lengths to prevent problems from occurring with your solar power system.

The Longest Full Solar Warranty in the Industry

Clean Solar guarantees all workmanship and installation for 15 years – 5 years more than most other companies in the industry.
The 15 year full warranty includes parts and labor associated with replacing or repairing your system as well as all penetrations that we make to your roof. The 15 year term begins on the date of installation listed on the signed contract.
This 15 year warranty includes the entire portion of your roof that we cover with solar panels. Clean Solar installs extra flashings and the recommended urethane caulking to guarantee a clean and leak free installation.  Our competitors offer a limited one year warranty on your roof.
Leased solar systems are for the term of the lease agreement.

Solar Panel 25 Year Warranty
Clean Solar only uses the highest quality solar panels from the world’s leading solar panel manufacturers. Most of our photovoltaic panel manufacturers offer warranties of a very similar nature, guaranteeing energy production from their panels for 25 years . This is standard in the solar industry. If your solar panels malfunction or degrade past the normal variance, Clean Solar will replace the panel(s) for you.

As utility rates climb, the cost to install a solar panel system continues to fall, down 50% since 2007 alone. Even as costs fall, solar power remains a significant investment for any homeowner. To make things easier, we'll help you decide if solar is right for you by answering some frequently asked questions:  How much will I save on utility bills? How do I choose the right system? How do I select a provider?  1. How much will I save on utility bills? Solar protects you against rising utility rates, hidden fees, and surprise hikes in your electric bill. Savings quickly add up to thousands of dollars over the life of your system.   Your total savings depend on how high your electric rates are, how much sunshine you receive, and financial incentives like federal, state, and local tax credits. Even with those variables, the average U.S. homeowner could save $84 per month over their current electric bill. In some states, savings can top $150 per month.1 Over 20 years, savings can reach $20,000 or more.  Get an instant estimate         2. How do I choose the right system? It's important to find an experienced professional who can customize a system to your home's requirements. Here's what your installer will look for:   How much power do you need? Check your electric bills to determine how many kilowatts you use on an average day. Multiply that by .25 to find out how big your system should be. A typical system generates 5 kW per day, but your home may need less or more.   What's your climate?  The number of panels you need depends on how much solar radiation reaches the ground at your location in a given period of time. This is called insolation.   How much direct sun does your home get? In general, you'll need 100 square feet of south facing roof (or yard) space for every kilowatt of power your system generates, avoiding shadows from trees, chimneys or taller buildings.   3. How do I select a provider? Here are a few things to consider when choosing a solar professional:   Experience Be sure to find out how long the installer has been in business. An installer recommended by a national solar company will typically be around for the long haul, while smaller installers may come and go.    Reference Consider getting recent customer references. Check with the Better Business Bureau to make sure that no complaints have been filed, and look at customer reviews on websites like Angie's List and Yelp.   Credentials The installer should be licensed, bonded and insured. You can also ask about certification through the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners or completion of training programs accredited by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council.   Partnerships Look for installers who partner with brands you know, like national home improvement chains or warehouse clubs. That's usually a good sign that the company is a safe bet.    Warranty Look for an installer that offers warranties for your roof and other critical parts of your system, like the inverter. Ask if they guarantee system production.           Why Choose Sunrun?  Sunrun has over 18 years of quality solar installation experience, and builds a new solar power system every 10 minutes. We invented the solar lease as an affordable way to go solar, and install more than $2 million of solar every day.

Best brands of solar panels
To find the best brands of solar panels you can use America's most trusterd solar panel comparison and reviews website, SolarReviews.
However, reviews of solar panels can be a bit meaningless because most consumer owners have not had any issues and so whilst solar company reviews are very important when choosing solar installers they are of less use when choosing solar panels.
For more information to help you make an informed decision about this topic, I would recommend this article about buying solar panels.

How much electricity will solar panels produce in California
Solar panels produce different amounts of energy in different locations.
Around the Sacramento area solar panels installed on a south facing 29 degree pitch roof will typically produce:
1,550 kWh per year per 1kw of peak DC (direct current) capacity
For more information about how your location, roof direction and roof tilt affects solar power production use the solar panels calculator and enter your address below.









What rebates, solar tax credits and other solar incentives are available in California
What solar incentives and tax credits are available in California?
The main incentives to install solar in California is the 30% federal solar tax credit and the net metering law.
The upfront utility based incentives from each of the main publically owned utilities are now exhausted for residential customers and almost exhausted for commercial customers.
However, the investment case for buying solar panels for your home has never been stronger because reductions in the price of solar systems has more than compensated for the loss of some upfront rebates.
 

 
Net Metering in California
The California Public Utility Commission voted by a narrow majority of 3 to 2 to extend the ability of residential energy customers in California to be credited with full retail rates for excess solar power that they generate and feed back into the grid at times when the electrical loads in their house are less than their solar production.
Whilst this didn't affect people that had already had installed solar panels on their homes in California it was a massive win for the millions of Californian homeowners who are yet to install the solar panels.
The reason net metering law is so important is that solar systems by their nature produce most power in the middle of the day when most homeowners are at work and using little power.
This is a very generous incentive and should not be taken for granted.
It means you can now install solar panels and sign a contract with your utility (known as a net metering agreement) where the utility guarantees to pay you a retail rate for exported solar power, usually for 10 or 15 years.
Each of the major utilities may offer slightly different net metering contracts but they are similar in nature.
To see more visit www.cpuc.ca.gov/General.aspx?id=3800
 

 
Is a purchase, lease or PPA agreement best?
Generally speaking you will make the largest savings over time if you purchase your solar panels outright yourself (whether you use cash you have at hand or finance secured against your home).
 However this is not always the case.
If you are in a position where you do not have a federal income tax liability then you will not be able to take advantage of the 30% federal solar tax credit.
In this case you may be better off with a third party owned solar lease where the solar company retains the right to this tax credit.
 

 
What is the payback period from installing solar panels in California?
The payback period from installing solar panels in California is usually between 4 and 8 years depending on the size of the system, the brand of solar panels you buy, the amount you were previously paying for power and whether you lease or buy your system.
This represents an excellent low risk investment.
 

 
Why analysis of solar savings and payback periods can be difficult in California
As California has net metering then the value of a solar power system is simply the annual production multiplied by the rate for power.
However, working this out can be difficult for two reasons.
Firstly for people on time of use metering the value power value changes with the time of day that the solar power is generated.
The second issue relates to the tiered rates of power prices.
With most utilities the amount you are charged for power increases as your usage increases.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
