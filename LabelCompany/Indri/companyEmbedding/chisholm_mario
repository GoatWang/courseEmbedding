Mark Chisholm and STIHL
 




















One part acrobat, one part expert rope climber, one part tree physiologist, and several parts competitor and thrill
seeker, Mark Chisholm is a third-generation, certified arborist with his family-owned Aspen Tree Expert Company in New Jersey. His expertise in tree care has made him a sought-after consultant and industry spokesperson for the world of arboriculture, and he regularly travels the globe to consult with international arborist associations and conducts educational sessions nationwide on behalf of STIHL Inc. He has also done numerous national media interviews, including with The Weather Channel’s Wake Up with Al and ABC's 20/20.
Chisholm has won the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA) New Jersey Chapter Tree Climbing Championship 21 of the last 22 years and won the ISA International Tree Climbing Championship in 1997, 2001 and, again, in 2010. Chisholm currently holds the world record in the 50-foot secured footlock climbing event, with a time of 13.8 seconds.
Mark Chisholm demonstrates an enthusiasm and passion for trees that makes him a perfect fit for Team STIHL and an excellent resource to STIHL customers and tree lovers.
