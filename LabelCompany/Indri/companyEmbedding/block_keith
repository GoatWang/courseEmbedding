Salesforce Names Former Oracle Exec Keith Block President and Vice Chairman


June 6, 2013 at 3:58 pm PT

Tweet

Salesforce.com just announced that it had named Keith Block as president and vice-chairman. If that name sounds familiar, it is the same Keith Block who used to be executive vice president for North America at the software giant Oracle.
Still not ringing a bell? Block was the one found to be disparaging Oracle products in a series of instant messages with a colleague that were disclosed in the course of the complicated Itanium lawsuit with Hewlett-Packard. Here’s the best bit.
“Nobody talks about Sun, even the Sun customers…it’s dead dead dead….Nobody wants to sell Sun…it baaaalllllooooooows….pig with lipstick, at best.”
Block was referring to Sun Microsystems, the hardware company that Oracle acquired in 2010. Block’s departure from Oracle was confirmed a few days after those messages came to light. 
But enough about that. What’s he going to do at Salesforce? Join the board of directors, for one thing. It’s a big hire for CEO Marc Benioff, especially in light of the growing rivalry between him and his former mentor, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison.
Here’s the official announcement:
Keith Block Joins Salesforce.com as President and Vice Chairman
Leading technology veteran to head salesforce.com’s customer facing operations
Block appointed to salesforce.com’s Board of Directors
SAN FRANCISCO, June 6, 2013 /PRNewswire/ — Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM), the world’s #1 CRM platform (http://www.salesforce.com/), today announced that Keith Block has joined the company as President and Vice Chairman, leading the company’s global sales, customer support and consulting services organizations. In addition, Block has been appointed to salesforce.com’s Board of Directors.
Block has led winning sales, consulting and engineering teams for nearly 30 years. In his most recent role as Oracle’s Executive Vice President of North America Sales & Consulting, Block led an 11,000-person team and built a multi-billion dollar sales business unit that achieved record revenue growth and margin expansion over the span of 10 years.
Comments on the News
“We are thrilled to welcome Keith to salesforce.com,” said Marc Benioff, Chairman and CEO, salesforce.com. “His exceptional track record leading sales, consulting and engineering teams makes him a powerful addition to our world-class distribution and leadership team.”
“14 years ago, salesforce.com completely changed the face of enterprise software and they are once again leading a new era of software with next generation social and mobile cloud technologies,” said Keith Block, President and Vice Chairman, salesforce.com. “I’m incredibly excited to join salesforce.com and help pave the way to $10 billion by delivering innovation, growth and customer success.”
Background on Keith Block
Prior to joining salesforce.com, Block spent 26 years at Oracle, where he led the transformation to a specialized sales model to support industry, solution and market segmentation. In addition, Block served as an Executive Officer at Oracle and a member of Oracle’s Executive Committee.
Block began his career at Booz Allen Hamilton as a senior consultant to Air Force executives.
Block serves on the Board of Trustees at the Concord Museum, the Advisory Board at Carnegie-Mellon University Heinz Graduate School, and the President’s Advisory Council for Carnegie-Mellon University.       
Block holds an M.S. in Management & Policy Analysis and a B.S. in Information Systems Management from Carnegie-Mellon University. He is also a graduate of Carnegie-Mellon Heinz Graduate School.

I think the NSA has a job to do and we need the NSA. But as (physicist) Robert Oppenheimer said, “When you see something that is technically sweet, you go ahead and do it and argue about what to do about it only after you’ve had your technical success. That is the way it was with the atomic bomb.”— Phil Zimmerman, PGP inventor and Silent Circle co-founder, in an interview with Om Malik

Salesforce Gets a Dose of Oracle Discipline


                    The cloud pioneer wants customers to stop buying piecemeal

Keith Block, president of Salesforce.com.

Photographer: Bloomberg



More than a decade ago, Salesforce. com became the first powerhouse tech company built entirely around sales and customer service software that’s distributed, managed, and maintained online. Today it has annual revenue above $5 billion and a market value of close to $50 billion. But because it built its business selling to smaller companies, Salesforce is still a fraction of the size of rivals such as Oracle and IBM, which regularly nail down bigger deals. In February, founder and Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff set a goal of $10 billion in annual revenue, though he didn’t say when. That’s for Keith Block to worry about.Block, Salesforce’s president and a 26-year veteran of Oracle, has spent the past two years trying to make the cloud company sell more like the hardware giants. He’s focused the sales team on securing multiyear megadeals with the likes of Coca-Cola and Barclays instead of pitching software in bits and pieces to businesses of any size. He’s asking software designers to build more products aimed at specific industries, and he’s developed a more rigid, aggressive sales strategy meant to answer any question a big client could have.That strategy starts at the top, says Block. When he and Benioff pitch CEOs, “the discussions aren’t really around cloud,” he says. “They are around, ‘How can I change the way I do things with my customer?’ Every time we sell something, we’re solving a business problem.”




Block oversees a team he assembled to manage major accounts. That group includes staffers coding industry-specific software, the salespeople telling clients why they need it, and the customer service reps talking them through each click. The goal is to sell more stuff to Salesforce’s top 30 customers, who each pay the company about $10 million a year, and get them to spend five times that, says Steve Koenig, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. Block says he’s tripled the number of deal closings by investing in Ignite, a program that offers customers free consulting services, but declined to comment on specific sales targets.For salespeople, the biggest change under Block has been the “Do Step,” a set of do-this-then-that rules he created to guide them through the sales process. It’s a serious shift for a sales culture that had long been relatively easygoing, says Jim Steele, the company’s former head of worldwide sales, who now holds that position at competitor InsideSales.com. “What Keith brought that we frankly always struggled to get at Salesforce was a disciplined operational rigor that was unyielding, unforgiving,” he says.In 2012, Block left Oracle when instant messages he sent a colleague insulting the quality of Oracle products and the behavior of his boss, Mark Hurd, became public as part of a Hewlett-Packard lawsuit against the company. Benioff hired Block soon after, telling reporters at the time that the recruitment effort had taken 10 years. “I think the biggest mistake Mark Hurd ever made was letting Keith Block leave Oracle, because he’s probably the best sales executive the enterprise software industry has ever seen,” Benioff said.




Salesforce revenue has grown from $4.1 billion to $5.4 billion in Block’s first two years there, and researcher Gartner estimates that the company’s share of the market for customer relationship management software has risen from 14 percent to 18 percent. Deferred revenue has grown from $2.5 billion to $3.3 billion as the company signs longer-term contracts with larger companies. The average contract duration has risen and is now one to three years, the company says.At the same time, Salesforce has been slow to adapt its software designs for the mobile era, Gartner says. Several competitors, including Microsoft, have been faster. Larry Augustin, the CEO of SugarCRM, a smaller competitor, says Block’s all-or-nothing sales model de-emphasizes the quality of individual products. “It’s not about each application being innovative in its space, it’s about being able to provide a suite of apps from one vendor, really the Oracle pitch,” he says. Salesforce says rivals can’t match its products’ versatility, and Block says he regularly gives demos using his iPhone 6.

Salesforce may also need to worry about turnover as longtime employees chafe against Block’s changes, says Andy Price, a managing partner at executive recruitment firm Schweichler Price Mullarkey & Barry. Among others, Steele left in December, and four other senior Salesforce managers have joined him at InsideSales since March. But if Block is going to meet Benioff’s goal, Price says, some new strictures, and departures, are inevitable. “The company needs to behave like a larger, more mature company,” he says. In some cases, “that’s just not exciting to the people who’ve got it to this point.”The bottom line: Block is pushing Salesforce to focus on selling bigger software packages as he aims to double revenue.
