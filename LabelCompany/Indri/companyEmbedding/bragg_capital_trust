I stayed for four months and all I needed was my suitcase.  It was obvious when I moved in that the place had been thoroughly cleaned.  Everything was taken care of and all utilities including Cable and Internet were included in the cost.  They had linens, kitchenware, and this place even had a community pool!  For me, it was a home away from home.   The owner, Adam Rappaport, knows the Charlotte real estate market and was easy to work with.  I originally signed a three month lease and was able to extend it an additional month.  I would definitely recommend Executive Digz for your short-term housing needs.

Fund 
Summary: Queens Road Value Fund
 

Investment 
Objective
 
The Fund 
seeks long-term capital growth.
 
Fees 
and Expenses of the Fund
 
This 
table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold 
shares of the Fund.
 







Shareholder 
      Fees
(fees 
      paid directly from your investment)



Maximum 
      Sales Charge (Load) Imposed On Purchases


None



Maximum 
      Deferred Sales Charge (Load)


None
 






Annual 
      Fund Operating Expenses
(expenses 
      that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your 
      investment)



Management 
      Fees


0.95%



Distribution 
      and Service (12b-1) Fees


None



Other 
      Expenses


0.00%



Acquired 
      Fund Fees and Expenses (1)


0.02%



Total 
      Annual Fund Operating Expenses


0.97%
 





(1)

Acquired 
      Fund Fees and Expenses are the indirect costs of investing in other 
      investment companies. The operating expenses in this fee table will not 
      correlate to the expense ratio in the Fund’s financial highlights because 
      the financial statements include only the direct operating expenses 
      incurred by the Fund.
 
Example
 
This 
Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with 
the cost of investing in other mutual funds.
 
The 
Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods 
indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The 
Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the 
Fund’s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be 
higher or lower, based upon these assumptions your costs would be:
 






1 
      Year


3 
      Years


5 
      Years


10 
      Years



$99


$309


$536


$1,190
 
Portfolio 
Turnover
 
The Fund 
pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities 
(or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover may indicate higher 
transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a 
taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating 
expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most 
recent fiscal year, the Fund’s portfolio turnover rate was 5% of the average 
value of its portfolio.
 
Principal 
Investment Strategies
 
The Fund 
seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in the equity 
securities (common stocks, preferred stocks and convertible securities) of U.S. 
companies. Investments will be made based on their potential for capital growth 
without limitation on issuer capitalization. The Fund is non-diversified, which 
means that it can invest a greater percentage of its assets in any one issuer 
than a diversified fund.

Queens Road Funds




  

 
The 
Fund’s investment advisor, Bragg Financial Advisors, Inc., invests the Fund’s 
assets by pursuing a value-oriented strategy. The advisor’s strategy begins with 
a screening process that seeks to identify companies whose stocks sell at 
discounted price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) multiples. The 
advisor favors companies that maintain strong balance sheets and have 
experienced management. Generally, the investment advisor attempts to identify 
situations where stock prices are undervalued by the market. The advisor sells 
securities when it believes they are trading for more than their intrinsic 
value, to generate tax losses to offset taxable gains, or if additional cash is 
needed to fund redemptions.
 
Principal 
Investment Risks
 
As 
with all mutual funds, there is the risk that you could lose money through your 
investment in the Fund. Many factors affect the Fund’s net asset value and 
performance.
 
Equity 
Risk
 
The 
prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may 
result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities 
market as a whole.
 
Diversification
 
Because 
the Fund is non-diversified, economic, political, or other conditions that 
affect the issuers in which the Fund may be heavily invested may result in 
greater fluctuation in the price of the Fund’s shares than if the Fund was more 
widely diversified.
 
Issuer-specific 
changes
 
The 
value of an individual security can be more volatile than the market as a whole 
and can perform differently than the value of the market as a 
whole.
 
Portfolio 
strategy
 
The 
investment advisor’s skill in choosing appropriate investments for the Fund will 
determine, in part, the Fund’s ability to achieve its investment 
objective.
 
Small 
and medium cap securities
 
The 
prices of securities of small and medium capitalization companies generally are 
more volatile, less liquid; and more likely to be adversely affected by poor 
economic or market conditions than securities of larger companies. Small and 
medium size companies may have limited product lines, markets or financial 
resources, and they may be dependent upon a limited management 
group.
 
Stock 
market volatility
 
Stock 
markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse 
issuer, political, regulatory, market or economic developments.
 
Value 
investing
 
The value 
approach to investing involves the risk that those stocks may remain 
undervalued. Value stocks as a group may be out of favor and underperform the 
overall equity market for a long period of time.
 
Who 
May Want to Invest in the Fund?
 
Queens 
Road Value Fund is designed for investors who seek one or more of the 
following:
 





  
      

•

a 
      stock fund with the long-term goal of growth of 
  capital





  
      

•

a 
      fund to complement a portfolio of other 
  investments





  
      

•

are 
      willing to accept significant changes (up or down) in the value of an 
      investment
 
The 
Fund is NOT appropriate for investors who:
 





  
      

•

want 
      to avoid high volatility or possible 
losses





  
      

•

want 
      an investment that pursues market trends or focuses on particular sectors 
      or industries





  
      

•

are 
      pursuing a short-term goal or investing emergency reserve 
      money





  
      

•

are 
      seeking a high level of regular income or preservation of 
      capital

Performance
 
The bar 
chart and performance table below show the variability of the Fund’s returns, 
which is some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund. The bar chart 
shows performance of the Fund’s shares for each full calendar year since the 
Fund’s inception. The performance table compares the performance of the Fund’s 
shares over time to the performance of a broad-based securities market index.

may not be an indication of how the Fund will perform in the 
future.

After-tax 
returns are calculated using the highest historical individual federal marginal 
income tax rate and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual 
after-tax returns depend on a shareholder’s tax situation and may differ from 
those shown. The after-tax returns are not relevant if you hold your Fund shares 
in tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement 
accounts (“IRA”).
 
The 
S&P 500/Citigroup Value Index is a market-capitalization-weighted index 
developed by Standard and Poor’s consisting of those stocks within the S&P 
500 Index that exhibit strong value characteristics. The S&P 500/Citigroup 
Value Index uses a numerical ranking system based on four value factors and 
three growth factors to determine the constituents and their weightings. The 
value factors include: book value to price ratio, cash flow to price ratio, 
sales to price ratio and dividend yield. The growth factors include: earnings 
per share growth rate, sales per share growth rate and internal growth rate each 
measured over five years. The index is an unmanaged benchmark that assumes 
reinvestment of all distributions and excludes the effect of taxes and fees. 
Individuals cannot invest directly in an index.

Purchase 
and Sale of Fund Shares
 
The 
minimum initial investment in shares is $2,500 for regular accounts and $1,000 
for retirement plans, and the minimum subsequent investment is $1,000 for 
regular accounts and $50 for retirement plans. You may purchase and redeem 
shares of the Fund on any day that the New York Stock Exchange is open. 
Redemption requests may be made in writing, by telephone, or through a financial 
intermediary and will be paid by check or wire transfer.
 
Tax 
Information
 
Dividends 
and capital gain distributions you receive from the Fund, whether you reinvest 
your distributions in additional Fund shares or receive them in cash, are 
taxable to you at either ordinary income or capital gains tax rates unless you 
are investing through a tax-deferred plan such as an IRA or 401(k) 
plan.
 
Payments 
to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries
 
If you 
purchase the Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such 
as a bank), the Fund’s advisor may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund 
shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by 
influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to 
recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your 
financial intermediary’s website for more information.

Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with 
the cost of investing in other mutual funds.
 
The 
Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods 
indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The 
Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the 
Fund’s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be 
higher or lower, based upon these assumptions your costs would be:
 






1 
      Year


3 
      Years


5 
      Years


10 
      Years



$129


$403


$697


$1,534
 
Portfolio 
Turnover
 
The Fund 
pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities 
(or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover may indicate higher 
transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a 
taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating 
expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most 
recent fiscal year, the Fund’s portfolio turnover rate was 14% of the average 
value of its portfolio.
 
Principal 
Investment Strategies
 
The Fund 
seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in the equity 
securities (common stocks, preferred stocks and convertible securities) of small 
capitalization U.S. companies. The Fund defines small capitalization (small cap) 
companies as those with a market capitalization of no more than $2 billion at 
the time of purchase. Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 
80% of its assets (for the purpose of this requirement, net assets includes net 
assets plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in equity securities of 
companies with small market capitalization. The Fund is non-diversified, which 
means that it can invest a greater percentage of its assets in any one issuer 
than a diversified fund.

The 
Fund’s investment advisor, Bragg Financial Advisors, Inc., invests the Fund’s 
assets by pursuing a value-oriented strategy. The advisor’s strategy begins with 
a screening process that seeks to identify small cap companies whose stocks sell 
at discounted price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) multiples. 
The advisor favors companies that maintain strong balance sheets and have 
experienced management. Generally, the investment advisor attempts to identify 
situations where stock prices are undervalued by the market. The advisor sells 
securities when it believes they are trading for more than their intrinsic 
value, to generate tax losses to offset taxable gains, or if additional cash is 
needed to fund redemptions.
 
Principal 
Investment Risks
 
As with 
all mutual funds, there is the risk that you could lose money through your 
investment in the Fund. Many factors affect the Fund’s net asset value and 
performance.
 
Equity 
Risk
 
The 
prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may 
result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities 
market as a whole.
 
Diversification
 
Because 
the Fund is non-diversified, economic, political, or other conditions that 
affect the issuers in which the Fund may be heavily invested may result in 
greater fluctuation in the price of the Fund’s shares than if the Fund was more 
widely diversified.
 
Issuer-specific 
changes
 
The value 
of an individual security can be more volatile than the market as a whole and 
can perform differently than the value of the market as a whole.
 
Portfolio 
strategy
 
The 
investment advisor’s skill in choosing appropriate investments for the Fund will 
determine, in part, the Fund’s ability to achieve its investment 
objective.
 
Small 
cap securities
 
The 
prices of securities of small capitalization companies generally are more 
volatile, less liquid; and more likely to be adversely affected by poor economic 
or market conditions than securities of larger companies. Small companies may 
have limited product lines, markets or financial resources, and they may be 
dependent upon a limited management group.
 
Stock 
market volatility
 
Stock 
markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse 
issuer, political, regulatory, market or economic developments.
 
Value 
investing
 
The value 
approach to investing involves the risk that those stocks may remain 
undervalued. Value stocks as a group may be out of favor and underperform the 
overall equity market for a long period of time.
 
Who 
May Want to Invest in the Fund?
 
The 
Queens Road Small Cap Value Fund is designed for investors who seek one or more 
of the following:
 





  
      

•

an 
      aggressive stock fund with the long-term goal of growth of 
      capital





  
      

•

      fund to complement a portfolio of more conservative 
      investments





  
      

•

are 
      willing to accept significant changes (up or down) in the value of an 
      investment
 
The 
Fund is NOT appropriate for investors who:
 





  
      

•

want 
      to avoid high volatility or possible 
losses





  
      

•

want 
      an investment that pursues market trends or focuses on particular sectors 
      or industries





  
      

•

are 
      pursuing a short term goal or investing emergency reserve 
      money

After-tax 
returns are calculated using the highest historical individual federal marginal 
income tax rate and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual 
after-tax returns depend on a shareholder’s tax situation and may differ from 
those shown. The after-tax returns are not relevant if you hold your Fund shares 
in tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement 
accounts (“IRA”).
 
The 
Russell 2000 Value Index measures the performance of small-cap value segment of 
the U.S. equity universe. It includes those Russell 2000 companies with lower 
price-to-book ratios and lower forecasted growth values. The Russell 2000 Value 
Index is constructed to provide a comprehensive and unbiased barometer for the 
small-cap value segment. The index is completely reconstituted annually to 
ensure larger stocks do not distort the performance and characteristics of the 
true small-cap opportunity set and that the represented companies continue to 
reflect value characteristics. The index is an unmanaged benchmark that assumes 
reinvestment of all distributions and excludes the effect of taxes and fees. 
Individuals cannot invest directly in an index.

Tax 
Information
 
Dividends 
and capital gain distributions you receive from the Fund, whether you reinvest 
your distributions in additional Fund shares or receive them in cash, are

Payments 
to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries
 
If you 
purchase the Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such 
as a bank), the Fund’s advisor may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund 
shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by 
influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to 
recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your 
financial intermediary’s website for more information.

Investment 
Strategies and Related Risks
 
Investment 
Objective
 
Each 
Fund’s objective is long-term capital growth. Each Fund’s investment objective 
is fundamental and may not be changed without shareholder approval. However, the 
Queen’s Road Small Cap Value Fund’s investment policy to invest at least 80% of 
its net assets in equity securities of small cap companies is non-fundamental 
and may be changed by the Fund’s Board of Trustees upon 60 days written notice 
to shareholders.

reserves the right to invest in other securities, which may include other types 
of stocks, such as stocks of larger companies, foreign companies, growth 
companies, or fixed income investments including investment grade bonds and high 
risk bonds (often called junk bonds).
 
Principal 
Investment Risks
 
The risk 
descriptions below provide a more detailed explanation of the Funds’ common 
principal investment risks (except as noted) that correspond to the risks 
described in each Fund’s Fund Summary section of this Prospectus.
 
Equity 
Risk
 
The 
prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. These price movements may 
result from factors affecting individual companies, industries or the securities 
market as a whole. Individual companies may report poor results or be negatively 
affected by industry and/or economic trends and developments. The prices of 
securities issued by such companies may suffer a decline in response. In 
addition, the equity market tends to move in cycles which may cause stock prices 
to fall over short or extended periods of time.

Queens Road Funds




  

 
Diversification
 
The Funds 
are non-diversified. Therefore, each may invest a greater portion of its assets 
in the securities of one issuer than diversified funds. Economic, political, or 
other conditions that affect the industries or issuers in which the Funds may be 
heavily invested may result in greater fluctuation in the price of the Funds’ 
shares than if the Funds were more widely diversified. However, each Fund does 
intend to meet certain tax diversification requirements.
 
Issuer-specific 
changes
 
The value 
of an individual security can be more volatile than the market as a whole and 
can perform differently than the value of the market as a whole.
 
Portfolio 
strategy
 
The 
investment advisor’s skill in choosing appropriate investments for the Funds 
will determine in part each Fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective. 
The advisor’s judgments about the attractiveness, value and potential 
appreciation of a particular security in which a Fund invests may prove to be 
inaccurate and may not produce the desired results. Additionally, if the advisor 
overestimates the value or return potential of one or more securities, the Funds 
may underperform the equity market in general. The market may not agree with the 
advisor’s determination that a stock is undervalued, and the stock’s price may 
not increase to what the advisor believes is its full value. It may even 
decrease in value. During these periods, relative performance may 
suffer.
 
Small and medium 
cap securities
 
(Medium 
cap securities risk not applicable to Queens Road Small Cap Value 
Fund)
 
Investing 
in the securities of small and medium capitalization companies involves special 
risks. Among other things, the prices of securities of these companies generally 
are more volatile than those of larger companies; the securities of small and 
medium capitalization companies generally are less liquid; and smaller companies 
generally are more likely to be adversely affected by poor economic or market 
conditions. In addition, it is anticipated that some of the Funds’ portfolio 
securities may not be widely traded, and that the Funds’ position in such 
securities may be substantial in relation to the market for such securities. 
Accordingly, it may be difficult for the Fund to dispose of such securities 
quickly at prevailing market prices. Investments in securities of companies with 
small and medium market capitalizations are generally considered to offer 
greater opportunity for appreciation but also may involve greater risks than 
customarily are associated with more established companies. The securities of 
smaller and medium companies may be subject to more abrupt fluctuations in 
market price than larger, more established companies. Small companies have 
limited product lines, markets or financial resources, or they may be dependent 
upon a limited management group. In addition to exhibiting greater volatility, 
small cap stocks may, to a degree, fluctuate independently of larger cap stocks, 
i.e., small cap stocks may decline in price as the prices of large cap stocks 
rise or vice versa.
 
Stock 
market volatility
 
While 
stocks have historically outperformed other asset classes over the long term, 
stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse 
issuer, political, regulatory, market or economic developments. Different parts 
of the market can react differently to these developments.
 
Value 
investing
 
The 
value approach to investing involves the risk that those stocks may remain 
undervalued. Value stocks as a group may be out of favor and underperform the 
overall equity market for a long period of time, while the market concentrates 
on “growth” stocks. In addition, a Fund may forgo investments that show growth 
potential if they are inconsistent with its value investment strategy. Value 
funds often concentrate much of their investments in certain industries, and 
thus will be more susceptible to factors adversely affecting issuers within that 
industry than would a more diversified portfolio of securities.
 
Temporary 
Investments
 
To 
respond to adverse market, economic, political or other conditions, each Fund 
may invest 100% of its total assets, without limitation, in high-quality 
short-term debt securities and money market instruments. These short-term debt 
securities and money market instruments include: shares of money market mutual 
funds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, bankers’ acceptances, U.S. 
Government securities and repurchase agreements. While a Fund is in a defensive 
position, the opportunity to achieve its investment objective will be limited. 
Furthermore, to the extent that a Fund invests in money market mutual funds for 
cash positions, there will be some duplication of expenses because the Fund pays 
its pro-rata portion of such money market funds’ advisory fees and operational 
fees. Each Fund may also invest a substantial portion of its assets in such 
instruments at any time to maintain liquidity or pending selection of 
investments in accordance with its policies.

2012, BFA received an advisory fee of 0.95% of average daily net assets of 
Queens Road Value Fund and 1.24% of average daily net assets of Queens Road

Shareholder 
Information
 
Buying 
and Redeeming Shares
 
You pay 
no sales charge to purchase or sell (redeem) shares of a Fund. The date on which 
your purchase, redemption or exchange of shares is processed is the trade date, 
and the price used for the transaction is based on the next calculation of net 
asset value after the order is processed. The net asset value per share (NAV) 
for each Fund is calculated as of the close of regular trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange (generally 4 p.m. Eastern time) and is determined every day that 
the Exchange is open. Securities in each Fund’s portfolio that primarily trade 
on a foreign exchange may change in value on a day that the Exchange is closed 
and the Fund’s shareholders are not able to redeem shares in the Fund. If a 
Fund, its transfer agent or any other authorized agent receives your trade order 
by the close of regular trading on the NYSE, your order will receive that day’s 
NAV. If your order is received after the close of regular trading, it will 
receive the next business day’s NAV. If you place your order through a financial 
intermediary rather than with the Fund or its transfer agent directly, the 
financial intermediary is responsible for transmitting your order to the Fund’s 
transfer agent in a timely manner.
 
You will 
receive a confirmation of each transaction and quarterly statements showing your 
balance and account activity. You should verify the accuracy of all transactions 
and statements as soon as you receive them.
 
Computing 
NAV
 
Net asset 
value (NAV) of each Fund is determined by calculating the total value of all 
portfolio securities, cash, other assets held by the Fund, and interest and 
dividends accrued and subtracting from that amount all liabilities, including 
accrued expenses. The net asset value of each Fund is divided by the total 
number of shares outstanding to determine each Fund’s NAV. The NAV is calculated 
at the close of regular trading on the NYSE on each business day the exchange is 
open. If the exchange closes early, the Funds will calculate NAV at that 
time.
 
For 
purposes of computing NAV, each Fund uses the last reported sales price or 
quotation for portfolio securities, or if market quotations are not readily 
available, fair value will be determined in good faith by the Board of Trustees. 
If BFA believes, in good faith, that the market quotations provided do not 
accurately represent the value of a security, the security will be valued at 
fair value as determined in good faith according to the Fund’s Pricing Policy 
approved by the Board of Trustees.

Transactions 
Through Third Parties
 
The Funds 
have authorized one or more brokers to receive purchase and redemption orders on 
its behalf. Such brokers are authorized to designate other intermediaries to 
receive purchase and redemption orders on the Funds’ behalf. The Funds will be 
deemed to have received a purchase or redemption order when an authorized 
broker, its authorized designee, receives the order. Customer orders will be 
priced at the applicable Fund’s NAV next computed after they are received by an 
authorized broker or its authorized designee.
 
If you 
invest through a broker or other financial institution, the policies and fees 
charged by that institution may be different than those of the Funds. Brokers, 
advisors, retirement plans or others may charge transactions fees or set 
different minimum investments or limitations on buying or selling shares. 
Consult your financial representative if you have any questions about any such 
fees or imitations prior to buying or selling shares.
 
How 
to Purchase Shares
 
A minimum 
initial investment of $2,500 is required to open an account ($1,000 for 
Traditional and Roth IRAs) with subsequent minimum investments of $1,000 ($50 
for Traditional and Roth IRAs). Minimum initial investments may be waived if, in 
the investment advisor’s opinion, doing so would be in the interest of all 
shareholders. For instance, if a group or class of investors would agree to 
invest amounts on a regular basis, such as in a 401k plan, or if the investment 
advisor has reason to believe that waiving the minimum would allow the Funds to 
attract more assets which would reduce the Funds operating expenses for all 
shareholders once certain asset levels are reached.
 
All 
orders are subject to acceptance, and we may reject purchases to protect other 
shareholders.
 
Shareholders’ 
Accounts
 
When you 
invest in a Fund, the Transfer Agent will establish an account to which all full 
and fractional shares (to three decimal places) will be credited. Your purchase 
will receive the NAV next calculated after the Transfer Agent has received your 
order. The Fund will not issue share certificates evidencing shares of the Fund. 
Instead, your account will be credited with the number of shares purchased, 
relieving you of responsibility for safekeeping of certificates and the need to 
deliver them upon redemption.

Automatic Investment Plan permits you to purchase shares of a Fund at monthly 
intervals, provided that your bank allows automatic withdrawals. At your option, 
the bank account that you designate will be debited by an amount that you 
specify, and such funds will be used to purchase shares of a Fund on a monthly 
basis. To participate in the Automatic Investment Plan, call the Transfer Agent 
at (800) 595-3088 to obtain the appropriate forms. The Automatic Investment Plan 
does not assure a profit and does not protect against loss in declining markets. 
You may terminate your participation with the Automatic Investment Plan at any 
time by notifying the Transfer Agent in writing.
 
Other 
Information Concerning Purchase of Shares
 
Each Fund 
reserves the right to reject any order, to cancel any order due to non-payment 
and to waive or lower the investment minimums with respect to any person or 
class of persons. If an order is canceled because of non-payment or because your 
check does not clear, you will be responsible for any loss that the Fund incurs. 
If you are already a shareholder, the Fund can redeem shares from your account 
to reimburse it for any loss. For purchases of $50,000 or more, the Fund may, in 
its discretion, require payment by wire or cashier’s or certified check. For 
initial purchases, the Fund will not process a redemption of the purchased 
shares until clearance of the check deposited for that purchase. Cash, money 
orders and travelers checks are not accepted as payment for shares.
 
How 
to Redeem Shares
 
All 
shares of a Fund offered for redemption will be redeemed at the NAV of the Fund 
next determined after the Transfer Agent receives the redemption request that is 
in compliance with the requirements described in this section. Because each 
Fund’s NAV will fluctuate as a result of changes in the market value of the 
Fund’s portfolio securities, the amount you receive upon redemption may be more 
or less than the amount you paid for such Fund shares being redeemed. Redemption 
proceeds will be mailed to your registered address of record or, if the 
redemption proceeds are $5,000 or more, may be transmitted by wire, upon your 
written request to the Transfer Agent, to your pre-designated account at a 
domestic bank. You will be charged for the cost of such wire transfer. Fund 
redemption proceeds will be mailed generally within 7 days of receipt of the 
redemption request. Redemptions for Fund shares will only be made after the 
check for the purchase of those Fund shares has cleared payment. The Funds will 
not make redemption proceeds payable to any person other than the shareholder(s) 
of record.

Redemption 
by Mail
 
Shares 
may be redeemed by mail by writing directly to the Transfer Agent. The 
redemption request must be signed exactly as your name appears on the account 
application, with the signature guaranteed, and must include your account 
number. If Fund shares are owned by more than one person, the redemption request 
must be signed by all owners exactly as the names appear on the registration 
form. You should be able to obtain a signature guarantee from a bank, 
broker-dealer, credit union (if authorized under state law), securities exchange 
or association, clearing agency or savings association. A notary public is not 
an acceptable guarantor.
 
A request 
for redemption will not be processed until all the necessary documents have been 
received in proper form by the Transfer Agent. If you are in doubt as to what 
documents are required, you should contact the Transfer Agent at (800) 
595-3088.
 
Other 
Information Concerning Redemption
 
Each Fund 
reserves the right to take up to seven days to make payment if, in the judgment 
of the advisor, the Fund could be adversely affected by immediate payment. In 
addition, the right of redemption for a Fund may be suspended or the date of 
payment postponed for (a) any period (i) during which the New York Stock 
Exchange is closed other than customary weekend and holiday closings, or (ii) 
during which trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission; (b) any period during which an emergency 
exists, as determined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, as a result of 
which (i) disposal by a Fund of securities owned by it is not reasonably 
practicable, or (ii) it is not reasonably practicable for a Fund to fairly 
determine the value of its net assets; or (c) for such other periods as the SEC 
may by order permit for the protection of shareholders of a Fund. In determining 
whether any of the conditions for suspension of redemption are in effect, each 
Fund will be guided by the rules, regulations and pronouncements of the 
SEC.
 
Due to 
the high cost of maintaining accounts, each Fund has the right to redeem, upon 
not less than 30 days’ written notice, all of your shares of the Fund if, 
through prior redemptions, your account has a net asset value of less than 
$1,000. You will be given at least 30 days’ written notice prior to any 
involuntary redemption and during such period will be allowed to purchase 
additional shares to bring your account up to the applicable minimum balance 
before the redemption is processed.
 
The Funds 
have elected to be governed by Rule 18f-1 under the Investment Company Act of 
1940 pursuant to which each Fund is obligated during any 90 day period to redeem 
shares for any one shareholder of record solely in cash up to the lesser of 
$250,000 or 1% of the net asset value of the Fund at the beginning of the 
period. Should a redemption exceed such limitation, the Fund may deliver, in 
lieu of cash, readily marketable securities from its portfolio. The securities 
delivered will be selected at the sole discretion of the Fund, will not 
necessarily be representative of the entire portfolio and may be securities 
which the Fund would otherwise sell. The redeeming shareholder will usually 
incur brokerage costs in converting the securities to cash. The method of 
valuing securities used to make the redemptions in kind will be the same as the 
method of valuing portfolio securities and such valuation will be made as of the 
same time the redemption price is determined.
 
Frequent 
Purchases And Redemptions Of Fund Shares
 
The Funds 
do not permit market-timing. The Funds are intended for long-term investors. 
Frequent trading of Fund shares, also known as “market-timing,” is not 
permitted. Excessive trading into or out of a Fund may harm the Fund’s 
performance by disrupting portfolio management strategies and by increasing 
expenses. Accordingly, if you engage in this type of activity a Fund may suspend 
or terminate your trading privileges. A Fund may consider a shareholder’s 
history in any Fund, including trading history in other accounts under common 
ownership or control, in determining whether to suspend or terminate your 
trading privileges. All purchases are subject to acceptance by the Funds. The 
Funds reserve the right to reject any purchases it suspects to be 
market-timing.
 
In an 
attempt to deter market timing, the Funds will use methods 
including:
 





  
      

•

Selective 
      monitoring of trade activity;





  
      

•

Broad 
      authority to take discretionary action against market timers and against 
      specific trades;





  
      

•

Reliance 
      on others (transfer agents, financial intermediaries, etc.) market timing 
      detection practices.
 
Each of 
the methods involves subjective judgments that are consistent with shareholder 
interests. Furthermore, each of these methods involves some selectivity in their 
application. While the Funds will seek to take actions that will detect and 
prohibit market timing, the Funds do not represent that market timing can be 
completely eliminated in any fund. For instance, a Fund may not be able to 
identify or reasonably detect or deter market timing transactions that may be 
facilitated by financial intermediaries or made difficult to identify through 
the use of omnibus accounts by those intermediaries that transmit orders to the 
Fund on behalf of their customers who are beneficial owners. To the extent that 
the Funds have omnibus accounts the Funds will ensure that brokers maintaining 
such accounts enter into an agreement with the Funds to provide shareholder 
transaction information, to the extent known to the broker, to the Funds upon 
request. Although the Funds will take reasonable efforts to eliminate market 
timing transactions there can be no assurance that the systems and procedures of 
the Funds, the Funds’ transfer agent, and financial intermediaries which submit 
orders to the Funds, will be able to monitor all trading activity.

Distribution 
And Taxes
 
In 
general, selling shares of the Fund and receiving distributions (whether 
reinvested or taken in cash) are taxable events. Depending on the purchase price 
and the sale price, you may have a gain or a loss on any shares sold. Any tax 
liabilities generated by your transactions or by receiving distributions are 
your responsibility. The Fund anticipates that distributions will be primarily 
taxed as ordinary income. You may want to avoid making a substantial investment 
when the Fund is about to make a taxable distribution because you would be 
responsible for any taxes on the distribution regardless of how long you have 
owned your shares. The Fund may produce capital gains even if they do not have 
income to distribute and performance has been poor.
 
Early 
each year, the Fund will mail to you a statement setting forth the federal 
income tax information for all distributions made during the previous year. If 
you do not provide your taxpayer identification number, your account will be 
subject to backup withholding. The tax considerations described in this section 
do not apply to tax-deferred accounts or other non-taxable entities. Because 
each investor’s tax circumstances are unique, please consult with your tax 
adviser about your investment.
 
Householding: To 
reduce expenses, we mail only one copy of the prospectus and each annual and 
semi-annual report to those addresses shared by two or more accounts. If you 
wish to receive individual copies of these documents, please call the Funds at 
(800) 595-3088 on days the Funds are open for business or contact your financial 
institution. We will begin sending you individual copies thirty days after 
receiving your request.

Why?

Financial 
      companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law 
      gives consumers the right to limit some, but not all sharing. Federal law
