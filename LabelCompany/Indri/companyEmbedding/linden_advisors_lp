Linden Advisros |   Why Linden Advisors




























 
 

Why Linden Advisors
Linden Advisors offers a unique combination of strong transaction experience and excellence of execution, deep relationships with potential buyers, in-depth knowledge of the technology domain, and most importantly, client focus and integrity.
Strong Transaction Experience and Excellence of Execution
Linden Advisors brings strong transaction experience and outstanding execution capabilities, having executed numerous M&A and financing transactions at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown and Montgomery Securities.
Deep Relationships with Potential Buyers
Linden Advisors has a wealth of relevant senior relationships within the technology industry. These relationships with potential strategic buyers ensure that meaningful and serious dialogues occur – often times the key to a successful transaction is having the dialogue with the appropriate audience.
In-depth Knowledge of the Technology Domain
Linden Advisors is focused on serving the unique needs of CEOs and Boards in the technology industry. Clients want experts who understand the technology industry and the key factors that lead to success in the different stages of a technology company’s lifecycle. Our focus on technology allows us to keep abreast of these success factors and incorporate them in meeting the specific needs of our clients.
Client Focus and Integrity
For Linden Advisors, clients’ interests and needs always come first. Our unrelenting integrity and client commitment are critical to our success and form the basis of all our professional activities. We pursue every avenue of success for our clients with a high level of enthusiasm and tenacity.
Senior Level Attention
Gaurang Desai will be involved with transactions from beginning to end. Thus, unlike larger investment banks, Linden Advisors provides clients with true senior-level counsel regarding critical strategic decisions. This is particularly critical in a private transaction where proper positioning of the company with prospective buyers is key to maximizing shareholder value, and this is best done by a senior, experienced banker.
