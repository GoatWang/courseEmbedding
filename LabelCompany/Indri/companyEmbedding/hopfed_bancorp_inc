Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

      month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company reported net income 
      of $985,000, or $0.16 per share, basic and diluted, compared to net 
      income of $510,000, or $0.08 per share basic and diluted, for the three 
      month period ended September 30, 2015. For the nine month periods ended

      Commenting on the third quarter results, John E. Peck, President and

      The Company’s Nashville loan production office has originated loans with 
      balances totaling $39.5 million at September 30, 2016, as compared to 
      $23.3 million at June 30, 2016, and $7.8 million at September 30, 2015. 
      Our loan pipeline remains robust. In addition to commercial loan growth, 
      our secondary market loan operation continues to find success. In 
      October 2016, we opened a loan production office in Brentwood, 
      Tennessee, that enhances both our secondary market and portfolio lending 
      in the attractive Williamson County, Tennessee market,” Mr. Peck 
      concluded.

      The increase in non-accrual loans at September 30, 2016, as compared to 
      December 31, 2015, is largely the result of one land development 
      relationship that has been classified as substandard since July of 2013. 
      The collateral for the loan consists of undeveloped land that is being 
      held for future commercial development and a single family residence.
    

      At September 30, 2016, non-performing assets totaled $12.4 million, or 
      1.43% of total assets. At September 30, 2016, the Company had no loans 
      past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest. A summary of the 
      activity in other real estate owned for the nine month period ended 
      September 30, 2016, is as follows:

Asset Quality (continued)


      For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company’s 
      balance of loans classified as Troubled Debt Restructurings (“TDRs”) 
      increased from $5.5 million to $6.5 million. The increase is the result 
      of one lending relationship in which the customer’s payment terms were 
      revised to provide for interest only payments while the customer 
      attempts to sell the collateral. A summary of the activity in loans 
      classified as TDRs for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, 
      is as follows:

      At September 30, 2016, the Company’s level of loans classified as 
      substandard was $31.9 million as compared to $28.1 million at December 
      31, 2015. The $3.8 million increase in classified assets at September 
      30, 2016, as compared to December 31, 2015, is largely the result of one 
      large commercial agri-business loan that has been negatively affected by 
      the decline in commodity prices and one unrelated multi-family loan. At 
      September 30, 2016, the Company’s classified loan to total risk-based 
      capital ratio was 31.8%. The Company’s specific reserve for impaired 
      loans was $605,000 at September 30, 2016, and $630,000 at December 31, 
      2015. A summary of the level of classified loans and the Company’s 
      allocation of its allowance for loan loss by loan type at September 30, 
      2016, is as follows:

Net Interest Income


      For the three month period ended September 30, 2016, total interest 
      income was $8.0 million, as compared to $7.7 million for the three month 
      period ended June 30, 2016, and $8.0 million for the three month period 
      ended September 30, 2015. For the three month period ended September 30, 
      2016, total interest expense was $1.3 million, representing a linked 
      quarter increase of $47,000 and a decline of $318,000 as compared to the 
      three month period ended September 30, 2015. The decline of interest 
      expense for the three month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared 
      to the three month period ended September 30, 2015, is largely 
      attributable to maturities of higher costing time deposits, reducing the 
      Company’s interest expense on deposits by $202,000 as compared to the 
      three month period ended September 30, 2015. On a linked quarter basis, 
      the slight increase in interest expense is largely the result of $12.7 
      million increase in total deposit balances and a 0.03% increase in the 
      total cost interest bearing liabilities. For the three month period 
      ended September 30, 2016, the Company’s interest expense on subordinated 
      debentures declined by $87,000 as compared to the three month period 
      ended September 30, 2015, due to the maturing of an interest rate swap 
      on the debenture.
    

      For the three month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company’s net 
      interest income was $6.7 million, compared to $6.4 million for the three 
      month periods ended June 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015, respectively. 
      For the three month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company’s net 
      interest margin was 3.41%, as compared to 3.28% for the three month 
      period ended June 30, 2016, and 3.25% for the three month period ended 
      September 30, 2015. The net interest margin for the three month period 
      ended June 30, 2016, was negatively influenced by a large loan being 
      classified as non-accrual, resulting in a $200,000 reduction of interest 
      income on loans.
    

      For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company’s total 
      interest income was $23.8 million, as compared to $25.1 million for the 
      nine month period ended September 30, 2015. The $1.3 million decline in 
      total interest income for the nine month period ended September 30, 
      2016, as compared to September 30, 2015, was largely the result of a 
      $1.7 million decline in investment income. For the nine month period 
      ended September 30, 2015, the Company experienced an $830,000 recovery 
      on a previously non-accrual investment. In addition to the investment 
      income recovery, the combined average balance of taxable and tax free 
      investments for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, declined 
      by $27.6 million as compared to the nine month period ended September 
      30, 2015.
    

      For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company’s 
      interest expense was $4.0 million, as compared to $4.9 million for the 
      nine month period ended September 30, 2015. The decline of interest 
      expense is the result of both lower interest rates and reduced average 
      balances of time deposits. For the nine month period ended September 30, 
      2016, the average balance of retail time deposits were $257.8 million 
      and their average cost was 0.95%. For the nine month period ended 
      September 30, 2015, the average balance of retail time deposits were 
      $289.2 million and their average cost was 1.16%. For the nine month 
      period ended September 30, 2016, the Company’s interest expense on 
      subordinated debentures was $287,000, or 3.71%, as compared to $553,000, 
      or 7.15%, for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. The 
      decline in subordinated debentures interest expense is the result of the 
      maturity of the Company’s interest rate swap on its debenture.
    

      For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company’s net 
      interest income was $19.8 million, as compared to $20.2 million for the 
      nine month period ended September 30, 2015. For the nine month period 
      ended September 30, 2016, the Company’s net interest margin was 3.36%, 
      as compared to 3.40% for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. 
      For the nine month period ended September 30, 2015, the recovery of 
      non-accrual investment interest added 0.16% to the Company’s net 
      interest margin.
    

Non-interest Income


      On a linked quarter basis, total non-interest income declined by $25,000 
      largely due to a $60,000 decline in financial services income. On a 
      linked quarter basis, mortgage origination revenue declined by $20,000 
      while gains on the sale of securities and income from bank owned life 
      insurance both increased by $27,000. For the three month period ended 
      September 30, 2016, total non-interest income was $9,000 higher as 
      compared to the three month period ended September 30, 2015. For the 
      three month period ended September 30, 2016, service charge income was 
      $719,000, representing a $31,000 decline as compared to the three month 
      period ended September 30, 2015. For the three month period ended 
      September 30, 2016, merchant card income was $308,000, as compared to 
      $286,000 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015. The 
      Company’s mortgage origination revenue for the three month period ended 
      September 30, 2016, was $415,000, as compared to $345,000 for the three 
      month period ended September 30, 2015. For the three month period ended 
      September 30, 2016, financial services income was $131,000, as compared 
      to $186,000 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015.
    

      For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, non-interest income 
      was $5.9 million, as compared to $5.7 million for the nine month period 
      ended September 30, 2015. The increase in non-interest income for the 
      nine month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine 
      month period ended September 30, 2015, is largely the result of a 
      $353,000 increase in mortgage origination revenue. For the nine month 
      period ended September 30, 2016, other operating income was $568,000, as 
      compared to $483,000 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. 
      For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, gains on the sale of 
      securities were $422,000, a decline of $130,000 as compared to the nine 
      month period ended September 30, 2016.
    

Non-interest Expense


      On a linked quarter basis, the Company’s non-interest expenses declined 
      by $256,000. On a linked quarter basis, the most significant increases 
      in operating expenses was a $40,000 increase in data processing expenses 
      and a $63,000 increase in professional services expenses. For the three 
      month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company’s salaries and 
      benefits expenses declined by $144,000 and other operating expense 
      declined by $140,000, respectively, as compared to the three month 
      period ended June 30, 2016. During the three month period ended 
      September 30, 2016, the Company sold real estate accounted for a fixed 
      asset for a gain of $72,000.
    

      For the three month period ended September 30, 2016, non-interest 
      expenses declined by $200,000 as compared to the three month period 
      ended September 30, 2015. For the three month period ended September 30, 
      2016, salaries and benefits expense declined by $203,000 as compared to 
      the three month period ended September 30, 2015. For the three month 
      period ended September 30, 2016, other non-interest expense declined by 
      $67,000 as compared to the three month period ended September 30, 2015. 
      For the three month period ended September 30, 2016, no other 
      non-interest expense items increased or decreased by more than $50,000 
      as compared to the three month period ended September 30, 2015.

      expenses were $22.7 million, a decline of $612,000 as compared to the

      ended September 30, 2016, expense items changing by more than $100,000

Balance Sheet


      At September 30, 2016, consolidated assets were $871.9 million, a

      month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company experienced a $14.0 
      million decrease in time deposits, a $4.0 million decrease in FHLB 
      borrowings, a $25.3 million decrease in cash balances and a $22.7

      balances and reduction in FHLB borrowings and time deposits, the Company 
      has reduced its balance in available for sale securities by $23.9 
      million, to $213.3 million at September 30, 2016, as compared to
