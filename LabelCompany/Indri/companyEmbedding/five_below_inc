Five Below's CEO: Brick And Mortar Is 'Cake,' Online Is Just The 'Icing'

Benzinga's Option Alert Recap From July 17 

At a time when most retailers are closing stores or at the very least not planning to open new ones, Five Below Inc (NASDAQ: FIVE) is an outlier as the company has plans to open 100 new stores.
The company's secret? Offer customers an incredible customer experience or tremendous value. But in Five Below's case, the company offers both, at least according to its CEO Joel Anderson.
"You go in our store, it's just a store to have fun," he said during CNBC's "Squawk Box" segment on Wednesday. "Let go and just have fun. If you can offer value and a great store experience you are going to win."
But Five Below has another secret up its sleeve to win in the retail space: Do the opposite of what everyone else is doing. At a time when retailers are placing more emphasis on online channels perhaps at the expense of brick-and-mortar, Anderson sees its physical stores as the "cake" and online is merely the "icing."
Finally, one of the biggest cases against owning Five Below is the company's large exposure to fidget spinners and once the trend fades so will the company. Anderson isn't in the least bit convinced and noted his store is a "trend retailer" that has been front-and-center in some of the hottest trends over the years, including Disney's "Frozen," selfie sticks and Shopkins.

Five Below's CEO: Brick And Mortar Is 'Cake,' Online Is Just The 'Icing' 

Watch These 5 Huge Call Purchases In Tuesday Trade 


 
Five Below Inc (NASDAQ: FIVE) is a standout in the retail sector at a time when many companies are lowering their footprint by closing stores Five Below is looking to open new ones.
Five Below's status as a retail standout helped boost shares higher by nearly 15 percent since the start of 2017 but not all among the Street remain bullish. UBS's Michael Lasser downgrades Five Below's stock rating from Buy to Neutral with a price target slashed from $59 to $52 for two reasons: fidget spinners and the stock's valuation.
First, Five Below's recent momentum is in part due to the immense popularity of fidget spinners. But now the company is forced to "quickly recognize and react" to the fact that the toy's popularity is fading and will be forced to manage down its inventory, Lasser noted (see his track record here).
In fact, the company has already become promotional and is offering two fidget spinners for $5 or one for $3.
Second, Five Below's stock valuation has "hung in there better than most retailers" and is now trading at 27x on a next-twelve-month basis, the analyst continued. This represents a 65 percent premium versus the hardline and broader group average and marks an expansion from the 50 percent premium the stock traded at to start 2017.
Finally, Five Below is still at the end of the day a retailer and at the very least the negative perception of poor overall trends could act as an "overhang" for the stock.
At time of publication, shares of Five Below were down 3.14 percent at $46.36.

Five Below has opened for business at the Cullman Shopping Center.


Tiffeny Owens | The Cullman Times




















































Five Below has opened for business at the Cullman Shopping Center, filling the vacancy left by Hancock Fabrics’ abrupt closure last year.
Five Below sells novelty items — all priced at $5 or less — for teens and pre-teens and is set to officially open today. However, customers got a sneak peek at merchandise Thursday, with several popping in to check out the new shop. 







The Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based chain has more than 500 stores in 32 states, with the forthcoming Cullman location among the 100 new stores opening this year, according to the company. The retailer will occupy the space where Hancock Fabric briefly opened in October 2015 before closing when it filed for bankruptcy. Five Below sells an assortment of cell phone cases and chargers, remote control cars, yoga pants, graphic tees, nail polish, footballs and soccer balls, candy and seasonal must-haves for Easter, Halloween, Christmas and more.

PHILADELPHIA, PA, July  18, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Five Below, Inc. (NASDAQ:FIVE), a leading high-growth, value retailer of merchandise for teens, pre-teens and beyond, will celebrate the five year anniversary of its stock market listing with a visit to the Nasdaq MarketSite in Times Square tomorrow, July 19th. In honor of this celebration, Joel Anderson, President and CEO of Five Below, will ring the Opening Bell at 9:30 a.m. EDT. “We are incredibly proud of Five Below’s growth and success. At the time of our IPO, we had just 215 stores in 18 states and approximately $300 million in revenue. Today, we operate over 575 stores across 32 states with revenue exceeding $1 billion,” stated Anderson. “Our stores have performed consistently across different geographies and in urban, suburban and semi-rural environments. With potential for over 2,000 stores in the U.S. alone, we believe a substantial runway for growth lies ahead of us. Our continued strong performance in 2017 gives us confidence in achieving our long-term objective of delivering 20 percent top-line and over 20 percent bottom-line growth through 2020.” Anderson continued, “I’d like to thank our loyal customers, who inspire us to deliver WOW! every day. I could not be more proud of our associates who work tirelessly to delight our customers and enable us to deliver fresh, exciting trend-right products and a fun in-store experience.

The Fidget Spinner Craze Could Fade, But This Store Won’t
Five Below has thrived as fidget spinners have thrilled children and adults alike, but the discount chain has even more going for it.

Five Below benefitted from the fidget-spinner craze, and two analysts argue that investors should stay the course even as the toys potentially fade in popularity.

 Even as the fidget spinner fad fades, enthusiasm for discount retailer Five Below remains, at least among Wall Street analysts. “We regard sales momentum tied to Fidget Spinner (and other one-hit wonders) as well as the typical seasonal weakness in the shares as ‘noise,’” Guggenheim’s John Heinbockel wrote Tuesday. He’s encouraged by some store redesigns and new marketing strategies, and he thinks shares could hit $60, 25% above current levels.

   Five Below shares rose considerably ahead of the company’s most recent earnings report, but have fallen since then amid concerns that people won’t go to the stores as much now that fidget spinners have become less cool. Nonetheless, analysts are responding positively to a handful of redesigned store locations, which could be “seeing a meaningful sales/traffic lift,” according to MKM analyst Pat McKeever. New signage and graphics seem to be well received by customers.  Retail investors remain on edge as Amazon adds Prime members and expands into new business areas, but McKeever argues that consumers still want the “treasure hunt” experience they get from Five Below. “While we’re not going to suggest Five Below is ‘Amazon proof,’ we do think the company is relatively well insulated,” he wrote, thanks to its steady growth and unique shopping experience.   Big Picture: Investors have been trading Five Below shares based on their impressions of the fidget spinner craze, but two analysts say there’s more to the company than fads.

In September 2014, the company announced a new lease agreement to move its New Castle, Delaware distribution center to Oldmans Township, New Jersey.[pr 3] The new center would add 275 jobs to the local economy while Delaware would lose 175.[10]

Fundraising[edit]
The company offers a unique fundraising opportunity for non-profit groups. Stores can partner with local groups to set up a "FUNdraising" opportunity, where anyone with an invitation from the group can come in during a pre-selected time period, and shop. 10% of the sales created by shoppers with invitations will be donated back to the organization.
Philanthropy[edit]
Since 2005, the company has contributed over $1 million for organizations around the country who focus on childhood well-being. They have partnered with and supported Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation with the sale of lemonade bracelets, gift cards and pin-ups which, to date, has resulted in over $300,000 being donated.
Since 2008, they have participated in the annual Halloween Promotion benefiting St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Their fundraising has raised over $900,000 for the hospital.
After Superstorm Sandy, the company partnered with the American Red Cross and collect over $50,000 through a $1 donation at the register program. They then doubled all donations resulting in a donation in the total of $100,000.

In September 2014, the company announced a new lease agreement to move its New Castle, Delaware distribution center to Oldmans Township, New Jersey.[pr 3] The new center would add 275 jobs to the local economy while Delaware would lose 175.[10]

Stores can partner with local groups to set up a "FUNdraising" opportunity, where anyone with an invitation from the group can come in during a pre-selected time period, and shop. 10% of the sales created by shoppers with invitations will be donated back to the organization.
Philanthropy[edit]
Since 2005, the company has contributed over $1 million for organizations around the country who focus on childhood well-being. They have partnered with and supported Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation with the sale of lemonade bracelets, gift cards and pin-ups which, to date, has resulted in over $300,000 being donated.
Since 2008, they have participated in the annual Halloween Promotion benefiting St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Their fundraising has raised over $900,000 for the hospital.
After Superstorm Sandy, the company partnered with the American Red Cross and collect over $50,000 through a $1 donation at the register program. They then doubled all donations resulting in a donation in the total of $100,000.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

History[edit]




Five Below in Durham, North Carolina.


In October 2002, Five Below was founded by David Schlessinger, founder of Encore Books and Zany Brainy, and Tom Vellios who was the former CEO of Zany Brainy.
The first Five Below location opened up at the Gateway Shopping Center in Wayne, Pennsylvania on October 4, 2002.[5]
Growth[edit]
As of July 2017[update], Five Below has over 590 stores in 32 states,[6] and two distribution centres. It began its outward expansion away from the Philadelphia Metro area by entering the Illinois and Michigan markets in 2011;[pr 1] Georgia, Kansas, Missouri and Western Michigan in 2012;[pr 2] Texas in 2013;[7] Tennessee in 2014; Alabama, Florida and Kentucky in 2015; Louisiana, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin in 2016. [8] California received their first stores in 2017; Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah will have theirs later this year.
In 2011, the company moved its corporate headquarters to a larger location in Philadelphia, PA. The building into which it moved includes other well-known companies such as Merrill Lynch, the American College of Radiology, eResearch Technology and Philadelphia Magazine.[9]
In September 2014, the company announced a new lease agreement to move its New Castle, Delaware distribution center to Oldmans Township, New Jersey.[pr 3] The new center would add 275 jobs to the local economy while Delaware would lose 175.[10]

Fundraising[edit]
The company offers a unique fundraising opportunity for non-profit groups. Stores can partner with local groups to set up a "FUNdraising" opportunity, where anyone with an invitation from the group can come in during a pre-selected time period, and shop. 10% of the sales created by shoppers with invitations will be donated back to the organization.
Philanthropy[edit]
Since 2005, the company has contributed over $1 million for organizations around the country who focus on childhood well-being. They have partnered with and supported Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation with the sale of lemonade bracelets, gift cards and pin-ups which, to date, has resulted in over $300,000 being donated.
Since 2008, they have participated in the annual Halloween Promotion benefiting St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Their fundraising has raised over $900,000 for the hospital.
After Superstorm Sandy, the company partnered with the American Red Cross and collect over $50,000 through a $1 donation at the register program. They then doubled all donations resulting in a donation in the total of $100,000.

Inside of Five Below store, Saginaw, Michigan.


While products at Five Below can be from any category, some items carried by the store include trading cards, sports related items, games, fashion accessories, bath and body related items, candy, beverages, room decorations, school supplies and stationery, books, accessories for electronics, DVDs, computer software, novelty items and gag items, as well as seasonal items.[4]
History[edit]




Five Below in Durham, North Carolina.


In October 2002, Five Below was founded by David Schlessinger, founder of Encore Books and Zany Brainy, and Tom Vellios who was the former CEO of Zany Brainy.
The first Five Below location opened up at the Gateway Shopping Center in Wayne, Pennsylvania on October 4, 2002.[5]
Growth[edit]
As of July 2017[update], Five Below has over 590 stores in 32 states,[6] and two distribution centres. It began its outward expansion away from the Philadelphia Metro area by entering the Illinois and Michigan markets in 2011;[pr 1] Georgia, Kansas, Missouri and Western Michigan in 2012;[pr 2] Texas in 2013;[7] Tennessee in 2014; Alabama, Florida and Kentucky in 2015; Louisiana, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin in 2016. [8] California received their first stores in 2017; Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah will have theirs later this year.
In 2011, the company moved its corporate headquarters to a larger location in Philadelphia, PA. The building into which it moved includes other well-known companies such as Merrill Lynch, the American College of Radiology, eResearch Technology and Philadelphia Magazine.[9]
In September 2014, the company announced a new lease agreement to move its New Castle, Delaware distribution center to Oldmans Township, New Jersey.[pr 3] The new center would add 275 jobs to the local economy while Delaware would lose 175.[10]
Fundraisers and philanthropy[edit]





This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (December 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Fundraising[edit]
The company offers a unique fundraising opportunity for non-profit groups. Stores can partner with local groups to set up a "FUNdraising" opportunity, where anyone with an invitation from the group can come in during a pre-selected time period, and shop. 10% of the sales created by shoppers with invitations will be donated back to the organization.
Philanthropy[edit]
Since 2005, the company has contributed over $1 million for organizations around the country who focus on childhood well-being.

Products and supplies[edit]




Inside of Five Below store, Saginaw, Michigan.


While products at Five Below can be from any category, some items carried by the store include trading cards, sports related items, games, fashion accessories, bath and body related items, candy, beverages, room decorations, school supplies and stationery, books, accessories for electronics, DVDs, computer software, novelty items and gag items, as well as seasonal items.[4]
History[edit]




Five Below in Durham, North Carolina.


In October 2002, Five Below was founded by David Schlessinger, founder of Encore Books and Zany Brainy, and Tom Vellios who was the former CEO of Zany Brainy.
The first Five Below location opened up at the Gateway Shopping Center in Wayne, Pennsylvania on October 4, 2002.[5]
Growth[edit]
As of July 2017[update], Five Below has over 590 stores in 32 states,[6] and two distribution centres. It began its outward expansion away from the Philadelphia Metro area by entering the Illinois and Michigan markets in 2011;[pr 1] Georgia, Kansas, Missouri and Western Michigan in 2012;[pr 2] Texas in 2013;[7] Tennessee in 2014; Alabama, Florida and Kentucky in 2015; Louisiana, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin in 2016. [8] California received their first stores in 2017; Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah will have theirs later this year.
In 2011, the company moved its corporate headquarters to a larger location in Philadelphia, PA. The building into which it moved includes other well-known companies such as Merrill Lynch, the American College of Radiology, eResearch Technology and Philadelphia Magazine.[9]
In September 2014, the company announced a new lease agreement to move its New Castle, Delaware distribution center to Oldmans Township, New Jersey.[pr 3] The new center would add 275 jobs to the local economy while Delaware would lose 175.[10]
Fundraisers and philanthropy[edit]





This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (December 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Fundraising[edit]
The company offers a unique fundraising opportunity for non-profit groups. Stores can partner with local groups to set up a "FUNdraising" opportunity, where anyone with an invitation from the group can come in during a pre-selected time period, and shop. 10% of the sales created by shoppers with invitations will be donated back to the organization.
Philanthropy[edit]
Since 2005, the company has contributed over $1 million for organizations around the country who focus on childhood well-being. They have partnered with and supported Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation with the sale of lemonade bracelets, gift cards and pin-ups which, to date, has resulted in over $300,000 being donated.
Since 2008, they have participated in the annual Halloween Promotion benefiting St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Their fundraising has raised over $900,000 for the hospital.
After Superstorm Sandy, the company partnered with the American Red Cross and collect over $50,000 through a $1 donation at the register program. They then doubled all donations resulting in a donation in the total of $100,000.
