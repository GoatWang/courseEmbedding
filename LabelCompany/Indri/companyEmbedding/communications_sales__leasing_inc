NEW YORK, April 21, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Communications Sales & Leasing Inc.  (NASD:CSALV) will replace Cliffs Natural Resources (NYSE:  CLF) in the S&P MidCap 400 after the close of trading on Friday, April 24. S&P MidCap 400 constituent Windstream Holdings Inc. (NASD:WIN) is spinning off Communications Sales & Leasing in a transaction expected to be completed on or about that date pending final conditions. Windstream will remain in the S&P MidCap 400 following the spin-off transaction. Cliff Natural Resources has a market capitalization below $800 million and is no longer representative of the mid-cap market space.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Communications Sales & Leasing,Inc. (NASDAQ:UNIT) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?)

Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 7 Buy Ratings, 1 Strong Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 3.13)Consensus Price Target: $32.20 (22.11% upside)

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Communications Sales & Leasing, Inc. Formed Through Spinoff
Creates First REIT Focused on Communication Distribution Systems



















April 24, 2015 17:30 ET

 | Source: Uniti Group Inc.





LITTLE ROCK, Ark., April 24, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Communications Sales & Leasing, Inc., or CS&L, (Nasdaq: CSAL) today announced its formation as a public company with the completion of its spinoff from Windstream Holdings, Inc. ("Windstream"), creating what we believe to be the first real estate investment trust ("REIT") focused on acquiring and leasing communication distribution systems. CS&L's stock begins trading Monday, April 27, 2015, on the Nasdaq exchange under the symbol "CSAL." The company will be a member of the S&P 400 Midcap Index and expects to pay an annual dividend of $2.40 per share.

	"We are excited today to launch our new company, Communications Sales & Leasing," said Kenny Gunderman, president and chief executive officer of CS&L. "We have assembled a leadership team with deep experience in telecommunications, REITs, capital markets and mergers and acquisitions. We look forward to growing our company and generating solid returns for shareholders."

	Under the terms of the previously announced deal, Windstream today distributed approximately 80.1 percent of CS&L shares to Windstream shareholders of record as of 5 p.m. EDT on April 10, 2015. An ex-date of April 27, 2015, has been established by Nasdaq, so all trades through the close of business on April 24, 2015 carry the right to receive this distribution.

	Windstream shareholders retained their Windstream shares and received one share of CS&L for every five shares of Windstream held. The spinoff is expected to be a tax-free distribution to Windstream shareholders and requires no action on their part. The two companies expect CS&L shares to be deposited into shareholders' accounts by April 30. Windstream shareholders will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares for amounts of less than one CS&L share.

	In connection with the spinoff, CS&L completed its previously announced issuances of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2023 (the "Secured Notes") and $1.11 billion aggregate principal amount of the 8.25% Senior Notes due 2023 (the "Senior Notes" and, together with the Secured Notes, the "Notes"). CS&L initially issued all of the Notes to Windstream's subsidiary, Windstream Services, LLC ("Windstream Services"), which Windstream Services used to exchange for, and retire, certain of its outstanding indebtedness. Additionally, CS&L entered into a senior secured credit agreement consisting of a $2.14 billion term loan B facility with a maturity of seven and a half years and a $500 million revolving credit facility with a maturity of five years. A portion of the term loan facility was funded in cash and a portion was issued to Windstream Services, both of which CS&L used to acquire the communication distribution system assets from Windstream. The term facility bears interest at a rate equal to, at the company's option, either a base rate plus an applicable margin equal to 3.00% or a eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin equal to 4.00%. The Notes and the new credit facilities are guaranteed by certain of CS&L's subsidiaries. All obligations under the Secured Notes and the new credit facilities, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by certain of the assets of CS&L and the guarantors.

	Real estate investment trusts are used for real property assets that produce rental income. In 2014, Windstream obtained a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service confirming that certain telecommunications network assets constitute real estate assets under applicable REIT rules. With the close of the transaction, CS&L now owns 64,000 route miles of fiber, 235,000 route miles of copper, central office land and buildings across 29 states. CS&L will lease those assets back to Windstream through a 15-year, triple-net lease.

	"We expect to diversify our tenant base by acquiring additional assets and leasing them to other local, regional and national telecommunications providers," Gunderman said. "This a great day for Communications Sales & Leasing, and we look forward to a bright future."

About CS&L

	CS&L (Nasdaq:CSAL), an S&P 400 Midcap Index company headquartered in Little Rock, Ark., is an internally managed triple-net-lease real estate investment trust. To our knowledge, CS&L is the first REIT primarily engaged in the acquisition and leasing of communication distribution systems. CS&L currently owns 64,000 route miles of fiber, 235,000 route miles of copper and central office land and buildings across 29 states which it leases to a single tenant. Additional information about CS&L can be found on its website at www.cslreit.com.

	Certain statements in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical statements of fact and those regarding our intent, belief or expectations, including, but not limited to, statements regarding: tax treatment of the spinoff, growth prospects and expectations regarding the payment of dividends.

	Words such as "anticipate(s)," "expect(s)," "intend(s)," "plan(s)," "believe(s)," "may," "will," "would," "could," "should," "seek(s)" and similar expressions, or the negative of these terms, are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could lead to actual results differing materially from those projected, forecasted or expected. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects or which could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include, but are not limited to: the ability to achieve some or all the benefits that we expect to achieve from the spinoff; the ability and willingness of Windstream to meet and/or perform its obligations under any contractual arrangements that are entered into with us in connection with the spinoff; the availability of and the ability to identify suitable acquisition opportunities and the ability to acquire and lease the respective properties on favorable terms; the ability to generate sufficient cash flows to service our outstanding indebtedness; access to debt and equity capital markets; fluctuating interest rates; the ability to retain our key management personnel; the ability to qualify or maintain our status as a REIT; changes in the U.S. tax law and other state, federal or local laws, whether or not specific to REITs; covenants in our debt agreements that may limit our operational flexibility; risks inherent in the communications industry; other risks inherent in the ownership of communication distribution systems, including potential liability relating to environmental matters and illiquidity of real estate investments; and additional factors discussed in the Risk Factors section of our Information Statement filed on Form 8-K with the SEC on March 26, 2015, and in our subsequent filings with the SEC.

	CS&L expressly disclaims any obligation to release publicly any updates or revisions to any of the forward looking statements set forth in this press release to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any statement is based.

 The Issuers intend to initially issue all of the Notes to Windstream Services as partial consideration for the contribution of select telecommunications network assets, including fiber and copper networks and other real estate, of Windstream Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq:WIN) ("Parent"), the parent of Windstream Services, and its subsidiaries to CS&L and its subsidiaries, in anticipation of Parent's proposed pro rata distribution of at least 80.1% of the shares of common stock of CS&L (the "Spin-Off") to the Parent's shareholders. The Spin-Off is more fully described in CS&L's Information Statement on Form 10 filed by CS&L with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on March 26, 2015.


 The Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or any state securities law, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. The Notes will be offered only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A under the Securities Act and outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer or sale would be unlawful.

About Communications Sales & Leasing


 Following the Spin-Off, CS&L will become, upon its election, a publicly traded, self-administered real estate investment trust ("REIT") primarily engaged in the ownership, acquisition and leasing of communication distribution systems. CS&L expects to generate revenues primarily by leasing communications distribution systems to telecommunications operators in triple-net lease arrangements, under which the tenant is primarily responsible for costs relating to the distribution systems (including property taxes, insurance, and maintenance and repair costs). To our knowledge, CS&L will be the first REIT focused on acquiring and building communication distribution systems, and will seek to grow its portfolio by pursuing opportunities to acquire additional communications distribution systems to lease to communication service providers on a triple-net basis. CS&L also anticipates diversifying 
its portfolio over time, including potentially acquiring other real property assets within or outside of the communications infrastructure industry to lease to third parties.
