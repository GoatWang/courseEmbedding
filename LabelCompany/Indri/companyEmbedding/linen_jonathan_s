BUSINESS PEOPLE
BUSINESS PEOPLE; American Express Rewards 2 Executives


By SETH FAISON Jr.


Published: February 19, 1992









                    Two executives of the American Express Company who helped clean up messy situations in separate branches of the company's financial-services business in 1990 were rewarded with promotions yesterday.        

                    Jonathan S. Linen, who was sent to stop the financial hemorrhaging at the Shearson Lehman Brothers division nearly two years ago, was named president and chief operating officer of the Travel Related Services unit. He will serve under Harvey Golub, the unit's chairman and chief executive, effective March 1.        

                    John R. Laird, dispatched in 1990 to rescue another American Express unit, the Boston Company, the money management and banking subsidiary, succeeds Mr. Linen as the president and chief executive of the Shearson Lehman Brothers division, the retail brokerage operation. He will remain chairman and chief executive of the Boston Company.        

                    In a letter to colleagues announcing the changes, Mr. Golub wrote that the Travel Related Services unit had "undertaken a thorough re-examination of our businesses and cost structures" in recent months. Mr. Linen, he wrote, will take daily responsibility for carrying out plans to expand the unit's travel-management businesses, reposition its consumer lending operation and improve overall efficiency.        

                    G. Richard Thoman, who as vice chairman of Travel Related Services was repsonsible for its international business, will resign on June 1.        

                    Mr. Linen, 48 years old, is a career American Express employee who once described himself as a contrarian who likes to come into a business when things are at their worst. When he was sent to Shearson, he arrived on the heels of record losses.        

                    "We were on the ropes," Mr. Linen said yesterday of the situation at Shearson. "Morale was terrible, business was bad."        

                    During his tenure, Mr. Linen said, spending was brought under control, fixed costs were cut by 25 percent, and the operation became more client-focused.        

                    As for his task at Travel Related Services, he said: "We have some work to do. We have to get people feeling good about coming to work in the morning."        

                    Before May 1990, Mr. Linen was one of three American Express executives who made up the president's office of the Travel Related Services operation, responsible for the direct-marketing and traveler's checks group. He will now be the operation's sole president.        

                    Mr. Linen is said to be close to James D. Robinson 3d, the chairman and chief executive of American Express, and to Howard L. Clark Jr., the chairman and chief executive of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., which includes the Shearson Lehman Brothers division, the Lehman Brothers Inc. investment banking unit and the Boston Company.        

                    When Mr. Linen joined American Express in 1969, he worked as an assistant to Mr. Clark's father, Howard L. Clark Sr., who was chairman then. He has worked in several sections of the company, including retail travel-Europe, service establishment marketing and sales, and marketing and sales, where he was president.        

                    "At heart, I'm a T.R.S. person," he said, referring to Travel Related Services and describing himself as "a marketer first" with all-around skills as a general manager.        

                    "A lot of good managing is figuring out what you're not good at and getting support for it," he said.        

                    Mr. Laird, 49, became the chairman and chief executive of the Boston Company in March 1990, just as the unit was in turmoil. The former president, James N. von Germeten, was removed after American Express decided that after-tax earnings for the first three quarters of 1988 were overstated by $30 million.        

                    Before joining the Boston Company, Mr. Laird worked at American Express for 12 years in a variety of financial-management positions. Yesterday, Mr. Clark credited Mr. Laird with significantly improving the Boston Company's asset quality, revenues and strategic focus.

The appointments will become effective at the Company’s next Board meeting on Jan. 28.”Dave Dorman and Jon Linen will make outstanding additions to the Yum! Brands Board of Directors. Dave leads one of the largest communications services companies in the world, and has extensive experience in the technology solutions which are critically important to our restaurant operations. Jon Linen’s global expertise at one of the world’s leading service brands will greatly complement our desire to satisfy our customers better than any other restaurant company,” said David C. Novak, Yum! Brands Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Prior to assuming his current position, Dorman served as president of AT&T Corp., and prior to that as CEO of Concert, the global venture created by AT&T and British Telecommunications. He has a long career in the telecommunications business, having also served as president of Sprint Business, and as chairman, CEO and president of Pacific Bell.

Linen has risen through the American Express ranks over a 35-year career, and assumed his current position in 1993. As Vice Chairman, he is responsible for representing the company with its key corporate and government clients, business partners, industry associations and current and potential joint venture partners. He is a member of the American Express Global Leadership Team, responsible for establishing the company’s overall strategic direction. Previously, he served as president and chief operating officer of American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc., and as president and chief executive officer of Shearson Lehman Brothers.

Four of the company’s restaurant brands — KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and Long John Silver’s — are the global leaders of the chicken, pizza, Mexican-style food and quick-service seafood categories respectively. Yum!

Brands’ system opened about three new restaurants each day of the year, making it one of the fastest growing retailers in the world. In 2002, the company changed its name to Yum! Brands Inc. from Tricon Global Restaurants Inc. to reflect its expanding portfolio of brands and its ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange. For the past two years, the company has been recognized in Fortune Magazine’s top 50 “Best Companies for Minorities,” claiming the number-one spot for “managerial diversity.”

Sadly No












Verified Purchase


Style is excellent and trendy, quality for price was fantastic, dress fits very oddly on my size 12 body.  The top ends directly after the bust and the rest is form fitting.  It fit the same way on my friend so it wasn't just me.  I don't know maybe it's the over 40 body type?  Definately going back.

Super cute












Verified Purchase


This dress was super cute. I  ordered it ina misses sz 16 and it fit perfectly. Except for two things? The first night I wore i popped two buttons at the bottom and It wrinkles a lot like linen  but i got lots of compliments.

Liked the dress overall












Verified Purchase


This is a nice feminine dress.  The reason I did not give it 5 starts is because the last 3 buttons pop off very easily if you're not careful.  I drives a honda pilot SUV which sits high off the ground and I have to be careful about how i get into the car or the buttons will pop off.  Luckily this happened after I left church on Sunday. I liked this dress so much, so I had a seamstress to sew down the front to the last button and I sewed the buttons back on since it adds to the style of the dress.
