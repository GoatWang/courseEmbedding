Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Richard Glanton



        Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_GlantonUpdated: 2016-03-22T01:58Z
      
Richard GlantonRichard H. Glanton is a Georgia-born entrepreneur based in Princeton, N.J. He is Founder, CEO and President of ElectedFace, Inc., a company that operates a social-media platform launched in early 2016. ElectedFace is a centralized social-media platform that connects elected officials to constituents supporters and followers; colleges and universities to students, faculties, alumni and families; businesses to employees, customers and target markets; faith-based organizations to the faithful, and celebrities to fans and followers. ElectedFace shares advertising revenues with institutional users and elected officials based upon their activity time and connections. ElectedFace connects users globally through a High Definition browser-based video facility for everyone who wants to see the person to whom he or she is connected. Additional features encourage interaction on a local, regional, national and global level with individuals and organizations of all types.[1][2]Contents1 Background1.1 Early years1.2 College education1.3 Law school1.4 Employment history2 Personal life2.1 Barnes Foundation2.2 Board directorships2.3 Civic and political activity3 ReferencesBackgroundEarly yearsGlanton was one of 11 children born to Herbert and Norace Glanton on November 21, 1946, near Villa Rica, Ga., where his father was a farmer. He suffered chronic asthma symptoms as a child, so his mother home-schooled him until the third grade since the school he would have otherwise attended was a one-room wooden structure located more than a mile’s walk along a dirt road. Starting in third grade, he attended a segregated public school for African-Americans. The school, Glanton-Hindsman Elementary in Villa Rica, Ga., is named after his late grandmother and third-grade teacher, Jeannie Glanton, and another person.[3]Glanton graduated from Carver High School in Carrollton, Ga. in 1964. He was elected president of his junior class and vice president of his senior class. He was editor-in-chief of his high school’s yearbook under the supervision of his English teacher, C. B. Ward, and was on his high school newspaper editorial staff.[4] Glanton graduated from high school in 1964.[5] Carver High School was a segregated public high school for Americans of African descent residing in Carroll County, Georgia in the 1950s and 1960s.[3]College educationGlanton and fellow high school classmates accepted an invitation from the late Dr. James E. Boyd, former President of West Georgia College, to attend the dedication of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Chapel at West Georgia. The late Senator Robert F. Kennedy delivered the dedication. Glanton graduated from West Georgia College (now the University of West Georgia) in 1968.[6] The university later named a scholarship, the Richard H. Glanton Presidential Endowment, in his honor. Mr. Glanton was the first full-time African-American male student admitted to and to graduate from West Georgia College in the Class of 1968 with a B.A. Degree in English. Glanton was co-captain of the college debate team in 1967-68. Glanton also received an honorary doctorate degree from his alma mater in 2005, in recognition of his accomplishments as president of the Barnes Foundation.[7]Law schoolGlanton graduated from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1972.[8] He was the first recipient of the Robert F. Kennedy Scholarship at UVA in his second year, 1971. The scholarship was established to honor the memory of then recently assassinated Senator Kennedy, who had graduated from the school in 1951.[9]Employment historyUpon graduation from law school, Glanton joined Huie & Harland (later known as Kutal Rock and Huie), in Atlanta.[10] He worked in litigation on challenges to the constitutionality of the legislation that created Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, among other matters. Glanton accepted a position with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. He remained there until 1975, serving as the executive assistant to the late EEOC chairman, John H. Powell, Jr.[11]Glanton accepted a staff attorney position with United Airlines’ legal department in Elk Grove, IL in 1975. He handled employment discrimination matters, labor disputes involving arbitrations under collective bargaining agreements and litigation. In 1978, he began a one-year stint at Consolidated Rail Corp., hiring and supervising lawyers representing Conrail in commercial litigation in 13 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces.[12]Pennsylvania Governor Richard Thornburgh appointed Glanton executive deputy counsel in 1979. Glanton served as a key adviser and member of the governor’s executive staff vested with legal and executives duties until 1983. He supervised 150 lawyers in various executive legal departments of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as well as five Thornburgh administration cabinet members.[13][14] In March 1983, Glanton joined Wolf Block, a Philadelphia law firm, as a partner in its corporate department.[15] In 1987, Glanton joined Reed Smith as a partner in its Philadelphia office.[16]In 1991, Kathleen Frederick, a female associate whose employment was terminated for poor performance, sued both Reed Smith and Glanton for sex discrimination, sexual harassment and defamation under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.[17] The case was tried before a jury of 11 whites and 1 black that found Frederick was fired for cause. The jury further found Glanton sexually harassed Frederick but awarded $1 in damages. The jury did not clarify in its finding what alleged action by Glanton constituted harassment. Glanton denied Frederick’s claim of sexual harassment as a murderous lie.[18] Glanton called Frederick crazy and sick in her head.[19] Frederick was awarded $125,000 damages for libel. On appeal, a settlement was entered into and the jury verdict was vacated.[20][21] Glanton resigned from Reed Smith in 2003 and joined Exelon as senior vice president of corporate development. He was responsible for mergers and acquisitions and divestitures.[22] Glanton resigned from Exelon in 2008 and founded ElectedFace in 2010.Personal lifeGlanton and Scheryl Williams were married in 1974. They have two children, Morgan and David. Glanton and his first wife divorced in February 2009. He married Eileen Marie Candia on September 11, 2009.[23] They too have a daughter, Georgia Frances Glanton, born August 25, 2010.Barnes FoundationIn June 1990, Glanton was elected President of the Barnes Foundation’s Board of Trustees.[24][25] The Barnes collection includes paintings by Cézanne, Matisse, Picasso and many others. Many critics consider the Barnes Foundation the most important collection of modern art in the United States.[26][27][28]When Glanton became President of Barnes, the foundation’s gallery was in dire need of restoration to save the collection.[29] A steam explosion in 1985 had damaged the walls and a number of paintings (which have since been restored); there was no way to monitor the temperature in the building to protect the artworks, and a 1920s electrical system was still in place.[30]Glanton raised more than $20 million to help restore the building by managing a worldwide tour of 61 to 83 selected paintings displayed at seven venues in Asia, Europe and America.[31] The show, From Cézanne to Matisse: Great French Paintings from the Barnes Foundation, took place from 1993 to 1995 and attracted more than 5 million visitors.[32] Glanton was awarded the titles of both Officer and Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters by the late former French president Francois Mitterrand, along with similar awards by the museum of Western Art in Tokyo, Japan; Bavaria; Germany; Ontario, Canada; and Fort Worth, Texas.[33] "As traveling shows go," according to an article in the New York Times, "the Barnes exhibition was one of the most successful in museum history, ranking just behind ‘The Treasures of Tutankhamen,’ a seven-city United States tour that drew more than eight million people between November 1976 and September 1979."[34][35][36]Glanton also created other ways for the foundation to raise funds. For example, he negotiated a contract with Si Newhouse, co-owner of Advance Publications, granting it worldwide publication rights to the show’s catalog. The hardback copy was priced initially at $65, and more than 1 million copies were sold worldwide.[37] This catalog was the very first Barnes Foundation Collection color publication. It was heavily promoted and marketed to attendees at venues where Barnes exhibitions were held.[38] Under Glanton’s stewardship the Barnes Foundation entered into a contract with Continuum, a Bill Gates-controlled non-profit organization, which produced one the first CD-ROMs in 1992 by a major art institution called A Passion for Art.[34] The Barnes Foundation also opened its first gift shop in 1996.[39]Board directorshipsGlanton is a member of the board of directors of Aqua America (WTR) NYSE, GEO Group Inc., (GEO) NYSE and MISTRAS Group, Inc. (MG) NYSE. Glanton has served continuously on public company boards for more than 33 years, including 13 years at Exelon Corp. and its predecessor, the Philadelphia Electric Company.[40]A member of the board of directors of Aqua America Inc. since 1996, Glanton is the lead director and chairman of Investment and Risk Committee and a member of the executive committee.[41] Aqua America is the second largest publicly traded Water Company in the United States providing water and wastewater services to 3 million residents in Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina, Illinois, Texas, New Jersey, Indiana and Virginia.[42] Glanton joined the board of directors of GEO Group Inc.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

A Controversial Man in an Eccentric Place


By CAROL VOGEL


Published: April 4, 1993









MERION, Pa.— 
                    Mention Richard H. Glanton's name to any student or former student at the Barnes Foundation or to anyone connected with the art world or Pennsylvania politics, and you may hear a string of expletives that would make a longshoreman blush.        

                    Mr. Glanton's tenure as president of the Barnes Foundation, which began in 1990 and runs through 1995, has produced several court cases. Every day, Barnes students distribute pamphlets outside the foundation's building here, on the Philadelphia Main Line. The latest is entitled "Grand Scam. How the Trustees Faked It: Renovation Budgets and Other Hoaxes." A billboard on nearby Conshohocken Road accuses the foundation of violating a public trust. (It was paid for by Augustus F. Brown, a retired college professor, who said he was glad to spend $5,500 to educate the public.)        

                    The 46-year-old Mr. Glanton seems unfazed at being perceived as a public enemy. His manner is smug, his speech direct. "You could go off the deep end if you get emotional about all this," he said in his office at the foundation, a cozy, sun-filled space that was once a sitting room. Clad in an impeccable blue suit, Hermes tie, suspenders and Gucci loafers, he looked like something out of central casting for a "Wall Street"-type film about politics.        

                    Part of Mr. Glanton's cool exterior comes from knowing that, for better or worse, he will soon be credited as the man who put the Barnes Foundation on the map. When "Great French Paintings From the Barnes Foundation" opens at the National Gallery of Art in Washington next month and then travels to museums in Paris, Tokyo and Philadelphia, thousands upon thousands of people will be able to see important works by artists like Picasso, Matisse, Manet, Monet, Cezanne and Renoir that have never before left their Pennsylvania home.        

                    From its inception in 1922, the Barnes Foundation has been an eccentric place and sparked highly charged emotions. Its founder, Albert C. Barnes, a manufacturer of patent medicines, amassed a remarkable collection of about 800 paintings and 200 sculptures. In 1926, he began to house them in his new home, which for tax purposes was called the foundation's administrative building. The collection includes about 170 Renoirs, 55 Cezannes and 20 Picassos. Canvases said to be by Titian, Giorgione, Veronese and El Greco (some attributions have been disputed) hang alongside major paintings by Matisse, Seurat, van Gogh and Manet in crowded, idiosyncratic arrangements that also include French Gothic, Colonial and Spanish hardware, porcelains and a mixture of furniture.        

                    The unconventional method of display reflects Barnes's personal mission -- to teach people to look at art in a less rarefied way than scholars do and to see the relationship of painting to daily life. He described the foundation as a place for "plain people, that is men and women who gain their livelihood by daily toil." Hostile to most of the art world, he prevented important collectors like Walter P. Chrysler Jr. and scholars like Meyer Schapiro and Kenneth Clark from viewing the collection. Only in 1961, a decade after Barnes's death, and after the foundation's tax-exempt status had been challenged in court, were its galleries opened to the public, on a limited basis.        

                    Barnes stipulated in the foundation's charter that "no picture belonging to the collection shall ever be loaned, sold or otherwise disposed of, except that if any picture passes into a state of actual decay so that it is no longer of any value it may be removed for that reason only from the collection." Barnes tradition also decreed that no objects could be moved from their places in the galleries. Nor, according to a rule established by Violette De Mazia, a former education director of the foundation, could color photographs be taken of any of the works.        

                    IN 1950, A YEAR BEFORE BARNES died, he unexpectedly turned the fate of the collection over to Lincoln University, a small, predominantly black school about 45 miles from Merion with no reputation for the study of art. He gave the university the power to nominate new trustees as the old ones died or retired. Four of the five current board members were nominated by the university.        

                    Just how Mr. Glanton, a corporate lawyer whose art education consisted of a single college art-appreciation course, became president of the foundation is a matter of debate. There are diametrically opposed versions of how it happened.        

                    Mr. Glanton, who served on Lincoln's board for nearly six years, describes the appointment as a fluke. "Franklin Williams was the president of the Barnes. When he died, members of Lincoln's board nominated me. Two months later I became the Barnes president. It wasn't something I expected."        

                    Another version comes from Richard L. Feigen, a New York art dealer who sat on the Lincoln board and the Barnes art advisory committee, a group formed to advise the Barnes board on its holdings, until he was asked to resign two years ago over a disagreement involving deaccessioning. Mr. Feigen insists that Mr. Glanton's appointment was calculated. "From the beginning, his ambitions were purely political," he said. "In fact, Franklin Williams did everything he could to keep Glanton off the Barnes board. But he finally managed to maneuver himself into the job."
