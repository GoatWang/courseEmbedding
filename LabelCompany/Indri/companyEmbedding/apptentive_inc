About Apptentive | What We Do and How We Got Here










































































We are Apptentive




The Apptentive Story

Apptentive was founded in 2011 by four friends on a mission to make it easier for companies to build stronger relationships with their customers.
We found that most tools were either reactive (waiting for customers to reach out to companies) or too pushy (broadcasting lots of messages that cannot be responded to). We wanted to use software to create a beautiful experience for companies to start conversations with their customers, but also listen to them, respond accordingly, and use insights gained to build a more customer-centric app and company. And create it we did…
In 2012, Apptentive entered TechStars Seattle and raised a seed round involving Google Ventures, Founder’s Co-op, Social Leverage, and Golden Venture Partners. In 2014, we raised a second round lead by SurveyMonkey, and are using it to rapidly grow our team.
Every month, we power millions of customer conversations around the globe and work with the most successful companies in many verticals. We’ve been doing this longer than anyone else, and are privileged to help our customers communicate with their consumers in a personal and scalable manner.
