The country's Hunan TV and the studio have created a template for working together, and "we're not going to try to jam product into China that doesn't make sense," he says.

Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer said Wednesday that a $375 million film-financing deal with Hunan TV came about because the Chinese company was involved in all the right sectors, and he said his studio's future was closely linked to China.
"After a lot of conversations with a lot of people, we felt this was the simplest one that touches all those boxes," Feltheimer told THR in an interview in Changsha, in China's Hunan province, after the deal was formally announced. "They're in film production, distribution, advertising, location-based entertainment business, they are in TV in a major way, they are in the cable business. They stepped up, and we stepped up, and at a certain point we said we were going exclusive."




Under the terms of the deal, Hunan’s wholly owned subsidiary TIK Films will co-finance all qualifying Lionsgate feature films for the next three years, including films such as Gods of Egypt, Now You See Me 2, The Last Witch Hunter, starring Vin Diesel, Sicario and The Age of Adaline, starring Blake Lively and Harrison Ford. 
"The minute this deal was signed, they were already investing in a whole bunch of movies, and they will distribute those movies and co-finance the movies they mentioned. We've created a template [for] working together," said Feltheimer.
Under the terms of the deal, Hunan TV will fund a quarter of Lionsgate’s production costs, or $375 million, with the investment capped at $125 million a year.
Lionsgate's future success is intertwined with China, Feltheimer emphasized.
"China is for sure the number two film market — last month it was number one," the Lionsgate CEO said. "In terms of core business growth, we've got to be here and figure it out. We have to be part of the scene in China for us to be successful over the next five years, and I'm hoping this deal will be a large part of this."
China's regulatory environment is notoriously tricky, but Feltheimer said he did not find it any more difficult than other markets.
"Every market has its own vicissitudes, and you have to be respectful of each of the cultures, and so far it hasn't been a big issue for us," he told THR. "This deal was approved in whatever way it had to be approved. Everybody wants all of our businesses to have no restrictions in any country, but even in Canada, in order to distribute home entertainment you need to follow the Canadian rules, and it's just about as hard to do business there as it is in China. We are respectful of everyone's culture being different, the rules being different, and we try to follow those rules. We have enough content, and if every single thing doesn't play here, then that will be OK."
There has been a lot of discussion about co-productions in China. Official co-productions have a bigger slice of the box office and have better access to the market, but there are few examples of major successes so far.
Feltheimer said that problems have come when people strike a deal without having produced a movie or TV show. "You need to ask: Is that a viable product? Is it repeatable? Is it special? Does it survive the test of time, meaning does it add value to your company? Is it true library product? If it's not, then you probably shouldn't be making it no matter what your co-financing deal is," he explained.
Said Feltheimer: "We're not going to scramble to make Chinese movies that we don't believe in, we're not going to make co-productions that we don't believe in and we're not going to try to jam product into China that doesn't make sense."
He said that one area that would be of particular interest would be developing content based on video games, with the first project to be based on Candy Crush Saga, as well as localizing successful TV shows for the China market, including shows based on Matt Kunitz titles such as Fear Factor.
"We're going to build big production values, build one big set, maybe do three or four different languages on that one set. The core is to find one thing that works for one audience," said Feltheimer.
Feltheimer also spoke of his excitement about the virtual reality business that Lionsgate's Summit Entertainment label is building with Samsung. Among the VR efforts is Insurgent, the second installment in the Divergent franchise. Fans don an Oculus-powered Gear VR headset and enter a 360 degree immersive world where they are captured by Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet) and her Erudite faction.
"When you put that headset on and think of all the applications for home entertainment, sports, gaming — technology keeps creating new and better ways to enjoy entertainment, and for us the key thing is to be really controlling as much intellectual property as we can, not just in the U.S.," said Feltheimer.
Last year, Lionsgate and the Chinese e-commerce colossus Alibaba signed a strategic collaboration deal to offer Lionsgate titles in China, including Divergent and The Twilight Saga: Eclipse and TV shows such as Mad Men, Weeds and The Royals.
The movies and TV shows are available through the Lionsgate Entertainment World (LGEW) service, a subscription streaming service for mainland China that will be available exclusively through Alibaba's set-top box.




Nearly two thirds of Chinese people access content via their cell phones or tablets, and looking ahead, Lionsgate is also keen to expand its presence in mobile.
"You can't ignore mobile. We are doing a lot of stuff in the game space, mostly nonconsole stuff, and those are primarily mobile/pad games. That's going to be a big business, and it's a lot simpler than going for a console game. We don't care what device you watch on, as long as you watch it," said Feltheimer. "To be able to watch something that you start on your television that you then move to your mobile device, I think that's a big benefit for the content business."

For the fiscal year ending March 31, Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer received pay of $6.7 million in pay — 10% of the $66.3 million he made in the previous year, when he received stock awards under a new five-year contract.
The studio made the announcement in a regulatory filing Wednesday.
Feltheimer received a base salary of $1.5 million, $1 million in stock awards, $4.1 million in non-equity incentives and $220,311 in other compensation, which includes $28,043 for club membership dues and $189,347 for personal use of the company aircraft.
Feltheimer also received an $8 million bonus that was half cash and half stock — with the stock portion not being recorded until the end of the current fiscal year. The cash part of the bonus, reported apart from the compensation package, lifts with fiscal year 2015 total to about $10 million.







Lionsgate stock rose 28% in the current fiscal year to reach an all-time high of $38.53 on Wednesday. Wall Street has been impressed with the studio’s focus on margins and its solid performances in film and TV.
Vice chairman Michael Burns earned $8.64 million in the most recent fiscal year — almost the same as the $8.5 million earned in 2014. CFO James Barge earned $3.19 million, down from $5 million.
Motion Picture Group co-president and co-COO Steven Beeks earned $4.2 million, more than double his $1.72 million in 2014. Wayne Levin, general counsel and chief strategic officer, earned $4.88 million in 2015, up sharply from $1.65 million last year.
Lionsgate also disclosed in the filing that it will hold its annual shareholders meeting on Sept. 15 in Toronto during the Toronto Film Festival.

The former producer talks about his niche-to-mass strategy and what's next in the YA space.

This story first appeared in the Jan. 30 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.
When Jon Feltheimer — this year's recipient of the Milestone Award, the guild's highest honor — became CEO of Lionsgate Entertainment in 2000, the word "niche" was an insult. But thanks in part to the way this Brooklyn-born producer has steered his studio for the past 15 years, nobody's turning up their nose at niche anymore.


Read More Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer Leaps Past Les Moonves Among Highest-Paid Media CEOs
He started by identifying core audiences that were being underserved in the marketplace (say, teens who want to see limbs removed with woodworking tools), then overserved them (with seven Saw movies). Meanwhile, he bet on prestige-building art house projects such as Hotel Rwanda and Crash, which beat Brokeback Mountain to win best picture at the 2006 Oscars. He navigated his company through tricky mergers (with Artisan in 2003), engineered ambitious acquisitions (getting into the Twilight business by buying Summit), expanded Lionsgate's TV production to include buzzed-about shows (Mad Men and Orange Is the New Black) and turned YA novels Hunger Games and Divergent into two of the biggest-grossing "niche" franchises of modern times. Now, the company — which raked in $1.78 billion at the worldwide box office in 2014 and nearly half a billion dollars in TV revenue a year earlier — boasts a stock valuation of $5 billion. 
THR asked Feltheimer, 63, about how he chooses his studio's slate, what happens to Lionsgate after Hunger Games and if he could reveal every detail of the final episode of Mad Men.
Lionsgate built itself by appealing to niche audiences, but Hunger Games isn't exactly a niche movie.
If you look at it based on box-office growth or on a worldwide scale, it's definitely not a niche movie. But it's funny; when we thought about Hunger Games initially, we thought about it as a movie that we could start with a core quadrant and expand. We thought about it as within one or two quadrants and how to market it to them.
Read More Sony Hack: Lionsgate Wanted to Discuss Merger, Acquisition
The Hunger Games franchise wraps in November. What's the future for Lionsgate in the YA space?
We're always looking for ways to extend all of our intellectual property. We've seen that's what happened with Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings. So we're always looking for worlds within the IP that we haven't explored yet.
So you're saying something else in the Hunger Games world isn't out of the question?
Not saying specifically for The Hunger Games, but we have other franchises, too. If you look at Divergent, for example, after the third book, [author Veronica Roth] actually put out a novella called Four. There may be other material there. One never knows when we dig into the treasure troves of these brilliant writers what we might find.

Read More Veronica Roth 'Excited to Move On' After Final 'Divergent' Story 'Four' (Q&A)
Can there be another YA franchise as successful as Twilight or Hunger Games? Or has that moment passed?
These franchises are like magic. You can't prescribe them. They come out of the ether a little bit, and then you hope you manage them well enough to make them everything they can be.
Have you seen the final episode of Mad Men?
Oh yes, I try to watch everything we do. I'm not happy that it's ending, but I think Matthew [Weiner] did a wonderful job from beginning to end. I think it's going to always remain as one of the best series ever done. I will say I do feel people have ignored how good the acting is with Jon Hamm never winning an Emmy and the fact that Mad Men didn't get any Golden Globe nominations this year. I feel like it's been so good for so long that people began expecting even more. I think the quality has never gone down on that show, and the acting and writing are amazing. We all need to tip our hats to this incredible group.
Is there anything you know now that you wish you'd known back in 2000 when you became CEO?
Everything! (Laughs.) I feel like I learn something new every day, and that's what's exciting about my job.

Mr. Feltheimer was named Chief Executive Officer of Lionsgate in March 2000.  During his 14-year tenure as CEO, Lionsgate has grown from its independent studio roots into a leading next generation global content leader with a reputation for innovation.  The Company's market capitalization has grown from $80 million in 2000 to nearly $5 billion today, and its revenue has increased more than 15 times over.  During Mr. Feltheimer's tenure as CEO, Lionsgate has established a reputation for leadership in films, television programming and digital content driven by a prestigious 16,000-title library, innovative partnerships with digital platforms, a feature film slate led by the global blockbuster Hunger Games franchise, and a vibrant television business encompassing over 30 shows on more than 20 different networks including multiple Emmy Award winner Mad Men, successes such as Weeds, Anger Management, Nashville and Nurse Jackie and the critically-acclaimed hit Orange is the New Black.  Mr. Feltheimer received MIPCOM’s prestigious “Personality of The Year” Award in October 2010, was inducted into Broadcasting & Cable’s Hall of Fame in October 2012 and received NATPE’s coveted 2014 Brandon Tartikoff Legacy Award, reflecting 30 years of leadership in the global television business.  He has been named to Vanity Fair’s “The New Establishment” list as well as being named one of “America’s Most Inspiring CEO’s” by Esquire Magazine.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/type.object.type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
