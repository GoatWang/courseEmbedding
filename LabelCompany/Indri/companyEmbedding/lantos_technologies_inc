Lantos Technologies Inc.
BioPhotonicsNov 2010

            In Massachusetts, Lantos Technologies Inc. of Cambridge has announced
that it has closed on a $1.6 million deal to develop its 3-D ear canal imaging technology.
Braintree-based Catalyst Health Ventures led the round, which was joined by Boston-based
investors Excel Venture Management and Mass Medical Angels. Lantos’ technology
provides minimally invasive digital mapping of the human ear canal, enabling the
development of custom-fit audio devices such as hearing aids, earphones and noise-canceling
devices. Dubbed emission reabsorption laser-induced fluorescence, the technology
is a new method of 3-D image capture; the intra-aural scanner will be its first
application in the medical field.



 explore related content


GLOSSARYfluorescenceThe emission of light or other electromagnetic radiation of longer wavelengths by a substance as a result of the absorption of some other radiation of shorter wavelengths, provided the emission continues only as long as the stimulus producing it is maintained. In other words, fluorescence is the luminescence that persists for less than about 10-8 s after excitation.
