Linn Energy to form new Oklahoma company

Back to Gallery
















Linn Energy and another oil company will form a new Oklahoma driller with acreage in the Scoop and Stack play in the Anadarko Basin.
RELATED: Linn Energy to sell Wisconsin assets for $581 million
Houston's Linn and Tulsa's Citizen Energy will combine 140,000 net acres of contiguous oil land across Oklahoma, with each taking half of the equity in the new company that will drill up the acreage, Roan Resources.



Linn said Roan will be the first company to focus solely on the Scoop and Stack with a large footprint across the region. The firm plans to drill 58 wells this year with five rigs.
Linn and Citizens expect to take Roan public in early 2018, depending on the market, after its oil production nearly doubles to 40,000 barrels a day over the next few months. Roan's acreage has roughly 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent in resources that could last two decades, the companies said.

History[edit]
Linn Energy was founded in 2003 by Michael Linn.[5]
In 2006, the company became a public company via an initial public offering that raised over $200 million.[6]
In 2007, the company doubled its holdings by purchasing many of the oil and gas assets of Dominion Energy, mainly in Oklahoma, for $2.05 billion.[7]
In 2011, the company announced the retirement of founder Michael Linn.[5]
In March 2012, the company bought the holdings of BP in the Hugoton Natural Gas Area, the large gas-producing region from southwestern Kansas into the Texas Panhandle for $1.2 billion. The purchase included 2,400 active wells on 600,000 acres and a gas processing plant.[8]
Linn expanded its holdings in the Rocky Mountains in June 2012 with the purchase of 12,500 acres in the Jonah Field in southwest Wyoming from BP for approximately $1 billion. The field contains around 750 active natural gas wells which produce, in addition to natural gas, approximately one-quarter natural gas liquids such as butane and propane.[9]
In February 2013, the company acquired Berry Petroleum Company in a stock deal valued at $4.3 billion.[10]
In September 2013, the company announced the acquisition of assets in the Permian Basin for $525 million.[11]
In June 2014, the company announced the acquisition of assets from Devon Energy for $2.3 billion and plans to sell assets in the Granite Wash Basin.[12]
In August 2014, the company announced the acquisition of assets in the Hugoton Natural Gas Area from Pioneer Natural Resources for $340 million. The company also announced the sale of its interests in non-producing acreage in the Anadarko Basin for $90 million.[13]
In March 2016, the company missed a debt payment and announced that a bankruptcy filing was likely.[14] On May 11, 2016, Linn Energy filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection.[15]
In February 2017, the company completed a financial restructuring.[4] The restructuring including the corporate spin-off of Berry Petroleum Company.[4]
Controversies[edit]
On April 3, 2006, Linn Energy announced to delay its filing of Form 10-K to allow restatement of 2003 and 2004 results.The restatement related to adjustments identified by the company relating to the accounting for the price of acquisitions.[16]
On February 8, 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission closed its probe into Linn Energy’s $4.6 billion acquisition of Berry Petroleum and decided to take no enforcement actions.[17]

As of December 31, 2016, the company had 3.5 trillion cubic feet equivalent of estimated proved reserves, of which 17% were petroleum, 65% were natural gas, and 18% were natural gas liquids.[3]
The company controls 2.6 million acres of petroleum and natural producing assets including:[4]

Mid-Continent - properties in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma, including ~185,000 net acres in SCOOP/STACK/Merge[4]
1,100,000 net acres in the Hugoton Natural Gas Area in Kansas[3]
115,000 net acres in the East Texas Oil Field[3]
20,000 net acres in the Williston Basin, which are marketed for sale[3]
90,000 net acres in the Permian Basin in Texas, which are marketed for sale[3]
150,000 net acres in North Louisiana[3]
30,000 net acres in the Jonah Field[3]

History[edit]
Linn Energy was founded in 2003 by Michael Linn.[5]
In 2006, the company became a public company via an initial public offering that raised over $200 million.[6]
In 2007, the company doubled its holdings by purchasing many of the oil and gas assets of Dominion Energy, mainly in Oklahoma, for $2.05 billion.[7]
In 2011, the company announced the retirement of founder Michael Linn.[5]
In March 2012, the company bought the holdings of BP in the Hugoton Natural Gas Area, the large gas-producing region from southwestern Kansas into the Texas Panhandle for $1.2 billion. The purchase included 2,400 active wells on 600,000 acres and a gas processing plant.[8]
Linn expanded its holdings in the Rocky Mountains in June 2012 with the purchase of 12,500 acres in the Jonah Field in southwest Wyoming from BP for approximately $1 billion. The field contains around 750 active natural gas wells which produce, in addition to natural gas, approximately one-quarter natural gas liquids such as butane and propane.[9]
In February 2013, the company acquired Berry Petroleum Company in a stock deal valued at $4.3 billion.[10]
In September 2013, the company announced the acquisition of assets in the Permian Basin for $525 million.[11]
In June 2014, the company announced the acquisition of assets from Devon Energy for $2.3 billion and plans to sell assets in the Granite Wash Basin.[12]
In August 2014, the company announced the acquisition of assets in the Hugoton Natural Gas Area from Pioneer Natural Resources for $340 million. The company also announced the sale of its interests in non-producing acreage in the Anadarko Basin for $90 million.[13]
In March 2016, the company missed a debt payment and announced that a bankruptcy filing was likely.[14] On May 11, 2016, Linn Energy filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection.[15]
In February 2017, the company completed a financial restructuring.[4] The restructuring including the corporate spin-off of Berry Petroleum Company.[4]
Controversies[edit]
On April 3, 2006, Linn Energy announced to delay its filing of Form 10-K to allow restatement of 2003 and 2004 results.The restatement related to adjustments identified by the company relating to the accounting for the price of acquisitions.[16]
On February 8, 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission closed its probe into Linn Energy’s $4.6 billion acquisition of Berry Petroleum and decided to take no enforcement actions.[17]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
