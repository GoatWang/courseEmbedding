After exhausting local and online resources, the confused "newbie" grower fell victim to a $5,000 faulty product. Instead of writing a bad review, he enlisted the help of a friend, completely overhauled the system, and the two started a small hydro store offering a haven for other misfit growers of various shapes and sizes. A safe place to share experiences with various cultivation methods and equipment, and sometimes even buy a custom grow cabinet or two to test a crazy idea. Customers always enjoyed the service, traditionally available only to the larger veteran grower.Fast forward to February 2014. The hydro store had taken a definitive backseat to a fabrication shop, to stamp out turnkey grow cabinets designed for novice enjoyment. The systems were full of success stories from some of those crazy ideas, which led to $100k being sold that month. Each and every system was sold, built, and serviced by three seasoned growers and part time help from a fourth.To scale the business and attract investors, they needed to define the company's relationship with cannabis, and offer confidence that the associated risks were accounted for. The decision was made to build transparency into the model; make full disclosure, present it to the SEC, and become fully reporting public company. In May 2014 the company secured an investment instrument to provide $1.5M seed money to scale operations and begin the process. After several rounds of comments and responses with the SEC, largely related to cannabis, the S-1 registration statement became effective December 22, 2014 and the Company added shareholders through a friends and family raise.We are the company, we are the newbie, and we're known as Cabinet Grow, Inc. As of today, we're proud to say that FINRA refers to us as CBNT. We consider this milestone a significant victory for both the company and the industry, but especially the "little guy" who is free to learn, shop, grow, and socialize without prejudice.Team CG would like to take this moment to acknowledge the generations who sowed seeds before us, and thank our customers for watering ours. The few have grown into many, and though seasoned, our common newbie roots run deep. We promise to transplant this root bound plant and take plenty of cuttings before we bloom. If you understand the references, CBNT is open for business; seeking like - minded impassioned partnerships, and would like to hear from you. For those that don't, you're what we lovingly call a newbie, and we built this business for you. A cutting refers to cloning a plant, and being root bound means you've outgrown your pot (no pun intended). Welcome. Please visit cabinetgrow.com and we'll introduce you to the world of self-sustained cultivation.Signed,Team Cabinet Grow, CBNTCFN Interview with Sam May, CEO of Cabinet Grow from TDM Financial on Vimeo.ABOUT CABINET GROW, INC.Cabinet Grow, Inc., through its predecessor Universal Hydro, began operations in California in 2008.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

issues trading symbol offering investors a fresh perspective on cannabis
 
IRVINE,
CA / ACCESSWIRE / July 2, 2015 / In 2008, a medical marijuana patient in Southern California set out to find a way to grow
his own cannabis at home. After exhausting local and online resources, the confused “newbie” grower fell victim to
a $5,000 faulty product.  Instead of writing a bad review, he enlisted the help of a friend, completely overhauled the system,
and the two started a small hydro store offering a haven for other misfit growers of various shapes and sizes.  A safe place
to share experiences with various cultivation methods and equipment, and sometimes even buy a custom grow cabinet or two to test
a crazy idea.  Customers always enjoyed the service, traditionally available only to the larger veteran grower. 
 
Fast
forward to February 2014. The hydro store had taken a definitive backseat to a fabrication shop, to stamp out turnkey grow
cabinets designed for novice enjoyment.  The systems were full of success stories from some of those crazy ideas, which led
to $100k being sold that month.  Each and every system was sold, built, and serviced by three seasoned growers and part time
help from a fourth. 
 
To
scale the business and attract investors, they needed to define the company's relationship with cannabis, and offer confidence
that the associated risks were accounted for. The decision was made to build transparency into the model; make full disclosure,
present it to the SEC, and become fully reporting public company. In May 2014 the company secured an investment instrument
to provide $1.5M seed money to scale operations and begin the process.  After several rounds of comments and responses with
the SEC, largely related to cannabis, the S-1 registration statement became effective December 22, 2014 and the Company added
shareholders through a friends and family raise.
 
We
are the company, we are the newbie, and we’re known as Cabinet Grow, Inc. As of today, we’re proud to say that FINRA
refers to us as CBNT.  We consider this milestone a significant victory for both the company and the industry, but especially
the “little guy” who is free to learn, shop, grow, and socialize without prejudice. 
 
Team
CG would like to take this moment to acknowledge the generations who sowed seeds before us, and thank our customers for watering
ours.  The few have grown into many, and though seasoned, our common newbie roots run deep. We promise to transplant this
root bound plant and take plenty of cuttings before we bloom. If you understand the references, CBNT is open for business; seeking
like - minded impassioned partnerships, and would like to hear from you.  For those that don’t, you’re what we
lovingly call a newbie, and we built this business for you. A cutting refers to cloning a plant, and being root bound means you’ve
outgrown your pot (no pun intended). Welcome. Please visit cabinetgrow.com
and we’ll introduce you to the world of self-sustained cultivation.

 
Signed,

Cabinet Grow Inc. (PC) Description



The Company makes cabinet based horticultural systems. The design and production of our hydroponic and soil grow cabinets makes the process of growing in a self-contained cabinet automated and simplified. Our mission is to make hydroponic and soil growing simpler, more efficient and a better value than other products found on the market. Our product offerings are split into two categories: (1) self-contained horticultural grow cabinets and (2) specifically constructed kits and packages offered to satisfy the DIY home horticulturist, which involve a modular growing solution. The Company's line of grow cabinets consists of three models, with variations of each model allowing consumers to select a cabinet that will suit their specific needs.  The Company views itself as a "pick and shovel" assembler and distributor, providing the tools needed for successful growing operations, but never touching the actual end product. Throughout the entire process, from seed to harvest, we are dedicated to giving growers the products, services and knowledge to make each grow their best.

You may have a patio and a strip of green if you live in an urban setting, or you may have a large yard with plenty of green space that allows you, your family and your friends to spread out. Patio furniture is a good place to start when outfitting your outdoor space. Those who have a large patio can choose sofas, chairs and outdoor dining sets. No exterior space is complete without a grill, and an outdoor kitchen is especially family- and entertaining-friendly. At Walmart, we offer many different pieces of outdoor furniture from which you can choose. Check out our Best Sellers, Special Buys and Clearance items for great finds on pieces to make your patio and backyard a place to which you'll rush home.Patio FurniturePatio furniture takes many forms. Some of the most common pieces are chaise lounges and chairs. Materials that this furniture is made of include aluminum, metal, wood and PVC. Some chairs and chaise lounges have mesh seats and backs. For added comfort, look for chairs that have accessories like overhangs and cup holders and have their own padding attached. If your desired piece doesn't come with them, we have several pads you can attach to them. Chairs that are portable and break down so they fit into a carry bag easily make it easy for you to use them at home, at the beach or an outdoor concert. If you entertain often outside, we have two- and three-person benches for added seating, and some of these have storage underneath. To relax in style, consider chairs that are also rocking chairs or are Adirondack-style chairs that are a cross between a chair and chaise lounge. Outdoor dining sets that have tables that allow for a large umbrella to insert through provide shade when it's time to sit down to lunch or dinner. Other types of outdoor furniture sets we have include conversation sets, bistro sets, sectionals and sofas. Many of the permanent pieces also have covers to protect them from inclement weather.Grills and Outdoor CookingA backyard doesn t seem complete without a grill or two in use. Having a grill as part of your patio setup means less time inside the house on nice days and a chance to show off your culinary skills   even if it's just for grilling hot dogs and hamburgers. Grills come in many assorted styles, and we have several for you to consider. Gas grills and charcoal grills are the most common, with electric grills also being an option. There are also portable grills that you can use on a table or when you're out at the beach or park, and smokers or pellet grills make it so you can slow-roast meats and vegetables and add a lot of smoky flavor to them.Gas grills come in two forms: propane and natural gas. Propane gas grills require a canister of propane to be attached, but this allows these grills to be used anywhere in the backyard or even away from home. Natural gas grills require a hookup to the home and can only go as far as the gas line allows them. Charcoal grills use lighted charcoal briquettes to supply the heat. Gas grills allow you to control the flame better, but some people prefer the taste that comes from cooking over charcoal.Portable grills can be either propane gas or charcoal. Smokers can also be all three, although many use chunks of hardwood like pecan or mesquite to create the smoke that permeates whatever you're cooking. Pellet grills are also smoker grills but use pellets made from sawdust to create smoke. With any kind of grill, accessories are important. This includes spatulas, tongs, sauce brushes or mops, knives, grill brushes, forks and skewers. You can purchase these items separately or choose one of our convenient sets that have all the pieces you need inside. Other accessories and supplies to consider include:  Grill covers   for protecting your grill against the elements Chimney starters, charcoal, lighter fluid, wood chunks and chips   use with both charcoal grills and smokers Grill cleaning tools   stiff wire brushes that keep grill grates clean of burnt food turkey fryers   large, deep fryers for frying large cuts of meat outside Refrigerators and ice makers   for keeping food and beverages coldPatio and Outdoor DecorHaving some furniture and a grill on the patio is a terrific start. However, you may want to consider adding some homier touches to complete the scene. A couple of planters or large pots with flowers is a nice touch, or if you're doing a lot of cooking outside, you may want to grow some fresh herbs. Outdoor lighting is also essential because you don't want to be forced to go inside once the sun sets. Options you have here include landscape and deck lights, decorative lights that you connect to your home, tiki torches, colored bulbs on strands that you hang strategically around the patio or even flood lights. Other decorations you can add to brighten your patio area and backyard include bird baths, bird feeders, fountains, garden statues, weathervanes and even a small pond. The choices come to life with your imagination, so see what we have to offer and what inspires you.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147349575, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

Both your lawn and the plants and vegetation you have need plenty of water and sunlight, which you and Mother Nature provide. However, your greenery needs a little help in the form of food, fertilizer, pest control and other treatments to keep everything growing and producing as much as it can. With our low prices, every day, on everything in our Garden Center, you can create a terrific-looking natural space for yourself, your family and your friends without breaking the bank.Lawn careIn addition to frequent cutting, edging, trimming and other maintenance steps you do to maintain a healthy, beautiful-looking lawn, you need to keep it fed and pest- and weed-free. If you have bare patches in your lawn, spread some grass seed in the bare spots. It'll take just a few weeks for the new grass to fill in. Make sure you're using seed that matches the type of grass you have, such as fescue or Bermuda grass.Keep your lawn fed properly by using fertilizer. Fertilizer comes in large bags from 10 pounds to 25 pounds and serves as the primary food for your lawn. It's recommended that you use a fertilizer spreader to apply fertilizer in an even pattern. Too much fertilizer in one spot can cause your grass to "burn" in direct sunlight. Choose a spreader that's suited for your lawn. If you have an average- to large-size lawn to maintain, you'll want to use a spreader that you push across your lawn that spreads the fertilizer out as you walk. If you only have a small patch of grass to maintain, such as at a condominium or apartment with a back yard, choose either a handheld spreader or apply with a wand using liquid fertilizer. There are even liquid fertilizers you can spray using your own water hose. GardeningEven before you plant your first flower bulb, vegetable, bush or tree, it's important to prepare the soil. The first step is to clear any weeds and old vegetation from the area where you plan to do your planting. Then, it's a good idea to enrich the soil with new garden soil or topsoil. It's also smart to use a pH level tester on the soil to make sure the pH levels are correct for the plants you wish to grow. It might be necessary to add some lime or calcium to the soil until the nutrient balance is correct.Once you've sown your seeds or planted your plants, it's necessary to keep them feed. If you apply garden soil initially, many brands have fertilizer mixed in with the soil, which feeds your plants for a few weeks. However, as the plants and flowers mature, it becomes necessary to feed them periodically. A good way to take care of this is to attach a liquid fertilizer container to a water hose to disperse a measured amount of food to your plants.If you don t have a patch of land to grow plants, there are many other options available, such as planters, vases and boxes. If you don t have access to a water hose, a watering can will deliver the water the plants need.Weed and plant controlIf you have weeds popping up in your lawn or garden, you want to remove them right away so they don't overrun your lawn, vegetables or other plants. In your garden, it's best to remove them by hand, such as by using a garden shovel, trowel or asparagus knife to dig beneath the roots of the weed and remove it completely. Any weeds that have roots remaining in the soil can regrow in time, which means you'll need to repeat the process again. For lawns, you can apply fertilizer to your grass that has weed killer mixed in, allowing you to "weed and feed" your lawn that the same time. For weeds that pop up individually on your lawn, such as dandelions or crabgrass, and for any weeds that grow between patio or sidewalk sections, you can use a spot sprayer to kill them directly. These usually kill the weeds within a few days.If you have garden pests, such as ants or crawling insects, that are eating or killing your plants, there are options you can use to kill the pests without harming your vegetation. A good example of this is diatomaceous earth, which provides long-lasting control against harmful insects. It's safe for pets, and you can even use it inside your home.Show moreElectrode, Comp-167313233, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-
