Career[edit]
Harvey graduated in medicine from the University of Melbourne. He developed an interest in the factors that influence the prescribing of antibiotics, especially where it involved unethical promotion.[3] He worked at the Royal Melbourne Hospital and then as an adjunct associate professor in the School of Public Health at La Trobe University.[1]
Harvey took part in drawing up ethical criteria for the promotion of medicinal drugs for the World Health Organization, and served on a committee that formulated the Australian "Quality Use of Medicines" policy. He has also worked on medicinal drug policy in Southeast Asia, Croatia, and Jordan. He is Chair of the Governing Council of Health Action International Asia Pacific.[4] He served on the TGA's Transparency Review Panel, the Medicines Australia Code Review Panel, the Working Group on Promotion of Therapeutic Products, and the Natural Therapy Review Advisory Committee.[5] Another of his areas of interest is the application of information technology to optimise medicinal drug use.[1]
Harvey quit his job with La Trobe in 2014 after the university agreed to receive $15 million from Swisse Wellness to fund a new complementary medicine centre.[2][6] He told the Australian Journal of Pharmacy that "in 2013-4 Swisse sought a research partnership with a number of Australian universities; all but one resisted on the grounds that, while such an association might give Swisse a fig-leaf of respectability, it would not reflect well on the reputation of the university involved."[7] This followed legal action by Swisse against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation for defamation in a consumer advocacy show The Checkout, which criticised their research methods.[8][9]
In 2014 after leaving La Trobe, Harvey took a post as Adjunct Associate Professor of Epidemiology & Preventive Medicine at Monash University.[10]
Campaigning[edit]
Ken Harvey is a critic of drug promotion by pharmaceutical companies,[11] and supports a campaign called "No Advertising Please" that calls on doctors to reject free lunches from drug company representatives (who selectively present evidence that goes in a new drug's favour), and instead to only prescribe drugs that they have independently researched, including reading critical evaluations. Harvey served as a consumer representative on Medicines Australia's transparency working group, which advocated for patients to be able to know whether their doctors had been given free flights to industry funded conferences that promote new drugs.[12][13] Harvey has called on the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) "to ban inaccurate, misleading or unethical promotion of medicines", and is a strong critic of the way that therapeutic claims of complementary medicines are regulated.[14][15] Harvey has criticised the TGA for not regulating body building products that contain synthetic amphetamines, which are instead regulated as food products despite making health claims.[16] In 2016, he highlighted that Chemmart's consumer DNA testing was misleading and breached the TGA's Advertising Code because it was not able to deliver on the claims being made for it.[17]
Friends of Science in Medicine[edit]
Harvey is an executive member of Friends of Science in Medicine (FSM),[3] an organization which aims "to emphasise the importance of having health care in Australia based upon evidence, scientifically sound research and established scientific knowledge."[18]
Nurofen[edit]
Harvey criticised the Reckitt Benckiser brand Nurofen for marketing identical ibuprofen products in different packages as "targeting" specific pain, which became the subject of an ACCC investigation.[19][20]
SensaSlim[edit]
Harvey was sued for alleged defamation by SensaSlim, a company that marketed products claimed to offer weight loss benefits, after he lodged a complaint about their practices with the Therapeutic Goods Administration.[4] The company attempted to delete all correspondence with an Internet marketing company while under investigation by the ACCC.[21]
The Federal Court determined that the company had engaged in deceptive conduct. The final result was that the company was fined a total of $3.55 million and was de-listed. Its principal, Peter Foster, was fined $660,000 and permanently banned from being a company director or having any business in the diet or health industry. Two other directors, Peter O'Brien and Michael Boyle were fined $55,000 and $75,000 respectively and disqualified from being company directors.[22]
Medical Journal of Australia[edit]
In 2015, Stephen Leeder was sacked as the Editor-In-Chief of the Medical Journal of Australia after criticizing the decision to outsource production of the journal to the global publishing giant Elsevier.[23] All but one of the AMJ's editorial advisory committee resigned following the decision to sack Leeder, and wrote to AMA president Brian Owler asking him to review the decision.[24] Ken Harvey supported Leeder and said that his sacking, and the use of Elsevier is "a mistake that is fairly irredeemable"[6]
Chiropractic[edit]
Harvey is very critical of the way that complaints against chiropractors have been handled by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency's (AHPRA) Chiropractic Board of Australia, regarding violations of its registration standards since the board's inception. The violations include "advertising in a misleading or deceptive manner," use of testimonials, and encouragement of "unnecessary use of health services." After a lack of resolution to these complaints, Harvey and the FSM approached the ACCC since they have "powers, under national consumer law, to prosecute for misleading and deceptive and unconscionable conduct" in the hopes that action would be taken to resolve the complaints.[25]
In 2015, a over a year after contacting the ACCC, Harvey and the FSM followed up on "ten representative complaints" to see if any action had been taken by either government body. Of those complaints, only one clinic resolved all of the issues while the others were still unresolved, including one clinic which had simply set up a new website containing the previous violations. It appeared that AHPRA had contacted the chiropractic clinics regarding the complaints, but they had not done very much to enforce their own rules. In response to this failure, Harvey and his colleagues contacted the press, including the AMJ and The Sydney Morning Herald,[26] bringing a large amount of attention to the issue.[25]
Recognition[edit]
In 2011 he was awarded the Thornett Award for Promotion of Reason by the Australian Skeptics, and in 2013 they made him a life member.[5]
The Australian consumer advocacy organisation Choice gave Harvey its "Consumer Champion" award in 2012, describing him as a "scam buster and snake oil nemesis",[27] and they made Harvey a life member for his "services to the consumer movement".[1][4]
In 2016, the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science chair Dr Malcolm Jenkins presented Harvey with their ANZAAS Medal,[3] "in recognition of his longstanding advocacy for evidence-based medicine and treatment".[28] The same year, he was awarded Skeptic of the Year by the Australian Skeptics "for continued and determined efforts which have made a significant impact on exposing malpractice in the chiropractic industry and its governing bodies".[29]
Harvey was awarded a Member (AM) of the Order of Australia in the 2017 Queen’s Birthday Honours list, to recognize his "significant service to community health and the pharmaceutical industry through roles in developing guidelines for the ethical use of antibiotics”.[30]

After a lack of resolution to these complaints, Harvey and the FSM approached the ACCC since they have "powers, under national consumer law, to prosecute for misleading and deceptive and unconscionable conduct" in the hopes that action would be taken to resolve the complaints.[25]
In 2015, a over a year after contacting the ACCC, Harvey and the FSM followed up on "ten representative complaints" to see if any action had been taken by either government body. Of those complaints, only one clinic resolved all of the issues while the others were still unresolved, including one clinic which had simply set up a new website containing the previous violations. It appeared that AHPRA had contacted the chiropractic clinics regarding the complaints, but they had not done very much to enforce their own rules. In response to this failure, Harvey and his colleagues contacted the press, including the AMJ and The Sydney Morning Herald,[26] bringing a large amount of attention to the issue.[25]
Recognition[edit]
In 2011 he was awarded the Thornett Award for Promotion of Reason by the Australian Skeptics, and in 2013 they made him a life member.[5]
The Australian consumer advocacy organisation Choice gave Harvey its "Consumer Champion" award in 2012, describing him as a "scam buster and snake oil nemesis",[27] and they made Harvey a life member for his "services to the consumer movement".[1][4]
In 2016, the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science chair Dr Malcolm Jenkins presented Harvey with their ANZAAS Medal,[3] "in recognition of his longstanding advocacy for evidence-based medicine and treatment".[28] The same year, he was awarded Skeptic of the Year by the Australian Skeptics "for continued and determined efforts which have made a significant impact on exposing malpractice in the chiropractic industry and its governing bodies".[29]
Harvey was awarded a Member (AM) of the Order of Australia in the 2017 Queen’s Birthday Honours list, to recognize his "significant service to community health and the pharmaceutical industry through roles in developing guidelines for the ethical use of antibiotics”.[30]

Career[edit]
Harvey graduated in medicine from the University of Melbourne. He developed an interest in the factors that influence the prescribing of antibiotics, especially where it involved unethical promotion.[3] He worked at the Royal Melbourne Hospital and then as an adjunct associate professor in the School of Public Health at La Trobe University.[1]
Harvey took part in drawing up ethical criteria for the promotion of medicinal drugs for the World Health Organization, and served on a committee that formulated the Australian "Quality Use of Medicines" policy. He has also worked on medicinal drug policy in Southeast Asia, Croatia, and Jordan. He is Chair of the Governing Council of Health Action International Asia Pacific.[4] He served on the TGA's Transparency Review Panel, the Medicines Australia Code Review Panel, the Working Group on Promotion of Therapeutic Products, and the Natural Therapy Review Advisory Committee.[5] Another of his areas of interest is the application of information technology to optimise medicinal drug use.[1]
Harvey quit his job with La Trobe in 2014 after the university agreed to receive $15 million from Swisse Wellness to fund a new complementary medicine centre.[2][6] He told the Australian Journal of Pharmacy that "in 2013-4 Swisse sought a research partnership with a number of Australian universities; all but one resisted on the grounds that, while such an association might give Swisse a fig-leaf of respectability, it would not reflect well on the reputation of the university involved."[7] This followed legal action by Swisse against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation for defamation in a consumer advocacy show The Checkout, which criticised their research methods.[8][9]
In 2014 after leaving La Trobe, Harvey took a post as Adjunct Associate Professor of Epidemiology & Preventive Medicine at Monash University.[10]
Campaigning[edit]
Ken Harvey is a critic of drug promotion by pharmaceutical companies,[11] and supports a campaign called "No Advertising Please" that calls on doctors to reject free lunches from drug company representatives (who selectively present evidence that goes in a new drug's favour), and instead to only prescribe drugs that they have independently researched, including reading critical evaluations. Harvey served as a consumer representative on Medicines Australia's transparency working group, which advocated for patients to be able to know whether their doctors had been given free flights to industry funded conferences that promote new drugs.[12][13] Harvey has called on the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) "to ban inaccurate, misleading or unethical promotion of medicines", and is a strong critic of the way that therapeutic claims of complementary medicines are regulated.[14][15] Harvey has criticised the TGA for not regulating body building products that contain synthetic amphetamines, which are instead regulated as food products despite making health claims.[16] In 2016, he highlighted that Chemmart's consumer DNA testing was misleading and breached the TGA's Advertising Code because it was not able to deliver on the claims being made for it.[17]
Friends of Science in Medicine[edit]
Harvey is an executive member of Friends of Science in Medicine (FSM),[3] an organization which aims "to emphasise the importance of having health care in Australia based upon evidence, scientifically sound research and established scientific knowledge."[18]
Nurofen[edit]
Harvey criticised the Reckitt Benckiser brand Nurofen for marketing identical ibuprofen products in different packages as "targeting" specific pain, which became the subject of an ACCC investigation.[19][20]
SensaSlim[edit]
Harvey was sued for alleged defamation by SensaSlim, a company that marketed products claimed to offer weight loss benefits, after he lodged a complaint about their practices with the Therapeutic Goods Administration.[4] The company attempted to delete all correspondence with an Internet marketing company while under investigation by the ACCC.[21]
The Federal Court determined that the company had engaged in deceptive conduct. The final result was that the company was fined a total of $3.55 million and was de-listed. Its principal, Peter Foster, was fined $660,000 and permanently banned from being a company director or having any business in the diet or health industry. Two other directors, Peter O'Brien and Michael Boyle were fined $55,000 and $75,000 respectively and disqualified from being company directors.[22]
Medical Journal of Australia[edit]
In 2015, Stephen Leeder was sacked as the Editor-In-Chief of the Medical Journal of Australia after criticizing the decision to outsource production of the journal to the global publishing giant Elsevier.[23] All but one of the AMJ's editorial advisory committee resigned following the decision to sack Leeder, and wrote to AMA president Brian Owler asking him to review the decision.[24] Ken Harvey supported Leeder and said that his sacking, and the use of Elsevier is "a mistake that is fairly irredeemable"[6]
Chiropractic[edit]
Harvey is very critical of the way that complaints against chiropractors have been handled by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency's (AHPRA) Chiropractic Board of Australia, regarding violations of its registration standards since the board's inception. The violations include "advertising in a misleading or deceptive manner," use of testimonials, and encouragement of "unnecessary use of health services." After a lack of resolution to these complaints, Harvey and the FSM approached the ACCC since they have "powers, under national consumer law, to prosecute for misleading and deceptive and unconscionable conduct" in the hopes that action would be taken to resolve the complaints.[25]
In 2015, a over a year after contacting the ACCC, Harvey and the FSM followed up on "ten representative complaints" to see if any action had been taken by either government body. Of those complaints, only one clinic resolved all of the issues while the others were still unresolved, including one clinic which had simply set up a new website containing the previous violations. It appeared that AHPRA had contacted the chiropractic clinics regarding the complaints, but they had not done very much to enforce their own rules. In response to this failure, Harvey and his colleagues contacted the press, including the AMJ and The Sydney Morning Herald,[26] bringing a large amount of attention to the issue.[25]
Recognition[edit]
In 2011 he was awarded the Thornett Award for Promotion of Reason by the Australian Skeptics, and in 2013 they made him a life member.[5]
The Australian consumer advocacy organisation Choice gave Harvey its "Consumer Champion" award in 2012, describing him as a "scam buster and snake oil nemesis",[27] and they made Harvey a life member for his "services to the consumer movement".[1][4]

Harvey was awarded a Member (AM) of the Order of Australia in the 2017 Queen’s Birthday Honours list, to recognize his "significant service to community health and the pharmaceutical industry through roles in developing guidelines for the ethical use of antibiotics”.[30]

New proposals from Australia’s drug regulator should give you a better idea if your complementary medicines do what they say on the packet.
One change proposed by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) is a “stamp of approval” on the packaging and promotional material of some vitamins, minerals, herbs and other supplements to tell you there is enough evidence to back health claims.
Other proposals include reducing the number of often unsubstantiated indications that manufacturers of complementary medicines currently make on their TGA application, which are then used as the basis for advertising claims. 
The TGA also proposes incentives for companies to develop and market products with new active ingredients, or make new claims based on research.
The proposed changes, which are out for public consultation, follow the recent ABC Four Corners program, which highlighted long-standing problems with the way complementary medicines are currently regulated.


ABC Four Corners’ documentary “Swallowing it” highlights the shortcomings of how complementary medicines are regulated in Australia.

What’s the problem?
The TGA’s proposals are urgently needed to fix three major shortcomings of the current regulatory system.
First, consumer organisations and health professionals have lost confidence in the complementary medicines industry’s ability to regulate its own advertisements, and in the TGA’s ability to apply adequate sanctions when companies don’t follow the rules.
Second, there is little incentive for the manufacturers of complementary medicines to research new innovative products or prove existing ones work.
There are about 11,000 listed complementary medicines on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (indicated by Aust L on packaging). Listed medicines are meant to contain pre-approved, relatively low-risk ingredients, produced with good manufacturing practice and only make “low-level” health claims for which evidence is held. However, the TGA does not check these requirements before the product is marketed; post-marketing surveillance and upheld complaints show high levels of regulatory non-compliance.  
But there are only 35 registered complementary medicines (indicated by Aust R on packaging) the TGA says have been thoroughly assessed for safety, quality and efficacy (there is also debate about whether many of these older products should still be on this TGA list). There are fewer products on this list because research to meet registration requirements is expensive, the public doesn’t understand the subtleties between an Aust L and Aust R product and a better return on investment comes from promotional hype and celebrity endorsement of listed products. 
Third, the TGA provides only limited transparency about companies and products that fail post-marketing evaluation or have complaints upheld. This information is currently regarded as commercial-in-confidence, fuelling the perception the TGA is more concerned with helping industry than protecting consumers.
How could the new measures help?
The proposal to restrict companies to only making pre-approved, “low-level” indications and claims for a product, such as, “may relieve the pain of mild osteoarthritis”, will minimise the risk of misleading consumers. But it is not yet clear how the list of allowed indications will be established nor how a specific product will be matched with an appropriate allowed indication.
The regulator also proposes manufacturers apply for “intermediate-level” health claims falling outside the permitted list (outlined above). An example might be, “our formulation of cranberry reduces the frequency of recurrent urinary infections in women”. For this, the TGA would have to assess the evidence substantiating the claim for a particular product. If the evidence stacks up (and there’s a debate about the type of evidence needed), the product could then carry a TGA “stamp of approval” on the label and any promotional material. But it is not clear what this “stamp of approval” will be. Is it text, a symbol or both?



Not everyone agrees a TGA ‘stamp of approval’ should be in the form of a symbol, like this.
(Unofficial mock-up created by Ken Harvey)


In preliminary TGA stakeholder consultations, consumer representatives supported a prominent visual identifier (like a logo or symbol) because of the failure of the existing Aust L and Aust R labelling to inform consumers. But industry representatives were concerned a highly visible identifier for a small number of evidence-based complementary medicines might affect sales of the bulk of listed products without one.
The TGA’s proposals encourage innovation because they will stimulate companies to engage in research to qualify for a TGA “stamp of approval”. The proposal also suggests companies that develop a TGA approved evidence-based claim would be awarded a three-year period of data protection to stop others freeloading on their research. 
But the proposed changes do not yet address the need for greater transparency in the regulatory process. For instance, it is not clear whether the TGA’s assessment of evidence to back higher-level health claims for complementary medicines will be publicly available, as they are for prescription medicines.
What happens next?
These proposed changes, which are out for public consultation until March 28, 2017,  sit alongside other recommendations aimed at improving the advertising complaints system. 
If the TGA implements this package of recommendations, Australia will be a world leader in how complementary medicines are regulated. Despite the substantial and increasing use of supplements, no other country has developed a system that helps consumers and health professionals separate the evidence-based wheat from the chaff, improves confidence in the industry, stimulates more evidence-based products and has the potential to boost exports.

We also support the great work Ken does and the many contributions he has ma...de*  Whilst Ken's problems with the initial catalyst for this page genesis have passed as of February 10th 2012, his work and wonderfully educational commentary continues.   +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ What follows is the original biography for this page:  SensaSlim is an alternative weight loss product that has drawn much media attention in Australia, giving the public an impression of seemingly miraculous success. Apart from making claims that defied the accepted science of weight loss, the marketers of SensaSlim claimed via a slick advertising campaign, video and website to have evidence gained from a clinical trial involving 11,000 people that the product was perhaps "the greatest weight loss product in the world".   In a May 31st 2011 article The Australian Skeptics revealed that Dr. Ken Harvey - an adjunct senior lecturer in the School of Public Health, La Trobe University - had complained to The Therapeutic Goods Administration over promotion of the product. This resulted in a strategic lawsuit against public participation, known as a 'SLAPP' suit, being lodged against Ken Harvey which causes significant financial and personal pressure. In a statement to the TGA's Complaints Resolution Panel, Dr. Harvey substantially backed his position that, “in my opinion, the ‘sensational results’ claimed are most likely to have been fabricated. In addition, I do not believe that any of the other claims made for this product are capable of substantiation.”  Before the CRP could deliberate adequately, SensaSlim issued a "Statement of claim" in the NSW Supreme court. This alleged defamation against Dr. Harvey, seeking “general and punitive damages for libel in the sum of $800,000.00”, plus costs, as reported by The Australian Skeptics.  Due to a clause in the Therapeutic Goods Regulations 1990 42ZCAJ (2) this puts a temporary but potentially lengthy stop to complaints heard by the CRP. As complaints can take months to reach conclusion the product is continued to be marketed and sold with no regard to it's legitimacy or indeed any possible negative effects. The relevant regulation states:  “If, after a complaint has been made to the Panel, a proceeding begins in a court about the subject matter of the complaint, the Panel cannot deal with the complaint until the proceeding is finally disposed of”.   Crucially, SensaSlim until May 21st, 2011 had Dr Matthew Capehorn, clinical director of the National Obesity Forum (UK) and clinical manager of the Rotherham Institute for Obesity, as their own Research Director. As part of this role Dr. Capehorn wrote and published a white paper on the unseen clinical trial evidence "in good faith". Through his lawyers Capehorn has written to SensaSlim stating in part, "Despite requests, I have never seen evidence of the original clinical trial, and it has never been published in a peer reviewed medical journal. Therefore, the White Paper holds no scientific relevance, until that original trial is published.”   SensaSlim have made numerous breaches of contract with Dr. Capehorn and have not acquiesced to his demands to remove his image, name and white paper from their website.

He campaigns regularly against the nonscientific products and ...services that have become so pervasive in Australia over recent years. Dr. Harvey devotes much of his free time to speak to local skeptic groups and explain to relevant media outlets about the shortfalls in current legislation that have allowed the seeming unchecked growth of arguably unacceptable and ineffective products and services. In fact on December 6th last year "Pharma in Focus" revealed that "up to 90% of complementary medicines reviewed by the TGA do not comply with regulatory requirements".   Dr. Harvey is a frequent figure on TV, radio and in print media discussing the health, legal, financial and regulatory dynamics peculiar to Australia's apparent obsession with unproven and often untested New Age "therapies". 展开categories非营利组织中文(简体)English (US)日本語한국어Français (France)Bahasa IndonesiaPolskiEspañolPortuguês (Brasil)DeutschItalianoMessengerFacebook Lite用户地点游戏位置名人二手市场小组食谱彩色气球Instagram公司简介创建广告创建主页开发者招聘信息隐私权政策Cookie广告选项条款设置活动日志 Facebook © 2017
