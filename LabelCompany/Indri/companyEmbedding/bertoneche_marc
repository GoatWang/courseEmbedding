Item Description: ELSEVIER SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY, United Kingdom, 2000. Hardback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . Brand New Book. Financial Performance presents the foundation concepts underlying the Senior Executive Programmes the Authors have taught together and separately over the last 15 years in Europe, Asia and North America. These programmes include The Oxford Advanced Management Programme The Oxford Senior Executive Finance Programme The INSEAD Advanced Management Programme The IMI, Geneva, Advanced Management Programme The Harvard Advanced Management Programme The Oxford International Executive Programme, Singapore The IMI International Finance Programme, Singapore The book is intended as a reference manual as well as a textbook and will be of value to anyone with an interest in financial performance - particularly senior executives. The developments in modern finance over the last two decades have considerable implications for the way senior executives think about the finance discipline. It is no longer enough to have a rudimentary knowledge of basic finance and a heavy reliance on financial specialists. CEOs of course need excellent financial professionals - however they need to go beyond this and provide strategic leadership.This requires a conceptual framework for dealing with financial matters. This book provides a description of the underlying ideas and will be of value to anyone with an interest in financial performance - particularly senior executives. This book revolves around the concept of value and it is organised into two parts. Part I Performance Measurement Consists of three chapters, all of which focus on the real and fairly complex set of financial statements of DaimlerChrysler AG. The first two chapters provide a detailed guided tour of the financial statements which deconstruct the complexity and then reconstruct the financials to provide a clearer base for analysis. These chapters have been arranged to deal with each line item of financial statements which have been highlighted in such a way to allow the reader to treat the materials as a reference as well as a sequential read. Chapter three presents a framework for evaluating financial health and introduces a cash flow based model for understanding the short and medium term constraints on a firm s growth. This exposition revolves around the concept of sustainable growth.Part 2 Valuation In the second part of the book chapter 4 introduces the cost of capital concept followed by chapter 5 which provides a general source of reference for valuation and a variety of difference applications.Chapter 6 concludes the book with a review of concept of shareholder value from a European perspective. Rory Knight MA(Oxon), MCom, PhD, CA Dean (Emeritus), Templeton College, University of Oxford For the last five years Rory has been Dean of Templeton College, the University of Oxford s business college. During this time he led the Oxford Advanced Management Programme and he created the Oxford Senior Executive Finance Programme. He has considerable experience in business and management development. He is actively involved in briefing the senior executives of leading companies on issues in Finance and Strategy. Prior to coming to Oxford Dr Knight was the deputy director of a foundation within the Swiss National Bank (SNB) and previously a Professor in Finance at IMI, Geneva IMD, Lausanne.Marc Bertoneche MA, MBA, DBA, Phd Visiting Professor, Harvard Business School Marc is a Professor in Business Administration at the University of Bordeaux and has been on the faculty at INSEAD, the European Institute of Business Administration in Fontainebleau France for more than twenty years.

Examines the acquisition of Dresdner Bank by Allianz--the deal of the year in 2002. Examines some of the challenges posed by the turnaround of Dresdner as seen by Michael Diekmann, the new CEO of Allianz. In working with Dresdner, Allianz needed to figure out what it meat to be a fully integrated financial service provider. Focuses on the development of the product line, the question of branding, the investment bank, and the organization.

Master in Management - Grande Ecole




 





    The Grande École curriculum is divided into a generalist phase and a specialization phase. The first phase concentrates on business fundamentals, while the second one focuses on acquiring an expertise (chosen according to the professional goals of the student). The unique structure of the curriculum enables students to acquire both an excellent grounding in general management and expertise in a specific field. We firmly believe this combination is the key success factor in training future leaders and making a lasting impact on the careers of our students. The second year of the Master’s program Cycle is composed of a specialized and professional curriculum, and the composition of a research paper.

They are designed for students who already hold a Master’s degree in an other field and wish to specialize in a specific field of management. MSc programs are one-year Master’s degrees taught in English. They are designed for students who hold a Bachelor degree in any field from leading international universities.

Description

                    'Financial Performance' presents the foundation concepts underlying the Senior Executive Programmes the Authors have taught together and separately over the last 15 years in Europe, Asia and North America.

These programmes include

The Oxford Advanced Management Programme
The Oxford Senior Executive Finance Programme
The INSEAD Advanced Management Programme
The IMI, Geneva, Advanced Management Programme
The Harvard Advanced Management Programme
The Oxford International Executive Programme, Singapore
The IMI International Finance Programme, Singapore

The book is intended as a reference manual as well as a textbook and will be of value to anyone with an interest in financial performance - particularly senior executives.



The developments in modern finance over the last two decades have considerable implications for the way senior executives think about the finance discipline.  It is no longer enough to have a rudimentary knowledge of basic finance and a heavy reliance on financial specialists.

CEOs of course need excellent financial professionals - however they need to go beyond this and provide strategic leadership.  This requires a conceptual framework for dealing with financial matters. This book provides a description of the underlying ideas and will be of value to anyone with an interest in financial performance - particularly senior executives.


This book revolves around the concept of value and it is organised into two parts.

Part IPerformance Measurement

Consists of three chapters, all of which focus on the real and fairly complex set of financial statements of DaimlerChrysler AG.    

The first two chapters provide a detailed guided tour of the financial statements which deconstruct the complexity and then reconstruct the financials to provide a clearer base for analysis. These chapters have been arranged to deal with each line item of financial statements which have been highlighted in such a way to allow the reader to treat the materials as a reference as well as a sequential read.

Chapter three presents a framework for evaluating financial health and introduces a cash flow based model for understanding the short and medium term constraints on a firm's growth.  This exposition revolves around the concept of sustainable growth.

Part 2Valuation

In the second part of the book chapter 4 introduces the cost of capital concept followed by chapter 5 which provides a general source of reference for valuation and a variety of difference applications.Chapter 6 concludes the book with a review of concept of shareholder value from a European perspective.

Finding the God Particle of the Sustainability Business Case: Greener Pastures for Shareholder Value
Marc L Bertoneche and Cornis van der Lugt
The start of the 2000s saw a flurry of international publications on "the business case" for sustainability, seeking to map out the returns on investment and to differentiate recommended actions from cases of corporate philanthropy. Reports by business organisations and others identified different categories of justifications, incentives, benefits and levels of making the business case. 1) Research over the last decade has pointed to a complex relation between sustainability and financial performance. 2) Results have been influenced by different input and output variables applied, by what is defined as: "sustainability" or "socially responsible" actions, the scope of the agenda covered and the definition of what is the ultimate goal (e.g. increased profit, shareholder value or longer term success and value of the business).
Keywords: Corporate Social Responsibility and Impact; 
				  Performance; 
				  Environmental Sustainability;
