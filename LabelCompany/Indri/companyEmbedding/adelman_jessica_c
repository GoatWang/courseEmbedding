Kroger Co. has hired an executive to replace Lynn Marmer, who is retiring as group vice president of corporate affairs.
Jessica Adelman will take that role on Nov. 1.

Adelman has been senior vice president of corporate affairs for Syngenta North America, a maker of chemicals and seeds for agricultural use.
Marmer announced in July she plans to retire early next year. She was Kroger’s first female executive officer in 1998.
Adelman will oversee reputation management for Cincinnati-based Kroger, the nation’s largest operator of traditional supermarkets. That includes external communications and brand public relations, media, government and regulatory affairs, corporate social responsibility and environmental sustainability, community relations, crisis management, cause-related marketing, and corporate philanthropy.
Adelman has handled similar issues during her 20 years as a public affairs executive in the food industry. That includes her time at at Syngenta, where she worked since 2008.
“Jessica brings a wealth of public affairs leadership experience and deep knowledge of the food supply chain,” Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen said in a news release.
The 40-year-old Adelman, her husband and three children will move to Greater Cincinnati from the Washington, D.C., area.
