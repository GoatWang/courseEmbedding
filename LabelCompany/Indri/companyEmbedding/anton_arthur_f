Arthur F. Anton
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Download a Short Bio

I always had a pretty good head for business – even in high school and early college, when I managed a Carvel ice cream parlor in Brooklyn, N.Y. Knowing the customer was key to that operation, just like at Swagelok today. So was knowing how to treat customers and employees. And being responsible with finances. And making sure processes followed company standards, to maintain quality.

In 1980, I earned a degree in economics and accounting from the City University of New York. I got offers from a few firms, but felt most comfortable with the gentler, Midwestern values of Ernst & Ernst. They hired me as an entry-level accountant in their small New York office. By age 24, I transferred to the firm’s headquarters in Cleveland where I had exposure to more senior leaders.

I worked my way up the ranks, dealing with all kinds of interesting client companies. I was always the guy willing to take on a new adventure, a new assignment. In addition to tax work, I handled initial public offerings, due diligence, mergers and acquisitions, and more.

Eventually, I ran a regional financial services practice for what was then called Ernst & Young. A group of 100-some people, we served major banks, investment companies and manufacturing companies around Cleveland, Toledo and Detroit.

Soon after, I became a partner in the firm, one of my proudest accomplishments.

By 1998, I was ready for something new – some exposure to disciplines outside accounting and finance. Swagelok gave me the opportunity, inviting me to become chief financial officer.

I came on board and took over Swagelok’s finance and IT areas, but also was encouraged to get involved in even more: manufacturing, marketing, supply chain, HR. In 2000, I helped ramp up Swagelok’s business in the semiconductor industry, particularly with supply chain planning. I worked with IT to put in a new system to better allocate products and better understand customer demand.

I was so focused on trying to do a good job as CFO, that I didn’t expect to be named president and chief operating officer one year later. In 2003, I became chief executive officer.

One of my biggest successes as CEO has been picking a good team – one that shows the respect and integrity so important to this company. Here, it’s not only what you do, but how you do it.

With their help, I’ve seen Swagelok become better at listening to customers and offering them custom solutions. We’ve become more nimble, adopting lean manufacturing principles – because it’s the right, responsible thing to do.

I try to instill in my leaders a devotion to service, rather than a devotion to self. That’s helped Swagelok become as strong as it is today. And it’s helped make us a good corporate citizen. Everyone on our management team gives back to the community by serving outside Swagelok.

Personally, I’m an active board member of Forest City Enterprises Inc., The Sherwin-Williams Company, Olympic Steel and University Hospitals, where I chair the finance committee.

Arthur F. Anton
 Achievement Centers for Children
 Sometimes a leader makes such an impact on an organization that it’s hard to believe he’s only been serving on the board of trustees for four years. 
That’s the way Arthur Anton, president and CEO of Swagelok Co., is regarded by the Achievement Centers for Children (ACC), which offers children with disabilities and their families services such as rehabilitation, education, family support and recreation.
Shortly after joining the ACC board in 1999, Anton was elected treasurer and chaired the finance committee. During his three-year tenure in that position, he and his committee reviewed and revised the ACC’s endowment and investment policies. 
He was a vigilant, educated advocate in meeting and communicating with the ACC’s investment managers to ensure the best possible outcomes for earnings. Anton and his committee also reviewed options for financing the ACC’s $8 million facility, and he oversaw the implementation of these financing decisions.
He joined the steering committee for the capital campaign and later became chair of the campaign. He was an active solicitor on the campaign cabinet, making his own financial contribution and pledging $50,000 from Swagelok. 
Anton led a two-year search for a new ACC location and, as a member of the facility committee, helped find a construction manager. He later served as chair of the facility committee.
Braving a harsh economic environment, Anton was a co-chair of the ACC’s Signature Event in November 2002 and solicited corporate and individual support. This event raised $275,000, the greatest amount raised in a single event in ACC’s history. Today, he continues his involvement, working to identify potential board members through his participation on the governance committee and helping to lead the executive committee.

Anton, Arthur F. and Carol M. Scholarship Fund
The Arthur F. and Carol M. Anton Scholarship Fund was established by Mr. and Mrs. Art and Carol Anton for the purpose of attracting highly qualified students from ethnically underrepresented groups, namely African-American, Hispanic and American Indian, to The University of Akron to study engineering and graduate from the College of Engineering.
A student awarded an Anton Scholarship will be known as an Anton Scholar and provided with up to $6,000 during the first academic year at The University of Akron. At least five new scholarships will be awarded annually to first-time freshman students. The scholarship may be renewed for an additional six semesters, if a student remains in good academic standing and is enrolled in an engineering degree program.
To apply for this scholarship, a University of Akron entering freshman must:

Be a domestic student from an ethnically underrepresented group, such as African-American, Hispanic, or American Indian
Select engineering as the intended major and be enrolled full time
Type or neatly hand write an essay (at least 500 words) describing: 1) Why you intend to become an engineer, 2) Your strengths and weaknesses, 3) Why a scholarship award is important to you and why you should be considered to receive a scholarship, and 4) Your school-related and other extracurricular activities and interests
Provide two letters of reference from former teachers, administrators or community leaders addressing your academic ability, character, reputation, or professional aptitude

Selection decisions for first-time freshman students are based on:

Contents of the application package, including one application form, one essay, and two letters of recommendation
Achieved academic excellence in high school, with preference for students who meet direct admission requirements into the College of Engineering

Continuing/current engineering students also are eligible to apply for this scholarship and must:

Be enrolled in the Increasing Diversity in Engineering Academic (IDEAs) Program in the College of Engineering
Complete the College of Engineering online scholarship application
Have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher

Selection decisions for continuing/current students are based on:

Contents of the online application
Demonstrated academic excellence and financial need

The College of Engineering Dean’s Office shall have authority to select the scholarship recipients and to award and administer the scholarship.
The IDEAs Program in the College of Engineering is responsible for providing academic support and professional development to all Anton Scholars. During their engineering studies, Anton Scholars will be expected to meet with Mr. and Mrs. Anton, participate in a tour of Swagelok Company, and attend workshops organized by the College of Engineering.
