AFH
ACQUISITION IX, INC.

(A
DELAWARE CORPORATION)

  



NOTES TO
UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


 

Note 1 -
The Company

AFH
Acquisition IX, Inc., (the “Company”), was incorporated
under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 18, 2007. The
Company is 100% owned by AFH Holding & Advisory, LLC (the
“Parent”). The financial statements presented represent
only those transactions of AFH Acquisition IX, Inc. The Company is
looking to acquire an existing company or acquire the technology to
begin operations.

 

As a blank
check company, the Company’s business is to pursue a business
combination through acquisition, or merger with, an existing
company. As of the date of the financial statements, the Company is
not conducting negotiations with any target business. No assurances
can be given that the Company will be successful in locating or
negotiating with any target company.

 

Since
inception, the Company has been engaged in organizational
efforts.

 

Note 2 -
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Method of
Accounting

The
Company maintains its books and prepares its financial statements
on the accrual basis of accounting.

 

Loss per
Common Share

Loss per
common share is computed in accordance with FASB ASC 260-10, by
dividing income (loss) available to common stockholders by weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for each
period

 

Use of
Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results can differ from those estimates.

 

Income
Taxes

The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC
740-10, using the asset and liability approach, which requires
recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected
future tax consequences of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts and the tax basis of such assets and liabilities.
This method utilizes enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the
year in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse and
gives immediate effect to changes in income tax rates upon
enactment. Deferred tax assets are recognized, net of any valuation
allowance, for temporary differences and net operating loss and tax
credit carry forwards. Deferred income tax expense represents the
change in net deferred assets and liability balances.

 

Financial
Instruments

The
Company’s financial instruments consist of due to parent.
Unless otherwise noted, it is management’s opinion that the
Company is not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit
risks arising from these financial instruments. The fair value of
these financial instruments approximates their carrying value,
unless otherwise noted.

Recent
Pronouncements

In January
2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-1, “Simplifying Income
Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary
Items”, which eliminates the concept from U.S. GAAP the
concept of an extraordinary item. Under the ASU, an entity will no
longer (1) segregate an extraordinary item from the results of
ordinary operations; (2) separately present an extraordinary item
on its income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing
operations; or (3) disclose income taxes and earnings-per-share
data applicable to an extraordinary item. Early adoption is
permitted. The Company’s effective date for adoption is
January 1, 2016. The Company does not expect this accounting update
to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements
in future periods, although that could change

 

There are
no other recently issued accounting pronouncements that the Company
has yet to adopt that are expected to have a material effect on its
financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows.

 

Note 3 -
Equity Securities

 

Holders of
shares of common stock shall be entitled to cast one vote for each
common share held at all stockholder’s meetings for all
purposes, including the election of directors. The common stock
does not have cumulative voting rights.

 

The
preferred stock of the Company shall be issued by the Board of
Directors of the Company in one or more classes or one or more
series within any class and such classes or series shall have such
voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such
designations, preferences, limitations or restrictions as the Board
of Directors of the Company may determine, from time to
time.

 

No holder
of shares of stock of any class shall be entitled as a matter of
right to subscribe for or purchase or receive any part of any new
or additional issue of shares of stock of any class, or of
securities convertible into shares of stock or any class, whether
now hereafter authorized or whether issued for money, for
consideration other than money, or by way of dividend.

 

As of July
31, 2016, there were no issued and outstanding preferred shares and
5,000,000 common shares were issued and outstanding to AFH Holding
& Advisory LLC.

 

Note 4 -
Going Concern

 

The
Company’s financial statements have been presented on the
basis that it is a going concern, which contemplates the
realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the
normal course of business. The Company has reported recurring
losses from operations. As a result, there is an accumulated
deficit of $76,080 at July 31, 2016.

 

The
Company’s continued existence is dependent upon its ability
to raise capital or acquire a marketable company. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern.

Litigation
with AFH Advisory and Amir F. Heshmatpour

 

Emmaus
Life Sciences, Inc.

 

AFH
Advisory is presently a plaintiff and a counterclaim defendant in a
matter that is pending in both Delaware Superior Court (Index No.
N12C-09-045-MMJ [CCLD]) and Delaware Chancery Court (Index No. C.A.
No. 8005-JJ). AFH Advisory brought the suit against Emmaus Life
Sciences, Inc. ("Emmaus") in regards to Emmaus' attempt to cancel
AFH Advisory's ownership interest in Emmaus, and its refusal to
reimburse AFH Advisory for expenses relating to a reverse merger.
Emmaus has brought counterclaims against AFH Advisory for a
declaratory judgment canceling AFH Advisory's ownership interest in
Emmaus, fraud, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment. All
parties completed document discovery and filed motions for summary
judgment. Emmaus' motion for partial summary judgment was granted
by the Court, which held that the Third Letter of Intent ("LOI
III") between AFH Advisory and Emmaus was terminated, the public
offering contemplated by LOI III was terminated, the advisor shares
Emmaus gave to AFH Advisory and its affiliates pursuant to the
terms of LOI III had been canceled, and that AFH and its affiliated
must return all Emmaus shares in their possession.   The
partial summary judgment motion brought by individual counterclaim
defendant Amir Heshmatpour, and joined in by AFH Advisory, was
granted in part by the Court, which held that Emmaus was not
entitled to compensatory damages on its fraud and fraud in the
inducement claims. Following the Court's decision on these summary
judgment motions, AFH Advisory does not have any remaining claims
against Emmaus. Emmaus continues to maintain claims against AFH
Advisory for breach of contract, fraud, and unjust enrichment. AFH
Advisory has asserted defenses for these remaining claims, and it
is defending this matter. Pursuant to a settlement agreement with
Emmaus, the terms of which are confidential, the fraud claims
against AFH and Heshmatpour brought by Emmaus have been dismissed.
On April 7, 2015, a settlement of all claims   was reached between the parties
whereby AFH Advisory agreed to transfer publicly traded securities
of one of AFH’s portfolio companies to Emmaus   with a   current   trading value of $30,000.

 

Emerald
Dairy, Inc.

 

AFH
Advisory and other entities brought a lawsuit in the Superior Court
of California, Los Angeles County against Emerald Dairy, Inc.
(“Emerald”) and its Chairman, Mr. Shan, asserting that
they were entitled to a large number of shares of Emerald, both
from Emerald and from shares individually owned, and pledged, by
Chairman Shan. Emerald and Chairman Shan defaulted.  On March
27, 2015, a default judgment was issued by the Superior Court of
California in favor of AFH Advisory in the amount of $1,132,181
which includes damages of $897,121, prejudgment interest of
$224,260, and attorney fees of $10,800. 

 

Banner
Bank Judgment

 

Mr. Amir
Heshmatpour is a defendant in two lawsuits related to Banner Bank
which have been reduced to judgment. The lawsuits arise from three
loans issued in the late 1990’s. The lender was Town Bank, a
Washington State Bank which is no longer in existence, having been
acquired by Banner Bank in the early 2000’s. The borrowers on
the three separate loans were H&H Holdings, Metrophone Telecom,
and Amir and Kathy Heshmatpour. In the early 2000’s, the
three loans were consolidated into one loan, shortly before Banner
Bank acquired Town Bank. Once this acquisition occurred, the
relationship between the borrowers and the successor lender soured,
and a default was ultimately declared on the loans.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 


Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.


What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.


The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
