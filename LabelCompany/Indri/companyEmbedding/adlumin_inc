About UsAluminum Products Inc. was established in 1978, years after its humble beginning as KAR Fabricators, an early 70’s one man shop. Aluminum Products Inc. began by building high end aluminum offshore and bay fishing boats called Little Yacht. After years of producing high end boats , Aluminum Products could make almost anything from aluminum, and was ready and positioned to combine those skills with CNC machinery. The addition of this new technology allowed the company to be involved in many projects both large and small for General Contractors, Engineering & Architecture Firms, and the Oil & Gas industry. The company is also proud to have been chosen to build equipment for the 2013 Gulf of Mexico well blowout containment project.This new machinery could also be used to make other products, such as ATV aftermarket skids, which would grow to become half of all company sales. Today ATV and UTV protective armor is proudly made here in South Louisiana and shipped to every state in the USA and several countries.  Simplicity, loyal employees and an undeterred quest for perfection is what has kept the name synonymous with great products.  Quality remains the number one priority and that virtue will never go out of style.  The facility is located on 3 acres w/ 2000 sq ft of warehouse, 6000 sq ft of air conditioned working comfort  and 1600 sq ft of office. Aluminum Products should be your number one aluminum fabrication and ATV/UTV accessory supplier.

About UsAluminum Products Inc. was established in 1978, years after its humble beginning as KAR Fabricators, an early 70’s one man shop. Aluminum Products Inc. began by building high end aluminum offshore and bay fishing boats called Little Yacht. After years of producing high end boats , Aluminum Products could make almost anything from aluminum, and was ready and positioned to combine those skills with CNC machinery. The addition of this new technology allowed the company to be involved in many projects both large and small for General Contractors, Engineering & Architecture Firms, and the Oil & Gas industry. The company is also proud to have been chosen to build equipment for the 2013 Gulf of Mexico well blowout containment project.This new machinery could also be used to make other products, such as ATV aftermarket skids, which would grow to become half of all company sales. Today ATV and UTV protective armor is proudly made here in South Louisiana and shipped to every state in the USA and several countries.  Simplicity, loyal employees and an undeterred quest for perfection is what has kept the name synonymous with great products.  Quality remains the number one priority and that virtue will never go out of style.  The facility is located on 3 acres w/ 2000 sq ft of warehouse, 6000 sq ft of air conditioned working comfort  and 1600 sq ft of office. Aluminum Products should be your number one aluminum fabrication and ATV/UTV accessory supplier.

Aluminum Decking


	Enjoy your outdoor living with LockDry® and NextDeck® aluminum decking from Nexan Building Products, Inc. Why struggle with scraping, staining, sealing or painting wood, composite or pvc decking? LockDry® and NextDeck® gives homeowners the freedom to enjoy their outdoor deck, rather than spending countless hours and money on deck maintenance and repairs.

















	  		LockDry® Aluminum Waterproof Decking from Nexan	  	



















	Expanding a home’s outdoor living space is a big trend, and so many newer homes have second or third level decks with space underneath that is basically lost. LockDry® Decking not only creates a beautifully finished and gapless deck - but when installed on a 2nd or 3rd level deck, the area underneath is instantly transformed into a dry outdoor patio, carport or storage. This allows home owners the added advantage of having more usable outdoor deck space no matter the weather.

	  		Nextdeck® Aluminum Decking by Nexan	  	




















NextDeck® is a revolutionary decking product that offers unsurpassed durability and longevity. Specifically designed to replace other high maintenance decking products, NextDeck® delivers a truly maintenance free choice. Why struggle with scraping, staining, sealing or painting wood, composite or pvc decking? NextDeck® gives homeowners the freedom to enjoy their outdoor living space and activities, rather than spending countless hours and money on deck maintenance and repairs.

What our customers are saying:
WOW! I am impressed! I called to place my order and real person answered,  spoke perfect English,  albeit a slight southern accent,  and my order was sent within a day,  shipped quickly and I had it a few days later. I saved over a hundred dollars over local and installed it my self. I cant imagine how that they could do any better. THANKS!

About UsAluminum Products Inc. was established in 1978, years after its humble beginning as KAR Fabricators, an early 70’s one man shop. Aluminum Products Inc. began by building high end aluminum offshore and bay fishing boats called Little Yacht. After years of producing high end boats , Aluminum Products could make almost anything from aluminum, and was ready and positioned to combine those skills with CNC machinery. The addition of this new technology allowed the company to be involved in many projects both large and small for General Contractors, Engineering & Architecture Firms, and the Oil & Gas industry. The company is also proud to have been chosen to build equipment for the 2013 Gulf of Mexico well blowout containment project.This new machinery could also be used to make other products, such as ATV aftermarket skids, which would grow to become half of all company sales. Today ATV and UTV protective armor is proudly made here in South Louisiana and shipped to every state in the USA and several countries.  Simplicity, loyal employees and an undeterred quest for perfection is what has kept the name synonymous with great products.  Quality remains the number one priority and that virtue will never go out of style.  The facility is located on 3 acres w/ 2000 sq ft of warehouse, 6000 sq ft of air conditioned working comfort  and 1600 sq ft of office. Aluminum Products should be your number one aluminum fabrication and ATV/UTV accessory supplier.
