Michael Kirk’s First Flip-it! Experience
Flip-it! is designed to be an easy-to-use, low-tech product right out of the package. Pennsylvania photographer, Michael Kirk, reports on his first experience with Flip-it! He writes:
“I purchased the Demb “Flip-it!” due to recommendations on a number of photography forums I frequently read.  I had a family wedding that I was attending as a guest that weekend and thought this would be a good time to try my hand at wedding photography (I primarily have been shooting sports and never shot a wedding prior).  I received my Flip It on Thursday and brought it with me to the wedding rehearsal dinner on Friday evening and again to the wedding on Saturday. Since I was not the hired Pro for the wedding and was only shooting as a guest,  I had no qualms about trying a new piece of equipment with no prior experience using it.  I went into this never using the Demb Flip-it!, not even a practice image!. You can take a look at my gallery of the wedding pictures I took:
http://www.mlkimages.smugmug.com/gallery/2442095#P-8-15 
All photos were taken using the 4″x 4 1/2″ Flip-it!; it is the easiest piece of equipment to use…..No shadows, perfect lighting.  I was/am very impressed with the results and ease of use, you can get instant quality results which is a big plus for anyone just starting out using flash photography.”
