History[edit]
Founding and growth[edit]
In 1983, Gary Burrell recruited Min H. Kao from the defense contractor Magnavox while working for the former King Radio.[6] They founded Garmin in 1989 in Lenexa, Kansas,[2] as "ProNav". ProNav's first product was a GPS unit which sold for US$2,500. The company was later renamed "Garmin", an acronym of the first names of its two founders, Gary Burrell and Min H. Kao.[7] In 1991, the U.S. Army became their first customer.[8]
By 1995, Garmin's sales had reached $105 million, and it had achieved a profit of $23 million. By 1999, sales had reached $233 million and a profit of $64 million. Garmin reported a 2006 total revenue of $1.77 billion, up 73% from $1.03 billion in 2005.[9][10]
On May 13, 1999, AirCell and Garmin International announced an alliance to develop new products that use AirCell's unique cellular air-ground link to bring affordable flight communications, navigation and safety to general aviation aircraft.[11] By 2000 Garmin had sold three million GPS devices, and was producing 50 different models. Its products were sold in 100 countries and carried by 2,500 independent distributors. As of 22 August 2000, the company held 35 patents on GPS technology. By the end of June 2000, the company employed 1,205 people: 541 in the United States, 635 in Taiwan, and 29 in the United Kingdom.[12]
Public offering[edit]
The company began public trading on NASDAQ on 8 December 2000. At that time Burrell owned 19,911,155 shares. Kao owned 20,352,803 shares. Together their holdings accounted for 45 percent of the company's stock. Kao's brother, Ruey-Jeng Kao, an attorney in Taipei, owned another 7,984,109 shares, which when combined with Burrell's and Kao's shares constituted 54.22 percent of the shares outstanding.[13]
Acquisitions[edit]




The world's only Garmin retail location is located on the Magnificent Mile in Chicago, Illinois.


In August 2003, Garmin completed acquisition of UPS Aviation Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of United Parcel Service, Inc., expanding its product line of panel-mounted GPS/NAV/COMM units and integrated cockpit systems for private and commercial aircraft. The acquired company changed its name to Garmin AT, Inc. and continued operations as a wholly owned subsidiary of Garmin International, Inc.[14]
Garmin has acquired Dynastream Innovations,[15] EME Tec Sat SAS (EME),[16] and Digital Cyclone.[17] Dynastream, in Cochrane, Alberta, produces personal monitoring technology (ANT+)—such as foot pods and heart rate monitors for sports and fitness products—and also ultra-low-power and low-cost wireless connectivity devices for a wide range of applications (ANT). EME Tec Sat SAS (EME) is the distributor of Garmin's consumer products in France; following the acquisition, EME changed its name to Garmin France SAS. Digital Cyclone Inc (DCI), located in Chanhassen, Minnesota, provides mobile weather solutions for consumers, pilots, and outdoor enthusiasts. Garmin also bought Nautamatic Marine Systems,[18] an Oregon-based company that makes autopilot systems for boats. In July 2011, Garmin finished its acquisition of the German satellite navigation company Navigon.[19]
In 2006, Garmin introduced a new corporate logo,[20] and opened its first retail store, located on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Illinois.[21]
In 2015, Garmin acquired South Africa's iKubu Ltd. for its Backtracker on-bicycle low power radar system.[22]
Corporate governance[edit]
Burrell retired in 2003 as Garmin's chief executive officer and in 2004 retired as chairman of its board of directors. He is now chairman emeritus. Kao became CEO in 2003, and chairman in 2004.[23]
In 2005, Forbes estimated Kao’s net worth at $1.5 billion. He has donated $17.5 million to the University of Tennessee. The same year Forbes estimated Burrell’s net worth as $940 million.[24]
Operations[edit]




Garmin Tech Center (台灣國際航電科技大樓) is the head office of Garmin (Asia) Corporation and located in the Xizhi District of New Taipei City, Taiwan


Garmin operates in several other countries besides the UK, USA, and Taiwan.[25] It operates as Formar (Belgium), Garmin AMB (Canada), Belanor (Norway), Trepat (Spain), and Garmin-Cluj (Romania).
Products and brands[edit]
See also: List of Garmin products
Software[edit]
In addition to devices with integrated software, Garmin also produces a number of software packages for use on a personal computer. This software was designed to run on only the Microsoft Windows operating system until 2006, when Garmin released all of its software for Mac OS X.[26]
Marine GPS[edit]
The company’s first product was the GPS 100, a panel-mounted GPS receiver aimed at the marine market, priced at $2,500. It debuted at the 1990 International Marine Technology Exposition in Chicago. The product was an instant hit and generated a backlog of orders for 5,000 units. In response to the demand thus created, Kao traveled (January 1991) to Taipei to set up manufacturing facilities.
Handheld GPS[edit]




A Garmin eTrex H, an early, basic GPS model


Another early product, a handheld GPS receiver, proved popular with military personnel serving in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia during the 1991 Gulf War. In the early 2000s (decade), Garmin launched a series of personal GPS devices aimed at recreational runners called the Forerunner. A similar wrist-worn GPS device with two dimensional GPS tracking and waypoint projection called the Garmin Foretrex is popular among day hikers, off-road mountain bikers, and sailboat racers.
eTrex[edit]




A Garmin eTrex 30 simultaneously connects to both GPS and GLONASS satellites.


The compact eTrex series, as introduced in 2000. The series includes several models with different features and options. The original eTrex, commonly nicknamed "eTrex Yellow" offered a lightweight (5.3 oz/150 g), waterproof, palm-sized 12-channel GPS receiver to backpackers, hikers, and others afoot in remote areas, along with a battery life of up to 22 hours on two AA-size batteries.[27] It was replaced in 2007 by the eTrex H, which added a high-sensitivity receiver.[28] Other more advanced eTrex models include the Summit, Venture, Legend, and Vista, each with various additional features such as WAAS, altimeter, digital compass, city database, and highway maps. Many of these models come in color and expandable-memory versions.[29]
In May 2011, Garmin refreshed the eTrex product line with improved mechanical design and support for advances in cartography and hardware technology with its release of the eTrex 10, eTrex 20, and eTrex 30, Garmin became the first company to manufacture and distribute a worldwide consumer navigation product supporting both GPS and GLONASS satellite constellations.[30][31] In May 13, 2015 Garmin released the eTrex 20x and 30x, which succeeded the eTrex 20 and 30. The main upgrade was a higher resolution screen and 4GB storage, double of the previous models.[32]
July 2, 2015 Garmin introduced its eTrex Touch line, releasing three models (25, 35 and 35t), all featuring an 2.6" touch screen.[33]

The Geko series was a compact line of handheld GPS receivers aimed at the budget or lightweight hiking market.
In 2004, Garmin introduced its 60C line of handheld GPS mapping receivers, featuring increased sensitivity and storage capacity along with a battery life of up to 30 hours in battery-save mode. This was followed by the 60Cx and 60CSx with improved color map displays.
With the GTM-11, GTM 20 and GTM 25, a Garmin GPS device receives and uses traffic message channel (TMC) information.[34] Also, some Garmin nüvi (1690, 1490T, 1450T, 1390T, 1390, 1350, 1260, 1250 and 265WT, 265T, 265W, 265, 255w and 255) comes with an integrated TMC receiver.
iQue PDA receivers[edit]
Main article: Garmin iQue
In 2003, Garmin launched the iQue line of integrated PDA-GPS receivers. On 31 October 2005, the iQue M4 became the first PDA that did not require a PC to preload the maps. The American version came with built-in maps of North America, while the UK version was supplied pre-loaded with maps of Western Europe.

In 1998, the first Garmin StreetPilot was announced at the Consumer Electronics Show. It had a black and white screen and no voice. In 2002, the StreetPilot III added a color display and voice navigation. In October 2005, Garmin released the StreetPilot i-Series, compact GPS navigators which came in three models, i2, i3, i5. The i2 has a monochrome display, and maps need to be loaded on a Transflash card. The i3 is similar, except it has a color screen. The i5 has a color screen and the maps are preprogrammed into the device. More advanced versions of the StreetPilot include the c-Series, some of which sport large color touchscreens, FM traffic notifications, support for weather and information updates from MSN Direct, and Bluetooth support.
In 2005, the nüvi 300 series was released. It was the first modern-shaped automotive GPS, with a slim rectangular shape that could fit in a pocket. In October 2006, the firm began shipping the nüvi 660, a pocket-size widescreen successor to the nüvi 300 series. The 660 added bluetooth, FM transmitter, enhanced screen brightness and screen size, all in a small "flat" size. It was the last model to feature OSGB grid reference entry. Garmin's 2012 nüvi lineup includes "essential" models (nuvi 30/40/50 series); "advanced" models (nuvi 2405/2505 series); and "prestige" (nuvi 3400/3500 series). Advanced and prestige models carry additional features . Models that carry an "LM" designation include free updates of the installed maps. The nüvi series (at least) runs under Linux.
Garmin's Zumo line is designed specifically for motorcycles.
Garmin released its 2000's series in 2010, which includes 2200 (3.5 inch display), and 2300 (4.3 inch display).
Fishfinders[edit]
Garmin also manufactures a line of sonar fishfinders, including some units that also have GPS capability.
Laptop GPS and mobile apps[edit]
In April 2008, Garmin launched Garmin Mobile PC, a GPS navigation software program for laptop PCs and other computers, based on the Microsoft Windows operating system, now discontinued.[35]
Garmin offers mobile apps for Android, Windows Phone, and for iPhone. On July 25, 2011, Garmin International, Inc. released Garmin StreetPilot Onboard N. America Version 1.0 for the iOS operating system 4.0 or later. It is compatible with iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, iPod touch (3rd and 4th generation) and GPS-enabled iPads. The iPhone app is 1.61 GB and has In-app purchases available including Traffic, and Fuel Prices. Map coverage includes North America (United States, Canada, Mexico, plus Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, the Bahamas, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint Barthelemy, and Jamaica).

Main article: Garmin Nüvifone
In early 2009, Garmin announced it would be manufacturing a location-specific cellular telephone in cooperation with Asus.[36] Called the Garmin-Asus nüvifone G60, the United States release on AT&T was scheduled for 4 October 2009.[37] Four other models in this line have since been released: two Windows Mobile-powered models for the European and Asian market, and two Android models, one for the Europe/Asia market and another for T-Mobile USA.
Personal trainers[edit]
Main article: Garmin Forerunner
The Garmin Edge and certain models of Garmin Forerunner is a suite of GPS-enabled devices for use while running or cycling.
Avionics[edit]
Main articles: Garmin G1000 and Garmin G3000




Garmin avionics (an audio control panel; a GNS 430 combined GPS/VHF navigation receiver/VHF communication transceiver; and a transponder) in a light aircraft






Garmin GWX 68 aviation weather radar unit


Garmin has a dedicated division for aviation products, such as integrated cockpits, panel mount displays, multi-function displays (MFD), transponders, radar and other related avionics. For example, the G1000 is an all-glass avionics suite for OEM aircraft.[38] The G900X is similar to the G1000 but designed for use in experimental aircraft,[39] and the G600 is a retrofit solution for several certificated aircraft.[40]
Garmin entered the aviation market in 1991 with the GPS-100AVD panel-mounted receiver. Its first portable unit, the GPS-95, was introduced in 1993. In 1994, the GPS-155 panel-mounted unit was the first GPS receiver on the market to receive full FAA certification for instrument approaches.[41][42]
In 1998, Garmin introduced the GNS-430, an integrated GPS navigation receiver/communications transceiver.[41]
Garmin-AT subsidiary[edit]
In 2003, Garmin acquired UPS Aviation Technologies, including that firm's II Morrow Apollo line of aircraft MFD/GPS/NAV/COMM units. II Morrow had been founded in Salem, Oregon in 1982 as a manufacturer of LORAN C marine and general aviation products. In 1982 its aircraft navigator 602 LORAN C receiver permitted point to point navigation. Some examples of its LORAN units are Apollo II 616B Aviation LORAN panel mount (1986), II Morrow Apollo 604 Loran Navigator (1987) and Apollo 820 GPS Flybuddy (1991). In 1986, United Parcel Service (UPS) purchased the company to expand the use of electronic technology in the package delivery and tracking business.
II Morrow shifted focus from marine business to development of package process automation technology for UPS such as vehicle management systems, automated high speed package sorting systems, as well as delivery and tracking systems. In 1999, II Morrow was renamed to UPS Aviation Technologies, and re-focused towards modernizing UPS' Boeing 7xx series Heavy Iron Transport Category Aircraft fleet, as well they also re-entered the general aviation marketplace. It certified the first Gamma 3 WAAS GPS engine for FAA Certified Precision GPS approaches.[43] The new certified WAAS engine yielded vertical and horizontal accuracy of one meter RMS in guidance into airports without existing ILS approaches. This GPS technology met the FAA's TSO-C146a primary navigation standards for en route, terminal and approach phases of flight—with WAAS augmentation as the sole means of navigation. This primary GPS "sole source" navigation capability was integrated into the CNX-80. The CNX-80 WAAS GPS/COM/NAV integrated navigator was the first product in the industry approved for primary GPS navigation. It also enabled LPV "glidescope" approaches without requiring ground nav aids. New LNAV (GPS) approaches provide the accuracy and safety of an ILS—without the ground-based localizer and glideslope equipment.[44] Later, the CNX-80 was renamed the GNS-480, under Garmin.[45]
As UPS Aviation Technologies, this subsidiary was also involved with development, engineering, and manufacturing functional products for the FAA's Capstone program, which also included ADS-B transponder (UAT and FIS), datalink services, and the MX-20 Multi Function Display that in addition to NAV, it displayed terrain, real-time weather, Jeppeson plates, other ADS-B aircraft, and a variety of other functions in 2000.
Under the FAA Capstone Phase I program, a fleet of small commercial aircraft were equipped for an evaluation of the safety benefits from the use of advanced technologies during day-to-day operations in Alaska's high-risk operating environment. The aircraft are fitted with IFR capable GPS receivers, a Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) data-link system that enables Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and Flight Information Services (FIS) including real-time weather, and a multifunction display (MFD) depicting terrain, other ADS-B aircraft, and weather graphics and text data. These avionics was installed on 200 aircraft used for commuter, charter and mail flights in southwest Alaska.
In 1999: Flight International magazine presented UPS Aviation Technologies with its Aerospace Industry Award for the development of ADS-B, a surveillance technology intended to reduce aviation delays while improving safety. [46]
Wristwear[edit]




Garmin Fenix3 Multisport GPS Watch


The Garmin Vivofit 3 measures the wearer's steps, measures his sleep, judges his body movement, and counts his heart rate and the number of stairs that he has climbed.[47]
The Garmin Vivomove is a classic watch with an activity tracking capabilities. It has a built-in accelerometer (calculates distance for indoor workouts, without need for a foot pod), step counter, auto goal (learns the wearer's activity level and assigns a daily step goal), move bar, and sleep-monitoring capabilities.[48]
The Garmin produces the Vivo HRSmart, the most remarkable wearable technology with the affordable price compared to the competitor. Vivo HRSmart is significantly improved from the previous model, Vivo fit 3. It comes with the touch screen and includes sensible heart-rate monitoring, media player controller, receivable text and phone finder features.
The Garmin Forerunner 735 XT features multi-sport tracking capabilities, built in heart rate sensor, and a variety of special profiles for jogging, swimming, cycling, skiing, paddle sports, a variety of weight loss activities, and hiking. It comes with built-in GPS to track the location and to calculate the distance. .[49] Garmin announced the latest multisport GPS smartwatch Fenix 5 on January 4, 2017, with some advanced features .[50]
Maps[edit]
Most current Garmin devices can display its current location on a map, which is vector-based and stored in the built-in memory or loaded from additional flash media. The built-in (or 'basemap') displays all country borders and major cities. Garmin offers different maps for purchase, including detailed road maps, topographic maps and nautical maps. Non-commercial maps are also available and can be displayed on most Garmin GPS devices.
The maps used by Garmin products are currently provided by Navteq.[51] Map errors are handled using Navteq Map Reporter.[52] Errors can be reported using Garmin's report a map error page,[53] or by using the Navteq map reporter.[54]
Sport sponsorship[edit]
In 2007 Garmin began sponsorship of English Premier League football club Middlesbrough in a one-year deal that was carried into a second year for the 2008/09 season.[55] In 2008 Garmin began sponsorship of cycling team Garmin-Sharp to promote its Edge line of bicycle computers.[56] In 2015, the team became Cannondale-Garmin.[57] In 2014 Garmin paired up with Premier League side Southampton FC in a global partnership. Garmin's European head office is located in Southampton.[58]

History[edit]
Founding and growth[edit]
In 1983, Gary Burrell recruited Min H. Kao from the defense contractor Magnavox while working for the former King Radio.[6] They founded Garmin in 1989 in Lenexa, Kansas,[2] as "ProNav". ProNav's first product was a GPS unit which sold for US$2,500. The company was later renamed "Garmin", an acronym of the first names of its two founders, Gary Burrell and Min H. Kao.[7] In 1991, the U.S. Army became their first customer.[8]
By 1995, Garmin's sales had reached $105 million, and it had achieved a profit of $23 million. By 1999, sales had reached $233 million and a profit of $64 million. Garmin reported a 2006 total revenue of $1.77 billion, up 73% from $1.03 billion in 2005.[9][10]
On May 13, 1999, AirCell and Garmin International announced an alliance to develop new products that use AirCell's unique cellular air-ground link to bring affordable flight communications, navigation and safety to general aviation aircraft.[11] By 2000 Garmin had sold three million GPS devices, and was producing 50 different models. Its products were sold in 100 countries and carried by 2,500 independent distributors. As of 22 August 2000, the company held 35 patents on GPS technology. By the end of June 2000, the company employed 1,205 people: 541 in the United States, 635 in Taiwan, and 29 in the United Kingdom.[12]
Public offering[edit]
The company began public trading on NASDAQ on 8 December 2000. At that time Burrell owned 19,911,155 shares. Kao owned 20,352,803 shares. Together their holdings accounted for 45 percent of the company's stock. Kao's brother, Ruey-Jeng Kao, an attorney in Taipei, owned another 7,984,109 shares, which when combined with Burrell's and Kao's shares constituted 54.22 percent of the shares outstanding.[13]
Acquisitions[edit]




The world's only Garmin retail location is located on the Magnificent Mile in Chicago, Illinois.


In August 2003, Garmin completed acquisition of UPS Aviation Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of United Parcel Service, Inc., expanding its product line of panel-mounted GPS/NAV/COMM units and integrated cockpit systems for private and commercial aircraft. The acquired company changed its name to Garmin AT, Inc. and continued operations as a wholly owned subsidiary of Garmin International, Inc.[14]
Garmin has acquired Dynastream Innovations,[15] EME Tec Sat SAS (EME),[16] and Digital Cyclone.[17] Dynastream, in Cochrane, Alberta, produces personal monitoring technology (ANT+)—such as foot pods and heart rate monitors for sports and fitness products—and also ultra-low-power and low-cost wireless connectivity devices for a wide range of applications (ANT). EME Tec Sat SAS (EME) is the distributor of Garmin's consumer products in France; following the acquisition, EME changed its name to Garmin France SAS. Digital Cyclone Inc (DCI), located in Chanhassen, Minnesota, provides mobile weather solutions for consumers, pilots, and outdoor enthusiasts. Garmin also bought Nautamatic Marine Systems,[18] an Oregon-based company that makes autopilot systems for boats. In July 2011, Garmin finished its acquisition of the German satellite navigation company Navigon.[19]
In 2006, Garmin introduced a new corporate logo,[20] and opened its first retail store, located on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Illinois.[21]
In 2015, Garmin acquired South Africa's iKubu Ltd. for its Backtracker on-bicycle low power radar system.[22]
Corporate governance[edit]
Burrell retired in 2003 as Garmin's chief executive officer and in 2004 retired as chairman of its board of directors. He is now chairman emeritus. Kao became CEO in 2003, and chairman in 2004.[23]
In 2005, Forbes estimated Kao’s net worth at $1.5 billion. He has donated $17.5 million to the University of Tennessee. The same year Forbes estimated Burrell’s net worth as $940 million.[24]
Operations[edit]




Garmin Tech Center (台灣國際航電科技大樓) is the head office of Garmin (Asia) Corporation and located in the Xizhi District of New Taipei City, Taiwan


Garmin operates in several other countries besides the UK, USA, and Taiwan.[25] It operates as Formar (Belgium), Garmin AMB (Canada), Belanor (Norway), Trepat (Spain), and Garmin-Cluj (Romania).

In addition to devices with integrated software, Garmin also produces a number of software packages for use on a personal computer. This software was designed to run on only the Microsoft Windows operating system until 2006, when Garmin released all of its software for Mac OS X.[26]
Marine GPS[edit]
The company’s first product was the GPS 100, a panel-mounted GPS receiver aimed at the marine market, priced at $2,500. It debuted at the 1990 International Marine Technology Exposition in Chicago. The product was an instant hit and generated a backlog of orders for 5,000 units. In response to the demand thus created, Kao traveled (January 1991) to Taipei to set up manufacturing facilities.
Handheld GPS[edit]




A Garmin eTrex H, an early, basic GPS model


Another early product, a handheld GPS receiver, proved popular with military personnel serving in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia during the 1991 Gulf War. In the early 2000s (decade), Garmin launched a series of personal GPS devices aimed at recreational runners called the Forerunner. A similar wrist-worn GPS device with two dimensional GPS tracking and waypoint projection called the Garmin Foretrex is popular among day hikers, off-road mountain bikers, and sailboat racers.
eTrex[edit]




A Garmin eTrex 30 simultaneously connects to both GPS and GLONASS satellites.


The compact eTrex series, as introduced in 2000. The series includes several models with different features and options. The original eTrex, commonly nicknamed "eTrex Yellow" offered a lightweight (5.3 oz/150 g), waterproof, palm-sized 12-channel GPS receiver to backpackers, hikers, and others afoot in remote areas, along with a battery life of up to 22 hours on two AA-size batteries.[27] It was replaced in 2007 by the eTrex H, which added a high-sensitivity receiver.[28] Other more advanced eTrex models include the Summit, Venture, Legend, and Vista, each with various additional features such as WAAS, altimeter, digital compass, city database, and highway maps. Many of these models come in color and expandable-memory versions.[29]
In May 2011, Garmin refreshed the eTrex product line with improved mechanical design and support for advances in cartography and hardware technology with its release of the eTrex 10, eTrex 20, and eTrex 30, Garmin became the first company to manufacture and distribute a worldwide consumer navigation product supporting both GPS and GLONASS satellite constellations.[30][31] In May 13, 2015 Garmin released the eTrex 20x and 30x, which succeeded the eTrex 20 and 30. The main upgrade was a higher resolution screen and 4GB storage, double of the previous models.[32]
July 2, 2015 Garmin introduced its eTrex Touch line, releasing three models (25, 35 and 35t), all featuring an 2.6" touch screen.[33]

In 1998, the first Garmin StreetPilot was announced at the Consumer Electronics Show. It had a black and white screen and no voice. In 2002, the StreetPilot III added a color display and voice navigation. In October 2005, Garmin released the StreetPilot i-Series, compact GPS navigators which came in three models, i2, i3, i5. The i2 has a monochrome display, and maps need to be loaded on a Transflash card. The i3 is similar, except it has a color screen. The i5 has a color screen and the maps are preprogrammed into the device. More advanced versions of the StreetPilot include the c-Series, some of which sport large color touchscreens, FM traffic notifications, support for weather and information updates from MSN Direct, and Bluetooth support.
In 2005, the nüvi 300 series was released. It was the first modern-shaped automotive GPS, with a slim rectangular shape that could fit in a pocket. In October 2006, the firm began shipping the nüvi 660, a pocket-size widescreen successor to the nüvi 300 series. The 660 added bluetooth, FM transmitter, enhanced screen brightness and screen size, all in a small "flat" size. It was the last model to feature OSGB grid reference entry. Garmin's 2012 nüvi lineup includes "essential" models (nuvi 30/40/50 series); "advanced" models (nuvi 2405/2505 series); and "prestige" (nuvi 3400/3500 series). Advanced and prestige models carry additional features . Models that carry an "LM" designation include free updates of the installed maps. The nüvi series (at least) runs under Linux.
Garmin's Zumo line is designed specifically for motorcycles.
Garmin released its 2000's series in 2010, which includes 2200 (3.5 inch display), and 2300 (4.3 inch display).
Fishfinders[edit]
Garmin also manufactures a line of sonar fishfinders, including some units that also have GPS capability.
Laptop GPS and mobile apps[edit]
In April 2008, Garmin launched Garmin Mobile PC, a GPS navigation software program for laptop PCs and other computers, based on the Microsoft Windows operating system, now discontinued.[35]
Garmin offers mobile apps for Android, Windows Phone, and for iPhone. On July 25, 2011, Garmin International, Inc. released Garmin StreetPilot Onboard N. America Version 1.0 for the iOS operating system 4.0 or later. It is compatible with iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, iPod touch (3rd and 4th generation) and GPS-enabled iPads.

The Garmin Edge and certain models of Garmin Forerunner is a suite of GPS-enabled devices for use while running or cycling.
Avionics[edit]
Main articles: Garmin G1000 and Garmin G3000




Garmin avionics (an audio control panel; a GNS 430 combined GPS/VHF navigation receiver/VHF communication transceiver; and a transponder) in a light aircraft






Garmin GWX 68 aviation weather radar unit


Garmin has a dedicated division for aviation products, such as integrated cockpits, panel mount displays, multi-function displays (MFD), transponders, radar and other related avionics. For example, the G1000 is an all-glass avionics suite for OEM aircraft.[38] The G900X is similar to the G1000 but designed for use in experimental aircraft,[39] and the G600 is a retrofit solution for several certificated aircraft.[40]
Garmin entered the aviation market in 1991 with the GPS-100AVD panel-mounted receiver. Its first portable unit, the GPS-95, was introduced in 1993. In 1994, the GPS-155 panel-mounted unit was the first GPS receiver on the market to receive full FAA certification for instrument approaches.[41][42]
In 1998, Garmin introduced the GNS-430, an integrated GPS navigation receiver/communications transceiver.[41]
Garmin-AT subsidiary[edit]
In 2003, Garmin acquired UPS Aviation Technologies, including that firm's II Morrow Apollo line of aircraft MFD/GPS/NAV/COMM units. II Morrow had been founded in Salem, Oregon in 1982 as a manufacturer of LORAN C marine and general aviation products. In 1982 its aircraft navigator 602 LORAN C receiver permitted point to point navigation. Some examples of its LORAN units are Apollo II 616B Aviation LORAN panel mount (1986), II Morrow Apollo 604 Loran Navigator (1987) and Apollo 820 GPS Flybuddy (1991). In 1986, United Parcel Service (UPS) purchased the company to expand the use of electronic technology in the package delivery and tracking business.
II Morrow shifted focus from marine business to development of package process automation technology for UPS such as vehicle management systems, automated high speed package sorting systems, as well as delivery and tracking systems. In 1999, II Morrow was renamed to UPS Aviation Technologies, and re-focused towards modernizing UPS' Boeing 7xx series Heavy Iron Transport Category Aircraft fleet, as well they also re-entered the general aviation marketplace. It certified the first Gamma 3 WAAS GPS engine for FAA Certified Precision GPS approaches.[43] The new certified WAAS engine yielded vertical and horizontal accuracy of one meter RMS in guidance into airports without existing ILS approaches. This GPS technology met the FAA's TSO-C146a primary navigation standards for en route, terminal and approach phases of flight—with WAAS augmentation as the sole means of navigation. This primary GPS "sole source" navigation capability was integrated into the CNX-80. The CNX-80 WAAS GPS/COM/NAV integrated navigator was the first product in the industry approved for primary GPS navigation. It also enabled LPV "glidescope" approaches without requiring ground nav aids. New LNAV (GPS) approaches provide the accuracy and safety of an ILS—without the ground-based localizer and glideslope equipment.[44] Later, the CNX-80 was renamed the GNS-480, under Garmin.[45]
As UPS Aviation Technologies, this subsidiary was also involved with development, engineering, and manufacturing functional products for the FAA's Capstone program, which also included ADS-B transponder (UAT and FIS), datalink services, and the MX-20 Multi Function Display that in addition to NAV, it displayed terrain, real-time weather, Jeppeson plates, other ADS-B aircraft, and a variety of other functions in 2000.
Under the FAA Capstone Phase I program, a fleet of small commercial aircraft were equipped for an evaluation of the safety benefits from the use of advanced technologies during day-to-day operations in Alaska's high-risk operating environment. The aircraft are fitted with IFR capable GPS receivers, a Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) data-link system that enables Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and Flight Information Services (FIS) including real-time weather, and a multifunction display (MFD) depicting terrain, other ADS-B aircraft, and weather graphics and text data. These avionics was installed on 200 aircraft used for commuter, charter and mail flights in southwest Alaska.
In 1999: Flight International magazine presented UPS Aviation Technologies with its Aerospace Industry Award for the development of ADS-B, a surveillance technology intended to reduce aviation delays while improving safety. [46]
Wristwear[edit]




Garmin Fenix3 Multisport GPS Watch


The Garmin Vivofit 3 measures the wearer's steps, measures his sleep, judges his body movement, and counts his heart rate and the number of stairs that he has climbed.[47]
The Garmin Vivomove is a classic watch with an activity tracking capabilities. It has a built-in accelerometer (calculates distance for indoor workouts, without need for a foot pod), step counter, auto goal (learns the wearer's activity level and assigns a daily step goal), move bar, and sleep-monitoring capabilities.[48]
The Garmin produces the Vivo HRSmart, the most remarkable wearable technology with the affordable price compared to the competitor. Vivo HRSmart is significantly improved from the previous model, Vivo fit 3. It comes with the touch screen and includes sensible heart-rate monitoring, media player controller, receivable text and phone finder features.
The Garmin Forerunner 735 XT features multi-sport tracking capabilities, built in heart rate sensor, and a variety of special profiles for jogging, swimming, cycling, skiing, paddle sports, a variety of weight loss activities, and hiking. It comes with built-in GPS to track the location and to calculate the distance. .[49] Garmin announced the latest multisport GPS smartwatch Fenix 5 on January 4, 2017, with some advanced features .[50]
Maps[edit]
Most current Garmin devices can display its current location on a map, which is vector-based and stored in the built-in memory or loaded from additional flash media. The built-in (or 'basemap') displays all country borders and major cities. Garmin offers different maps for purchase, including detailed road maps, topographic maps and nautical maps. Non-commercial maps are also available and can be displayed on most Garmin GPS devices.
The maps used by Garmin products are currently provided by Navteq.[51] Map errors are handled using Navteq Map Reporter.[52] Errors can be reported using Garmin's report a map error page,[53] or by using the Navteq map reporter.[54]
Sport sponsorship[edit]
In 2007 Garmin began sponsorship of English Premier League football club Middlesbrough in a one-year deal that was carried into a second year for the 2008/09 season.[55] In 2008 Garmin began sponsorship of cycling team Garmin-Sharp to promote its Edge line of bicycle computers.[56] In 2015, the team became Cannondale-Garmin.[57] In 2014 Garmin paired up with Premier League side Southampton FC in a global partnership. Garmin's European head office is located in Southampton.[58]

History[edit]
Founding and growth[edit]
In 1983, Gary Burrell recruited Min H. Kao from the defense contractor Magnavox while working for the former King Radio.[6] They founded Garmin in 1989 in Lenexa, Kansas,[2] as "ProNav". ProNav's first product was a GPS unit which sold for US$2,500. The company was later renamed "Garmin", an acronym of the first names of its two founders, Gary Burrell and Min H. Kao.[7] In 1991, the U.S. Army became their first customer.[8]
By 1995, Garmin's sales had reached $105 million, and it had achieved a profit of $23 million. By 1999, sales had reached $233 million and a profit of $64 million. Garmin reported a 2006 total revenue of $1.77 billion, up 73% from $1.03 billion in 2005.[9][10]
On May 13, 1999, AirCell and Garmin International announced an alliance to develop new products that use AirCell's unique cellular air-ground link to bring affordable flight communications, navigation and safety to general aviation aircraft.[11] By 2000 Garmin had sold three million GPS devices, and was producing 50 different models. Its products were sold in 100 countries and carried by 2,500 independent distributors. As of 22 August 2000, the company held 35 patents on GPS technology. By the end of June 2000, the company employed 1,205 people: 541 in the United States, 635 in Taiwan, and 29 in the United Kingdom.[12]
Public offering[edit]
The company began public trading on NASDAQ on 8 December 2000. At that time Burrell owned 19,911,155 shares. Kao owned 20,352,803 shares. Together their holdings accounted for 45 percent of the company's stock. Kao's brother, Ruey-Jeng Kao, an attorney in Taipei, owned another 7,984,109 shares, which when combined with Burrell's and Kao's shares constituted 54.22 percent of the shares outstanding.[13]
Acquisitions[edit]




The world's only Garmin retail location is located on the Magnificent Mile in Chicago, Illinois.


In August 2003, Garmin completed acquisition of UPS Aviation Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of United Parcel Service, Inc., expanding its product line of panel-mounted GPS/NAV/COMM units and integrated cockpit systems for private and commercial aircraft. The acquired company changed its name to Garmin AT, Inc. and continued operations as a wholly owned subsidiary of Garmin International, Inc.[14]
Garmin has acquired Dynastream Innovations,[15] EME Tec Sat SAS (EME),[16] and Digital Cyclone.[17] Dynastream, in Cochrane, Alberta, produces personal monitoring technology (ANT+)—such as foot pods and heart rate monitors for sports and fitness products—and also ultra-low-power and low-cost wireless connectivity devices for a wide range of applications (ANT). EME Tec Sat SAS (EME) is the distributor of Garmin's consumer products in France; following the acquisition, EME changed its name to Garmin France SAS. Digital Cyclone Inc (DCI), located in Chanhassen, Minnesota, provides mobile weather solutions for consumers, pilots, and outdoor enthusiasts. Garmin also bought Nautamatic Marine Systems,[18] an Oregon-based company that makes autopilot systems for boats. In July 2011, Garmin finished its acquisition of the German satellite navigation company Navigon.[19]
In 2006, Garmin introduced a new corporate logo,[20] and opened its first retail store, located on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Illinois.[21]
In 2015, Garmin acquired South Africa's iKubu Ltd. for its Backtracker on-bicycle low power radar system.[22]
Corporate governance[edit]
Burrell retired in 2003 as Garmin's chief executive officer and in 2004 retired as chairman of its board of directors. He is now chairman emeritus. Kao became CEO in 2003, and chairman in 2004.[23]
In 2005, Forbes estimated Kao’s net worth at $1.5 billion. He has donated $17.5 million to the University of Tennessee. The same year Forbes estimated Burrell’s net worth as $940 million.[24]
Operations[edit]




Garmin Tech Center (台灣國際航電科技大樓) is the head office of Garmin (Asia) Corporation and located in the Xizhi District of New Taipei City, Taiwan


Garmin operates in several other countries besides the UK, USA, and Taiwan.[25] It operates as Formar (Belgium), Garmin AMB (Canada), Belanor (Norway), Trepat (Spain), and Garmin-Cluj (Romania).
Products and brands[edit]

Software[edit]
In addition to devices with integrated software, Garmin also produces a number of software packages for use on a personal computer. This software was designed to run on only the Microsoft Windows operating system until 2006, when Garmin released all of its software for Mac OS X.[26]
Marine GPS[edit]
The company’s first product was the GPS 100, a panel-mounted GPS receiver aimed at the marine market, priced at $2,500. It debuted at the 1990 International Marine Technology Exposition in Chicago. The product was an instant hit and generated a backlog of orders for 5,000 units. In response to the demand thus created, Kao traveled (January 1991) to Taipei to set up manufacturing facilities.
Handheld GPS[edit]




A Garmin eTrex H, an early, basic GPS model


Another early product, a handheld GPS receiver, proved popular with military personnel serving in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia during the 1991 Gulf War. In the early 2000s (decade), Garmin launched a series of personal GPS devices aimed at recreational runners called the Forerunner. A similar wrist-worn GPS device with two dimensional GPS tracking and waypoint projection called the Garmin Foretrex is popular among day hikers, off-road mountain bikers, and sailboat racers.
eTrex[edit]




A Garmin eTrex 30 simultaneously connects to both GPS and GLONASS satellites.


The compact eTrex series, as introduced in 2000. The series includes several models with different features and options. The original eTrex, commonly nicknamed "eTrex Yellow" offered a lightweight (5.3 oz/150 g), waterproof, palm-sized 12-channel GPS receiver to backpackers, hikers, and others afoot in remote areas, along with a battery life of up to 22 hours on two AA-size batteries.[27] It was replaced in 2007 by the eTrex H, which added a high-sensitivity receiver.[28] Other more advanced eTrex models include the Summit, Venture, Legend, and Vista, each with various additional features such as WAAS, altimeter, digital compass, city database, and highway maps. Many of these models come in color and expandable-memory versions.[29]
In May 2011, Garmin refreshed the eTrex product line with improved mechanical design and support for advances in cartography and hardware technology with its release of the eTrex 10, eTrex 20, and eTrex 30, Garmin became the first company to manufacture and distribute a worldwide consumer navigation product supporting both GPS and GLONASS satellite constellations.[30][31] In May 13, 2015 Garmin released the eTrex 20x and 30x, which succeeded the eTrex 20 and 30. The main upgrade was a higher resolution screen and 4GB storage, double of the previous models.[32]
July 2, 2015 Garmin introduced its eTrex Touch line, releasing three models (25, 35 and 35t), all featuring an 2.6" touch screen.[33]

In 1998, the first Garmin StreetPilot was announced at the Consumer Electronics Show. It had a black and white screen and no voice. In 2002, the StreetPilot III added a color display and voice navigation. In October 2005, Garmin released the StreetPilot i-Series, compact GPS navigators which came in three models, i2, i3, i5. The i2 has a monochrome display, and maps need to be loaded on a Transflash card. The i3 is similar, except it has a color screen. The i5 has a color screen and the maps are preprogrammed into the device. More advanced versions of the StreetPilot include the c-Series, some of which sport large color touchscreens, FM traffic notifications, support for weather and information updates from MSN Direct, and Bluetooth support.
In 2005, the nüvi 300 series was released. It was the first modern-shaped automotive GPS, with a slim rectangular shape that could fit in a pocket. In October 2006, the firm began shipping the nüvi 660, a pocket-size widescreen successor to the nüvi 300 series. The 660 added bluetooth, FM transmitter, enhanced screen brightness and screen size, all in a small "flat" size. It was the last model to feature OSGB grid reference entry. Garmin's 2012 nüvi lineup includes "essential" models (nuvi 30/40/50 series); "advanced" models (nuvi 2405/2505 series); and "prestige" (nuvi 3400/3500 series). Advanced and prestige models carry additional features . Models that carry an "LM" designation include free updates of the installed maps. The nüvi series (at least) runs under Linux.
Garmin's Zumo line is designed specifically for motorcycles.
Garmin released its 2000's series in 2010, which includes 2200 (3.5 inch display), and 2300 (4.3 inch display).

Avionics[edit]
Main articles: Garmin G1000 and Garmin G3000




Garmin avionics (an audio control panel; a GNS 430 combined GPS/VHF navigation receiver/VHF communication transceiver; and a transponder) in a light aircraft






Garmin GWX 68 aviation weather radar unit


Garmin has a dedicated division for aviation products, such as integrated cockpits, panel mount displays, multi-function displays (MFD), transponders, radar and other related avionics. For example, the G1000 is an all-glass avionics suite for OEM aircraft.[38] The G900X is similar to the G1000 but designed for use in experimental aircraft,[39] and the G600 is a retrofit solution for several certificated aircraft.[40]
Garmin entered the aviation market in 1991 with the GPS-100AVD panel-mounted receiver. Its first portable unit, the GPS-95, was introduced in 1993. In 1994, the GPS-155 panel-mounted unit was the first GPS receiver on the market to receive full FAA certification for instrument approaches.[41][42]
In 1998, Garmin introduced the GNS-430, an integrated GPS navigation receiver/communications transceiver.[41]
Garmin-AT subsidiary[edit]
In 2003, Garmin acquired UPS Aviation Technologies, including that firm's II Morrow Apollo line of aircraft MFD/GPS/NAV/COMM units. II Morrow had been founded in Salem, Oregon in 1982 as a manufacturer of LORAN C marine and general aviation products. In 1982 its aircraft navigator 602 LORAN C receiver permitted point to point navigation. Some examples of its LORAN units are Apollo II 616B Aviation LORAN panel mount (1986), II Morrow Apollo 604 Loran Navigator (1987) and Apollo 820 GPS Flybuddy (1991). In 1986, United Parcel Service (UPS) purchased the company to expand the use of electronic technology in the package delivery and tracking business.
II Morrow shifted focus from marine business to development of package process automation technology for UPS such as vehicle management systems, automated high speed package sorting systems, as well as delivery and tracking systems. In 1999, II Morrow was renamed to UPS Aviation Technologies, and re-focused towards modernizing UPS' Boeing 7xx series Heavy Iron Transport Category Aircraft fleet, as well they also re-entered the general aviation marketplace. It certified the first Gamma 3 WAAS GPS engine for FAA Certified Precision GPS approaches.[43] The new certified WAAS engine yielded vertical and horizontal accuracy of one meter RMS in guidance into airports without existing ILS approaches. This GPS technology met the FAA's TSO-C146a primary navigation standards for en route, terminal and approach phases of flight—with WAAS augmentation as the sole means of navigation. This primary GPS "sole source" navigation capability was integrated into the CNX-80. The CNX-80 WAAS GPS/COM/NAV integrated navigator was the first product in the industry approved for primary GPS navigation. It also enabled LPV "glidescope" approaches without requiring ground nav aids. New LNAV (GPS) approaches provide the accuracy and safety of an ILS—without the ground-based localizer and glideslope equipment.[44] Later, the CNX-80 was renamed the GNS-480, under Garmin.[45]
As UPS Aviation Technologies, this subsidiary was also involved with development, engineering, and manufacturing functional products for the FAA's Capstone program, which also included ADS-B transponder (UAT and FIS), datalink services, and the MX-20 Multi Function Display that in addition to NAV, it displayed terrain, real-time weather, Jeppeson plates, other ADS-B aircraft, and a variety of other functions in 2000.
Under the FAA Capstone Phase I program, a fleet of small commercial aircraft were equipped for an evaluation of the safety benefits from the use of advanced technologies during day-to-day operations in Alaska's high-risk operating environment. The aircraft are fitted with IFR capable GPS receivers, a Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) data-link system that enables Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and Flight Information Services (FIS) including real-time weather, and a multifunction display (MFD) depicting terrain, other ADS-B aircraft, and weather graphics and text data. These avionics was installed on 200 aircraft used for commuter, charter and mail flights in southwest Alaska.
In 1999: Flight International magazine presented UPS Aviation Technologies with its Aerospace Industry Award for the development of ADS-B, a surveillance technology intended to reduce aviation delays while improving safety. [46]
Wristwear[edit]




Garmin Fenix3 Multisport GPS Watch


The Garmin Vivofit 3 measures the wearer's steps, measures his sleep, judges his body movement, and counts his heart rate and the number of stairs that he has climbed.[47]
The Garmin Vivomove is a classic watch with an activity tracking capabilities. It has a built-in accelerometer (calculates distance for indoor workouts, without need for a foot pod), step counter, auto goal (learns the wearer's activity level and assigns a daily step goal), move bar, and sleep-monitoring capabilities.[48]
The Garmin produces the Vivo HRSmart, the most remarkable wearable technology with the affordable price compared to the competitor. Vivo HRSmart is significantly improved from the previous model, Vivo fit 3. It comes with the touch screen and includes sensible heart-rate monitoring, media player controller, receivable text and phone finder features.
The Garmin Forerunner 735 XT features multi-sport tracking capabilities, built in heart rate sensor, and a variety of special profiles for jogging, swimming, cycling, skiing, paddle sports, a variety of weight loss activities, and hiking. It comes with built-in GPS to track the location and to calculate the distance. .[49] Garmin announced the latest multisport GPS smartwatch Fenix 5 on January 4, 2017, with some advanced features .[50]
Maps[edit]
Most current Garmin devices can display its current location on a map, which is vector-based and stored in the built-in memory or loaded from additional flash media. The built-in (or 'basemap') displays all country borders and major cities. Garmin offers different maps for purchase, including detailed road maps, topographic maps and nautical maps. Non-commercial maps are also available and can be displayed on most Garmin GPS devices.
The maps used by Garmin products are currently provided by Navteq.[51] Map errors are handled using Navteq Map Reporter.[52] Errors can be reported using Garmin's report a map error page,[53] or by using the Navteq map reporter.[54]
Sport sponsorship[edit]
In 2007 Garmin began sponsorship of English Premier League football club Middlesbrough in a one-year deal that was carried into a second year for the 2008/09 season.[55] In 2008 Garmin began sponsorship of cycling team Garmin-Sharp to promote its Edge line of bicycle computers.[56] In 2015, the team became Cannondale-Garmin.[57] In 2014 Garmin paired up with Premier League side Southampton FC in a global partnership. Garmin's European head office is located in Southampton.[58]

History[edit]
Founding and growth[edit]
In 1983, Gary Burrell recruited Min H. Kao from the defense contractor Magnavox while working for the former King Radio.[6] They founded Garmin in 1989 in Lenexa, Kansas,[2] as "ProNav". ProNav's first product was a GPS unit which sold for US$2,500. The company was later renamed "Garmin", an acronym of the first names of its two founders, Gary Burrell and Min H. Kao.[7] In 1991, the U.S. Army became their first customer.[8]
By 1995, Garmin's sales had reached $105 million, and it had achieved a profit of $23 million. By 1999, sales had reached $233 million and a profit of $64 million. Garmin reported a 2006 total revenue of $1.77 billion, up 73% from $1.03 billion in 2005.[9][10]
On May 13, 1999, AirCell and Garmin International announced an alliance to develop new products that use AirCell's unique cellular air-ground link to bring affordable flight communications, navigation and safety to general aviation aircraft.[11] By 2000 Garmin had sold three million GPS devices, and was producing 50 different models. Its products were sold in 100 countries and carried by 2,500 independent distributors. As of 22 August 2000, the company held 35 patents on GPS technology. By the end of June 2000, the company employed 1,205 people: 541 in the United States, 635 in Taiwan, and 29 in the United Kingdom.[12]
Public offering[edit]
The company began public trading on NASDAQ on 8 December 2000. At that time Burrell owned 19,911,155 shares. Kao owned 20,352,803 shares. Together their holdings accounted for 45 percent of the company's stock. Kao's brother, Ruey-Jeng Kao, an attorney in Taipei, owned another 7,984,109 shares, which when combined with Burrell's and Kao's shares constituted 54.22 percent of the shares outstanding.[13]
Acquisitions[edit]




The world's only Garmin retail location is located on the Magnificent Mile in Chicago, Illinois.


In August 2003, Garmin completed acquisition of UPS Aviation Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of United Parcel Service, Inc., expanding its product line of panel-mounted GPS/NAV/COMM units and integrated cockpit systems for private and commercial aircraft. The acquired company changed its name to Garmin AT, Inc. and continued operations as a wholly owned subsidiary of Garmin International, Inc.[14]
Garmin has acquired Dynastream Innovations,[15] EME Tec Sat SAS (EME),[16] and Digital Cyclone.[17] Dynastream, in Cochrane, Alberta, produces personal monitoring technology (ANT+)—such as foot pods and heart rate monitors for sports and fitness products—and also ultra-low-power and low-cost wireless connectivity devices for a wide range of applications (ANT). EME Tec Sat SAS (EME) is the distributor of Garmin's consumer products in France; following the acquisition, EME changed its name to Garmin France SAS. Digital Cyclone Inc (DCI), located in Chanhassen, Minnesota, provides mobile weather solutions for consumers, pilots, and outdoor enthusiasts. Garmin also bought Nautamatic Marine Systems,[18] an Oregon-based company that makes autopilot systems for boats. In July 2011, Garmin finished its acquisition of the German satellite navigation company Navigon.[19]
In 2006, Garmin introduced a new corporate logo,[20] and opened its first retail store, located on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Illinois.[21]
In 2015, Garmin acquired South Africa's iKubu Ltd. for its Backtracker on-bicycle low power radar system.[22]
Corporate governance[edit]
Burrell retired in 2003 as Garmin's chief executive officer and in 2004 retired as chairman of its board of directors. He is now chairman emeritus. Kao became CEO in 2003, and chairman in 2004.[23]
In 2005, Forbes estimated Kao’s net worth at $1.5 billion. He has donated $17.5 million to the University of Tennessee. The same year Forbes estimated Burrell’s net worth as $940 million.[24]
Operations[edit]




Garmin Tech Center (台灣國際航電科技大樓) is the head office of Garmin (Asia) Corporation and located in the Xizhi District of New Taipei City, Taiwan


Garmin operates in several other countries besides the UK, USA, and Taiwan.[25] It operates as Formar (Belgium), Garmin AMB (Canada), Belanor (Norway), Trepat (Spain), and Garmin-Cluj (Romania).
Products and brands[edit]
See also: List of Garmin products
Software[edit]
In addition to devices with integrated software, Garmin also produces a number of software packages for use on a personal computer. This software was designed to run on only the Microsoft Windows operating system until 2006, when Garmin released all of its software for Mac OS X.[26]
Marine GPS[edit]
The company’s first product was the GPS 100, a panel-mounted GPS receiver aimed at the marine market, priced at $2,500. It debuted at the 1990 International Marine Technology Exposition in Chicago. The product was an instant hit and generated a backlog of orders for 5,000 units. In response to the demand thus created, Kao traveled (January 1991) to Taipei to set up manufacturing facilities.
Handheld GPS[edit]




A Garmin eTrex H, an early, basic GPS model


Another early product, a handheld GPS receiver, proved popular with military personnel serving in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia during the 1991 Gulf War. In the early 2000s (decade), Garmin launched a series of personal GPS devices aimed at recreational runners called the Forerunner. A similar wrist-worn GPS device with two dimensional GPS tracking and waypoint projection called the Garmin Foretrex is popular among day hikers, off-road mountain bikers, and sailboat racers.
eTrex[edit]




A Garmin eTrex 30 simultaneously connects to both GPS and GLONASS satellites.


The compact eTrex series, as introduced in 2000. The series includes several models with different features and options. The original eTrex, commonly nicknamed "eTrex Yellow" offered a lightweight (5.3 oz/150 g), waterproof, palm-sized 12-channel GPS receiver to backpackers, hikers, and others afoot in remote areas, along with a battery life of up to 22 hours on two AA-size batteries.[27] It was replaced in 2007 by the eTrex H, which added a high-sensitivity receiver.[28] Other more advanced eTrex models include the Summit, Venture, Legend, and Vista, each with various additional features such as WAAS, altimeter, digital compass, city database, and highway maps. Many of these models come in color and expandable-memory versions.[29]
In May 2011, Garmin refreshed the eTrex product line with improved mechanical design and support for advances in cartography and hardware technology with its release of the eTrex 10, eTrex 20, and eTrex 30, Garmin became the first company to manufacture and distribute a worldwide consumer navigation product supporting both GPS and GLONASS satellite constellations.[30][31] In May 13, 2015 Garmin released the eTrex 20x and 30x, which succeeded the eTrex 20 and 30. The main upgrade was a higher resolution screen and 4GB storage, double of the previous models.[32]
July 2, 2015 Garmin introduced its eTrex Touch line, releasing three models (25, 35 and 35t), all featuring an 2.6" touch screen.[33]

In 1998, the first Garmin StreetPilot was announced at the Consumer Electronics Show. It had a black and white screen and no voice. In 2002, the StreetPilot III added a color display and voice navigation. In October 2005, Garmin released the StreetPilot i-Series, compact GPS navigators which came in three models, i2, i3, i5. The i2 has a monochrome display, and maps need to be loaded on a Transflash card. The i3 is similar, except it has a color screen. The i5 has a color screen and the maps are preprogrammed into the device. More advanced versions of the StreetPilot include the c-Series, some of which sport large color touchscreens, FM traffic notifications, support for weather and information updates from MSN Direct, and Bluetooth support.
In 2005, the nüvi 300 series was released. It was the first modern-shaped automotive GPS, with a slim rectangular shape that could fit in a pocket. In October 2006, the firm began shipping the nüvi 660, a pocket-size widescreen successor to the nüvi 300 series. The 660 added bluetooth, FM transmitter, enhanced screen brightness and screen size, all in a small "flat" size. It was the last model to feature OSGB grid reference entry. Garmin's 2012 nüvi lineup includes "essential" models (nuvi 30/40/50 series); "advanced" models (nuvi 2405/2505 series); and "prestige" (nuvi 3400/3500 series). Advanced and prestige models carry additional features . Models that carry an "LM" designation include free updates of the installed maps. The nüvi series (at least) runs under Linux.
Garmin's Zumo line is designed specifically for motorcycles.
Garmin released its 2000's series in 2010, which includes 2200 (3.5 inch display), and 2300 (4.3 inch display).

Personal trainers[edit]
Main article: Garmin Forerunner
The Garmin Edge and certain models of Garmin Forerunner is a suite of GPS-enabled devices for use while running or cycling.
Avionics[edit]
Main articles: Garmin G1000 and Garmin G3000




Garmin avionics (an audio control panel; a GNS 430 combined GPS/VHF navigation receiver/VHF communication transceiver; and a transponder) in a light aircraft






Garmin GWX 68 aviation weather radar unit


Garmin has a dedicated division for aviation products, such as integrated cockpits, panel mount displays, multi-function displays (MFD), transponders, radar and other related avionics. For example, the G1000 is an all-glass avionics suite for OEM aircraft.[38] The G900X is similar to the G1000 but designed for use in experimental aircraft,[39] and the G600 is a retrofit solution for several certificated aircraft.[40]
Garmin entered the aviation market in 1991 with the GPS-100AVD panel-mounted receiver. Its first portable unit, the GPS-95, was introduced in 1993. In 1994, the GPS-155 panel-mounted unit was the first GPS receiver on the market to receive full FAA certification for instrument approaches.[41][42]
In 1998, Garmin introduced the GNS-430, an integrated GPS navigation receiver/communications transceiver.[41]
Garmin-AT subsidiary[edit]
In 2003, Garmin acquired UPS Aviation Technologies, including that firm's II Morrow Apollo line of aircraft MFD/GPS/NAV/COMM units. II Morrow had been founded in Salem, Oregon in 1982 as a manufacturer of LORAN C marine and general aviation products. In 1982 its aircraft navigator 602 LORAN C receiver permitted point to point navigation. Some examples of its LORAN units are Apollo II 616B Aviation LORAN panel mount (1986), II Morrow Apollo 604 Loran Navigator (1987) and Apollo 820 GPS Flybuddy (1991). In 1986, United Parcel Service (UPS) purchased the company to expand the use of electronic technology in the package delivery and tracking business.
II Morrow shifted focus from marine business to development of package process automation technology for UPS such as vehicle management systems, automated high speed package sorting systems, as well as delivery and tracking systems. In 1999, II Morrow was renamed to UPS Aviation Technologies, and re-focused towards modernizing UPS' Boeing 7xx series Heavy Iron Transport Category Aircraft fleet, as well they also re-entered the general aviation marketplace. It certified the first Gamma 3 WAAS GPS engine for FAA Certified Precision GPS approaches.[43] The new certified WAAS engine yielded vertical and horizontal accuracy of one meter RMS in guidance into airports without existing ILS approaches. This GPS technology met the FAA's TSO-C146a primary navigation standards for en route, terminal and approach phases of flight—with WAAS augmentation as the sole means of navigation. This primary GPS "sole source" navigation capability was integrated into the CNX-80. The CNX-80 WAAS GPS/COM/NAV integrated navigator was the first product in the industry approved for primary GPS navigation. It also enabled LPV "glidescope" approaches without requiring ground nav aids. New LNAV (GPS) approaches provide the accuracy and safety of an ILS—without the ground-based localizer and glideslope equipment.[44] Later, the CNX-80 was renamed the GNS-480, under Garmin.[45]
As UPS Aviation Technologies, this subsidiary was also involved with development, engineering, and manufacturing functional products for the FAA's Capstone program, which also included ADS-B transponder (UAT and FIS), datalink services, and the MX-20 Multi Function Display that in addition to NAV, it displayed terrain, real-time weather, Jeppeson plates, other ADS-B aircraft, and a variety of other functions in 2000.
Under the FAA Capstone Phase I program, a fleet of small commercial aircraft were equipped for an evaluation of the safety benefits from the use of advanced technologies during day-to-day operations in Alaska's high-risk operating environment. The aircraft are fitted with IFR capable GPS receivers, a Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) data-link system that enables Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and Flight Information Services (FIS) including real-time weather, and a multifunction display (MFD) depicting terrain, other ADS-B aircraft, and weather graphics and text data. These avionics was installed on 200 aircraft used for commuter, charter and mail flights in southwest Alaska.
In 1999: Flight International magazine presented UPS Aviation Technologies with its Aerospace Industry Award for the development of ADS-B, a surveillance technology intended to reduce aviation delays while improving safety. [46]
Wristwear[edit]




Garmin Fenix3 Multisport GPS Watch


The Garmin Vivofit 3 measures the wearer's steps, measures his sleep, judges his body movement, and counts his heart rate and the number of stairs that he has climbed.[47]
The Garmin Vivomove is a classic watch with an activity tracking capabilities. It has a built-in accelerometer (calculates distance for indoor workouts, without need for a foot pod), step counter, auto goal (learns the wearer's activity level and assigns a daily step goal), move bar, and sleep-monitoring capabilities.[48]
The Garmin produces the Vivo HRSmart, the most remarkable wearable technology with the affordable price compared to the competitor. Vivo HRSmart is significantly improved from the previous model, Vivo fit 3. It comes with the touch screen and includes sensible heart-rate monitoring, media player controller, receivable text and phone finder features.
The Garmin Forerunner 735 XT features multi-sport tracking capabilities, built in heart rate sensor, and a variety of special profiles for jogging, swimming, cycling, skiing, paddle sports, a variety of weight loss activities, and hiking. It comes with built-in GPS to track the location and to calculate the distance. .[49] Garmin announced the latest multisport GPS smartwatch Fenix 5 on January 4, 2017, with some advanced features .[50]
Maps[edit]
Most current Garmin devices can display its current location on a map, which is vector-based and stored in the built-in memory or loaded from additional flash media. The built-in (or 'basemap') displays all country borders and major cities. Garmin offers different maps for purchase, including detailed road maps, topographic maps and nautical maps. Non-commercial maps are also available and can be displayed on most Garmin GPS devices.
The maps used by Garmin products are currently provided by Navteq.[51] Map errors are handled using Navteq Map Reporter.[52] Errors can be reported using Garmin's report a map error page,[53] or by using the Navteq map reporter.[54]
Sport sponsorship[edit]
In 2007 Garmin began sponsorship of English Premier League football club Middlesbrough in a one-year deal that was carried into a second year for the 2008/09 season.[55] In 2008 Garmin began sponsorship of cycling team Garmin-Sharp to promote its Edge line of bicycle computers.[56] In 2015, the team became Cannondale-Garmin.[57] In 2014 Garmin paired up with Premier League side Southampton FC in a global partnership. Garmin's European head office is located in Southampton.[58]

History[edit]
Founding and growth[edit]
In 1983, Gary Burrell recruited Min H. Kao from the defense contractor Magnavox while working for the former King Radio.[6] They founded Garmin in 1989 in Lenexa, Kansas,[2] as "ProNav". ProNav's first product was a GPS unit which sold for US$2,500. The company was later renamed "Garmin", an acronym of the first names of its two founders, Gary Burrell and Min H. Kao.[7] In 1991, the U.S. Army became their first customer.[8]
By 1995, Garmin's sales had reached $105 million, and it had achieved a profit of $23 million. By 1999, sales had reached $233 million and a profit of $64 million. Garmin reported a 2006 total revenue of $1.77 billion, up 73% from $1.03 billion in 2005.[9][10]
On May 13, 1999, AirCell and Garmin International announced an alliance to develop new products that use AirCell's unique cellular air-ground link to bring affordable flight communications, navigation and safety to general aviation aircraft.[11] By 2000 Garmin had sold three million GPS devices, and was producing 50 different models. Its products were sold in 100 countries and carried by 2,500 independent distributors. As of 22 August 2000, the company held 35 patents on GPS technology. By the end of June 2000, the company employed 1,205 people: 541 in the United States, 635 in Taiwan, and 29 in the United Kingdom.[12]
Public offering[edit]
The company began public trading on NASDAQ on 8 December 2000. At that time Burrell owned 19,911,155 shares. Kao owned 20,352,803 shares. Together their holdings accounted for 45 percent of the company's stock. Kao's brother, Ruey-Jeng Kao, an attorney in Taipei, owned another 7,984,109 shares, which when combined with Burrell's and Kao's shares constituted 54.22 percent of the shares outstanding.[13]
Acquisitions[edit]




The world's only Garmin retail location is located on the Magnificent Mile in Chicago, Illinois.


In August 2003, Garmin completed acquisition of UPS Aviation Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of United Parcel Service, Inc., expanding its product line of panel-mounted GPS/NAV/COMM units and integrated cockpit systems for private and commercial aircraft. The acquired company changed its name to Garmin AT, Inc. and continued operations as a wholly owned subsidiary of Garmin International, Inc.[14]
Garmin has acquired Dynastream Innovations,[15] EME Tec Sat SAS (EME),[16] and Digital Cyclone.[17] Dynastream, in Cochrane, Alberta, produces personal monitoring technology (ANT+)—such as foot pods and heart rate monitors for sports and fitness products—and also ultra-low-power and low-cost wireless connectivity devices for a wide range of applications (ANT). EME Tec Sat SAS (EME) is the distributor of Garmin's consumer products in France; following the acquisition, EME changed its name to Garmin France SAS. Digital Cyclone Inc (DCI), located in Chanhassen, Minnesota, provides mobile weather solutions for consumers, pilots, and outdoor enthusiasts. Garmin also bought Nautamatic Marine Systems,[18] an Oregon-based company that makes autopilot systems for boats. In July 2011, Garmin finished its acquisition of the German satellite navigation company Navigon.[19]
In 2006, Garmin introduced a new corporate logo,[20] and opened its first retail store, located on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Illinois.[21]
In 2015, Garmin acquired South Africa's iKubu Ltd. for its Backtracker on-bicycle low power radar system.[22]
Corporate governance[edit]
Burrell retired in 2003 as Garmin's chief executive officer and in 2004 retired as chairman of its board of directors. He is now chairman emeritus. Kao became CEO in 2003, and chairman in 2004.[23]
In 2005, Forbes estimated Kao’s net worth at $1.5 billion. He has donated $17.5 million to the University of Tennessee. The same year Forbes estimated Burrell’s net worth as $940 million.[24]
Operations[edit]




Garmin Tech Center (台灣國際航電科技大樓) is the head office of Garmin (Asia) Corporation and located in the Xizhi District of New Taipei City, Taiwan


Garmin operates in several other countries besides the UK, USA, and Taiwan.[25] It operates as Formar (Belgium), Garmin AMB (Canada), Belanor (Norway), Trepat (Spain), and Garmin-Cluj (Romania).
Products and brands[edit]
See also: List of Garmin products
Software[edit]
In addition to devices with integrated software, Garmin also produces a number of software packages for use on a personal computer. This software was designed to run on only the Microsoft Windows operating system until 2006, when Garmin released all of its software for Mac OS X.[26]
Marine GPS[edit]
The company’s first product was the GPS 100, a panel-mounted GPS receiver aimed at the marine market, priced at $2,500. It debuted at the 1990 International Marine Technology Exposition in Chicago. The product was an instant hit and generated a backlog of orders for 5,000 units. In response to the demand thus created, Kao traveled (January 1991) to Taipei to set up manufacturing facilities.
Handheld GPS[edit]




A Garmin eTrex H, an early, basic GPS model


Another early product, a handheld GPS receiver, proved popular with military personnel serving in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia during the 1991 Gulf War. In the early 2000s (decade), Garmin launched a series of personal GPS devices aimed at recreational runners called the Forerunner. A similar wrist-worn GPS device with two dimensional GPS tracking and waypoint projection called the Garmin Foretrex is popular among day hikers, off-road mountain bikers, and sailboat racers.
eTrex[edit]




A Garmin eTrex 30 simultaneously connects to both GPS and GLONASS satellites.


The compact eTrex series, as introduced in 2000. The series includes several models with different features and options. The original eTrex, commonly nicknamed "eTrex Yellow" offered a lightweight (5.3 oz/150 g), waterproof, palm-sized 12-channel GPS receiver to backpackers, hikers, and others afoot in remote areas, along with a battery life of up to 22 hours on two AA-size batteries.[27] It was replaced in 2007 by the eTrex H, which added a high-sensitivity receiver.[28] Other more advanced eTrex models include the Summit, Venture, Legend, and Vista, each with various additional features such as WAAS, altimeter, digital compass, city database, and highway maps. Many of these models come in color and expandable-memory versions.[29]
In May 2011, Garmin refreshed the eTrex product line with improved mechanical design and support for advances in cartography and hardware technology with its release of the eTrex 10, eTrex 20, and eTrex 30, Garmin became the first company to manufacture and distribute a worldwide consumer navigation product supporting both GPS and GLONASS satellite constellations.[30][31] In May 13, 2015 Garmin released the eTrex 20x and 30x, which succeeded the eTrex 20 and 30. The main upgrade was a higher resolution screen and 4GB storage, double of the previous models.[32]
July 2, 2015 Garmin introduced its eTrex Touch line, releasing three models (25, 35 and 35t), all featuring an 2.6" touch screen.[33]

In 1998, the first Garmin StreetPilot was announced at the Consumer Electronics Show. It had a black and white screen and no voice. In 2002, the StreetPilot III added a color display and voice navigation. In October 2005, Garmin released the StreetPilot i-Series, compact GPS navigators which came in three models, i2, i3, i5. The i2 has a monochrome display, and maps need to be loaded on a Transflash card. The i3 is similar, except it has a color screen. The i5 has a color screen and the maps are preprogrammed into the device. More advanced versions of the StreetPilot include the c-Series, some of which sport large color touchscreens, FM traffic notifications, support for weather and information updates from MSN Direct, and Bluetooth support.
In 2005, the nüvi 300 series was released. It was the first modern-shaped automotive GPS, with a slim rectangular shape that could fit in a pocket. In October 2006, the firm began shipping the nüvi 660, a pocket-size widescreen successor to the nüvi 300 series. The 660 added bluetooth, FM transmitter, enhanced screen brightness and screen size, all in a small "flat" size. It was the last model to feature OSGB grid reference entry. Garmin's 2012 nüvi lineup includes "essential" models (nuvi 30/40/50 series); "advanced" models (nuvi 2405/2505 series); and "prestige" (nuvi 3400/3500 series). Advanced and prestige models carry additional features . Models that carry an "LM" designation include free updates of the installed maps. The nüvi series (at least) runs under Linux.
Garmin's Zumo line is designed specifically for motorcycles.
Garmin released its 2000's series in 2010, which includes 2200 (3.5 inch display), and 2300 (4.3 inch display).

In early 2009, Garmin announced it would be manufacturing a location-specific cellular telephone in cooperation with Asus.[36] Called the Garmin-Asus nüvifone G60, the United States release on AT&T was scheduled for 4 October 2009.[37] Four other models in this line have since been released: two Windows Mobile-powered models for the European and Asian market, and two Android models, one for the Europe/Asia market and another for T-Mobile USA.
Personal trainers[edit]
Main article: Garmin Forerunner
The Garmin Edge and certain models of Garmin Forerunner is a suite of GPS-enabled devices for use while running or cycling.
Avionics[edit]
Main articles: Garmin G1000 and Garmin G3000




Garmin avionics (an audio control panel; a GNS 430 combined GPS/VHF navigation receiver/VHF communication transceiver; and a transponder) in a light aircraft






Garmin GWX 68 aviation weather radar unit


Garmin has a dedicated division for aviation products, such as integrated cockpits, panel mount displays, multi-function displays (MFD), transponders, radar and other related avionics. For example, the G1000 is an all-glass avionics suite for OEM aircraft.[38] The G900X is similar to the G1000 but designed for use in experimental aircraft,[39] and the G600 is a retrofit solution for several certificated aircraft.[40]
Garmin entered the aviation market in 1991 with the GPS-100AVD panel-mounted receiver. Its first portable unit, the GPS-95, was introduced in 1993. In 1994, the GPS-155 panel-mounted unit was the first GPS receiver on the market to receive full FAA certification for instrument approaches.[41][42]
In 1998, Garmin introduced the GNS-430, an integrated GPS navigation receiver/communications transceiver.[41]
Garmin-AT subsidiary[edit]
In 2003, Garmin acquired UPS Aviation Technologies, including that firm's II Morrow Apollo line of aircraft MFD/GPS/NAV/COMM units. II Morrow had been founded in Salem, Oregon in 1982 as a manufacturer of LORAN C marine and general aviation products. In 1982 its aircraft navigator 602 LORAN C receiver permitted point to point navigation. Some examples of its LORAN units are Apollo II 616B Aviation LORAN panel mount (1986), II Morrow Apollo 604 Loran Navigator (1987) and Apollo 820 GPS Flybuddy (1991). In 1986, United Parcel Service (UPS) purchased the company to expand the use of electronic technology in the package delivery and tracking business.
II Morrow shifted focus from marine business to development of package process automation technology for UPS such as vehicle management systems, automated high speed package sorting systems, as well as delivery and tracking systems. In 1999, II Morrow was renamed to UPS Aviation Technologies, and re-focused towards modernizing UPS' Boeing 7xx series Heavy Iron Transport Category Aircraft fleet, as well they also re-entered the general aviation marketplace. It certified the first Gamma 3 WAAS GPS engine for FAA Certified Precision GPS approaches.[43] The new certified WAAS engine yielded vertical and horizontal accuracy of one meter RMS in guidance into airports without existing ILS approaches. This GPS technology met the FAA's TSO-C146a primary navigation standards for en route, terminal and approach phases of flight—with WAAS augmentation as the sole means of navigation. This primary GPS "sole source" navigation capability was integrated into the CNX-80. The CNX-80 WAAS GPS/COM/NAV integrated navigator was the first product in the industry approved for primary GPS navigation. It also enabled LPV "glidescope" approaches without requiring ground nav aids. New LNAV (GPS) approaches provide the accuracy and safety of an ILS—without the ground-based localizer and glideslope equipment.[44] Later, the CNX-80 was renamed the GNS-480, under Garmin.[45]
As UPS Aviation Technologies, this subsidiary was also involved with development, engineering, and manufacturing functional products for the FAA's Capstone program, which also included ADS-B transponder (UAT and FIS), datalink services, and the MX-20 Multi Function Display that in addition to NAV, it displayed terrain, real-time weather, Jeppeson plates, other ADS-B aircraft, and a variety of other functions in 2000.
Under the FAA Capstone Phase I program, a fleet of small commercial aircraft were equipped for an evaluation of the safety benefits from the use of advanced technologies during day-to-day operations in Alaska's high-risk operating environment. The aircraft are fitted with IFR capable GPS receivers, a Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) data-link system that enables Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and Flight Information Services (FIS) including real-time weather, and a multifunction display (MFD) depicting terrain, other ADS-B aircraft, and weather graphics and text data. These avionics was installed on 200 aircraft used for commuter, charter and mail flights in southwest Alaska.
In 1999: Flight International magazine presented UPS Aviation Technologies with its Aerospace Industry Award for the development of ADS-B, a surveillance technology intended to reduce aviation delays while improving safety. [46]
Wristwear[edit]




Garmin Fenix3 Multisport GPS Watch


The Garmin Vivofit 3 measures the wearer's steps, measures his sleep, judges his body movement, and counts his heart rate and the number of stairs that he has climbed.[47]
The Garmin Vivomove is a classic watch with an activity tracking capabilities. It has a built-in accelerometer (calculates distance for indoor workouts, without need for a foot pod), step counter, auto goal (learns the wearer's activity level and assigns a daily step goal), move bar, and sleep-monitoring capabilities.[48]
The Garmin produces the Vivo HRSmart, the most remarkable wearable technology with the affordable price compared to the competitor. Vivo HRSmart is significantly improved from the previous model, Vivo fit 3. It comes with the touch screen and includes sensible heart-rate monitoring, media player controller, receivable text and phone finder features.

History[edit]
Founding and growth[edit]
In 1983, Gary Burrell recruited Min H. Kao from the defense contractor Magnavox while working for the former King Radio.[6] They founded Garmin in 1989 in Lenexa, Kansas,[2] as "ProNav". ProNav's first product was a GPS unit which sold for US$2,500. The company was later renamed "Garmin", an acronym of the first names of its two founders, Gary Burrell and Min H. Kao.[7] In 1991, the U.S. Army became their first customer.[8]
By 1995, Garmin's sales had reached $105 million, and it had achieved a profit of $23 million. By 1999, sales had reached $233 million and a profit of $64 million. Garmin reported a 2006 total revenue of $1.77 billion, up 73% from $1.03 billion in 2005.[9][10]
On May 13, 1999, AirCell and Garmin International announced an alliance to develop new products that use AirCell's unique cellular air-ground link to bring affordable flight communications, navigation and safety to general aviation aircraft.[11] By 2000 Garmin had sold three million GPS devices, and was producing 50 different models. Its products were sold in 100 countries and carried by 2,500 independent distributors. As of 22 August 2000, the company held 35 patents on GPS technology. By the end of June 2000, the company employed 1,205 people: 541 in the United States, 635 in Taiwan, and 29 in the United Kingdom.[12]
Public offering[edit]
The company began public trading on NASDAQ on 8 December 2000. At that time Burrell owned 19,911,155 shares. Kao owned 20,352,803 shares. Together their holdings accounted for 45 percent of the company's stock. Kao's brother, Ruey-Jeng Kao, an attorney in Taipei, owned another 7,984,109 shares, which when combined with Burrell's and Kao's shares constituted 54.22 percent of the shares outstanding.[13]
Acquisitions[edit]




The world's only Garmin retail location is located on the Magnificent Mile in Chicago, Illinois.


In August 2003, Garmin completed acquisition of UPS Aviation Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of United Parcel Service, Inc., expanding its product line of panel-mounted GPS/NAV/COMM units and integrated cockpit systems for private and commercial aircraft. The acquired company changed its name to Garmin AT, Inc. and continued operations as a wholly owned subsidiary of Garmin International, Inc.[14]
Garmin has acquired Dynastream Innovations,[15] EME Tec Sat SAS (EME),[16] and Digital Cyclone.[17] Dynastream, in Cochrane, Alberta, produces personal monitoring technology (ANT+)—such as foot pods and heart rate monitors for sports and fitness products—and also ultra-low-power and low-cost wireless connectivity devices for a wide range of applications (ANT). EME Tec Sat SAS (EME) is the distributor of Garmin's consumer products in France; following the acquisition, EME changed its name to Garmin France SAS. Digital Cyclone Inc (DCI), located in Chanhassen, Minnesota, provides mobile weather solutions for consumers, pilots, and outdoor enthusiasts. Garmin also bought Nautamatic Marine Systems,[18] an Oregon-based company that makes autopilot systems for boats. In July 2011, Garmin finished its acquisition of the German satellite navigation company Navigon.[19]
In 2006, Garmin introduced a new corporate logo,[20] and opened its first retail store, located on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Illinois.[21]
In 2015, Garmin acquired South Africa's iKubu Ltd. for its Backtracker on-bicycle low power radar system.[22]
Corporate governance[edit]
Burrell retired in 2003 as Garmin's chief executive officer and in 2004 retired as chairman of its board of directors. He is now chairman emeritus. Kao became CEO in 2003, and chairman in 2004.[23]
In 2005, Forbes estimated Kao’s net worth at $1.5 billion. He has donated $17.5 million to the University of Tennessee. The same year Forbes estimated Burrell’s net worth as $940 million.[24]
Operations[edit]




Garmin Tech Center (台灣國際航電科技大樓) is the head office of Garmin (Asia) Corporation and located in the Xizhi District of New Taipei City, Taiwan


Garmin operates in several other countries besides the UK, USA, and Taiwan.[25] It operates as Formar (Belgium), Garmin AMB (Canada), Belanor (Norway), Trepat (Spain), and Garmin-Cluj (Romania).
Products and brands[edit]
See also: List of Garmin products
Software[edit]
In addition to devices with integrated software, Garmin also produces a number of software packages for use on a personal computer. This software was designed to run on only the Microsoft Windows operating system until 2006, when Garmin released all of its software for Mac OS X.[26]
Marine GPS[edit]
The company’s first product was the GPS 100, a panel-mounted GPS receiver aimed at the marine market, priced at $2,500. It debuted at the 1990 International Marine Technology Exposition in Chicago. The product was an instant hit and generated a backlog of orders for 5,000 units. In response to the demand thus created, Kao traveled (January 1991) to Taipei to set up manufacturing facilities.
Handheld GPS[edit]




A Garmin eTrex H, an early, basic GPS model


Another early product, a handheld GPS receiver, proved popular with military personnel serving in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia during the 1991 Gulf War. In the early 2000s (decade), Garmin launched a series of personal GPS devices aimed at recreational runners called the Forerunner. A similar wrist-worn GPS device with two dimensional GPS tracking and waypoint projection called the Garmin Foretrex is popular among day hikers, off-road mountain bikers, and sailboat racers.
eTrex[edit]




A Garmin eTrex 30 simultaneously connects to both GPS and GLONASS satellites.


The compact eTrex series, as introduced in 2000. The series includes several models with different features and options. The original eTrex, commonly nicknamed "eTrex Yellow" offered a lightweight (5.3 oz/150 g), waterproof, palm-sized 12-channel GPS receiver to backpackers, hikers, and others afoot in remote areas, along with a battery life of up to 22 hours on two AA-size batteries.[27] It was replaced in 2007 by the eTrex H, which added a high-sensitivity receiver.[28] Other more advanced eTrex models include the Summit, Venture, Legend, and Vista, each with various additional features such as WAAS, altimeter, digital compass, city database, and highway maps. Many of these models come in color and expandable-memory versions.[29]
In May 2011, Garmin refreshed the eTrex product line with improved mechanical design and support for advances in cartography and hardware technology with its release of the eTrex 10, eTrex 20, and eTrex 30, Garmin became the first company to manufacture and distribute a worldwide consumer navigation product supporting both GPS and GLONASS satellite constellations.[30][31] In May 13, 2015 Garmin released the eTrex 20x and 30x, which succeeded the eTrex 20 and 30. The main upgrade was a higher resolution screen and 4GB storage, double of the previous models.[32]
July 2, 2015 Garmin introduced its eTrex Touch line, releasing three models (25, 35 and 35t), all featuring an 2.6" touch screen.[33]

The Geko series was a compact line of handheld GPS receivers aimed at the budget or lightweight hiking market.
In 2004, Garmin introduced its 60C line of handheld GPS mapping receivers, featuring increased sensitivity and storage capacity along with a battery life of up to 30 hours in battery-save mode. This was followed by the 60Cx and 60CSx with improved color map displays.
With the GTM-11, GTM 20 and GTM 25, a Garmin GPS device receives and uses traffic message channel (TMC) information.[34] Also, some Garmin nüvi (1690, 1490T, 1450T, 1390T, 1390, 1350, 1260, 1250 and 265WT, 265T, 265W, 265, 255w and 255) comes with an integrated TMC receiver.
iQue PDA receivers[edit]
Main article: Garmin iQue
In 2003, Garmin launched the iQue line of integrated PDA-GPS receivers. On 31 October 2005, the iQue M4 became the first PDA that did not require a PC to preload the maps. The American version came with built-in maps of North America, while the UK version was supplied pre-loaded with maps of Western Europe.

In 1998, the first Garmin StreetPilot was announced at the Consumer Electronics Show. It had a black and white screen and no voice. In 2002, the StreetPilot III added a color display and voice navigation. In October 2005, Garmin released the StreetPilot i-Series, compact GPS navigators which came in three models, i2, i3, i5. The i2 has a monochrome display, and maps need to be loaded on a Transflash card. The i3 is similar, except it has a color screen. The i5 has a color screen and the maps are preprogrammed into the device. More advanced versions of the StreetPilot include the c-Series, some of which sport large color touchscreens, FM traffic notifications, support for weather and information updates from MSN Direct, and Bluetooth support.
In 2005, the nüvi 300 series was released. It was the first modern-shaped automotive GPS, with a slim rectangular shape that could fit in a pocket. In October 2006, the firm began shipping the nüvi 660, a pocket-size widescreen successor to the nüvi 300 series. The 660 added bluetooth, FM transmitter, enhanced screen brightness and screen size, all in a small "flat" size. It was the last model to feature OSGB grid reference entry. Garmin's 2012 nüvi lineup includes "essential" models (nuvi 30/40/50 series); "advanced" models (nuvi 2405/2505 series); and "prestige" (nuvi 3400/3500 series). Advanced and prestige models carry additional features . Models that carry an "LM" designation include free updates of the installed maps. The nüvi series (at least) runs under Linux.
Garmin's Zumo line is designed specifically for motorcycles.
Garmin released its 2000's series in 2010, which includes 2200 (3.5 inch display), and 2300 (4.3 inch display).
Fishfinders[edit]
Garmin also manufactures a line of sonar fishfinders, including some units that also have GPS capability.
Laptop GPS and mobile apps[edit]
In April 2008, Garmin launched Garmin Mobile PC, a GPS navigation software program for laptop PCs and other computers, based on the Microsoft Windows operating system, now discontinued.[35]
Garmin offers mobile apps for Android, Windows Phone, and for iPhone. On July 25, 2011, Garmin International, Inc. released Garmin StreetPilot Onboard N. America Version 1.0 for the iOS operating system 4.0 or later. It is compatible with iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, iPod touch (3rd and 4th generation) and GPS-enabled iPads. The iPhone app is 1.61 GB and has In-app purchases available including Traffic, and Fuel Prices. Map coverage includes North America (United States, Canada, Mexico, plus Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, the Bahamas, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint Barthelemy, and Jamaica).

Avionics[edit]
Main articles: Garmin G1000 and Garmin G3000




Garmin avionics (an audio control panel; a GNS 430 combined GPS/VHF navigation receiver/VHF communication transceiver; and a transponder) in a light aircraft






Garmin GWX 68 aviation weather radar unit


Garmin has a dedicated division for aviation products, such as integrated cockpits, panel mount displays, multi-function displays (MFD), transponders, radar and other related avionics. For example, the G1000 is an all-glass avionics suite for OEM aircraft.[38] The G900X is similar to the G1000 but designed for use in experimental aircraft,[39] and the G600 is a retrofit solution for several certificated aircraft.[40]
Garmin entered the aviation market in 1991 with the GPS-100AVD panel-mounted receiver. Its first portable unit, the GPS-95, was introduced in 1993. In 1994, the GPS-155 panel-mounted unit was the first GPS receiver on the market to receive full FAA certification for instrument approaches.[41][42]
In 1998, Garmin introduced the GNS-430, an integrated GPS navigation receiver/communications transceiver.[41]
Garmin-AT subsidiary[edit]
In 2003, Garmin acquired UPS Aviation Technologies, including that firm's II Morrow Apollo line of aircraft MFD/GPS/NAV/COMM units. II Morrow had been founded in Salem, Oregon in 1982 as a manufacturer of LORAN C marine and general aviation products. In 1982 its aircraft navigator 602 LORAN C receiver permitted point to point navigation. Some examples of its LORAN units are Apollo II 616B Aviation LORAN panel mount (1986), II Morrow Apollo 604 Loran Navigator (1987) and Apollo 820 GPS Flybuddy (1991). In 1986, United Parcel Service (UPS) purchased the company to expand the use of electronic technology in the package delivery and tracking business.
II Morrow shifted focus from marine business to development of package process automation technology for UPS such as vehicle management systems, automated high speed package sorting systems, as well as delivery and tracking systems. In 1999, II Morrow was renamed to UPS Aviation Technologies, and re-focused towards modernizing UPS' Boeing 7xx series Heavy Iron Transport Category Aircraft fleet, as well they also re-entered the general aviation marketplace. It certified the first Gamma 3 WAAS GPS engine for FAA Certified Precision GPS approaches.[43] The new certified WAAS engine yielded vertical and horizontal accuracy of one meter RMS in guidance into airports without existing ILS approaches. This GPS technology met the FAA's TSO-C146a primary navigation standards for en route, terminal and approach phases of flight—with WAAS augmentation as the sole means of navigation. This primary GPS "sole source" navigation capability was integrated into the CNX-80. The CNX-80 WAAS GPS/COM/NAV integrated navigator was the first product in the industry approved for primary GPS navigation. It also enabled LPV "glidescope" approaches without requiring ground nav aids. New LNAV (GPS) approaches provide the accuracy and safety of an ILS—without the ground-based localizer and glideslope equipment.[44] Later, the CNX-80 was renamed the GNS-480, under Garmin.[45]
As UPS Aviation Technologies, this subsidiary was also involved with development, engineering, and manufacturing functional products for the FAA's Capstone program, which also included ADS-B transponder (UAT and FIS), datalink services, and the MX-20 Multi Function Display that in addition to NAV, it displayed terrain, real-time weather, Jeppeson plates, other ADS-B aircraft, and a variety of other functions in 2000.
Under the FAA Capstone Phase I program, a fleet of small commercial aircraft were equipped for an evaluation of the safety benefits from the use of advanced technologies during day-to-day operations in Alaska's high-risk operating environment. The aircraft are fitted with IFR capable GPS receivers, a Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) data-link system that enables Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and Flight Information Services (FIS) including real-time weather, and a multifunction display (MFD) depicting terrain, other ADS-B aircraft, and weather graphics and text data. These avionics was installed on 200 aircraft used for commuter, charter and mail flights in southwest Alaska.
In 1999: Flight International magazine presented UPS Aviation Technologies with its Aerospace Industry Award for the development of ADS-B, a surveillance technology intended to reduce aviation delays while improving safety. [46]
Wristwear[edit]




Garmin Fenix3 Multisport GPS Watch


The Garmin Vivofit 3 measures the wearer's steps, measures his sleep, judges his body movement, and counts his heart rate and the number of stairs that he has climbed.[47]
The Garmin Vivomove is a classic watch with an activity tracking capabilities. It has a built-in accelerometer (calculates distance for indoor workouts, without need for a foot pod), step counter, auto goal (learns the wearer's activity level and assigns a daily step goal), move bar, and sleep-monitoring capabilities.[48]
The Garmin produces the Vivo HRSmart, the most remarkable wearable technology with the affordable price compared to the competitor. Vivo HRSmart is significantly improved from the previous model, Vivo fit 3. It comes with the touch screen and includes sensible heart-rate monitoring, media player controller, receivable text and phone finder features.
The Garmin Forerunner 735 XT features multi-sport tracking capabilities, built in heart rate sensor, and a variety of special profiles for jogging, swimming, cycling, skiing, paddle sports, a variety of weight loss activities, and hiking. It comes with built-in GPS to track the location and to calculate the distance. .[49] Garmin announced the latest multisport GPS smartwatch Fenix 5 on January 4, 2017, with some advanced features .[50]
Maps[edit]
Most current Garmin devices can display its current location on a map, which is vector-based and stored in the built-in memory or loaded from additional flash media. The built-in (or 'basemap') displays all country borders and major cities. Garmin offers different maps for purchase, including detailed road maps, topographic maps and nautical maps. Non-commercial maps are also available and can be displayed on most Garmin GPS devices.
The maps used by Garmin products are currently provided by Navteq.[51] Map errors are handled using Navteq Map Reporter.[52] Errors can be reported using Garmin's report a map error page,[53] or by using the Navteq map reporter.[54]
Sport sponsorship[edit]
In 2007 Garmin began sponsorship of English Premier League football club Middlesbrough in a one-year deal that was carried into a second year for the 2008/09 season.[55] In 2008 Garmin began sponsorship of cycling team Garmin-Sharp to promote its Edge line of bicycle computers.[56] In 2015, the team became Cannondale-Garmin.[57] In 2014 Garmin paired up with Premier League side Southampton FC in a global partnership. Garmin's European head office is located in Southampton.[58]

History[edit]
Founding and growth[edit]
In 1983, Gary Burrell recruited Min H. Kao from the defense contractor Magnavox while working for the former King Radio.[6] They founded Garmin in 1989 in Lenexa, Kansas,[2] as "ProNav". ProNav's first product was a GPS unit which sold for US$2,500. The company was later renamed "Garmin", an acronym of the first names of its two founders, Gary Burrell and Min H. Kao.[7] In 1991, the U.S. Army became their first customer.[8]
By 1995, Garmin's sales had reached $105 million, and it had achieved a profit of $23 million. By 1999, sales had reached $233 million and a profit of $64 million. Garmin reported a 2006 total revenue of $1.77 billion, up 73% from $1.03 billion in 2005.[9][10]
On May 13, 1999, AirCell and Garmin International announced an alliance to develop new products that use AirCell's unique cellular air-ground link to bring affordable flight communications, navigation and safety to general aviation aircraft.[11] By 2000 Garmin had sold three million GPS devices, and was producing 50 different models. Its products were sold in 100 countries and carried by 2,500 independent distributors. As of 22 August 2000, the company held 35 patents on GPS technology. By the end of June 2000, the company employed 1,205 people: 541 in the United States, 635 in Taiwan, and 29 in the United Kingdom.[12]
Public offering[edit]
The company began public trading on NASDAQ on 8 December 2000. At that time Burrell owned 19,911,155 shares. Kao owned 20,352,803 shares. Together their holdings accounted for 45 percent of the company's stock. Kao's brother, Ruey-Jeng Kao, an attorney in Taipei, owned another 7,984,109 shares, which when combined with Burrell's and Kao's shares constituted 54.22 percent of the shares outstanding.[13]
Acquisitions[edit]




The world's only Garmin retail location is located on the Magnificent Mile in Chicago, Illinois.


In August 2003, Garmin completed acquisition of UPS Aviation Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of United Parcel Service, Inc., expanding its product line of panel-mounted GPS/NAV/COMM units and integrated cockpit systems for private and commercial aircraft. The acquired company changed its name to Garmin AT, Inc. and continued operations as a wholly owned subsidiary of Garmin International, Inc.[14]
Garmin has acquired Dynastream Innovations,[15] EME Tec Sat SAS (EME),[16] and Digital Cyclone.[17] Dynastream, in Cochrane, Alberta, produces personal monitoring technology (ANT+)—such as foot pods and heart rate monitors for sports and fitness products—and also ultra-low-power and low-cost wireless connectivity devices for a wide range of applications (ANT). EME Tec Sat SAS (EME) is the distributor of Garmin's consumer products in France; following the acquisition, EME changed its name to Garmin France SAS. Digital Cyclone Inc (DCI), located in Chanhassen, Minnesota, provides mobile weather solutions for consumers, pilots, and outdoor enthusiasts. Garmin also bought Nautamatic Marine Systems,[18] an Oregon-based company that makes autopilot systems for boats. In July 2011, Garmin finished its acquisition of the German satellite navigation company Navigon.[19]
In 2006, Garmin introduced a new corporate logo,[20] and opened its first retail store, located on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Illinois.[21]
In 2015, Garmin acquired South Africa's iKubu Ltd. for its Backtracker on-bicycle low power radar system.[22]
Corporate governance[edit]
Burrell retired in 2003 as Garmin's chief executive officer and in 2004 retired as chairman of its board of directors. He is now chairman emeritus. Kao became CEO in 2003, and chairman in 2004.[23]
In 2005, Forbes estimated Kao’s net worth at $1.5 billion. He has donated $17.5 million to the University of Tennessee. The same year Forbes estimated Burrell’s net worth as $940 million.[24]
Operations[edit]




Garmin Tech Center (台灣國際航電科技大樓) is the head office of Garmin (Asia) Corporation and located in the Xizhi District of New Taipei City, Taiwan


Garmin operates in several other countries besides the UK, USA, and Taiwan.[25] It operates as Formar (Belgium), Garmin AMB (Canada), Belanor (Norway), Trepat (Spain), and Garmin-Cluj (Romania).
Products and brands[edit]
See also: List of Garmin products
Software[edit]
In addition to devices with integrated software, Garmin also produces a number of software packages for use on a personal computer. This software was designed to run on only the Microsoft Windows operating system until 2006, when Garmin released all of its software for Mac OS X.[26]
Marine GPS[edit]
The company’s first product was the GPS 100, a panel-mounted GPS receiver aimed at the marine market, priced at $2,500. It debuted at the 1990 International Marine Technology Exposition in Chicago. The product was an instant hit and generated a backlog of orders for 5,000 units. In response to the demand thus created, Kao traveled (January 1991) to Taipei to set up manufacturing facilities.
Handheld GPS[edit]




A Garmin eTrex H, an early, basic GPS model


Another early product, a handheld GPS receiver, proved popular with military personnel serving in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia during the 1991 Gulf War. In the early 2000s (decade), Garmin launched a series of personal GPS devices aimed at recreational runners called the Forerunner. A similar wrist-worn GPS device with two dimensional GPS tracking and waypoint projection called the Garmin Foretrex is popular among day hikers, off-road mountain bikers, and sailboat racers.
eTrex[edit]




A Garmin eTrex 30 simultaneously connects to both GPS and GLONASS satellites.


The compact eTrex series, as introduced in 2000. The series includes several models with different features and options. The original eTrex, commonly nicknamed "eTrex Yellow" offered a lightweight (5.3 oz/150 g), waterproof, palm-sized 12-channel GPS receiver to backpackers, hikers, and others afoot in remote areas, along with a battery life of up to 22 hours on two AA-size batteries.[27] It was replaced in 2007 by the eTrex H, which added a high-sensitivity receiver.[28] Other more advanced eTrex models include the Summit, Venture, Legend, and Vista, each with various additional features such as WAAS, altimeter, digital compass, city database, and highway maps. Many of these models come in color and expandable-memory versions.[29]
In May 2011, Garmin refreshed the eTrex product line with improved mechanical design and support for advances in cartography and hardware technology with its release of the eTrex 10, eTrex 20, and eTrex 30, Garmin became the first company to manufacture and distribute a worldwide consumer navigation product supporting both GPS and GLONASS satellite constellations.[30][31] In May 13, 2015 Garmin released the eTrex 20x and 30x, which succeeded the eTrex 20 and 30. The main upgrade was a higher resolution screen and 4GB storage, double of the previous models.[32]
July 2, 2015 Garmin introduced its eTrex Touch line, releasing three models (25, 35 and 35t), all featuring an 2.6" touch screen.[33]

In 1998, the first Garmin StreetPilot was announced at the Consumer Electronics Show. It had a black and white screen and no voice. In 2002, the StreetPilot III added a color display and voice navigation. In October 2005, Garmin released the StreetPilot i-Series, compact GPS navigators which came in three models, i2, i3, i5. The i2 has a monochrome display, and maps need to be loaded on a Transflash card. The i3 is similar, except it has a color screen. The i5 has a color screen and the maps are preprogrammed into the device. More advanced versions of the StreetPilot include the c-Series, some of which sport large color touchscreens, FM traffic notifications, support for weather and information updates from MSN Direct, and Bluetooth support.
In 2005, the nüvi 300 series was released. It was the first modern-shaped automotive GPS, with a slim rectangular shape that could fit in a pocket. In October 2006, the firm began shipping the nüvi 660, a pocket-size widescreen successor to the nüvi 300 series. The 660 added bluetooth, FM transmitter, enhanced screen brightness and screen size, all in a small "flat" size. It was the last model to feature OSGB grid reference entry. Garmin's 2012 nüvi lineup includes "essential" models (nuvi 30/40/50 series); "advanced" models (nuvi 2405/2505 series); and "prestige" (nuvi 3400/3500 series). Advanced and prestige models carry additional features . Models that carry an "LM" designation include free updates of the installed maps. The nüvi series (at least) runs under Linux.
Garmin's Zumo line is designed specifically for motorcycles.
Garmin released its 2000's series in 2010, which includes 2200 (3.5 inch display), and 2300 (4.3 inch display).
Fishfinders[edit]
Garmin also manufactures a line of sonar fishfinders, including some units that also have GPS capability.
Laptop GPS and mobile apps[edit]
In April 2008, Garmin launched Garmin Mobile PC, a GPS navigation software program for laptop PCs and other computers, based on the Microsoft Windows operating system, now discontinued.[35]
Garmin offers mobile apps for Android, Windows Phone, and for iPhone. On July 25, 2011, Garmin International, Inc. released Garmin StreetPilot Onboard N. America Version 1.0 for the iOS operating system 4.0 or later. It is compatible with iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, iPod touch (3rd and 4th generation) and GPS-enabled iPads.

Main article: Garmin Nüvifone
In early 2009, Garmin announced it would be manufacturing a location-specific cellular telephone in cooperation with Asus.[36] Called the Garmin-Asus nüvifone G60, the United States release on AT&T was scheduled for 4 October 2009.[37] Four other models in this line have since been released: two Windows Mobile-powered models for the European and Asian market, and two Android models, one for the Europe/Asia market and another for T-Mobile USA.
Personal trainers[edit]
Main article: Garmin Forerunner
The Garmin Edge and certain models of Garmin Forerunner is a suite of GPS-enabled devices for use while running or cycling.
Avionics[edit]
Main articles: Garmin G1000 and Garmin G3000




Garmin avionics (an audio control panel; a GNS 430 combined GPS/VHF navigation receiver/VHF communication transceiver; and a transponder) in a light aircraft






Garmin GWX 68 aviation weather radar unit


Garmin has a dedicated division for aviation products, such as integrated cockpits, panel mount displays, multi-function displays (MFD), transponders, radar and other related avionics. For example, the G1000 is an all-glass avionics suite for OEM aircraft.[38] The G900X is similar to the G1000 but designed for use in experimental aircraft,[39] and the G600 is a retrofit solution for several certificated aircraft.[40]
Garmin entered the aviation market in 1991 with the GPS-100AVD panel-mounted receiver. Its first portable unit, the GPS-95, was introduced in 1993. In 1994, the GPS-155 panel-mounted unit was the first GPS receiver on the market to receive full FAA certification for instrument approaches.[41][42]
In 1998, Garmin introduced the GNS-430, an integrated GPS navigation receiver/communications transceiver.[41]
Garmin-AT subsidiary[edit]
In 2003, Garmin acquired UPS Aviation Technologies, including that firm's II Morrow Apollo line of aircraft MFD/GPS/NAV/COMM units. II Morrow had been founded in Salem, Oregon in 1982 as a manufacturer of LORAN C marine and general aviation products. In 1982 its aircraft navigator 602 LORAN C receiver permitted point to point navigation. Some examples of its LORAN units are Apollo II 616B Aviation LORAN panel mount (1986), II Morrow Apollo 604 Loran Navigator (1987) and Apollo 820 GPS Flybuddy (1991). In 1986, United Parcel Service (UPS) purchased the company to expand the use of electronic technology in the package delivery and tracking business.
II Morrow shifted focus from marine business to development of package process automation technology for UPS such as vehicle management systems, automated high speed package sorting systems, as well as delivery and tracking systems. In 1999, II Morrow was renamed to UPS Aviation Technologies, and re-focused towards modernizing UPS' Boeing 7xx series Heavy Iron Transport Category Aircraft fleet, as well they also re-entered the general aviation marketplace. It certified the first Gamma 3 WAAS GPS engine for FAA Certified Precision GPS approaches.[43] The new certified WAAS engine yielded vertical and horizontal accuracy of one meter RMS in guidance into airports without existing ILS approaches. This GPS technology met the FAA's TSO-C146a primary navigation standards for en route, terminal and approach phases of flight—with WAAS augmentation as the sole means of navigation. This primary GPS "sole source" navigation capability was integrated into the CNX-80. The CNX-80 WAAS GPS/COM/NAV integrated navigator was the first product in the industry approved for primary GPS navigation. It also enabled LPV "glidescope" approaches without requiring ground nav aids. New LNAV (GPS) approaches provide the accuracy and safety of an ILS—without the ground-based localizer and glideslope equipment.[44] Later, the CNX-80 was renamed the GNS-480, under Garmin.[45]
As UPS Aviation Technologies, this subsidiary was also involved with development, engineering, and manufacturing functional products for the FAA's Capstone program, which also included ADS-B transponder (UAT and FIS), datalink services, and the MX-20 Multi Function Display that in addition to NAV, it displayed terrain, real-time weather, Jeppeson plates, other ADS-B aircraft, and a variety of other functions in 2000.
Under the FAA Capstone Phase I program, a fleet of small commercial aircraft were equipped for an evaluation of the safety benefits from the use of advanced technologies during day-to-day operations in Alaska's high-risk operating environment. The aircraft are fitted with IFR capable GPS receivers, a Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) data-link system that enables Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and Flight Information Services (FIS) including real-time weather, and a multifunction display (MFD) depicting terrain, other ADS-B aircraft, and weather graphics and text data. These avionics was installed on 200 aircraft used for commuter, charter and mail flights in southwest Alaska.
In 1999: Flight International magazine presented UPS Aviation Technologies with its Aerospace Industry Award for the development of ADS-B, a surveillance technology intended to reduce aviation delays while improving safety. [46]
Wristwear[edit]




Garmin Fenix3 Multisport GPS Watch


The Garmin Vivofit 3 measures the wearer's steps, measures his sleep, judges his body movement, and counts his heart rate and the number of stairs that he has climbed.[47]
The Garmin Vivomove is a classic watch with an activity tracking capabilities. It has a built-in accelerometer (calculates distance for indoor workouts, without need for a foot pod), step counter, auto goal (learns the wearer's activity level and assigns a daily step goal), move bar, and sleep-monitoring capabilities.[48]
The Garmin produces the Vivo HRSmart, the most remarkable wearable technology with the affordable price compared to the competitor. Vivo HRSmart is significantly improved from the previous model, Vivo fit 3. It comes with the touch screen and includes sensible heart-rate monitoring, media player controller, receivable text and phone finder features.
The Garmin Forerunner 735 XT features multi-sport tracking capabilities, built in heart rate sensor, and a variety of special profiles for jogging, swimming, cycling, skiing, paddle sports, a variety of weight loss activities, and hiking. It comes with built-in GPS to track the location and to calculate the distance. .[49] Garmin announced the latest multisport GPS smartwatch Fenix 5 on January 4, 2017, with some advanced features .[50]
Maps[edit]
Most current Garmin devices can display its current location on a map, which is vector-based and stored in the built-in memory or loaded from additional flash media. The built-in (or 'basemap') displays all country borders and major cities. Garmin offers different maps for purchase, including detailed road maps, topographic maps and nautical maps. Non-commercial maps are also available and can be displayed on most Garmin GPS devices.
The maps used by Garmin products are currently provided by Navteq.[51] Map errors are handled using Navteq Map Reporter.[52] Errors can be reported using Garmin's report a map error page,[53] or by using the Navteq map reporter.[54]
Sport sponsorship[edit]
In 2007 Garmin began sponsorship of English Premier League football club Middlesbrough in a one-year deal that was carried into a second year for the 2008/09 season.[55] In 2008 Garmin began sponsorship of cycling team Garmin-Sharp to promote its Edge line of bicycle computers.[56] In 2015, the team became Cannondale-Garmin.[57] In 2014 Garmin paired up with Premier League side Southampton FC in a global partnership. Garmin's European head office is located in Southampton.[58]

Automotive[edit]
StreetPilot series[edit]
Garmin's first in-car product series in their GPS products. It was superseded by Nüvi.
The first Garmin StreetPilot was introduced at CES 1998. It had a 240x160 black and white screen and a database of nearby services and attractions, with on-screen routing.[2] A revised model with 240x128 color screen, the StreetPilot ColorMap was introduced soon after, adding information on services available at highway exits.[3] The devices used 8MB or 16MB cartridges, onto which mapping data was loaded from the user's computer, at a chosen detail level (8MB covered the Atlanta Metropolitan Area at high detail, or a greater area at highway-level detail).
The successor model was the StreetPilot III in 2002, which had a 3.85" 305x160 color screen and added voice prompts. It was available in 32MB and 128MB (Deluxe model) memory options which was used to store the user loaded maps; it had a base map featuring major highways.[4]
26x0[edit]
The 2610, 2620, 2650 and 2660 models were introduced in August 2003,[5] with 3.7" 305x160 color touch screen and a CompactFlash Type II slot. The 2610 and 2650 models were supplied with maps on a CD plus a 128MB CF card. The 2620 and 2660 models did not come with a CD and the maps were pre-installed on the 2.2GB Microdrive. They also added multi-stop route optimization. The 2650 and 2660 required professional installation. They had a reversing light sensor, speed sensor, and angular direction sensor, to boost the system's accuracy, plus dead reckoning capability. The 26x0 models were replaced in July 2005 [6] by the 27x0 series.
C3x0[edit]
The C300 series was introduced in March 2005,[7] with a 3.5" 320x240 touch-sensitive color screen. The c310 and c320 models used a 128MB SD card and the C330 model had the maps in internal storage. C340 model was the last C300 series product. It was released in August 2005, adding FM traffic and text-to-speech capabilities to the C330.[8]
27x0[edit]
The 27x0 models used an internal-memory storage and offered a 3.7" 454x240 color screen, spoken street names and FM traffic receiver. 2720 was the base and 2730 added XM radio, FM transmitter, and MP3 player functions.[9]
i models[edit]

Maps were loaded from DVD to the 128MB MicroSD card. The i models only had standard routing functionality. A version of the i3 with pre-loaded map on built-in storage was released in October 2005.[10]
7x00[edit]
7200 and 7500 models were released in December 2005 [11] They shared the capabilities of Streetpilot 2730 with a 7" 480x234 screen with ambient light sensor.[citation needed] The 7500 was the successor to the 2650/2660 models, with the same sensors and dead reckoning capabilities.[citation needed]

Automotive[edit]
StreetPilot series[edit]
Garmin's first in-car product series in their GPS products. It was superseded by Nüvi.
The first Garmin StreetPilot was introduced at CES 1998. It had a 240x160 black and white screen and a database of nearby services and attractions, with on-screen routing.[2] A revised model with 240x128 color screen, the StreetPilot ColorMap was introduced soon after, adding information on services available at highway exits.[3] The devices used 8MB or 16MB cartridges, onto which mapping data was loaded from the user's computer, at a chosen detail level (8MB covered the Atlanta Metropolitan Area at high detail, or a greater area at highway-level detail).
The successor model was the StreetPilot III in 2002, which had a 3.85" 305x160 color screen and added voice prompts. It was available in 32MB and 128MB (Deluxe model) memory options which was used to store the user loaded maps; it had a base map featuring major highways.[4]

StreetPilot series[edit]
Garmin's first in-car product series in their GPS products. It was superseded by Nüvi.
The first Garmin StreetPilot was introduced at CES 1998. It had a 240x160 black and white screen and a database of nearby services and attractions, with on-screen routing.[2] A revised model with 240x128 color screen, the StreetPilot ColorMap was introduced soon after, adding information on services available at highway exits.[3] The devices used 8MB or 16MB cartridges, onto which mapping data was loaded from the user's computer, at a chosen detail level (8MB covered the Atlanta Metropolitan Area at high detail, or a greater area at highway-level detail).
The successor model was the StreetPilot III in 2002, which had a 3.85" 305x160 color screen and added voice prompts. It was available in 32MB and 128MB (Deluxe model) memory options which was used to store the user loaded maps; it had a base map featuring major highways.[4]

The 2610 and 2650 models were supplied with maps on a CD plus a 128MB CF card. The 2620 and 2660 models did not come with a CD and the maps were pre-installed on the 2.2GB Microdrive. They also added multi-stop route optimization. The 2650 and 2660 required professional installation. They had a reversing light sensor, speed sensor, and angular direction sensor, to boost the system's accuracy, plus dead reckoning capability. The 26x0 models were replaced in July 2005 [6] by the 27x0 series.
C3x0[edit]
The C300 series was introduced in March 2005,[7] with a 3.5" 320x240 touch-sensitive color screen. The c310 and c320 models used a 128MB SD card and the C330 model had the maps in internal storage.

27x0[edit]

Maps were loaded from DVD to the 128MB MicroSD card. The i models only had standard routing functionality. A version of the i3 with pre-loaded map on built-in storage was released in October 2005.[10]
7x00[edit]

Automotive[edit]
StreetPilot series[edit]
Garmin's first in-car product series in their GPS products. It was superseded by Nüvi.
The first Garmin StreetPilot was introduced at CES 1998. It had a 240x160 black and white screen and a database of nearby services and attractions, with on-screen routing.[2] A revised model with 240x128 color screen, the StreetPilot ColorMap was introduced soon after, adding information on services available at highway exits.[3] The devices used 8MB or 16MB cartridges, onto which mapping data was loaded from the user's computer, at a chosen detail level (8MB covered the Atlanta Metropolitan Area at high detail, or a greater area at highway-level detail).
The successor model was the StreetPilot III in 2002, which had a 3.85" 305x160 color screen and added voice prompts. It was available in 32MB and 128MB (Deluxe model) memory options which was used to store the user loaded maps; it had a base map featuring major highways.[4]

The 2610, 2620, 2650 and 2660 models were introduced in August 2003,[5] with 3.7" 305x160 color touch screen and a CompactFlash Type II slot. The 2610 and 2650 models were supplied with maps on a CD plus a 128MB CF card. The 2620 and 2660 models did not come with a CD and the maps were pre-installed on the 2.2GB Microdrive. They also added multi-stop route optimization. The 2650 and 2660 required professional installation. They had a reversing light sensor, speed sensor, and angular direction sensor, to boost the system's accuracy, plus dead reckoning capability. The 26x0 models were replaced in July 2005 [6] by the 27x0 series.
C3x0[edit]
The C300 series was introduced in March 2005,[7] with a 3.5" 320x240 touch-sensitive color screen. The c310 and c320 models used a 128MB SD card and the C330 model had the maps in internal storage.

27x0[edit]

Automotive[edit]
StreetPilot series[edit]
Garmin's first in-car product series in their GPS products. It was superseded by Nüvi.
The first Garmin StreetPilot was introduced at CES 1998. It had a 240x160 black and white screen and a database of nearby services and attractions, with on-screen routing.[2] A revised model with 240x128 color screen, the StreetPilot ColorMap was introduced soon after, adding information on services available at highway exits.[3] The devices used 8MB or 16MB cartridges, onto which mapping data was loaded from the user's computer, at a chosen detail level (8MB covered the Atlanta Metropolitan Area at high detail, or a greater area at highway-level detail).
The successor model was the StreetPilot III in 2002, which had a 3.85" 305x160 color screen and added voice prompts. It was available in 32MB and 128MB (Deluxe model) memory options which was used to store the user loaded maps; it had a base map featuring major highways.[4]
26x0[edit]
The 2610, 2620, 2650 and 2660 models were introduced in August 2003,[5] with 3.7" 305x160 color touch screen and a CompactFlash Type II slot. The 2610 and 2650 models were supplied with maps on a CD plus a 128MB CF card. The 2620 and 2660 models did not come with a CD and the maps were pre-installed on the 2.2GB Microdrive. They also added multi-stop route optimization. The 2650 and 2660 required professional installation. They had a reversing light sensor, speed sensor, and angular direction sensor, to boost the system's accuracy, plus dead reckoning capability. The 26x0 models were replaced in July 2005 [6] by the 27x0 series.
C3x0[edit]
The C300 series was introduced in March 2005,[7] with a 3.5" 320x240 touch-sensitive color screen. The c310 and c320 models used a 128MB SD card and the C330 model had the maps in internal storage. C340 model was the last C300 series product. It was released in August 2005, adding FM traffic and text-to-speech capabilities to the C330.[8]
27x0[edit]
The 27x0 models used an internal-memory storage and offered a 3.7" 454x240 color screen, spoken street names and FM traffic receiver. 2720 was the base and 2730 added XM radio, FM transmitter, and MP3 player functions.[9]
i models[edit]
Introduced in 2005 as low cost models. i3 released in August 2005 had a 2.1" 176x220 color display and the i2 released in October 2005 had a 2.1" 176x240 monochrome display. Maps were loaded from DVD to the 128MB MicroSD card. The i models only had standard routing functionality. A version of the i3 with pre-loaded map on built-in storage was released in October 2005.[10]
7x00[edit]
7200 and 7500 models were released in December 2005 [11] They shared the capabilities of Streetpilot 2730 with a 7" 480x234 screen with ambient light sensor.[citation needed] The 7500 was the successor to the 2650/2660 models, with the same sensors and dead reckoning capabilities.[citation needed]
C5x0[edit]
The Streetpilot c500 series (includes: c510, c530 and c550) was launched in March 2006, updating the c300 with SirfStarIII GPS chipset, new software and a slimmer footprint.

Garmin | Annual Report



























 

A year in review
Celebrating product innovation and customer experience

Letter from CEO
Dear Shareholder,
2015 was a challenging year for most global companies, and Garmin was no exception. The strong U.S. dollar reduced the U.S. dollar value of the revenue we generate outside the United States. Geopolitical conflicts negatively impacted demand for our products in key markets such as Russia and Eastern Europe. Lower oil prices—something we love as consumers—had a negative impact on our sales to oil-producing markets. Stock market volatility dampened enthusiasm in segments that are linked to asset appreciation. Finally, competition intensified across many of our business segments, which led to significant changes in the market. With all of the challenges we faced, one could wonder if there was any good news to celebrate. The answer is YES, and plenty of it:

Our revenue was down 2% for the year, but performed well despite the strong U.S. dollar. Unit deliveries were up 7% over 2014.
Our aviation, fitness, marine and outdoor segments grew 9% on a combined basis during 2015, and grew 13% on average over the past three years as a direct result of our investments in these segments.
We delivered highly anticipated products and technologies. Wrist-based heart rate has become the must-have feature for fitness watches and activity trackers. Fitness delivered three new product families with wrist-based heart rate in 2015 including models with our own Elevate™ heart rate technology. Outdoor leveraged the momentum of the wearable market with the highly successful fēnix® 3. Marine launched a significant number of game-changing products resulting in increased market share. Aviation delivered several key aircraft certifications during the year, including the new Cessna Latitude and HondaJet. Finally, our auto segment delivered strong profitability in mature market conditions allowing us to invest in new opportunities for the future. Our relationship with Honda Motor Co. expanded, resulting in Garmin navigation being available on most Honda models around the globe. In addition, our relationship with Daimler continues to expand with the introduction of the new 2017 Mercedes E-Class.
Our Beat Yesterday™ campaign was a resounding success that delivered increased interest in our products and our brand.
We expanded our operational footprint with a new factory in China and acquisitions that will bring new products and technologies to our portfolio.

Looking forward to 2016, we understand that we cannot control the macro environment in which we operate. Instead, we choose to focus on our mission, which is creating superior products that play an essential role in our customers’ lives. We have a strong lineup of products across all of our business segments, which enable our customers to pursue the active lifestyles that they love. Our aviation, fitness, marine and outdoor segments are once again forecasted to deliver strong growth, while our auto segment remains a healthy source of profits.
I want to thank our shareholders for your interest in Garmin. We look forward to 2016 and the many exciting opportunities it presents.


        Cliff Pemble
        President and CEO
    

 
Product Innovation
 


Product Innovation
At Garmin, our mission is to create superior products for aviation, fitness, outdoor, marine and auto that are an essential part of our customers’ lives. To stay true to our vision—to be the global leader in every market we serve, with products sought after for their compelling design, superior quality and best value—we focus on innovation and diversification, while never losing sight of the benefits our products bring to our customers.
It’s not about the things we make. It’s about the things we make possible.

Aviation
 


Aviation
In 2015, our avionics segment did it all—general and business aviation, helicopters and experimental aircraft. We continued relationships with aftermarket, airline and military channels and worked hard to capitalize on the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) NextGen transformation of the National Airspace System (NAS) and other regulatory mandates around the world. We reduced complexity, enhanced efficiency, underscored safety, shortened learning curves and vastly simplified cockpit management in all phases of flight. In short, Garmin aviation innovation is modernizing the way we fly.

The number of consecutive years our avionics product support has earned the top spot in Aviation International News and Professional Pilot's annual avionics product support surveys.

Garmin nuviCam LMTHD
08.10.2015


Editors' Rating: good



%displayPrice% %freeShipping%

at %seller%




Bottom Line: Garmin's pricey nüviCam LMTHD offers a huge array of features, including an integrated HD dash cam, but navigation issues could delay you from reaching your destination on time. 






Garmin Edge 1000
11.26.2014


Editors' Rating: good



%displayPrice% %freeShipping%

at %seller%




Bottom Line: Garmin's Edge 1000 offers top-notch navigation and full-fledged activity tracking, though you'll pay a premium for all these features. 






Garmin HUD+ (Head-Up Display)
10.21.2014


Editors' Rating: good



%displayPrice% %freeShipping%

at %seller%




Bottom Line: The HUD+ is an external display and windshield projector for your smartphone's Garmin GPS app. It works well, but is more of a toy for those with fighter-jet fantasies than a must-have. 






Garmin nüvi 55

08.08.2014


Editors' Rating: excellent



%displayPrice% %freeShipping%

at %seller%




Bottom Line: The Garmin nüvi 55 is a good buy if you need a basic GPS and don't have or want to use a smartphone. 






Garmin nüvi 3597LMTHD

04.18.2013


Editors' Rating: excellent



%displayPrice% %freeShipping%

at %seller%




Bottom Line: Garmin has done it again with the nüvi 3597LMTHD, a high-end portable GPS device that continues to set the bar for the genre. The question is whether there's a market for pricey in-car navigation systems these days.

04.18.2013


Editors' Rating: good



%displayPrice% %freeShipping%

at %seller%




Bottom Line: Garmin's midrange nüvi 2597LMT comes with some useful new features, but it's priced a bit high for what you get. 






Garmin nüvi 3590LMT

03.30.2012


Editors' Rating: excellent



%displayPrice% %freeShipping%

at %seller%




Bottom Line: It's getting tougher to make the case for high-end GPS devices, but the fully loaded Garmin 3590LMT easily succeeds. It's a worthy purchase if you have the cash. 






Garmin nuvi 2555LMT
02.28.2012




%displayPrice% %freeShipping%

Bottom Line: Product not yet reviewed by PCMag editors.

InMotion Web Hosting


Editors' Rating: excellent
07.24.2017



%displayPrice% %freeShipping%

at %seller%



Bottom Line: InMotion is a feature-stacked web hosting service that offers many attractive features, but a few issues keep it from being the top dog.










A2 Web Hosting


Editors' Rating: excellent
07.24.2017



%displayPrice% %freeShipping%

at %seller%



Bottom Line: Packed with features, A2 is a web hosting service that's more than worthy of being the foundation for your website.










Yamaha YAS-706 MusicCast Wireless Multiroom Sound Bar


Editors' Rating: excellent
07.24.2017



%displayPrice% %freeShipping%

at %seller%



Bottom Line: The pricey Yamaha YAS-706 soundbar handles both movies and music with a strong mix of power, balance, and connectivity.










Apple MacBook (2017)


Editors' Rating: good
07.24.2017



%displayPrice% %freeShipping%

at %seller%



Bottom Line: The ever-slim Apple MacBook gets a faster processor and remains a battery life champ, but a persistent dearth of connectivity ports makes it unappealing compared with the similarly priced MacBook Pro and Windows competitors.










SurveyMonkey


Editors' Rating: excellent
07.21.2017



%displayPrice% %freeShipping%

at %seller%



Bottom Line: SurveyMonkey has a well-deserved reputation as a leader in online survey marketing with an intuitive user interface and advanced features like artificial intelligence.










Microsoft Azure


Editors' Rating: excellent
07.21.2017



%displayPrice% %freeShipping%

at %seller%



Bottom Line: Organizations standardized on Windows Server are no-brainer candidates for Microsoft Azure once they begin moving infrastructure to the cloud. However, Azure is also friendly to other operating platforms, especially Linux, and has a growing arsenal of ancillary services, too.










Campaign Monitor


Editors' Rating: good
07.21.2017



%displayPrice% %freeShipping%

at %seller%



Bottom Line: Campaign Monitor may lack live support and third-party integrations, but it offers a simple way to connect with your audience through email marketing, including auto-responders and a new suite of analytics.










Zenefits Z2



Editors' Rating: excellent
07.21.2017



%displayPrice% %freeShipping%

at %seller%



Bottom Line: Zenefits Z2 is best suited for small to midsized businesses (SMBs) in need of solid human resources platform. By delivering the basic framework and regularly adding new integration partners, Zenefits Z2 can provide a fairly long lived solution even for fast-growing companies.

Editors' Rating: excellent
07.21.2017



%displayPrice% %freeShipping%

at %seller%



Bottom Line: NordVPN is a robust VPN service with an excellent collection of features, all wrapped in a slick Windows client that can easily secure your online activities. It's everything you could want, and an Editors' Choice winner.










Epson WorkForce Pro WF-4730


Editors' Rating: excellent
07.21.2017



%displayPrice% %freeShipping%

at %seller%



Bottom Line: Epson's WorkForce Pro WF-4730 all-in-one inkjet is fast and capable, and it supports just about every mobile connectivity feature available, but an auto-duplexing ADF would make it more attractive.










Eero (2nd Generation)


Editors' Rating: good
07.21.2017



%displayPrice% %freeShipping%

at %seller%



Bottom Line: The latest Eero mesh-based Wi-Fi system offers more powerful hardware and a few more features than its predecessor, but you'll have to pay extra for malware protection and some parental controls.










Aukey AC-LC2


Editors' Rating: good
07.21.2017



%displayPrice% %freeShipping%

at %seller%



Bottom Line: The Aukey AC-LC2 is a compact action camera with solid 4K video quality, but a frustrating interface and no digital stabilization.










RingCentral Office (for Business)



Editors' Rating: excellent
07.21.2017



%displayPrice% %freeShipping%

at %seller%



Bottom Line: RingCentral Office (for Business) is one of the best all-around office communications solutions we've tested. Combining voice over IP (VoIP) with a unified communications software client and dedicated mobile apps, RingCentral delivers all the features businesses need to communicate effectively.










Arvixe Web Hosting


Editors' Rating: excellent
07.21.2017



%displayPrice% %freeShipping%

at %seller%



Bottom Line: Arvixe is a web host with several well-rounded hosting packages, but the company falls just shy of being considered one of the elite in its space.










Kshioe Sports Cam


Editors' Rating: dismal
07.21.2017



%displayPrice% %freeShipping%

at %seller%



Bottom Line: The Kshioe Sports Cam has a lower price than most action cameras, but its performance is so poor across the board we can't recommend it.










Visioneer Patriot H80


Editors' Rating: excellent
07.21.2017



%displayPrice% %freeShipping%

at %seller%



Bottom Line: A remarkably fast workhorse document scanner, the Visioneer Patriot H80 is quicker and more accurate than most of its competitors, including its slightly lower-rated, less-expensive Patriot H60 sibling—but not enough to justify a hefty price difference.

History[edit]
Founding and growth[edit]
In 1983, Gary Burrell recruited Min H. Kao from the defense contractor Magnavox while working for the former King Radio.[6] They founded Garmin in 1989 in Lenexa, Kansas,[2] as "ProNav". ProNav's first product was a GPS unit which sold for US$2,500. The company was later renamed "Garmin", an acronym of the first names of its two founders, Gary Burrell and Min H. Kao.[7] In 1991, the U.S. Army became their first customer.[8]
By 1995, Garmin's sales had reached $105 million, and it had achieved a profit of $23 million. By 1999, sales had reached $233 million and a profit of $64 million. Garmin reported a 2006 total revenue of $1.77 billion, up 73% from $1.03 billion in 2005.[9][10]
On May 13, 1999, AirCell and Garmin International announced an alliance to develop new products that use AirCell's unique cellular air-ground link to bring affordable flight communications, navigation and safety to general aviation aircraft.[11] By 2000 Garmin had sold three million GPS devices, and was producing 50 different models. Its products were sold in 100 countries and carried by 2,500 independent distributors. As of 22 August 2000, the company held 35 patents on GPS technology. By the end of June 2000, the company employed 1,205 people: 541 in the United States, 635 in Taiwan, and 29 in the United Kingdom.[12]
Public offering[edit]
The company began public trading on NASDAQ on 8 December 2000. At that time Burrell owned 19,911,155 shares. Kao owned 20,352,803 shares. Together their holdings accounted for 45 percent of the company's stock. Kao's brother, Ruey-Jeng Kao, an attorney in Taipei, owned another 7,984,109 shares, which when combined with Burrell's and Kao's shares constituted 54.22 percent of the shares outstanding.[13]
Acquisitions[edit]




The world's only Garmin retail location is located on the Magnificent Mile in Chicago, Illinois.


In August 2003, Garmin completed acquisition of UPS Aviation Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of United Parcel Service, Inc., expanding its product line of panel-mounted GPS/NAV/COMM units and integrated cockpit systems for private and commercial aircraft. The acquired company changed its name to Garmin AT, Inc. and continued operations as a wholly owned subsidiary of Garmin International, Inc.[14]
Garmin has acquired Dynastream Innovations,[15] EME Tec Sat SAS (EME),[16] and Digital Cyclone.[17] Dynastream, in Cochrane, Alberta, produces personal monitoring technology (ANT+)—such as foot pods and heart rate monitors for sports and fitness products—and also ultra-low-power and low-cost wireless connectivity devices for a wide range of applications (ANT). EME Tec Sat SAS (EME) is the distributor of Garmin's consumer products in France; following the acquisition, EME changed its name to Garmin France SAS. Digital Cyclone Inc (DCI), located in Chanhassen, Minnesota, provides mobile weather solutions for consumers, pilots, and outdoor enthusiasts. Garmin also bought Nautamatic Marine Systems,[18] an Oregon-based company that makes autopilot systems for boats. In July 2011, Garmin finished its acquisition of the German satellite navigation company Navigon.[19]
In 2006, Garmin introduced a new corporate logo,[20] and opened its first retail store, located on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Illinois.[21]
In 2015, Garmin acquired South Africa's iKubu Ltd. for its Backtracker on-bicycle low power radar system.[22]
Corporate governance[edit]
Burrell retired in 2003 as Garmin's chief executive officer and in 2004 retired as chairman of its board of directors. He is now chairman emeritus. Kao became CEO in 2003, and chairman in 2004.[23]
In 2005, Forbes estimated Kao’s net worth at $1.5 billion. He has donated $17.5 million to the University of Tennessee. The same year Forbes estimated Burrell’s net worth as $940 million.[24]
Operations[edit]




Garmin Tech Center (台灣國際航電科技大樓) is the head office of Garmin (Asia) Corporation and located in the Xizhi District of New Taipei City, Taiwan


Garmin operates in several other countries besides the UK, USA, and Taiwan.[25] It operates as Formar (Belgium), Garmin AMB (Canada), Belanor (Norway), Trepat (Spain), and Garmin-Cluj (Romania).
Products and brands[edit]
See also: List of Garmin products
Software[edit]
In addition to devices with integrated software, Garmin also produces a number of software packages for use on a personal computer. This software was designed to run on only the Microsoft Windows operating system until 2006, when Garmin released all of its software for Mac OS X.[26]
Marine GPS[edit]
The company’s first product was the GPS 100, a panel-mounted GPS receiver aimed at the marine market, priced at $2,500. It debuted at the 1990 International Marine Technology Exposition in Chicago. The product was an instant hit and generated a backlog of orders for 5,000 units. In response to the demand thus created, Kao traveled (January 1991) to Taipei to set up manufacturing facilities.
Handheld GPS[edit]




A Garmin eTrex H, an early, basic GPS model


Another early product, a handheld GPS receiver, proved popular with military personnel serving in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia during the 1991 Gulf War. In the early 2000s (decade), Garmin launched a series of personal GPS devices aimed at recreational runners called the Forerunner. A similar wrist-worn GPS device with two dimensional GPS tracking and waypoint projection called the Garmin Foretrex is popular among day hikers, off-road mountain bikers, and sailboat racers.
eTrex[edit]




A Garmin eTrex 30 simultaneously connects to both GPS and GLONASS satellites.


The compact eTrex series, as introduced in 2000. The series includes several models with different features and options. The original eTrex, commonly nicknamed "eTrex Yellow" offered a lightweight (5.3 oz/150 g), waterproof, palm-sized 12-channel GPS receiver to backpackers, hikers, and others afoot in remote areas, along with a battery life of up to 22 hours on two AA-size batteries.[27] It was replaced in 2007 by the eTrex H, which added a high-sensitivity receiver.[28] Other more advanced eTrex models include the Summit, Venture, Legend, and Vista, each with various additional features such as WAAS, altimeter, digital compass, city database, and highway maps. Many of these models come in color and expandable-memory versions.[29]
In May 2011, Garmin refreshed the eTrex product line with improved mechanical design and support for advances in cartography and hardware technology with its release of the eTrex 10, eTrex 20, and eTrex 30, Garmin became the first company to manufacture and distribute a worldwide consumer navigation product supporting both GPS and GLONASS satellite constellations.[30][31] In May 13, 2015 Garmin released the eTrex 20x and 30x, which succeeded the eTrex 20 and 30. The main upgrade was a higher resolution screen and 4GB storage, double of the previous models.[32]
July 2, 2015 Garmin introduced its eTrex Touch line, releasing three models (25, 35 and 35t), all featuring an 2.6" touch screen.[33]

In 1998, the first Garmin StreetPilot was announced at the Consumer Electronics Show. It had a black and white screen and no voice. In 2002, the StreetPilot III added a color display and voice navigation. In October 2005, Garmin released the StreetPilot i-Series, compact GPS navigators which came in three models, i2, i3, i5. The i2 has a monochrome display, and maps need to be loaded on a Transflash card. The i3 is similar, except it has a color screen. The i5 has a color screen and the maps are preprogrammed into the device. More advanced versions of the StreetPilot include the c-Series, some of which sport large color touchscreens, FM traffic notifications, support for weather and information updates from MSN Direct, and Bluetooth support.
In 2005, the nüvi 300 series was released. It was the first modern-shaped automotive GPS, with a slim rectangular shape that could fit in a pocket. In October 2006, the firm began shipping the nüvi 660, a pocket-size widescreen successor to the nüvi 300 series. The 660 added bluetooth, FM transmitter, enhanced screen brightness and screen size, all in a small "flat" size. It was the last model to feature OSGB grid reference entry. Garmin's 2012 nüvi lineup includes "essential" models (nuvi 30/40/50 series); "advanced" models (nuvi 2405/2505 series); and "prestige" (nuvi 3400/3500 series). Advanced and prestige models carry additional features . Models that carry an "LM" designation include free updates of the installed maps. The nüvi series (at least) runs under Linux.
Garmin's Zumo line is designed specifically for motorcycles.
Garmin released its 2000's series in 2010, which includes 2200 (3.5 inch display), and 2300 (4.3 inch display).

Avionics[edit]
Main articles: Garmin G1000 and Garmin G3000




Garmin avionics (an audio control panel; a GNS 430 combined GPS/VHF navigation receiver/VHF communication transceiver; and a transponder) in a light aircraft






Garmin GWX 68 aviation weather radar unit


Garmin has a dedicated division for aviation products, such as integrated cockpits, panel mount displays, multi-function displays (MFD), transponders, radar and other related avionics. For example, the G1000 is an all-glass avionics suite for OEM aircraft.[38] The G900X is similar to the G1000 but designed for use in experimental aircraft,[39] and the G600 is a retrofit solution for several certificated aircraft.[40]
Garmin entered the aviation market in 1991 with the GPS-100AVD panel-mounted receiver. Its first portable unit, the GPS-95, was introduced in 1993. In 1994, the GPS-155 panel-mounted unit was the first GPS receiver on the market to receive full FAA certification for instrument approaches.[41][42]
In 1998, Garmin introduced the GNS-430, an integrated GPS navigation receiver/communications transceiver.[41]
Garmin-AT subsidiary[edit]
In 2003, Garmin acquired UPS Aviation Technologies, including that firm's II Morrow Apollo line of aircraft MFD/GPS/NAV/COMM units. II Morrow had been founded in Salem, Oregon in 1982 as a manufacturer of LORAN C marine and general aviation products. In 1982 its aircraft navigator 602 LORAN C receiver permitted point to point navigation. Some examples of its LORAN units are Apollo II 616B Aviation LORAN panel mount (1986), II Morrow Apollo 604 Loran Navigator (1987) and Apollo 820 GPS Flybuddy (1991). In 1986, United Parcel Service (UPS) purchased the company to expand the use of electronic technology in the package delivery and tracking business.
II Morrow shifted focus from marine business to development of package process automation technology for UPS such as vehicle management systems, automated high speed package sorting systems, as well as delivery and tracking systems. In 1999, II Morrow was renamed to UPS Aviation Technologies, and re-focused towards modernizing UPS' Boeing 7xx series Heavy Iron Transport Category Aircraft fleet, as well they also re-entered the general aviation marketplace. It certified the first Gamma 3 WAAS GPS engine for FAA Certified Precision GPS approaches.[43] The new certified WAAS engine yielded vertical and horizontal accuracy of one meter RMS in guidance into airports without existing ILS approaches. This GPS technology met the FAA's TSO-C146a primary navigation standards for en route, terminal and approach phases of flight—with WAAS augmentation as the sole means of navigation. This primary GPS "sole source" navigation capability was integrated into the CNX-80. The CNX-80 WAAS GPS/COM/NAV integrated navigator was the first product in the industry approved for primary GPS navigation. It also enabled LPV "glidescope" approaches without requiring ground nav aids. New LNAV (GPS) approaches provide the accuracy and safety of an ILS—without the ground-based localizer and glideslope equipment.[44] Later, the CNX-80 was renamed the GNS-480, under Garmin.[45]
As UPS Aviation Technologies, this subsidiary was also involved with development, engineering, and manufacturing functional products for the FAA's Capstone program, which also included ADS-B transponder (UAT and FIS), datalink services, and the MX-20 Multi Function Display that in addition to NAV, it displayed terrain, real-time weather, Jeppeson plates, other ADS-B aircraft, and a variety of other functions in 2000.
Under the FAA Capstone Phase I program, a fleet of small commercial aircraft were equipped for an evaluation of the safety benefits from the use of advanced technologies during day-to-day operations in Alaska's high-risk operating environment. The aircraft are fitted with IFR capable GPS receivers, a Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) data-link system that enables Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and Flight Information Services (FIS) including real-time weather, and a multifunction display (MFD) depicting terrain, other ADS-B aircraft, and weather graphics and text data. These avionics was installed on 200 aircraft used for commuter, charter and mail flights in southwest Alaska.
In 1999: Flight International magazine presented UPS Aviation Technologies with its Aerospace Industry Award for the development of ADS-B, a surveillance technology intended to reduce aviation delays while improving safety. [46]
Wristwear[edit]




Garmin Fenix3 Multisport GPS Watch


The Garmin Vivofit 3 measures the wearer's steps, measures his sleep, judges his body movement, and counts his heart rate and the number of stairs that he has climbed.[47]
The Garmin Vivomove is a classic watch with an activity tracking capabilities. It has a built-in accelerometer (calculates distance for indoor workouts, without need for a foot pod), step counter, auto goal (learns the wearer's activity level and assigns a daily step goal), move bar, and sleep-monitoring capabilities.[48]
The Garmin produces the Vivo HRSmart, the most remarkable wearable technology with the affordable price compared to the competitor. Vivo HRSmart is significantly improved from the previous model, Vivo fit 3. It comes with the touch screen and includes sensible heart-rate monitoring, media player controller, receivable text and phone finder features.
The Garmin Forerunner 735 XT features multi-sport tracking capabilities, built in heart rate sensor, and a variety of special profiles for jogging, swimming, cycling, skiing, paddle sports, a variety of weight loss activities, and hiking. It comes with built-in GPS to track the location and to calculate the distance. .[49] Garmin announced the latest multisport GPS smartwatch Fenix 5 on January 4, 2017, with some advanced features .[50]
Maps[edit]
Most current Garmin devices can display its current location on a map, which is vector-based and stored in the built-in memory or loaded from additional flash media. The built-in (or 'basemap') displays all country borders and major cities. Garmin offers different maps for purchase, including detailed road maps, topographic maps and nautical maps. Non-commercial maps are also available and can be displayed on most Garmin GPS devices.

History[edit]
Founding and growth[edit]
In 1983, Gary Burrell recruited Min H. Kao from the defense contractor Magnavox while working for the former King Radio.[6] They founded Garmin in 1989 in Lenexa, Kansas,[2] as "ProNav". ProNav's first product was a GPS unit which sold for US$2,500. The company was later renamed "Garmin", an acronym of the first names of its two founders, Gary Burrell and Min H. Kao.[7] In 1991, the U.S. Army became their first customer.[8]
By 1995, Garmin's sales had reached $105 million, and it had achieved a profit of $23 million. By 1999, sales had reached $233 million and a profit of $64 million. Garmin reported a 2006 total revenue of $1.77 billion, up 73% from $1.03 billion in 2005.[9][10]
On May 13, 1999, AirCell and Garmin International announced an alliance to develop new products that use AirCell's unique cellular air-ground link to bring affordable flight communications, navigation and safety to general aviation aircraft.[11] By 2000 Garmin had sold three million GPS devices, and was producing 50 different models. Its products were sold in 100 countries and carried by 2,500 independent distributors. As of 22 August 2000, the company held 35 patents on GPS technology. By the end of June 2000, the company employed 1,205 people: 541 in the United States, 635 in Taiwan, and 29 in the United Kingdom.[12]
Public offering[edit]
The company began public trading on NASDAQ on 8 December 2000. At that time Burrell owned 19,911,155 shares. Kao owned 20,352,803 shares. Together their holdings accounted for 45 percent of the company's stock. Kao's brother, Ruey-Jeng Kao, an attorney in Taipei, owned another 7,984,109 shares, which when combined with Burrell's and Kao's shares constituted 54.22 percent of the shares outstanding.[13]
Acquisitions[edit]




The world's only Garmin retail location is located on the Magnificent Mile in Chicago, Illinois.


In August 2003, Garmin completed acquisition of UPS Aviation Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of United Parcel Service, Inc., expanding its product line of panel-mounted GPS/NAV/COMM units and integrated cockpit systems for private and commercial aircraft. The acquired company changed its name to Garmin AT, Inc. and continued operations as a wholly owned subsidiary of Garmin International, Inc.[14]
Garmin has acquired Dynastream Innovations,[15] EME Tec Sat SAS (EME),[16] and Digital Cyclone.[17] Dynastream, in Cochrane, Alberta, produces personal monitoring technology (ANT+)—such as foot pods and heart rate monitors for sports and fitness products—and also ultra-low-power and low-cost wireless connectivity devices for a wide range of applications (ANT). EME Tec Sat SAS (EME) is the distributor of Garmin's consumer products in France; following the acquisition, EME changed its name to Garmin France SAS. Digital Cyclone Inc (DCI), located in Chanhassen, Minnesota, provides mobile weather solutions for consumers, pilots, and outdoor enthusiasts. Garmin also bought Nautamatic Marine Systems,[18] an Oregon-based company that makes autopilot systems for boats. In July 2011, Garmin finished its acquisition of the German satellite navigation company Navigon.[19]
In 2006, Garmin introduced a new corporate logo,[20] and opened its first retail store, located on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Illinois.[21]
In 2015, Garmin acquired South Africa's iKubu Ltd. for its Backtracker on-bicycle low power radar system.[22]
Corporate governance[edit]
Burrell retired in 2003 as Garmin's chief executive officer and in 2004 retired as chairman of its board of directors. He is now chairman emeritus. Kao became CEO in 2003, and chairman in 2004.[23]
In 2005, Forbes estimated Kao’s net worth at $1.5 billion. He has donated $17.5 million to the University of Tennessee. The same year Forbes estimated Burrell’s net worth as $940 million.[24]
Operations[edit]




Garmin Tech Center (台灣國際航電科技大樓) is the head office of Garmin (Asia) Corporation and located in the Xizhi District of New Taipei City, Taiwan


Garmin operates in several other countries besides the UK, USA, and Taiwan.[25] It operates as Formar (Belgium), Garmin AMB (Canada), Belanor (Norway), Trepat (Spain), and Garmin-Cluj (Romania).
Products and brands[edit]
See also: List of Garmin products
Software[edit]
In addition to devices with integrated software, Garmin also produces a number of software packages for use on a personal computer. This software was designed to run on only the Microsoft Windows operating system until 2006, when Garmin released all of its software for Mac OS X.[26]
Marine GPS[edit]
The company’s first product was the GPS 100, a panel-mounted GPS receiver aimed at the marine market, priced at $2,500. It debuted at the 1990 International Marine Technology Exposition in Chicago. The product was an instant hit and generated a backlog of orders for 5,000 units. In response to the demand thus created, Kao traveled (January 1991) to Taipei to set up manufacturing facilities.
Handheld GPS[edit]




A Garmin eTrex H, an early, basic GPS model


Another early product, a handheld GPS receiver, proved popular with military personnel serving in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia during the 1991 Gulf War. In the early 2000s (decade), Garmin launched a series of personal GPS devices aimed at recreational runners called the Forerunner. A similar wrist-worn GPS device with two dimensional GPS tracking and waypoint projection called the Garmin Foretrex is popular among day hikers, off-road mountain bikers, and sailboat racers.
eTrex[edit]




A Garmin eTrex 30 simultaneously connects to both GPS and GLONASS satellites.


The compact eTrex series, as introduced in 2000. The series includes several models with different features and options. The original eTrex, commonly nicknamed "eTrex Yellow" offered a lightweight (5.3 oz/150 g), waterproof, palm-sized 12-channel GPS receiver to backpackers, hikers, and others afoot in remote areas, along with a battery life of up to 22 hours on two AA-size batteries.[27] It was replaced in 2007 by the eTrex H, which added a high-sensitivity receiver.[28] Other more advanced eTrex models include the Summit, Venture, Legend, and Vista, each with various additional features such as WAAS, altimeter, digital compass, city database, and highway maps. Many of these models come in color and expandable-memory versions.[29]
In May 2011, Garmin refreshed the eTrex product line with improved mechanical design and support for advances in cartography and hardware technology with its release of the eTrex 10, eTrex 20, and eTrex 30, Garmin became the first company to manufacture and distribute a worldwide consumer navigation product supporting both GPS and GLONASS satellite constellations.[30][31] In May 13, 2015 Garmin released the eTrex 20x and 30x, which succeeded the eTrex 20 and 30. The main upgrade was a higher resolution screen and 4GB storage, double of the previous models.[32]
July 2, 2015 Garmin introduced its eTrex Touch line, releasing three models (25, 35 and 35t), all featuring an 2.6" touch screen.[33]

In 1998, the first Garmin StreetPilot was announced at the Consumer Electronics Show. It had a black and white screen and no voice. In 2002, the StreetPilot III added a color display and voice navigation. In October 2005, Garmin released the StreetPilot i-Series, compact GPS navigators which came in three models, i2, i3, i5. The i2 has a monochrome display, and maps need to be loaded on a Transflash card. The i3 is similar, except it has a color screen. The i5 has a color screen and the maps are preprogrammed into the device. More advanced versions of the StreetPilot include the c-Series, some of which sport large color touchscreens, FM traffic notifications, support for weather and information updates from MSN Direct, and Bluetooth support.
In 2005, the nüvi 300 series was released. It was the first modern-shaped automotive GPS, with a slim rectangular shape that could fit in a pocket. In October 2006, the firm began shipping the nüvi 660, a pocket-size widescreen successor to the nüvi 300 series. The 660 added bluetooth, FM transmitter, enhanced screen brightness and screen size, all in a small "flat" size. It was the last model to feature OSGB grid reference entry. Garmin's 2012 nüvi lineup includes "essential" models (nuvi 30/40/50 series); "advanced" models (nuvi 2405/2505 series); and "prestige" (nuvi 3400/3500 series). Advanced and prestige models carry additional features . Models that carry an "LM" designation include free updates of the installed maps. The nüvi series (at least) runs under Linux.
Garmin's Zumo line is designed specifically for motorcycles.
Garmin released its 2000's series in 2010, which includes 2200 (3.5 inch display), and 2300 (4.3 inch display).
Fishfinders[edit]
Garmin also manufactures a line of sonar fishfinders, including some units that also have GPS capability.
Laptop GPS and mobile apps[edit]
In April 2008, Garmin launched Garmin Mobile PC, a GPS navigation software program for laptop PCs and other computers, based on the Microsoft Windows operating system, now discontinued.[35]
Garmin offers mobile apps for Android, Windows Phone, and for iPhone. On July 25, 2011, Garmin International, Inc. released Garmin StreetPilot Onboard N. America Version 1.0 for the iOS operating system 4.0 or later. It is compatible with iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, iPod touch (3rd and 4th generation) and GPS-enabled iPads.

Avionics[edit]
Main articles: Garmin G1000 and Garmin G3000




Garmin avionics (an audio control panel; a GNS 430 combined GPS/VHF navigation receiver/VHF communication transceiver; and a transponder) in a light aircraft






Garmin GWX 68 aviation weather radar unit


Garmin has a dedicated division for aviation products, such as integrated cockpits, panel mount displays, multi-function displays (MFD), transponders, radar and other related avionics. For example, the G1000 is an all-glass avionics suite for OEM aircraft.[38] The G900X is similar to the G1000 but designed for use in experimental aircraft,[39] and the G600 is a retrofit solution for several certificated aircraft.[40]
Garmin entered the aviation market in 1991 with the GPS-100AVD panel-mounted receiver. Its first portable unit, the GPS-95, was introduced in 1993. In 1994, the GPS-155 panel-mounted unit was the first GPS receiver on the market to receive full FAA certification for instrument approaches.[41][42]
In 1998, Garmin introduced the GNS-430, an integrated GPS navigation receiver/communications transceiver.[41]
Garmin-AT subsidiary[edit]
In 2003, Garmin acquired UPS Aviation Technologies, including that firm's II Morrow Apollo line of aircraft MFD/GPS/NAV/COMM units. II Morrow had been founded in Salem, Oregon in 1982 as a manufacturer of LORAN C marine and general aviation products. In 1982 its aircraft navigator 602 LORAN C receiver permitted point to point navigation. Some examples of its LORAN units are Apollo II 616B Aviation LORAN panel mount (1986), II Morrow Apollo 604 Loran Navigator (1987) and Apollo 820 GPS Flybuddy (1991). In 1986, United Parcel Service (UPS) purchased the company to expand the use of electronic technology in the package delivery and tracking business.
II Morrow shifted focus from marine business to development of package process automation technology for UPS such as vehicle management systems, automated high speed package sorting systems, as well as delivery and tracking systems. In 1999, II Morrow was renamed to UPS Aviation Technologies, and re-focused towards modernizing UPS' Boeing 7xx series Heavy Iron Transport Category Aircraft fleet, as well they also re-entered the general aviation marketplace. It certified the first Gamma 3 WAAS GPS engine for FAA Certified Precision GPS approaches.[43] The new certified WAAS engine yielded vertical and horizontal accuracy of one meter RMS in guidance into airports without existing ILS approaches. This GPS technology met the FAA's TSO-C146a primary navigation standards for en route, terminal and approach phases of flight—with WAAS augmentation as the sole means of navigation. This primary GPS "sole source" navigation capability was integrated into the CNX-80. The CNX-80 WAAS GPS/COM/NAV integrated navigator was the first product in the industry approved for primary GPS navigation. It also enabled LPV "glidescope" approaches without requiring ground nav aids. New LNAV (GPS) approaches provide the accuracy and safety of an ILS—without the ground-based localizer and glideslope equipment.[44] Later, the CNX-80 was renamed the GNS-480, under Garmin.[45]
As UPS Aviation Technologies, this subsidiary was also involved with development, engineering, and manufacturing functional products for the FAA's Capstone program, which also included ADS-B transponder (UAT and FIS), datalink services, and the MX-20 Multi Function Display that in addition to NAV, it displayed terrain, real-time weather, Jeppeson plates, other ADS-B aircraft, and a variety of other functions in 2000.
Under the FAA Capstone Phase I program, a fleet of small commercial aircraft were equipped for an evaluation of the safety benefits from the use of advanced technologies during day-to-day operations in Alaska's high-risk operating environment. The aircraft are fitted with IFR capable GPS receivers, a Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) data-link system that enables Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and Flight Information Services (FIS) including real-time weather, and a multifunction display (MFD) depicting terrain, other ADS-B aircraft, and weather graphics and text data. These avionics was installed on 200 aircraft used for commuter, charter and mail flights in southwest Alaska.
In 1999: Flight International magazine presented UPS Aviation Technologies with its Aerospace Industry Award for the development of ADS-B, a surveillance technology intended to reduce aviation delays while improving safety. [46]
Wristwear[edit]




Garmin Fenix3 Multisport GPS Watch


The Garmin Vivofit 3 measures the wearer's steps, measures his sleep, judges his body movement, and counts his heart rate and the number of stairs that he has climbed.[47]
The Garmin Vivomove is a classic watch with an activity tracking capabilities. It has a built-in accelerometer (calculates distance for indoor workouts, without need for a foot pod), step counter, auto goal (learns the wearer's activity level and assigns a daily step goal), move bar, and sleep-monitoring capabilities.[48]
The Garmin produces the Vivo HRSmart, the most remarkable wearable technology with the affordable price compared to the competitor. Vivo HRSmart is significantly improved from the previous model, Vivo fit 3. It comes with the touch screen and includes sensible heart-rate monitoring, media player controller, receivable text and phone finder features.
The Garmin Forerunner 735 XT features multi-sport tracking capabilities, built in heart rate sensor, and a variety of special profiles for jogging, swimming, cycling, skiing, paddle sports, a variety of weight loss activities, and hiking. It comes with built-in GPS to track the location and to calculate the distance. .[49] Garmin announced the latest multisport GPS smartwatch Fenix 5 on January 4, 2017, with some advanced features .[50]
Maps[edit]
Most current Garmin devices can display its current location on a map, which is vector-based and stored in the built-in memory or loaded from additional flash media. The built-in (or 'basemap') displays all country borders and major cities. Garmin offers different maps for purchase, including detailed road maps, topographic maps and nautical maps. Non-commercial maps are also available and can be displayed on most Garmin GPS devices.
The maps used by Garmin products are currently provided by Navteq.[51] Map errors are handled using Navteq Map Reporter.[52] Errors can be reported using Garmin's report a map error page,[53] or by using the Navteq map reporter.[54]
Sport sponsorship[edit]
In 2007 Garmin began sponsorship of English Premier League football club Middlesbrough in a one-year deal that was carried into a second year for the 2008/09 season.[55] In 2008 Garmin began sponsorship of cycling team Garmin-Sharp to promote its Edge line of bicycle computers.[56] In 2015, the team became Cannondale-Garmin.[57] In 2014 Garmin paired up with Premier League side Southampton FC in a global partnership. Garmin's European head office is located in Southampton.[58]

History[edit]
Founding and growth[edit]
In 1983, Gary Burrell recruited Min H. Kao from the defense contractor Magnavox while working for the former King Radio.[6] They founded Garmin in 1989 in Lenexa, Kansas,[2] as "ProNav". ProNav's first product was a GPS unit which sold for US$2,500. The company was later renamed "Garmin", an acronym of the first names of its two founders, Gary Burrell and Min H. Kao.[7] In 1991, the U.S. Army became their first customer.[8]
By 1995, Garmin's sales had reached $105 million, and it had achieved a profit of $23 million. By 1999, sales had reached $233 million and a profit of $64 million. Garmin reported a 2006 total revenue of $1.77 billion, up 73% from $1.03 billion in 2005.[9][10]
On May 13, 1999, AirCell and Garmin International announced an alliance to develop new products that use AirCell's unique cellular air-ground link to bring affordable flight communications, navigation and safety to general aviation aircraft.[11] By 2000 Garmin had sold three million GPS devices, and was producing 50 different models. Its products were sold in 100 countries and carried by 2,500 independent distributors. As of 22 August 2000, the company held 35 patents on GPS technology. By the end of June 2000, the company employed 1,205 people: 541 in the United States, 635 in Taiwan, and 29 in the United Kingdom.[12]
Public offering[edit]
The company began public trading on NASDAQ on 8 December 2000. At that time Burrell owned 19,911,155 shares. Kao owned 20,352,803 shares. Together their holdings accounted for 45 percent of the company's stock. Kao's brother, Ruey-Jeng Kao, an attorney in Taipei, owned another 7,984,109 shares, which when combined with Burrell's and Kao's shares constituted 54.22 percent of the shares outstanding.[13]
Acquisitions[edit]




The world's only Garmin retail location is located on the Magnificent Mile in Chicago, Illinois.


In August 2003, Garmin completed acquisition of UPS Aviation Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of United Parcel Service, Inc., expanding its product line of panel-mounted GPS/NAV/COMM units and integrated cockpit systems for private and commercial aircraft. The acquired company changed its name to Garmin AT, Inc. and continued operations as a wholly owned subsidiary of Garmin International, Inc.[14]
Garmin has acquired Dynastream Innovations,[15] EME Tec Sat SAS (EME),[16] and Digital Cyclone.[17] Dynastream, in Cochrane, Alberta, produces personal monitoring technology (ANT+)—such as foot pods and heart rate monitors for sports and fitness products—and also ultra-low-power and low-cost wireless connectivity devices for a wide range of applications (ANT). EME Tec Sat SAS (EME) is the distributor of Garmin's consumer products in France; following the acquisition, EME changed its name to Garmin France SAS. Digital Cyclone Inc (DCI), located in Chanhassen, Minnesota, provides mobile weather solutions for consumers, pilots, and outdoor enthusiasts. Garmin also bought Nautamatic Marine Systems,[18] an Oregon-based company that makes autopilot systems for boats. In July 2011, Garmin finished its acquisition of the German satellite navigation company Navigon.[19]
In 2006, Garmin introduced a new corporate logo,[20] and opened its first retail store, located on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Illinois.[21]
In 2015, Garmin acquired South Africa's iKubu Ltd. for its Backtracker on-bicycle low power radar system.[22]
Corporate governance[edit]
Burrell retired in 2003 as Garmin's chief executive officer and in 2004 retired as chairman of its board of directors. He is now chairman emeritus. Kao became CEO in 2003, and chairman in 2004.[23]
In 2005, Forbes estimated Kao’s net worth at $1.5 billion. He has donated $17.5 million to the University of Tennessee. The same year Forbes estimated Burrell’s net worth as $940 million.[24]
Operations[edit]




Garmin Tech Center (台灣國際航電科技大樓) is the head office of Garmin (Asia) Corporation and located in the Xizhi District of New Taipei City, Taiwan


Garmin operates in several other countries besides the UK, USA, and Taiwan.[25] It operates as Formar (Belgium), Garmin AMB (Canada), Belanor (Norway), Trepat (Spain), and Garmin-Cluj (Romania).
Products and brands[edit]
See also: List of Garmin products
Software[edit]
In addition to devices with integrated software, Garmin also produces a number of software packages for use on a personal computer. This software was designed to run on only the Microsoft Windows operating system until 2006, when Garmin released all of its software for Mac OS X.[26]
Marine GPS[edit]
The company’s first product was the GPS 100, a panel-mounted GPS receiver aimed at the marine market, priced at $2,500. It debuted at the 1990 International Marine Technology Exposition in Chicago. The product was an instant hit and generated a backlog of orders for 5,000 units. In response to the demand thus created, Kao traveled (January 1991) to Taipei to set up manufacturing facilities.
Handheld GPS[edit]




A Garmin eTrex H, an early, basic GPS model


Another early product, a handheld GPS receiver, proved popular with military personnel serving in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia during the 1991 Gulf War. In the early 2000s (decade), Garmin launched a series of personal GPS devices aimed at recreational runners called the Forerunner. A similar wrist-worn GPS device with two dimensional GPS tracking and waypoint projection called the Garmin Foretrex is popular among day hikers, off-road mountain bikers, and sailboat racers.
eTrex[edit]




A Garmin eTrex 30 simultaneously connects to both GPS and GLONASS satellites.


The compact eTrex series, as introduced in 2000. The series includes several models with different features and options. The original eTrex, commonly nicknamed "eTrex Yellow" offered a lightweight (5.3 oz/150 g), waterproof, palm-sized 12-channel GPS receiver to backpackers, hikers, and others afoot in remote areas, along with a battery life of up to 22 hours on two AA-size batteries.[27] It was replaced in 2007 by the eTrex H, which added a high-sensitivity receiver.[28] Other more advanced eTrex models include the Summit, Venture, Legend, and Vista, each with various additional features such as WAAS, altimeter, digital compass, city database, and highway maps. Many of these models come in color and expandable-memory versions.[29]
In May 2011, Garmin refreshed the eTrex product line with improved mechanical design and support for advances in cartography and hardware technology with its release of the eTrex 10, eTrex 20, and eTrex 30, Garmin became the first company to manufacture and distribute a worldwide consumer navigation product supporting both GPS and GLONASS satellite constellations.[30][31] In May 13, 2015 Garmin released the eTrex 20x and 30x, which succeeded the eTrex 20 and 30. The main upgrade was a higher resolution screen and 4GB storage, double of the previous models.[32]
July 2, 2015 Garmin introduced its eTrex Touch line, releasing three models (25, 35 and 35t), all featuring an 2.6" touch screen.[33]

The Geko series was a compact line of handheld GPS receivers aimed at the budget or lightweight hiking market.
In 2004, Garmin introduced its 60C line of handheld GPS mapping receivers, featuring increased sensitivity and storage capacity along with a battery life of up to 30 hours in battery-save mode. This was followed by the 60Cx and 60CSx with improved color map displays.
With the GTM-11, GTM 20 and GTM 25, a Garmin GPS device receives and uses traffic message channel (TMC) information.[34] Also, some Garmin nüvi (1690, 1490T, 1450T, 1390T, 1390, 1350, 1260, 1250 and 265WT, 265T, 265W, 265, 255w and 255) comes with an integrated TMC receiver.
iQue PDA receivers[edit]
Main article: Garmin iQue
In 2003, Garmin launched the iQue line of integrated PDA-GPS receivers. On 31 October 2005, the iQue M4 became the first PDA that did not require a PC to preload the maps. The American version came with built-in maps of North America, while the UK version was supplied pre-loaded with maps of Western Europe.

In 1998, the first Garmin StreetPilot was announced at the Consumer Electronics Show. It had a black and white screen and no voice. In 2002, the StreetPilot III added a color display and voice navigation. In October 2005, Garmin released the StreetPilot i-Series, compact GPS navigators which came in three models, i2, i3, i5. The i2 has a monochrome display, and maps need to be loaded on a Transflash card. The i3 is similar, except it has a color screen. The i5 has a color screen and the maps are preprogrammed into the device. More advanced versions of the StreetPilot include the c-Series, some of which sport large color touchscreens, FM traffic notifications, support for weather and information updates from MSN Direct, and Bluetooth support.
In 2005, the nüvi 300 series was released. It was the first modern-shaped automotive GPS, with a slim rectangular shape that could fit in a pocket. In October 2006, the firm began shipping the nüvi 660, a pocket-size widescreen successor to the nüvi 300 series. The 660 added bluetooth, FM transmitter, enhanced screen brightness and screen size, all in a small "flat" size. It was the last model to feature OSGB grid reference entry. Garmin's 2012 nüvi lineup includes "essential" models (nuvi 30/40/50 series); "advanced" models (nuvi 2405/2505 series); and "prestige" (nuvi 3400/3500 series). Advanced and prestige models carry additional features . Models that carry an "LM" designation include free updates of the installed maps. The nüvi series (at least) runs under Linux.
Garmin's Zumo line is designed specifically for motorcycles.
Garmin released its 2000's series in 2010, which includes 2200 (3.5 inch display), and 2300 (4.3 inch display).
Fishfinders[edit]
Garmin also manufactures a line of sonar fishfinders, including some units that also have GPS capability.
Laptop GPS and mobile apps[edit]
In April 2008, Garmin launched Garmin Mobile PC, a GPS navigation software program for laptop PCs and other computers, based on the Microsoft Windows operating system, now discontinued.[35]
Garmin offers mobile apps for Android, Windows Phone, and for iPhone. On July 25, 2011, Garmin International, Inc. released Garmin StreetPilot Onboard N. America Version 1.0 for the iOS operating system 4.0 or later. It is compatible with iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, iPod touch (3rd and 4th generation) and GPS-enabled iPads.

The Garmin Edge and certain models of Garmin Forerunner is a suite of GPS-enabled devices for use while running or cycling.
Avionics[edit]
Main articles: Garmin G1000 and Garmin G3000




Garmin avionics (an audio control panel; a GNS 430 combined GPS/VHF navigation receiver/VHF communication transceiver; and a transponder) in a light aircraft






Garmin GWX 68 aviation weather radar unit


Garmin has a dedicated division for aviation products, such as integrated cockpits, panel mount displays, multi-function displays (MFD), transponders, radar and other related avionics. For example, the G1000 is an all-glass avionics suite for OEM aircraft.[38] The G900X is similar to the G1000 but designed for use in experimental aircraft,[39] and the G600 is a retrofit solution for several certificated aircraft.[40]
Garmin entered the aviation market in 1991 with the GPS-100AVD panel-mounted receiver. Its first portable unit, the GPS-95, was introduced in 1993. In 1994, the GPS-155 panel-mounted unit was the first GPS receiver on the market to receive full FAA certification for instrument approaches.[41][42]
In 1998, Garmin introduced the GNS-430, an integrated GPS navigation receiver/communications transceiver.[41]
Garmin-AT subsidiary[edit]
In 2003, Garmin acquired UPS Aviation Technologies, including that firm's II Morrow Apollo line of aircraft MFD/GPS/NAV/COMM units. II Morrow had been founded in Salem, Oregon in 1982 as a manufacturer of LORAN C marine and general aviation products. In 1982 its aircraft navigator 602 LORAN C receiver permitted point to point navigation. Some examples of its LORAN units are Apollo II 616B Aviation LORAN panel mount (1986), II Morrow Apollo 604 Loran Navigator (1987) and Apollo 820 GPS Flybuddy (1991). In 1986, United Parcel Service (UPS) purchased the company to expand the use of electronic technology in the package delivery and tracking business.
II Morrow shifted focus from marine business to development of package process automation technology for UPS such as vehicle management systems, automated high speed package sorting systems, as well as delivery and tracking systems. In 1999, II Morrow was renamed to UPS Aviation Technologies, and re-focused towards modernizing UPS' Boeing 7xx series Heavy Iron Transport Category Aircraft fleet, as well they also re-entered the general aviation marketplace. It certified the first Gamma 3 WAAS GPS engine for FAA Certified Precision GPS approaches.[43] The new certified WAAS engine yielded vertical and horizontal accuracy of one meter RMS in guidance into airports without existing ILS approaches. This GPS technology met the FAA's TSO-C146a primary navigation standards for en route, terminal and approach phases of flight—with WAAS augmentation as the sole means of navigation. This primary GPS "sole source" navigation capability was integrated into the CNX-80. The CNX-80 WAAS GPS/COM/NAV integrated navigator was the first product in the industry approved for primary GPS navigation. It also enabled LPV "glidescope" approaches without requiring ground nav aids. New LNAV (GPS) approaches provide the accuracy and safety of an ILS—without the ground-based localizer and glideslope equipment.[44] Later, the CNX-80 was renamed the GNS-480, under Garmin.[45]
As UPS Aviation Technologies, this subsidiary was also involved with development, engineering, and manufacturing functional products for the FAA's Capstone program, which also included ADS-B transponder (UAT and FIS), datalink services, and the MX-20 Multi Function Display that in addition to NAV, it displayed terrain, real-time weather, Jeppeson plates, other ADS-B aircraft, and a variety of other functions in 2000.
Under the FAA Capstone Phase I program, a fleet of small commercial aircraft were equipped for an evaluation of the safety benefits from the use of advanced technologies during day-to-day operations in Alaska's high-risk operating environment. The aircraft are fitted with IFR capable GPS receivers, a Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) data-link system that enables Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and Flight Information Services (FIS) including real-time weather, and a multifunction display (MFD) depicting terrain, other ADS-B aircraft, and weather graphics and text data. These avionics was installed on 200 aircraft used for commuter, charter and mail flights in southwest Alaska.
In 1999: Flight International magazine presented UPS Aviation Technologies with its Aerospace Industry Award for the development of ADS-B, a surveillance technology intended to reduce aviation delays while improving safety. [46]
Wristwear[edit]




Garmin Fenix3 Multisport GPS Watch


The Garmin Vivofit 3 measures the wearer's steps, measures his sleep, judges his body movement, and counts his heart rate and the number of stairs that he has climbed.[47]
The Garmin Vivomove is a classic watch with an activity tracking capabilities. It has a built-in accelerometer (calculates distance for indoor workouts, without need for a foot pod), step counter, auto goal (learns the wearer's activity level and assigns a daily step goal), move bar, and sleep-monitoring capabilities.[48]
The Garmin produces the Vivo HRSmart, the most remarkable wearable technology with the affordable price compared to the competitor. Vivo HRSmart is significantly improved from the previous model, Vivo fit 3. It comes with the touch screen and includes sensible heart-rate monitoring, media player controller, receivable text and phone finder features.
The Garmin Forerunner 735 XT features multi-sport tracking capabilities, built in heart rate sensor, and a variety of special profiles for jogging, swimming, cycling, skiing, paddle sports, a variety of weight loss activities, and hiking. It comes with built-in GPS to track the location and to calculate the distance. .[49] Garmin announced the latest multisport GPS smartwatch Fenix 5 on January 4, 2017, with some advanced features .[50]
Maps[edit]
Most current Garmin devices can display its current location on a map, which is vector-based and stored in the built-in memory or loaded from additional flash media. The built-in (or 'basemap') displays all country borders and major cities. Garmin offers different maps for purchase, including detailed road maps, topographic maps and nautical maps. Non-commercial maps are also available and can be displayed on most Garmin GPS devices.
The maps used by Garmin products are currently provided by Navteq.[51] Map errors are handled using Navteq Map Reporter.[52] Errors can be reported using Garmin's report a map error page,[53] or by using the Navteq map reporter.[54]
Sport sponsorship[edit]
In 2007 Garmin began sponsorship of English Premier League football club Middlesbrough in a one-year deal that was carried into a second year for the 2008/09 season.[55] In 2008 Garmin began sponsorship of cycling team Garmin-Sharp to promote its Edge line of bicycle computers.[56] In 2015, the team became Cannondale-Garmin.[57] In 2014 Garmin paired up with Premier League side Southampton FC in a global partnership. Garmin's European head office is located in Southampton.[58]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
