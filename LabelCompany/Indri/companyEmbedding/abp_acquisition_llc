Business Wire




Nov 11, 2016 8:00 AM EST













 




























































  ABP Acquisition LLC ("ABP") today announced the results of its tender offer to purchase up to 18 million shares of Five Star Quality Care, Inc. (Nasdaq: FVE), or Five Star, at a purchase price of $3.00/share, net to the seller in cash, without interest.  The tender offer expired at 12:00 midnight, New York time, on Thursday, November 10, 2016. The depositary for the tender offer has reported that, based upon a preliminary count, the total number of shares tendered was 22,769,337. Accordingly, it appears that the tender offer was over-subscribed. Pursuant to the terms of the tender offer, the number of shares that ABP will purchase from tendering stockholders will be prorated so that ABP only purchases up to 18 million shares.  The final results of the tender offer will be announced following confirmation of the final number of shares properly tendered. Payment for shares accepted for purchase will be made promptly, in accordance with the terms of the tender offer. All shares not accepted for payment will be returned to the stockholder or, in the case of tendered shares delivered by book entry transfer, credited to the account of the book entry transfer facility from which the transfer had been made, in accordance with the terms of the tender offer.  If any Five Star stockholders have any questions about the tender offer, please call the information agent for this tender offer: Morrow Sodali Global LLC at (800) 662-5200.

Business Wire




Oct 3, 2016 8:00 AM EDT













 




























































  ABP Acquisition LLC today announced that it intends to make a cash tender offer for up to 10,000,000 shares of common stock of Five Star Quality Care, Inc. (Nasdaq: FVE) at a price of $3.00 per share. The offer price represents a 57% premium over FVE's closing price of $1.91 per share on September 30, 2016, the last trading day prior to today's announcement, and represents a 34% premium over the average year to date closing trading prices of FVE shares of $2.24 per share. The number of shares ABP Acquisition LLC intends to offer to purchase in the tender offer represents approximately 20% of the outstanding shares of FVE common stock. The tender offer will be open to all FVE stockholders.  ABP ACQUISITION LLC'S OFFER WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO A FINANCING CONDITION.  ABP Acquisition LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of ABP Trust. Barry M. Portnoy and Adam D. Portnoy beneficially own ABP Trust and through ABP Trust they are the controlling stockholders of The RMR Group Inc. (Nasdaq:RMR). The RMR Group Inc., acting through its subsidiary The RMR Group LLC, provides management services to FVE. Barry Portnoy is a Managing Director of FVE. The Independent Directors of FVE approved the waiver of certain ownership restrictions in FVE's governing documents to permit ABP Acquisition LLC to commence and complete the contemplated tender offer, and ABP Acquisition LLC and the shares it acquires in the tender offer will be subject to standstill and lockup restrictions for extended periods.  Once the tender offer is commenced, offering materials will be mailed to FVE stockholders and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). FVE shareholders should read the offering materials when they become available, because they will contain important information.  The tender offer will be held open for at least 20 business days following its commencement, and tenders of shares must be made prior to the expiration of the tender offer period.

Five Star Quality Care, Inc. Grants Certain Ownership Limitation Exemptions to ABP Acquisition LLC


 On October 1, 2016, the Board of Directors of Five Star Quality Care, 
 Inc. (Nasdaq:FVE), acting by a special committee, granted ABP (News - Alert) 
 Acquisition LLC a conditional exemption from certain Five Star bylaw and 
 charter restrictions applicable to certain ownership limitations of not 
 more than 5% and 9.8% of Five Star's shares of common stock, 
 respectively. Five Star understands that ABP Acquisition LLC intends to 
 make a tender offer for up to 10,000,000 shares at $3.00 per share. ABP 
 Acquisition LLC is affiliated with Mr. Barry Portnoy, a Managing 
 Director of Five Star, and with the controlling shareholders of The RMR 
 Group Inc. (Nasdaq: RMR) and its subsidiary The RMR Group LLC, Five 
 Star's business manager.
 

 A Special Committee of Five Star's Board of Directors composed of all of 
 Five Star's Independent Directors negotiated and approved a Consent, 
 Standstill, Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement with ABP 
 Acquisition LLC, pursuant to which the Five Star shares ABP Acquisition 
 LLC may acquire in the tender offer will be subject to standstill and 
 lockup restrictions for extended periods. The Board acting by this 
 Special Committee intends to express no opinion to the Company's 
 shareholders with respect to the tender offer as it believes the 
 decision as to whether to tender Five Star shares is a personal decision 
 which should be made by shareholders based upon their personal 
 circumstances. Five Star's Board suggests that each shareholder should 
 review the tender offer and all related information, when available, 
 consult with such holder's financial and tax advisors and make an 
 independent determination.
 

 Five Star Quality Care, Inc. is a senior living and healthcare services 
 company. As of June 30, 2016, Five Star operated 276 senior living 
 communities (excluding one senior living community classified as a 
 discontinued operation) with 31,191 living units located in 32 states, 
 including 214 communities (22,952 living units) that it owned or leased 
 and 62 communities (8,239 living units) that it managed. These 
 communities include independent iving, assisted living, continuing care 
 retirement communities and skilled nursing communities. Five Star is 
 headquartered in Newton, Massachusetts.

 the solicitation of tenders with respect to Five Star's shares. ABP

 common stock, it will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a

 Five Star are encouraged to read each of the tender offer statement of

What Our Clients Are Saying prevnext    Greg GoertzenGoertzen Homes ABP Capital is fast, easy to work with, but most importantly they look at properties in a unique way. They provide the same, or often better, rates than other private investors, but they bring value to the table with their real estate and construction background.  I love working with ABP Capital because they are not only good people, they get things done.    Jim LackeyJim Lackey Associates ABP Capital is the real deal. Mike and his team are a sophisticated operation and can calculate the value of a deal quickly and with certainty.  Partnering with ABP means I can do any size deal, and even if a bank could fund a loan, many of my clients have told me they will never sign a personal guarantee again    Michael KellyKelly Capital I knew ABP Capital was a great company when Mike gave me advice on a property that he had no investment in that earned me $1,000,000. Since that advice, I've done many deals with ABP and each time their solid team of underwriters and accountants has produced excellent results.     Gary GossDTZ ABP Capital truly understands the immense diversity of projects and can quickly understand the value of a deal. Their ability to move at lightning-speed makes them my preferred lender for complex deals.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
