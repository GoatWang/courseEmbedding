CUSIP No. Y2685T115SCHEDULE 13D/APage 18 of 24 Pages 

This Amendment No. 6 (“Amendment No.
6”) amends and supplements the statement on Schedule 13D (the “Original Schedule 13D”) filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on July 21, 2014, as amended by Amendment No. 1 (“Amendment
No. 1”) filed with the SEC on July 23, 2015, Amendment No. 2 (“Amendment No. 2”) filed with the SEC
on September 17, 2015, Amendment No. 3 (“Amendment No.3”) filed with the SEC on May 11, 2016, Amendment No.4
(“Amendment No. 4”) filed with the SEC on June 10, 2016, and Amendment No. 5 (“Amendment No. 5”)
filed with the SEC on July 1, 2016 (the Original Schedule 13D as amended by Amendment No. 1, Amendment No. 2, Amendment No. 3,
Amendment No. 4, Amendment No. 5, and this Amendment No. 6, the “Schedule 13D”), with respect to the shares
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”) and the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock,
par value $0.01 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”), of Genco Shipping & Trading Limited, a corporation
organized under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (the “Issuer”). This Amendment No. 5 amends
Items 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 as set forth below.
 


Item 3.
SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS OR OTHER CONSIDERATION

 
 

 
Item 3 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended and supplemented by the addition of the following:

 
 

 
The Reporting Persons acquired the 6,597,938 shares of Series A Preferred Stock reported in this Schedule 13D pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement (as defined in Item 4), which convert into 6,597,938 shares of Common Stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $31,999,999.30, which were derived from the working capital of CCP, CCPM, CSCP II, CSCP Cayman, CCP II Cayman and CCP SBS II Cayman.

 


Item 4.
PURPOSE OF TRANSACTION

 
 

 
Item 4 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended and supplemented by the addition of the following:

 
 

 
As
    described in the Issuer’s Form 8-K filed October 6, 2016 (the “Form 8-K”), on October 6, 2016,
    certain funds managed by and affiliated with Centerbridge Partners, L.P. (collectively, “Centerbridge”)
    entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with the Issuer effective as of October 4, 2016 (the “Stock Purchase
    Agreement”) for the purchase of 6,597,938 shares of the Series A Preferred
    Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $31,999,999.30.  In addition, Centerbridge has agreed to provide a
    backstop commitment to purchase up to 3,402,062 additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock for $4.85 per share at a pro
    rata amount equal to the basic subscription amount for each fund.

 
 

 
The Series A Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $4.85 per share and will mandatorily convert into Common Stock at a conversion price of $4.85 per share, subject to certain adjustments, upon receipt of approval of the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock by the Company’s shareholders.  Commencing on the 180th day after issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock, holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to cumulative dividends at a rate of 6% per share on the liquidation preference unless any such dividends are not permitted by law or the terms of any loan agreement, credit agreement, guaranty, or related agreement.  In such a case, the dividends will be deferred until conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock.  Upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, its holders will be entitled to receive the amount of any unpaid deferred dividends in cash or shares of Common Stock based on the conversion price then in effect.

 

 
CUSIP No. Y2685T115SCHEDULE 13D/APage 19 of 24 Pages 

 
 


 
As described in the Form 8-K, other stakeholders of the Issuer separately have entered into commitment letters with the Issuer in connection with the proposed Offering that, in each case, are substantially similar to the Stock Purchase Agreement.  The Reporting Persons hereby expressly disclaim membership in a “group” (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) with any other stakeholders in the Issuer, and the entry into the Stock Purchase Agreement and the filing of this Schedule 13D shall not be construed as an admission that any Reporting Person, for any purpose, is a member of a group with any such stakeholder, or any other person, or that the Reporting Persons beneficially own any shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by any other stakeholder, or any other person.

 
 

 
The consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreements is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including, without limitation, refinancing and amendment of certain of the Issuer’s credit facilities.  Centerbridge has agreed in the Stock Purchase Agreement that it will vote all of its shares of common stock in favor of approval of conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. In addition, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, Centerbridge and the Issuer intend to enter into an industry standard registration rights agreement on substantially the same terms and conditions as set forth in that certain Registration Rights Agreement by and among the Company and certain of its shareholders dated as of July 9, 2014. In addition, the relative rights, preferences, limitations and designations of the Series A Preferred Stock are set forth in the Certificate of Designation attached as Exhibit A to the Stock Purchase Agreement.

 
 

 
The description of the Stock Purchase Agreement, including that of the Certificate of Designation, contained in this response to Item 4 is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Stock Purchase Agreement, which is incorporated herein by reference and attached hereto as Exhibit 4.

 


Item 5.
INTEREST IN SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER

 
 

 
Items 5(a) and (b) of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated as follows:

 
 

 
(a) – (b) The percentages of Common Stock reported herein are based on 7,354,449 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of August 9, 2016, as reported in the Issuer’s Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016 filed with the SEC on August 9, 2016, reflecting the one-for-ten reverse stock split effected by the Issuer on July 7, 2016 (the “Reverse Stock Split”), and assumes the conversion of all shares of Series A Preferred Stock.

 
 

 
The information required by Items 5(a) – (b) is set forth in rows 7 – 13 of the cover page for each of the Reporting Persons and is incorporated herein by reference. The number of shares set forth on the Reporting Persons’ cover pages also gives effect to the Reverse Stock Split.

 
 

 
(c) The Reporting Persons’ response to Item 4 is incorporated by reference into this Item 5(c).
