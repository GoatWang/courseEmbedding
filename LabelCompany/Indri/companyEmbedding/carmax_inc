First went to DGDG across the street where they low balled me and couldn't even honor KBB. 

I come to carmax after booking an appointment 12 hours before arrival. Terrance Watson was the sales associate I was working with who was very honest and an outstanding guy. He was very thorough and put me in queue to get the car appraised. 
Their system averaged the number of appraisals needed and by time and gave me an ETA of 35 minutes. 
In and out, he showed me carmax's deal next to KBB.
5 minutes after that, Eric put together the dmv forms and got me my check in 15 minutes. 


The building itself is very clean. They offer coffee and water and even have a kids area. 

Total time at the shop. 1 hour and 20 minutes.... 

Service:5/5
Professionalism: 5/5







This morning i came in to look at there inventory and possibly buy a car. I was stopped by a sales manager and was advised that they do not open for another 25 min. 
 I guess these guys are really motivated to sell cars. *sarcasm 

future tip. if a customer walks onto your lot 25min early let him browse, don't tell them to come back in 25 min.







Went here about 2 weeks ago with my wife because we are going to be looking for a car in the near future.  Walked in and we were greeted by someone at the desk, he signed us in to be helped by a salesman.  Only took a couple minutes for a salesman to be available, once he came over we told him what we were looking for which was a newer Tahoe.  He stated that he thinks they have one, we then followed him around the dealership to find that they did not have any.  We saw a couple other cars that we were possibly interested in, we asked the salesman questions about the car and it became obvious he didn't know anything at all.  Each time he would rush to the tag on the car and quickly read the details and try and regurgitate what he read.  

At the end he asked us if we were interested and I just looked at him with a blank look because there was nothing that we found to be interested in.  If you are looking for a car and looking for professional employees with a knowledge about the vehicles, this is not the place to go to.  Majority of the employees were wearing short sleeve shirts, tattoos showing, shorts, and all around a very unprofessional look.  The prices are good and that is why I gave this place a 2 star review, but in all honesty, if you are good at haggling with a dealer I would recommend doing that because you will most likely get a salesman that knows something about the car you are purchasing.







I went here last week to trade in my car and purchase a new car ... They have absolutely no idea wth they are doing - you would think that they would've trained their employees prior to opening but guess they didn't think that far ahead . End of story I went home pissed af with no new car - they made up every excuse for me not to get the car ... not happy . And will go to an actual dealer ...







The service manager Cameron is a nice guy but he needs to learn to work with his team to get things done by the deadline and not accuse people of getting work done to the car from a third party when I stated they were the last person that touched it after I bought it. So if you plan on getting service from them expected to be a few days late I decided to decline payment and pick it up early. they accepted to give me my oil change for free since I don't want them finishing the car







Juan and Nicole were awesome, in and out with the car we wanted in a little under 2 hours!!! My new favorite place to buy a car!







Sold my car, the entire process was so quick, easy and transparent! I was offered almost 3k over Kelly Blue Book, and the lady who helped me, Estefanie, was absolutely amazing. She was warm, knowledgeable, and made sure to get me in and out as quickly as possible. I can't Carnac recommend highly enough, and if you can ask for Estefanie you'll be sure to have a great experience!







Had a wonderful experience this morning with service department. They were kind, courteous, professional and explained everything in detail. I felt very confident with their recommendations. Thank you (I hope I have his name right) J. Grnzyk







Working with Alex at this new Carmax in San Jose has been a pleasure.  We were able to get a relatively high offer on the car we wanted to sell and a good deal on the car we purchased.  We are going back tomorrow to make another deal for our other daughter.  I couldn't have hoped for a better experience!  Alex has been fantastic and the rest of the staff helpful as well!

Carmex Everyday Lip Care | How to Get Healthy & Moisturized Lips



































































Everyday Lip Care
There are steps you can take to give your lips the care and protection they deserve to keep them healthy. It starts with finding the Carmex® lip balm that’s right for you. Check out the information below.
For more details about lip surfaces, texture, flexibility, color and contour, click here to download The Little Lip Book.

					What are “healthy” lips?				


The function of all surface tissues on the body, including the lips, is to protect the body from the outside environment. Such protection can only be accomplished if the lips are healthy. Healthy lips let us smile, whistle and kiss without discomfort, while protecting us from the harmful effects of the sun and wind.
So how do you get healthy lips? As the most delicate part of the face, lips have no oil glands of their own, so sometimes they need external moisture to keep them soft and healthy. That’s where Carmex® comes in.

					What can I do for dry, chapped lips?				


It’s the problem that plagues just about everybody: tender, dry lips that start cracking and rapidly get worse. The most common chapped lip causes are excessive lip licking, dehydration and damage from the sun.
Every time you lick your lips, it removes natural oils that keep moisture in your skin. In turn, that moisture evaporates, leaving behind dried-out, cracked lips with nothing to protect them.
Dehydration can happen when you spend too much time in dry environments (air conditioning and heating systems are culprits here), if you breathe through your mouth at night, and if you’re not drinking that all-important daily amount of water. In all cases, lip moisturizer can mean the difference between miserable lips and a huge smile.
Try Carmex® Classic Lip Balm for dry, chapped lips.

					How can I protect my lips from sun damage?				


Sun damage can lead to skin losing some of its elasticity, and unprotected lips are no exception. If you do not protect your lips from the sun you are increasing the risk of skin cancer or other undesirable skin conditions. However, you can protect your lips from sun damage by using a Carmex® lip balm with sunscreen designed specifically for the lips. Try and avoid glossy lip balms and lip sticks, which can actually magnify the sun’s rays.
Use your lip balm every day, even when it is cloudy because the sun’s rays can get through a cloudy sky. It is recommended to keep an SPF 15 or higher lip balm on hand and reapply it every two hours, including after eating or drinking. 
To keep your lips looking and feeling healthy, keep lips moisturized. When outdoors, use SPF 15 lip balm and avoid excessive exposure to the sun. Since sun damage happens over time, it’s never too late to start a good habit of making sure your lips are protected from the sun.
For sun-protecting lip balm, try Carmex Daily Care™.

					Should my lip care change each season?				


Many people have a daily skin care routine for their face, but forget about caring for their lips. The skin on our lips is softer, more sensitive and prone to damage when exposed to external elements. Since lips do not produce oil, they need extra care to stay hydrated.
During the summer, we tend to spend more time outdoors, exposing our lips to dryness, sunburn and sun damage due to heat and UV rays. During the winter, lip care can be even harder to maintain, as lips often bear the brunt of the elements, both indoors and out. Centrally heated homes and offices (which can be particularly dry) and whipping winter winds can take a toll on lips. UV rays can still do damage, even in the cold of winter.
So how can you help your lips weather the seasons? Here are 7 basic summer and winter lip care tips that can be applied year-round:

Do not lick your lips! Saliva draws moisture out of the lips as it evaporates and only makes the problem worse.
Drink plenty of fluids—especially water—and stay hydrated.
Use moisturizing lip balms that will seal in moisture and stay on your lips to help keep your lips hydrated. If you are not allergic to sunscreen, use a product with SPF 15 or higher—not just on sunny days, but every day.
Lipsticks that are shiny or contain high gloss with little-to-no color can be potentially harmful to lips because they can attract UV rays. Try a triple-layer approach for added protection: apply a lip balm with SPF, followed by a colored lipstick, then finish it off with some shine.
Use equal parts brown sugar, water, salt and honey to exfoliate your lips and remove any chapped skin.
Cover your face. In the winter, especially on windy days, make sure you have a scarf or hat with a mask that covers your lips.
Use a humidifier in dry environments to help moisturize your skin and lips.

Try Classic Lip Balm in the winter and Sun-Protecting Lip Balm in the summer.

					Can I wear lipstick and lip balm?				


Lipstick should show off your lips—NOT highlight dryness, cracking or chapping. Here are 4 quick beauty tips for your lips so you can get the most flattering and long-lasting look from your favorite lipstick:

Exfoliate lips once or twice a week to keep them soft and supple.
This step removes all of the dead skin from your lips, leaving new skin cells to grow in their place. This can easily be done by combining equal parts brown sugar, water, salt and honey, and then gently scrubbing the mixture on your lips.
Apply a moisture-locking lip balm before any other lip product to keep lips smooth and hydrated.
Lipstick can accentuate every flake and crack if lips are dry and chapped. As added protection against dryness, it’s a good idea to also apply medicated lip balm to lips before bed each night to keep lips moisturized.
Apply lip liner.
Begin at the dip of the upper lip and trace the outer part of your lips. Once the lips are lined, use the same liner pencil to fill them in. Simply turn the liner onto its side and color in the rest of the lip. This step is important, as it will provide a foundation for the lipstick you apply on top.
Apply lipstick.
Now it’s time to apply lipstick. One of the things that will help your lipstick look its best is to apply it with a lip brush, instead of directly from the tube, to allow the color to get into the lip and stay longer. Dip the brush onto the lipstick, and pack the color onto the lips to get a sort of stained effect. Next, take a tissue and blot the lips a couple of times to press the color into your lips. Then, use the lipstick tube to apply the second coat of color.

Natural Ingredients
Ingredients for Relief and Comfort
Ingredients for Moisturization and Protection






					Natural Ingredients				


Aloe: Plant-derived extract that helps heal and soothe.
Aloe has been used for centuries to treat skin conditions as well as wounds. Thanks to its anti-inflammatory properties, aloe relieves the pain of dry and chapped lips and skin. Another benefit of aloe is the hydrating effect that helps give a more youthful appearance wherever it’s applied.
Avocado Butter: Provides super moisturizing benefits.
Avocados have been used for health and beauty benefits for centuries because they’re loaded with nutrients, including vitamins A, B, C, E and K. Avocado butter is a powerful moisturizer and can provide protection against UV rays.
Beeswax: Naturally moistens and softens skin, plus protects against ultraviolet rays.
Worker bees spend their lives building this natural storage unit. Maybe that’s why beeswax helps create a natural, breathable barrier on the skin, protecting against dryness and irritants like the sun.
Candelilla wax: Gives our stick formula its staying power.
Candelilla wax is a plant-derived wax that slightly raises the melting temperature of our medicated lip balm stick formulas, allowing them to better maintain their shape and form. It also helps lips retain moisture over time.
Caprylic/capric triglyceride: A natural skin softener that helps prevent drying.
A natural fat that comes from coconuts, caprylic/capric triglyceride helps prevent drying, absorbs quickly and is so gentle it’s often used in formulations for sensitive skin.
Cocoa seed butter: An excellent natural emollient that helps moisturization.
Cocoa butter is natural fat extracted from the cocoa bean during the chocolate-making process. Used to treat skin conditions such as eczema and dermatitis, cocoa butter helps with moisturization, protects from environmental factors and helps prevent dryness and cracking.
Coconut oil: Natural moisturizer that helps hydrate and smooth skin.
Coconut oil is a natural moisturizer, like cocoa butter and lanolin. These and other emollients give you healthy-looking lips by moistening and preventing dryness and chapping associated with environmental effects.
Cold pressed cranberry seed oil: Hydrates and protects from free radicals.
Harvested from a chemical-free process, cold pressed cranberry seed oil is rich in antioxidants, vitamin E and essential fatty acids (EFAs) omega 3 & 6, providing hydration and protection from damaging free radicals that accelerate the appearance of aging.
Colloidal oatmeal: Soothes skin itch and irritation.
Colloidal oatmeal, also known as Avena sativa L., has been used for centuries as a soothing agent to help relieve itch and skin irritation. Colloidal oatmeal provides antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity and comprises starches and beta-glucan that provide protective water-holding functions.
Meadowfoam seed oil: Adds long-lasting moisturization and rejuvenates lips.
Derived from a flowering herb plant native to the western United States, meadowfoam seed oil is easily and quickly absorbed by dry skin, plus it soothes irritations and adds a luxurious feel to lip balms and lotions.
Menthol: Cool and refreshing, menthol offers relief from discomfort.
The source of our refreshing tingle, menthol is derived from natural peppermint oil. Its anesthetic properties help soothe dry, chapped lips and cold sores.
Mineral oil: Makes the classic Carmex® Lip Balm formula smooth and squeezable.
Clear and odorless, mineral oil is added to the classic Carmex® Classic Lip Balm formula to make it squeezable, so chapped lips get a silky-smooth treatment.
Safflower seed oil: A botanical moisturizer that soothes and softens skin.
Safflower seed oil is a natural botanical extracted from the safflower seed. It contains omega 6 and other nutrients and acts as a powerful hydrator and skin lubricant, adding elasticity while preventing dryness and smoothing skin.
Shea butter: Helps with moisturization, quickly relieving dryness and cracking.
Natural shea butter is rich with fatty acids that help to maintain elasticity and softness. It protects against excessive dryness from free-radical and sun damage, plus soothes chapped lips almost immediately.
Vitamin E: Helps prevent drying, chapping and the formation of free radicals.
Offers a wide range of benefits for lips and skin. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals, helping to prevent premature aging as well as dryness and chapping. It also has anti-inflammatory properties, soothing damage from the sun, wind or excessively dry environments.

					Ingredients for Relief and Comfort				


Benzocaine: Works on contact to relieve pain and itch due to cold sores.
Benzocaine is an anesthetic agent used to relieve or numb pain, itch and discomfort from cold sores.
Camphor: Alleviates burning, itching and pain of chapped lips and skin.
Camphor is a compound that shares many properties with menthol, such as a cooling effect that relieves burning, itching and pain. An antimicrobial germ-fighter, camphor also acts as a mild local anesthetic.
Dimethicone: Relieves irritation and protects tender lips and skin.
Used at a low concentration, dimethicone helps with spreadability and protects lips and skin with a waterproof layer to preserve natural moisture and relieve discomfort from itching and dryness.
Phenol: Helps ease discomfort of dry lips.
Known for its mild local anesthetic effect, phenol reduces the itching and burning of chapped lips.
Salicylic acid: A mild exfoliant that allows moisturizers to be better absorbed.
In very small, yet effective amounts, salicylic acid helps to gently remove dead, cracked, peeling skin, without affecting the new layer of skin that is constantly renewing itself. This allows soothing ingredients, such as menthol and camphor, to soak in thoroughly and get to work more quickly.
Back to top






					Ingredients for Moisturization and Protection				


Allantoin: Helps with moisturization as it softens, plus helps heal chapping.
Acting as a softener, allantoin soothes irritations, plus helps reduce dryness and flaking. Allantoin also decreases itching by helping dead skin cells slough off, leaving new skin feeling soft and smooth.
Cetyl esters: Hydrate skin and give a silky feel to our lip balms.
Providing a silky, non-sticky glide, cetyl esters are waxes that thicken our lip balms to give them staying power, plus help to moisturize and preserve softness.
Lanolin: Helps protect skin and locks in moisture.
This exceptional, natural ingredient locks in hydration, softens and helps with moisturization. Lanolin mimics skin’s natural ability to provide the proper environment for healing and soothing lips as it restores elasticity.
Octinoxate and oxybenzone: Safe and effective sunscreen filters to protect against the sun’s damaging rays.
Help prevent sunburn and damage to lips, when applied liberally 15 minutes before sun exposure.
Petrolatum: Effective in helping create a moisture barrier.
Petrolatum is recognized by the Food and Drug Administration for its effectiveness as a skin protectant. It creates a “bandage” between skin and its environment, penetrating the outermost lip and skin layers to aid in healing and to help prevent irritants and germs from penetrating cracks and cuts.

WHY CHOOSE RESEARCH AND MARKETS?



WORLD'S LARGEST SELECTION




TRUSTED BY THE BEST




CUSTOMER FOCUSED




SAFE & SECURE







I was looking everywhere with no luck for an important research publication called World Retail Data

                         & Statistics 2014. Eventually, I gave up but found a 2012 edition of the same publication at Research and Markets. I then emailed customer support to see if they could get me the 2014 edition and within hours, I had the 2014 edition - even at no additional charge.Wow, that was truly impressive customer service by you guys.Thanks a ton to Research and Markets.

						CarMax Inc. (NYSE:KMX) Dividend Growth in Spotlight					











CarMax Inc. (NYSE:KMX) currently has a 10 year dividend growth rate of -0.99900. This number is calculated using the geometric average which provides the typical value of dividend growth over the specified period using the product of their values. The geometric average is defined as the nth root of the product of n numbers. Solid dividend growth may be one sign of a healthy stock. Investors may be watching different time periods to assess dividend growth rates.
CarMax Inc. shares currently have an 8-year dividend growth rate of -0.99900, a 5 year of -0.99900, and a 3 year of 0.00000.
Free Cash Flow or FCF, may be used to gauge the true profitability of a company. FCF measures the amount of cash a company generates after accounting for capital expenditures, and it may be a useful indicator for assessing financial performance. CarMax Inc. (NYSE:KMX)‘s FCF growth is presently at 0.097767. 
This is calculated by subtracting FCF from the previous year from FCF this year, divided by FCF from last year. The company has an FCF score of 0.851877. The FCF score is an indicator that is derived by combining free cash flow stability with free cash flow growth. In general, a higher FCF score value would signal high free cash flow growth. 
The current FCF quality score is -3.595415. The free quality score assists with estimating free cash flow stability. FCF quality is calculated as the 12 ltm cash flow per share over the average of the cash flow numbers. With this number, a lower ratio is typically preferred. 
Looking a bit further, the company has an FCF yield of -0.031822, and a 5-year average FCF yield of -0.029422. The first is simply FCF divided by enterprise value, and the second is the five year average FCF divided by the current enterprise value.
SMA CrossTechnical traders and investors may be looking at the simple moving average 50/200 cross on shares of CarMax Inc. (NYSE:KMX). At the time of writing, the SMA 50/200 Cross value is 1.03572. 
If the value is greater than one, the 50 day moving average is above the 200 day moving average, which may signal positive stock price momentum. A value less than one would indicate that the 50 day moving average is below the 200 day, which may indicate negative share price momentum.
RangeInvestors often keep track of key stock price levels when doing equity research. Two standard levels are the 52-week high and 52-week low. Shares tend to come under increased scrutiny when approaching either of the two marks. After a recent check, the current stock price divided by the 52-week high for shares of CarMax Inc. (NYSE:KMX), gives us a value of 0.939000.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to:

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

First went to DGDG across the street where they low balled me and couldn't even honor KBB. 

I come to carmax after booking an appointment 12 hours before arrival. Terrance Watson was the sales associate I was working with who was very honest and an outstanding guy. He was very thorough and put me in queue to get the car appraised. 
Their system averaged the number of appraisals needed and by time and gave me an ETA of 35 minutes. 
In and out, he showed me carmax's deal next to KBB.
5 minutes after that, Eric put together the dmv forms and got me my check in 15 minutes. 


The building itself is very clean. They offer coffee and water and even have a kids area. 

Total time at the shop. 1 hour and 20 minutes.... 

Service:5/5
Professionalism: 5/5







This morning i came in to look at there inventory and possibly buy a car. I was stopped by a sales manager and was advised that they do not open for another 25 min. 
 I guess these guys are really motivated to sell cars. *sarcasm 

future tip. if a customer walks onto your lot 25min early let him browse, don't tell them to come back in 25 min.







Went here about 2 weeks ago with my wife because we are going to be looking for a car in the near future.  Walked in and we were greeted by someone at the desk, he signed us in to be helped by a salesman.  Only took a couple minutes for a salesman to be available, once he came over we told him what we were looking for which was a newer Tahoe.  He stated that he thinks they have one, we then followed him around the dealership to find that they did not have any.  We saw a couple other cars that we were possibly interested in, we asked the salesman questions about the car and it became obvious he didn't know anything at all.  Each time he would rush to the tag on the car and quickly read the details and try and regurgitate what he read.  

At the end he asked us if we were interested and I just looked at him with a blank look because there was nothing that we found to be interested in.  If you are looking for a car and looking for professional employees with a knowledge about the vehicles, this is not the place to go to.  Majority of the employees were wearing short sleeve shirts, tattoos showing, shorts, and all around a very unprofessional look.  The prices are good and that is why I gave this place a 2 star review, but in all honesty, if you are good at haggling with a dealer I would recommend doing that because you will most likely get a salesman that knows something about the car you are purchasing.







I went here last week to trade in my car and purchase a new car ... They have absolutely no idea wth they are doing - you would think that they would've trained their employees prior to opening but guess they didn't think that far ahead . End of story I went home pissed af with no new car - they made up every excuse for me not to get the car ... not happy . And will go to an actual dealer ...







The service manager Cameron is a nice guy but he needs to learn to work with his team to get things done by the deadline and not accuse people of getting work done to the car from a third party when I stated they were the last person that touched it after I bought it. So if you plan on getting service from them expected to be a few days late I decided to decline payment and pick it up early. they accepted to give me my oil change for free since I don't want them finishing the car







Juan and Nicole were awesome, in and out with the car we wanted in a little under 2 hours!!! My new favorite place to buy a car!







Sold my car, the entire process was so quick, easy and transparent! I was offered almost 3k over Kelly Blue Book, and the lady who helped me, Estefanie, was absolutely amazing. She was warm, knowledgeable, and made sure to get me in and out as quickly as possible. I can't Carnac recommend highly enough, and if you can ask for Estefanie you'll be sure to have a great experience!







Had a wonderful experience this morning with service department. They were kind, courteous, professional and explained everything in detail. I felt very confident with their recommendations. Thank you (I hope I have his name right) J. Grnzyk







Working with Alex at this new Carmax in San Jose has been a pleasure.  We were able to get a relatively high offer on the car we wanted to sell and a good deal on the car we purchased.  We are going back tomorrow to make another deal for our other daughter.  I couldn't have hoped for a better experience!  Alex has been fantastic and the rest of the staff helpful as well!

First went to DGDG across the street where they low balled me and couldn't even honor KBB. I come to carmax after booking an appointment 12 hours before arrival. Terrance Watson was the sales associate I was working with who was very honest and an outstanding guy. He was very thorough and put me in queue to get the car appraised. Their system averaged the number of appraisals needed and by time and gave me an ETA of 35 minutes. In and out, he showed me carmax's deal next to KBB.5 minutes after that, Eric put together the dmv forms and got me my check in 15 minutes. The building itself is very clean. They offer coffee and water and even have a kids area. Total time at the shop. 1 hour and 20 minutes.... Service:5/5Professionalism: 5/5

This morning i came in to look at there inventory and possibly buy a car. I was stopped by a sales manager and was advised that they do not open for another 25 min.  I guess these guys are really motivated to sell cars. *sarcasm future tip. if a customer walks onto your lot 25min early let him browse, don't tell them to come back in 25 min.

Went here about 2 weeks ago with my wife because we are going to be looking for a car in the near future.  Walked in and we were greeted by someone at the desk, he signed us in to be helped by a salesman.  Only took a couple minutes for a salesman to be available, once he came over we told him what we were looking for which was a newer Tahoe.  He stated that he thinks they have one, we then followed him around the dealership to find that they did not have any.  We saw a couple other cars that we were possibly interested in, we asked the salesman questions about the car and it became obvious he didn't know anything at all.  Each time he would rush to the tag on the car and quickly read the details and try and regurgitate what he read.  At the end he asked us if we were interested and I just looked at him with a blank look because there was nothing that we found to be interested in.  If you are looking for a car and looking for professional employees with a knowledge about the vehicles, this is not the place to go to.  Majority of the employees were wearing short sleeve shirts, tattoos showing, shorts, and all around a very unprofessional look.  The prices are good and that is why I gave this place a 2 star review, but in all honesty, if you are good at haggling with a dealer I would recommend doing that because you will most likely get a salesman that knows something about the car you are purchasing.

First went to DGDG across the street where they low balled me and couldn't even honor KBB. 

I come to carmax after booking an appointment 12 hours before arrival. Terrance Watson was the sales associate I was working with who was very honest and an outstanding guy. He was very thorough and put me in queue to get the car appraised. 
Their system averaged the number of appraisals needed and by time and gave me an ETA of 35 minutes. 
In and out, he showed me carmax's deal next to KBB.
5 minutes after that, Eric put together the dmv forms and got me my check in 15 minutes. 


The building itself is very clean. They offer coffee and water and even have a kids area. 

Total time at the shop. 1 hour and 20 minutes.... 

Service:5/5
Professionalism: 5/5







This morning i came in to look at there inventory and possibly buy a car. I was stopped by a sales manager and was advised that they do not open for another 25 min. 
 I guess these guys are really motivated to sell cars. *sarcasm 

future tip. if a customer walks onto your lot 25min early let him browse, don't tell them to come back in 25 min.







Went here about 2 weeks ago with my wife because we are going to be looking for a car in the near future.  Walked in and we were greeted by someone at the desk, he signed us in to be helped by a salesman.  Only took a couple minutes for a salesman to be available, once he came over we told him what we were looking for which was a newer Tahoe.  He stated that he thinks they have one, we then followed him around the dealership to find that they did not have any.  We saw a couple other cars that we were possibly interested in, we asked the salesman questions about the car and it became obvious he didn't know anything at all.  Each time he would rush to the tag on the car and quickly read the details and try and regurgitate what he read.  

At the end he asked us if we were interested and I just looked at him with a blank look because there was nothing that we found to be interested in.  If you are looking for a car and looking for professional employees with a knowledge about the vehicles, this is not the place to go to.  Majority of the employees were wearing short sleeve shirts, tattoos showing, shorts, and all around a very unprofessional look.  The prices are good and that is why I gave this place a 2 star review, but in all honesty, if you are good at haggling with a dealer I would recommend doing that because you will most likely get a salesman that knows something about the car you are purchasing.







I went here last week to trade in my car and purchase a new car ... They have absolutely no idea wth they are doing - you would think that they would've trained their employees prior to opening but guess they didn't think that far ahead . End of story I went home pissed af with no new car - they made up every excuse for me not to get the car ... not happy . And will go to an actual dealer ...







The service manager Cameron is a nice guy but he needs to learn to work with his team to get things done by the deadline and not accuse people of getting work done to the car from a third party when I stated they were the last person that touched it after I bought it. So if you plan on getting service from them expected to be a few days late I decided to decline payment and pick it up early. they accepted to give me my oil change for free since I don't want them finishing the car







Juan and Nicole were awesome, in and out with the car we wanted in a little under 2 hours!!! My new favorite place to buy a car!







Sold my car, the entire process was so quick, easy and transparent! I was offered almost 3k over Kelly Blue Book, and the lady who helped me, Estefanie, was absolutely amazing. She was warm, knowledgeable, and made sure to get me in and out as quickly as possible. I can't Carnac recommend highly enough, and if you can ask for Estefanie you'll be sure to have a great experience!







Had a wonderful experience this morning with service department. They were kind, courteous, professional and explained everything in detail. I felt very confident with their recommendations. Thank you (I hope I have his name right) J. Grnzyk







Working with Alex at this new Carmax in San Jose has been a pleasure.  We were able to get a relatively high offer on the car we wanted to sell and a good deal on the car we purchased.  We are going back tomorrow to make another deal for our other daughter.  I couldn't have hoped for a better experience!  Alex has been fantastic and the rest of the staff helpful as well!

Juan and Nicole were awesome, in and out with the car we wanted in a little under 2 hours!!! My new favorite place to buy a car!







Working with Alex at this new Carmax in San Jose has been a pleasure.  We were able to get a relatively high offer on the car we wanted to sell and a good deal on the car we purchased.  We are going back tomorrow to make another deal for our other daughter.  I couldn't have hoped for a better experience!  Alex has been fantastic and the rest of the staff helpful as well!







Sold my car, the entire process was so quick, easy and transparent! I was offered almost 3k over Kelly Blue Book, and the lady who helped me, Estefanie, was absolutely amazing. She was warm, knowledgeable, and made sure to get me in and out as quickly as possible. I can't Carnac recommend highly enough, and if you can ask for Estefanie you'll be sure to have a great experience!







First went to DGDG across the street where they low balled me and couldn't even honor KBB. 

I come to carmax after booking an appointment 12 hours before arrival. Terrance Watson was the sales associate I was working with who was very honest and an outstanding guy. He was very thorough and put me in queue to get the car appraised. 
Their system averaged the number of appraisals needed and by time and gave me an ETA of 35 minutes. 
In and out, he showed me carmax's deal next to KBB.
5 minutes after that, Eric put together the dmv forms and got me my check in 15 minutes. 


The building itself is very clean. They offer coffee and water and even have a kids area. 

Total time at the shop. 1 hour and 20 minutes.... 

Service:5/5
Professionalism: 5/5







Had a wonderful experience this morning with service department. They were kind, courteous, professional and explained everything in detail. I felt very confident with their recommendations. Thank you (I hope I have his name right) J. Grnzyk







Went here about 2 weeks ago with my wife because we are going to be looking for a car in the near future.  Walked in and we were greeted by someone at the desk, he signed us in to be helped by a salesman.  Only took a couple minutes for a salesman to be available, once he came over we told him what we were looking for which was a newer Tahoe.  He stated that he thinks they have one, we then followed him around the dealership to find that they did not have any.  We saw a couple other cars that we were possibly interested in, we asked the salesman questions about the car and it became obvious he didn't know anything at all.  Each time he would rush to the tag on the car and quickly read the details and try and regurgitate what he read.  

At the end he asked us if we were interested and I just looked at him with a blank look because there was nothing that we found to be interested in.  If you are looking for a car and looking for professional employees with a knowledge about the vehicles, this is not the place to go to.  Majority of the employees were wearing short sleeve shirts, tattoos showing, shorts, and all around a very unprofessional look.  The prices are good and that is why I gave this place a 2 star review, but in all honesty, if you are good at haggling with a dealer I would recommend doing that because you will most likely get a salesman that knows something about the car you are purchasing.







The service manager Cameron is a nice guy but he needs to learn to work with his team to get things done by the deadline and not accuse people of getting work done to the car from a third party when I stated they were the last person that touched it after I bought it. So if you plan on getting service from them expected to be a few days late I decided to decline payment and pick it up early. they accepted to give me my oil change for free since I don't want them finishing the car







I went here last week to trade in my car and purchase a new car ... They have absolutely no idea wth they are doing - you would think that they would've trained their employees prior to opening but guess they didn't think that far ahead . End of story I went home pissed af with no new car - they made up every excuse for me not to get the car ... not happy . And will go to an actual dealer ...







This morning i came in to look at there inventory and possibly buy a car. I was stopped by a sales manager and was advised that they do not open for another 25 min. 
 I guess these guys are really motivated to sell cars. *sarcasm 

future tip. if a customer walks onto your lot 25min early let him browse, don't tell them to come back in 25 min.

Went here about 2 weeks ago with my wife because we are going to be looking for a car in the near future.  Walked in and we were greeted by someone at the desk, he signed us in to be helped by a salesman.  Only took a couple minutes for a salesman to be available, once he came over we told him what we were looking for which was a newer Tahoe.  He stated that he thinks they have one, we then followed him around the dealership to find that they did not have any.  We saw a couple other cars that we were possibly interested in, we asked the salesman questions about the car and it became obvious he didn't know anything at all.  Each time he would rush to the tag on the car and quickly read the details and try and regurgitate what he read.  At the end he asked us if we were interested and I just looked at him with a blank look because there was nothing that we found to be interested in.  If you are looking for a car and looking for professional employees with a knowledge about the vehicles, this is not the place to go to.  Majority of the employees were wearing short sleeve shirts, tattoos showing, shorts, and all around a very unprofessional look.  The prices are good and that is why I gave this place a 2 star review, but in all honesty, if you are good at haggling with a dealer I would recommend doing that because you will most likely get a salesman that knows something about the car you are purchasing.

The service manager Cameron is a nice guy but he needs to learn to work with his team to get things done by the deadline and not accuse people of getting work done to the car from a third party when I stated they were the last person that touched it after I bought it. So if you plan on getting service from them expected to be a few days late I decided to decline payment and pick it up early. they accepted to give me my oil change for free since I don't want them finishing the car

I went here last week to trade in my car and purchase a new car ... They have absolutely no idea wth they are doing - you would think that they would've trained their employees prior to opening but guess they didn't think that far ahead . End of story I went home pissed af with no new car - they made up every excuse for me not to get the car ... not happy . And will go to an actual dealer ...

This morning i came in to look at there inventory and possibly buy a car. I was stopped by a sales manager and was advised that they do not open for another 25 min.  I guess these guys are really motivated to sell cars. *sarcasm future tip. if a customer walks onto your lot 25min early let him browse, don't tell them to come back in 25 min.

The service manager Cameron is a nice guy but he needs to learn to work with his team to get things done by the deadline and not accuse people of getting work done to the car from a third party when I stated they were the last person that touched it after I bought it. So if you plan on getting service from them expected to be a few days late I decided to decline payment and pick it up early. they accepted to give me my oil change for free since I don't want them finishing the car







I went here last week to trade in my car and purchase a new car ... They have absolutely no idea wth they are doing - you would think that they would've trained their employees prior to opening but guess they didn't think that far ahead . End of story I went home pissed af with no new car - they made up every excuse for me not to get the car ... not happy . And will go to an actual dealer ...







This morning i came in to look at there inventory and possibly buy a car. I was stopped by a sales manager and was advised that they do not open for another 25 min. 
 I guess these guys are really motivated to sell cars. *sarcasm 

future tip. if a customer walks onto your lot 25min early let him browse, don't tell them to come back in 25 min.







Went here about 2 weeks ago with my wife because we are going to be looking for a car in the near future.  Walked in and we were greeted by someone at the desk, he signed us in to be helped by a salesman.  Only took a couple minutes for a salesman to be available, once he came over we told him what we were looking for which was a newer Tahoe.  He stated that he thinks they have one, we then followed him around the dealership to find that they did not have any.  We saw a couple other cars that we were possibly interested in, we asked the salesman questions about the car and it became obvious he didn't know anything at all.  Each time he would rush to the tag on the car and quickly read the details and try and regurgitate what he read.  

At the end he asked us if we were interested and I just looked at him with a blank look because there was nothing that we found to be interested in.  If you are looking for a car and looking for professional employees with a knowledge about the vehicles, this is not the place to go to.  Majority of the employees were wearing short sleeve shirts, tattoos showing, shorts, and all around a very unprofessional look.  The prices are good and that is why I gave this place a 2 star review, but in all honesty, if you are good at haggling with a dealer I would recommend doing that because you will most likely get a salesman that knows something about the car you are purchasing.







Juan and Nicole were awesome, in and out with the car we wanted in a little under 2 hours!!! My new favorite place to buy a car!







Working with Alex at this new Carmax in San Jose has been a pleasure.  We were able to get a relatively high offer on the car we wanted to sell and a good deal on the car we purchased.  We are going back tomorrow to make another deal for our other daughter.  I couldn't have hoped for a better experience!  Alex has been fantastic and the rest of the staff helpful as well!







Sold my car, the entire process was so quick, easy and transparent! I was offered almost 3k over Kelly Blue Book, and the lady who helped me, Estefanie, was absolutely amazing. She was warm, knowledgeable, and made sure to get me in and out as quickly as possible. I can't Carnac recommend highly enough, and if you can ask for Estefanie you'll be sure to have a great experience!







First went to DGDG across the street where they low balled me and couldn't even honor KBB. 

I come to carmax after booking an appointment 12 hours before arrival. Terrance Watson was the sales associate I was working with who was very honest and an outstanding guy. He was very thorough and put me in queue to get the car appraised. 
Their system averaged the number of appraisals needed and by time and gave me an ETA of 35 minutes. 
In and out, he showed me carmax's deal next to KBB.
5 minutes after that, Eric put together the dmv forms and got me my check in 15 minutes. 


The building itself is very clean. They offer coffee and water and even have a kids area. 

Total time at the shop. 1 hour and 20 minutes.... 

Service:5/5
Professionalism: 5/5







Had a wonderful experience this morning with service department. They were kind, courteous, professional and explained everything in detail. I felt very confident with their recommendations. Thank you (I hope I have his name right) J. Grnzyk

The service manager Cameron is a nice guy but he needs to learn to work with his team to get things done by the deadline and not accuse people of getting work done to the car from a third party when I stated they were the last person that touched it after I bought it. So if you plan on getting service from them expected to be a few days late I decided to decline payment and pick it up early. they accepted to give me my oil change for free since I don't want them finishing the car

I went here last week to trade in my car and purchase a new car ... They have absolutely no idea wth they are doing - you would think that they would've trained their employees prior to opening but guess they didn't think that far ahead . End of story I went home pissed af with no new car - they made up every excuse for me not to get the car ... not happy . And will go to an actual dealer ...

This morning i came in to look at there inventory and possibly buy a car. I was stopped by a sales manager and was advised that they do not open for another 25 min.  I guess these guys are really motivated to sell cars. *sarcasm future tip. if a customer walks onto your lot 25min early let him browse, don't tell them to come back in 25 min.

Went here about 2 weeks ago with my wife because we are going to be looking for a car in the near future.  Walked in and we were greeted by someone at the desk, he signed us in to be helped by a salesman.  Only took a couple minutes for a salesman to be available, once he came over we told him what we were looking for which was a newer Tahoe.  He stated that he thinks they have one, we then followed him around the dealership to find that they did not have any.  We saw a couple other cars that we were possibly interested in, we asked the salesman questions about the car and it became obvious he didn't know anything at all.  Each time he would rush to the tag on the car and quickly read the details and try and regurgitate what he read.  At the end he asked us if we were interested and I just looked at him with a blank look because there was nothing that we found to be interested in.  If you are looking for a car and looking for professional employees with a knowledge about the vehicles, this is not the place to go to.  Majority of the employees were wearing short sleeve shirts, tattoos showing, shorts, and all around a very unprofessional look.  The prices are good and that is why I gave this place a 2 star review, but in all honesty, if you are good at haggling with a dealer I would recommend doing that because you will most likely get a salesman that knows something about the car you are purchasing.

Working with Alex at this new Carmax in San Jose has been a pleasure.  We were able to get a relatively high offer on the car we wanted to sell and a good deal on the car we purchased.  We are going back tomorrow to make another deal for our other daughter.  I couldn't have hoped for a better experience!  Alex has been fantastic and the rest of the staff helpful as well!

Sold my car, the entire process was so quick, easy and transparent! I was offered almost 3k over Kelly Blue Book, and the lady who helped me, Estefanie, was absolutely amazing. She was warm, knowledgeable, and made sure to get me in and out as quickly as possible. I can't Carnac recommend highly enough, and if you can ask for Estefanie you'll be sure to have a great experience!

First went to DGDG across the street where they low balled me and couldn't even honor KBB. I come to carmax after booking an appointment 12 hours before arrival. Terrance Watson was the sales associate I was working with who was very honest and an outstanding guy. He was very thorough and put me in queue to get the car appraised. Their system averaged the number of appraisals needed and by time and gave me an ETA of 35 minutes. In and out, he showed me carmax's deal next to KBB.5 minutes after that, Eric put together the dmv forms and got me my check in 15 minutes. The building itself is very clean. They offer coffee and water and even have a kids area. Total time at the shop. 1 hour and 20 minutes.... Service:5/5Professionalism: 5/5

First went to DGDG across the street where they low balled me and couldn't even honor KBB. 

I come to carmax after booking an appointment 12 hours before arrival. Terrance Watson was the sales associate I was working with who was very honest and an outstanding guy. He was very thorough and put me in queue to get the car appraised. 
Their system averaged the number of appraisals needed and by time and gave me an ETA of 35 minutes. 
In and out, he showed me carmax's deal next to KBB.
5 minutes after that, Eric put together the dmv forms and got me my check in 15 minutes. 


The building itself is very clean. They offer coffee and water and even have a kids area. 

Total time at the shop. 1 hour and 20 minutes.... 

Service:5/5
Professionalism: 5/5







This morning i came in to look at there inventory and possibly buy a car. I was stopped by a sales manager and was advised that they do not open for another 25 min. 
 I guess these guys are really motivated to sell cars. *sarcasm 

future tip. if a customer walks onto your lot 25min early let him browse, don't tell them to come back in 25 min.







Went here about 2 weeks ago with my wife because we are going to be looking for a car in the near future.  Walked in and we were greeted by someone at the desk, he signed us in to be helped by a salesman.  Only took a couple minutes for a salesman to be available, once he came over we told him what we were looking for which was a newer Tahoe.  He stated that he thinks they have one, we then followed him around the dealership to find that they did not have any.  We saw a couple other cars that we were possibly interested in, we asked the salesman questions about the car and it became obvious he didn't know anything at all.  Each time he would rush to the tag on the car and quickly read the details and try and regurgitate what he read.  

At the end he asked us if we were interested and I just looked at him with a blank look because there was nothing that we found to be interested in.  If you are looking for a car and looking for professional employees with a knowledge about the vehicles, this is not the place to go to.  Majority of the employees were wearing short sleeve shirts, tattoos showing, shorts, and all around a very unprofessional look.  The prices are good and that is why I gave this place a 2 star review, but in all honesty, if you are good at haggling with a dealer I would recommend doing that because you will most likely get a salesman that knows something about the car you are purchasing.







I went here last week to trade in my car and purchase a new car ... They have absolutely no idea wth they are doing - you would think that they would've trained their employees prior to opening but guess they didn't think that far ahead . End of story I went home pissed af with no new car - they made up every excuse for me not to get the car ... not happy . And will go to an actual dealer ...







The service manager Cameron is a nice guy but he needs to learn to work with his team to get things done by the deadline and not accuse people of getting work done to the car from a third party when I stated they were the last person that touched it after I bought it. So if you plan on getting service from them expected to be a few days late I decided to decline payment and pick it up early. they accepted to give me my oil change for free since I don't want them finishing the car







Sold my car, the entire process was so quick, easy and transparent! I was offered almost 3k over Kelly Blue Book, and the lady who helped me, Estefanie, was absolutely amazing. She was warm, knowledgeable, and made sure to get me in and out as quickly as possible. I can't Carnac recommend highly enough, and if you can ask for Estefanie you'll be sure to have a great experience!







Had a wonderful experience this morning with service department. They were kind, courteous, professional and explained everything in detail. I felt very confident with their recommendations. Thank you (I hope I have his name right) J. Grnzyk







Working with Alex at this new Carmax in San Jose has been a pleasure.  We were able to get a relatively high offer on the car we wanted to sell and a good deal on the car we purchased.  We are going back tomorrow to make another deal for our other daughter.  I couldn't have hoped for a better experience!  Alex has been fantastic and the rest of the staff helpful as well!

First went to DGDG across the street where they low balled me and couldn't even honor KBB. 

I come to carmax after booking an appointment 12 hours before arrival. Terrance Watson was the sales associate I was working with who was very honest and an outstanding guy. He was very thorough and put me in queue to get the car appraised. 
Their system averaged the number of appraisals needed and by time and gave me an ETA of 35 minutes. 
In and out, he showed me carmax's deal next to KBB.
5 minutes after that, Eric put together the dmv forms and got me my check in 15 minutes. 


The building itself is very clean. They offer coffee and water and even have a kids area. 

Total time at the shop. 1 hour and 20 minutes.... 

Service:5/5
Professionalism: 5/5







This morning i came in to look at there inventory and possibly buy a car. I was stopped by a sales manager and was advised that they do not open for another 25 min. 
 I guess these guys are really motivated to sell cars. *sarcasm 

future tip. if a customer walks onto your lot 25min early let him browse, don't tell them to come back in 25 min.







Went here about 2 weeks ago with my wife because we are going to be looking for a car in the near future.  Walked in and we were greeted by someone at the desk, he signed us in to be helped by a salesman.  Only took a couple minutes for a salesman to be available, once he came over we told him what we were looking for which was a newer Tahoe.  He stated that he thinks they have one, we then followed him around the dealership to find that they did not have any.  We saw a couple other cars that we were possibly interested in, we asked the salesman questions about the car and it became obvious he didn't know anything at all.  Each time he would rush to the tag on the car and quickly read the details and try and regurgitate what he read.  

At the end he asked us if we were interested and I just looked at him with a blank look because there was nothing that we found to be interested in.  If you are looking for a car and looking for professional employees with a knowledge about the vehicles, this is not the place to go to.  Majority of the employees were wearing short sleeve shirts, tattoos showing, shorts, and all around a very unprofessional look.  The prices are good and that is why I gave this place a 2 star review, but in all honesty, if you are good at haggling with a dealer I would recommend doing that because you will most likely get a salesman that knows something about the car you are purchasing.







I went here last week to trade in my car and purchase a new car ... They have absolutely no idea wth they are doing - you would think that they would've trained their employees prior to opening but guess they didn't think that far ahead . End of story I went home pissed af with no new car - they made up every excuse for me not to get the car ... not happy . And will go to an actual dealer ...







The service manager Cameron is a nice guy but he needs to learn to work with his team to get things done by the deadline and not accuse people of getting work done to the car from a third party when I stated they were the last person that touched it after I bought it. So if you plan on getting service from them expected to be a few days late I decided to decline payment and pick it up early. they accepted to give me my oil change for free since I don't want them finishing the car







Juan and Nicole were awesome, in and out with the car we wanted in a little under 2 hours!!! My new favorite place to buy a car!







Sold my car, the entire process was so quick, easy and transparent! I was offered almost 3k over Kelly Blue Book, and the lady who helped me, Estefanie, was absolutely amazing. She was warm, knowledgeable, and made sure to get me in and out as quickly as possible. I can't Carnac recommend highly enough, and if you can ask for Estefanie you'll be sure to have a great experience!







Had a wonderful experience this morning with service department. They were kind, courteous, professional and explained everything in detail. I felt very confident with their recommendations. Thank you (I hope I have his name right) J. Grnzyk

Working with Alex at this new Carmax in San Jose has been a pleasure.  We were able to get a relatively high offer on the car we wanted to sell and a good deal on the car we purchased.  We are going back tomorrow to make another deal for our other daughter.  I couldn't have hoped for a better experience!  Alex has been fantastic and the rest of the staff helpful as well!

Sold my car, the entire process was so quick, easy and transparent! I was offered almost 3k over Kelly Blue Book, and the lady who helped me, Estefanie, was absolutely amazing. She was warm, knowledgeable, and made sure to get me in and out as quickly as possible. I can't Carnac recommend highly enough, and if you can ask for Estefanie you'll be sure to have a great experience!

First went to DGDG across the street where they low balled me and couldn't even honor KBB. 

I come to carmax after booking an appointment 12 hours before arrival. Terrance Watson was the sales associate I was working with who was very honest and an outstanding guy. He was very thorough and put me in queue to get the car appraised. 
Their system averaged the number of appraisals needed and by time and gave me an ETA of 35 minutes. 
In and out, he showed me carmax's deal next to KBB.
5 minutes after that, Eric put together the dmv forms and got me my check in 15 minutes. 


The building itself is very clean. They offer coffee and water and even have a kids area. 

Total time at the shop. 1 hour and 20 minutes.... 

Service:5/5
Professionalism: 5/5







This morning i came in to look at there inventory and possibly buy a car. I was stopped by a sales manager and was advised that they do not open for another 25 min. 
 I guess these guys are really motivated to sell cars. *sarcasm 

future tip. if a customer walks onto your lot 25min early let him browse, don't tell them to come back in 25 min.







Went here about 2 weeks ago with my wife because we are going to be looking for a car in the near future.  Walked in and we were greeted by someone at the desk, he signed us in to be helped by a salesman.  Only took a couple minutes for a salesman to be available, once he came over we told him what we were looking for which was a newer Tahoe.  He stated that he thinks they have one, we then followed him around the dealership to find that they did not have any.  We saw a couple other cars that we were possibly interested in, we asked the salesman questions about the car and it became obvious he didn't know anything at all.  Each time he would rush to the tag on the car and quickly read the details and try and regurgitate what he read.  

At the end he asked us if we were interested and I just looked at him with a blank look because there was nothing that we found to be interested in.  If you are looking for a car and looking for professional employees with a knowledge about the vehicles, this is not the place to go to.  Majority of the employees were wearing short sleeve shirts, tattoos showing, shorts, and all around a very unprofessional look.  The prices are good and that is why I gave this place a 2 star review, but in all honesty, if you are good at haggling with a dealer I would recommend doing that because you will most likely get a salesman that knows something about the car you are purchasing.







I went here last week to trade in my car and purchase a new car ... They have absolutely no idea wth they are doing - you would think that they would've trained their employees prior to opening but guess they didn't think that far ahead . End of story I went home pissed af with no new car - they made up every excuse for me not to get the car ... not happy . And will go to an actual dealer ...







The service manager Cameron is a nice guy but he needs to learn to work with his team to get things done by the deadline and not accuse people of getting work done to the car from a third party when I stated they were the last person that touched it after I bought it. So if you plan on getting service from them expected to be a few days late I decided to decline payment and pick it up early. they accepted to give me my oil change for free since I don't want them finishing the car







Juan and Nicole were awesome, in and out with the car we wanted in a little under 2 hours!!! My new favorite place to buy a car!







Had a wonderful experience this morning with service department. They were kind, courteous, professional and explained everything in detail. I felt very confident with their recommendations. Thank you (I hope I have his name right) J. Grnzyk







Working with Alex at this new Carmax in San Jose has been a pleasure.  We were able to get a relatively high offer on the car we wanted to sell and a good deal on the car we purchased.  We are going back tomorrow to make another deal for our other daughter.  I couldn't have hoped for a better experience!  Alex has been fantastic and the rest of the staff helpful as well!

Sold my car, the entire process was so quick, easy and transparent! I was offered almost 3k over Kelly Blue Book, and the lady who helped me, Estefanie, was absolutely amazing. She was warm, knowledgeable, and made sure to get me in and out as quickly as possible. I can't Carnac recommend highly enough, and if you can ask for Estefanie you'll be sure to have a great experience!

First went to DGDG across the street where they low balled me and couldn't even honor KBB. I come to carmax after booking an appointment 12 hours before arrival. Terrance Watson was the sales associate I was working with who was very honest and an outstanding guy. He was very thorough and put me in queue to get the car appraised. Their system averaged the number of appraisals needed and by time and gave me an ETA of 35 minutes. In and out, he showed me carmax's deal next to KBB.5 minutes after that, Eric put together the dmv forms and got me my check in 15 minutes. The building itself is very clean. They offer coffee and water and even have a kids area. Total time at the shop. 1 hour and 20 minutes.... Service:5/5Professionalism: 5/5

This morning i came in to look at there inventory and possibly buy a car. I was stopped by a sales manager and was advised that they do not open for another 25 min.  I guess these guys are really motivated to sell cars. *sarcasm future tip. if a customer walks onto your lot 25min early let him browse, don't tell them to come back in 25 min.

Went here about 2 weeks ago with my wife because we are going to be looking for a car in the near future.  Walked in and we were greeted by someone at the desk, he signed us in to be helped by a salesman.  Only took a couple minutes for a salesman to be available, once he came over we told him what we were looking for which was a newer Tahoe.  He stated that he thinks they have one, we then followed him around the dealership to find that they did not have any.  We saw a couple other cars that we were possibly interested in, we asked the salesman questions about the car and it became obvious he didn't know anything at all.  Each time he would rush to the tag on the car and quickly read the details and try and regurgitate what he read.  At the end he asked us if we were interested and I just looked at him with a blank look because there was nothing that we found to be interested in.  If you are looking for a car and looking for professional employees with a knowledge about the vehicles, this is not the place to go to.  Majority of the employees were wearing short sleeve shirts, tattoos showing, shorts, and all around a very unprofessional look.  The prices are good and that is why I gave this place a 2 star review, but in all honesty, if you are good at haggling with a dealer I would recommend doing that because you will most likely get a salesman that knows something about the car you are purchasing.

I went here last week to trade in my car and purchase a new car ... They have absolutely no idea wth they are doing - you would think that they would've trained their employees prior to opening but guess they didn't think that far ahead . End of story I went home pissed af with no new car - they made up every excuse for me not to get the car ... not happy . And will go to an actual dealer ...

The service manager Cameron is a nice guy but he needs to learn to work with his team to get things done by the deadline and not accuse people of getting work done to the car from a third party when I stated they were the last person that touched it after I bought it. So if you plan on getting service from them expected to be a few days late I decided to decline payment and pick it up early. they accepted to give me my oil change for free since I don't want them finishing the car

Working with Alex at this new Carmax in San Jose has been a pleasure.  We were able to get a relatively high offer on the car we wanted to sell and a good deal on the car we purchased.  We are going back tomorrow to make another deal for our other daughter.  I couldn't have hoped for a better experience!  Alex has been fantastic and the rest of the staff helpful as well!

First went to DGDG across the street where they low balled me and couldn't even honor KBB. 

I come to carmax after booking an appointment 12 hours before arrival. Terrance Watson was the sales associate I was working with who was very honest and an outstanding guy. He was very thorough and put me in queue to get the car appraised. 
Their system averaged the number of appraisals needed and by time and gave me an ETA of 35 minutes. 
In and out, he showed me carmax's deal next to KBB.
5 minutes after that, Eric put together the dmv forms and got me my check in 15 minutes. 


The building itself is very clean. They offer coffee and water and even have a kids area. 

Total time at the shop. 1 hour and 20 minutes.... 

Service:5/5
Professionalism: 5/5







This morning i came in to look at there inventory and possibly buy a car. I was stopped by a sales manager and was advised that they do not open for another 25 min. 
 I guess these guys are really motivated to sell cars. *sarcasm 

future tip. if a customer walks onto your lot 25min early let him browse, don't tell them to come back in 25 min.







Went here about 2 weeks ago with my wife because we are going to be looking for a car in the near future.  Walked in and we were greeted by someone at the desk, he signed us in to be helped by a salesman.  Only took a couple minutes for a salesman to be available, once he came over we told him what we were looking for which was a newer Tahoe.  He stated that he thinks they have one, we then followed him around the dealership to find that they did not have any.  We saw a couple other cars that we were possibly interested in, we asked the salesman questions about the car and it became obvious he didn't know anything at all.  Each time he would rush to the tag on the car and quickly read the details and try and regurgitate what he read.  

At the end he asked us if we were interested and I just looked at him with a blank look because there was nothing that we found to be interested in.  If you are looking for a car and looking for professional employees with a knowledge about the vehicles, this is not the place to go to.  Majority of the employees were wearing short sleeve shirts, tattoos showing, shorts, and all around a very unprofessional look.  The prices are good and that is why I gave this place a 2 star review, but in all honesty, if you are good at haggling with a dealer I would recommend doing that because you will most likely get a salesman that knows something about the car you are purchasing.







I went here last week to trade in my car and purchase a new car ... They have absolutely no idea wth they are doing - you would think that they would've trained their employees prior to opening but guess they didn't think that far ahead . End of story I went home pissed af with no new car - they made up every excuse for me not to get the car ... not happy . And will go to an actual dealer ...







The service manager Cameron is a nice guy but he needs to learn to work with his team to get things done by the deadline and not accuse people of getting work done to the car from a third party when I stated they were the last person that touched it after I bought it. So if you plan on getting service from them expected to be a few days late I decided to decline payment and pick it up early. they accepted to give me my oil change for free since I don't want them finishing the car







Juan and Nicole were awesome, in and out with the car we wanted in a little under 2 hours!!! My new favorite place to buy a car!







Sold my car, the entire process was so quick, easy and transparent! I was offered almost 3k over Kelly Blue Book, and the lady who helped me, Estefanie, was absolutely amazing. She was warm, knowledgeable, and made sure to get me in and out as quickly as possible. I can't Carnac recommend highly enough, and if you can ask for Estefanie you'll be sure to have a great experience!







Had a wonderful experience this morning with service department. They were kind, courteous, professional and explained everything in detail. I felt very confident with their recommendations. Thank you (I hope I have his name right) J. Grnzyk







Working with Alex at this new Carmax in San Jose has been a pleasure.  We were able to get a relatively high offer on the car we wanted to sell and a good deal on the car we purchased.  We are going back tomorrow to make another deal for our other daughter.  I couldn't have hoped for a better experience!  Alex has been fantastic and the rest of the staff helpful as well!

First went to DGDG across the street where they low balled me and couldn't even honor KBB. I come to carmax after booking an appointment 12 hours before arrival. Terrance Watson was the sales associate I was working with who was very honest and an outstanding guy. He was very thorough and put me in queue to get the car appraised. Their system averaged the number of appraisals needed and by time and gave me an ETA of 35 minutes. In and out, he showed me carmax's deal next to KBB.5 minutes after that, Eric put together the dmv forms and got me my check in 15 minutes. The building itself is very clean. They offer coffee and water and even have a kids area. Total time at the shop. 1 hour and 20 minutes.... Service:5/5Professionalism: 5/5

First went to DGDG across the street where they low balled me and couldn't even honor KBB. 

I come to carmax after booking an appointment 12 hours before arrival. Terrance Watson was the sales associate I was working with who was very honest and an outstanding guy. He was very thorough and put me in queue to get the car appraised. 
Their system averaged the number of appraisals needed and by time and gave me an ETA of 35 minutes. 
In and out, he showed me carmax's deal next to KBB.
5 minutes after that, Eric put together the dmv forms and got me my check in 15 minutes. 


The building itself is very clean. They offer coffee and water and even have a kids area. 

Total time at the shop. 1 hour and 20 minutes.... 

Service:5/5
Professionalism: 5/5







This morning i came in to look at there inventory and possibly buy a car. I was stopped by a sales manager and was advised that they do not open for another 25 min. 
 I guess these guys are really motivated to sell cars. *sarcasm 

future tip. if a customer walks onto your lot 25min early let him browse, don't tell them to come back in 25 min.







Went here about 2 weeks ago with my wife because we are going to be looking for a car in the near future.  Walked in and we were greeted by someone at the desk, he signed us in to be helped by a salesman.  Only took a couple minutes for a salesman to be available, once he came over we told him what we were looking for which was a newer Tahoe.  He stated that he thinks they have one, we then followed him around the dealership to find that they did not have any.  We saw a couple other cars that we were possibly interested in, we asked the salesman questions about the car and it became obvious he didn't know anything at all.  Each time he would rush to the tag on the car and quickly read the details and try and regurgitate what he read.  

At the end he asked us if we were interested and I just looked at him with a blank look because there was nothing that we found to be interested in.  If you are looking for a car and looking for professional employees with a knowledge about the vehicles, this is not the place to go to.  Majority of the employees were wearing short sleeve shirts, tattoos showing, shorts, and all around a very unprofessional look.  The prices are good and that is why I gave this place a 2 star review, but in all honesty, if you are good at haggling with a dealer I would recommend doing that because you will most likely get a salesman that knows something about the car you are purchasing.







I went here last week to trade in my car and purchase a new car ... They have absolutely no idea wth they are doing - you would think that they would've trained their employees prior to opening but guess they didn't think that far ahead . End of story I went home pissed af with no new car - they made up every excuse for me not to get the car ... not happy . And will go to an actual dealer ...







The service manager Cameron is a nice guy but he needs to learn to work with his team to get things done by the deadline and not accuse people of getting work done to the car from a third party when I stated they were the last person that touched it after I bought it. So if you plan on getting service from them expected to be a few days late I decided to decline payment and pick it up early. they accepted to give me my oil change for free since I don't want them finishing the car







Juan and Nicole were awesome, in and out with the car we wanted in a little under 2 hours!!! My new favorite place to buy a car!







Sold my car, the entire process was so quick, easy and transparent! I was offered almost 3k over Kelly Blue Book, and the lady who helped me, Estefanie, was absolutely amazing. She was warm, knowledgeable, and made sure to get me in and out as quickly as possible. I can't Carnac recommend highly enough, and if you can ask for Estefanie you'll be sure to have a great experience!







Had a wonderful experience this morning with service department. They were kind, courteous, professional and explained everything in detail. I felt very confident with their recommendations. Thank you (I hope I have his name right) J. Grnzyk







Working with Alex at this new Carmax in San Jose has been a pleasure.  We were able to get a relatively high offer on the car we wanted to sell and a good deal on the car we purchased.  We are going back tomorrow to make another deal for our other daughter.  I couldn't have hoped for a better experience!  Alex has been fantastic and the rest of the staff helpful as well!
