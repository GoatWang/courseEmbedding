                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch to Rate CSAIL 2016-C7 Commercial Mortgage Trust P-T Certificates; Presale Issued | Business Wire


























































      Fitch to Rate CSAIL 2016-C7 Commercial Mortgage Trust P-T Certificates; 
      Presale Issued
    





November 01, 2016 05:18 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on the Credit Suisse 
      Commercial Mortgage Trust 2016-C7 Pass-Through Certificates.
    


      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$40,491,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$5,938,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$15,900,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$163,000,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$246,354,000 class A-5 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$65,656,000 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$590,113,000b class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$29,746,000b class X-B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$29,746,000 class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$23,029,000ab class X-E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$9,595,000ab class X-F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$45,098,000a class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$23,029,000a class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$9,595,000a class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      The following classes are not expected to be rated:
    

      --$32,624,581ab class X-NR;
    

      --$32,624,581a class NR.
    

      a) Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      b) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Nov. 1, 2016.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 53 loans secured by 199 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of $767,627,581 as of 
      the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust by Column 
      Financial Inc., Benefit Street Partners CRE Finance LLC, and Silverpeak 
      Real Estate Finance LLC.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Fitch Leverage In-Line with Recent Transactions: The Fitch LTV and DSCR 
      are 104.7% and 1.16x, respectively, compared to the YTD averages of 
      105.8% and 1.19x. Excluding credit opinion loans and loans secured by 
      multifamily cooperative properties, Fitch's normalized LTV and DSCR are 
      109.6% and 1.11x, respectively.
    

      Above-Average Amortization: Based on the scheduled balance at maturity, 
      the pool will pay down 16.2%, which is above the YTD average of 10.3%. 
      Two loans representing 8.6% of the pool are interest-only loans, 17 
      loans representing 40.0% of the pool are partial interest-only, and the 
      remaining 35 loans (51.4% of the pool) are balloon loans with loan terms 
      of five to 10 years.
    

      Highly Correlated Pool by Property Type and Geography: The largest 
      property type concentration is retail at 40.7% of the pool, followed by 
      office at 27.7% and multifamily at 18.5%. The pool is highly 
      concentrated by geography with 30.3% of the pool in Florida. 
      Additionally, 50.5% of the pool is located in the Southeast BEA 
      Geographic region.
    

      Credit Opinion Loans: Two loans, representing 8.6% of the pool, have 
      investment-grade credit opinions. The 9 West 57th Street senior note 
      (6.5% of the pool) contributed to the trust has an investment-grade 
      credit opinion of 'AAAsf*' on a stand-alone basis. GLP Industrial 
      Portfolio Pool B (2.1% of the pool) has an investment-grade credit 
      opinion of 'A+sf*' on a stand-alone basis and 'AAAsf*' on a pooled basis.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 12.3% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to CSAIL 2016-C7 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity 
      to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a 
      further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' 
      certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, in 
      which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 10.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with due diligence information from KPMG LLP. The due 
      diligence focused on a comparison and re-computation of certain 
      characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. Fitch 
      considered this information in its analysis and the findings did not 
      have an impact on our analysis/conclusions. A copy of the ABS Due 
      Diligence Form 15-E received by Fitch in connection with this 
      transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of 
      the related rating action commentary.
    

      REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS
    

      A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and 
      enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering 
      document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by 
      accessing the appendix referenced under "Related Research" below. The 
      appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es to those Fitch 
      considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report 
      titled "Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions," dated May 31, 2016.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk,

      Fitch Rates CSAIL 2016-C7 Commercial Mortgage Trust P-T Certificates
    





November 22, 2016 04:54 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Ratings Outlooks to 
      the Credit Suisse Commercial Mortgage Trust 2016-C7 pass-through 
      certificates:
    

      --$40,491,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$9,595,000a class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Fitch does not rate the $32,624,581ab class X-NR and the $32,624,581a 
      class NR.
    

      a) Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      b) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 53 loans secured by 199 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of $767,627,581 as of 
      the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust by Column 
      Financial Inc., Benefit Street Partners CRE Finance LLC, and Silverpeak 
      Real Estate Finance LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 72.2% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 80.6%, and asset summary reviews of 100% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Fitch Leverage In-Line with Recent Transactions: The Fitch loan to value 
      (LTV) and debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) are 104.7% and 1.16x, 
      respectively, compared to the year-to-date (YTD) averages of 105.8% and 
      1.19x. Excluding credit opinion loans and loans secured by multifamily 
      cooperative properties, Fitch's normalized LTV and DSCR are 109.6% and 
      1.11x, respectively.
    

      Above-Average Amortization: Based on the scheduled balance at maturity, 
      the pool will pay down 16.2%, which is above the YTD average of 10.3%. 
      Two loans representing 8.6% of the pool are interest-only loans, 17 
      loans representing 40.0% of the pool are partial interest-only, and the 
      remaining 35 loans (51.4% of the pool) are balloon loans with loan terms 
      of five to 10 years.
    

      Highly Correlated Pool by Property Type and Geography: The largest 
      property type concentration is retail at 40.7% of the pool, followed by 
      office at 27.7% and multifamily at 18.5%. The pool is highly 
      concentrated by geography with 30.3% of the pool in Florida. 
      Additionally, 50.5% of the pool is located in the Southeast BEA 
      Geographic region.
    

      Credit Opinion Loans: Two loans, representing 8.6% of the pool, have 
      investment-grade credit opinions. The 9 West 57th Street senior note 
      (6.5% of the pool) contributed to the trust has an investment-grade 
      credit opinion of 'AAAsf*' on a stand-alone basis. GLP Industrial 
      Portfolio Pool B (2.1% of the pool) has an investment-grade credit 
      opinion of 'A+sf*' on a stand-alone basis and 'AAAsf*' on a pooled basis.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 12.3% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to CSAIL 2016-C7 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity 
      to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a 
      further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' 
      certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, in 
      which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 10.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with due diligence information from KPMG LLP. The due 
      diligence focused on a comparison and re-computation of certain 
      characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. Fitch 
      considered this information in its analysis and the findings did not 
      have an impact on our analysis/conclusions. A copy of the ABS Due 
      Diligence Form 15-E received by Fitch in connection with this 
      transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of 
      the related rating action commentary.
    

      REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS
    

      A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and 
      enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering 
      document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by 
      accessing the appendix referenced under "Related Research" below. The 
      appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es to those Fitch 
      considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report 
      titled 'Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions,' dated May 31, 2016.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or

The
Depositor hereby confirms its agreement with the Underwriter concerning the purchase and sale of the Offered Certificates, as
follows:
�
1.��������������
Registration Statement.
�
The
Depositor has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the �Commission�) in accordance
with the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively,
the �Securities Act�), a registration statement on Form SF-3 (No. 333-207361), as amended, relating to the
Offered Certificates. The Depositor also has prepared and filed with the Commission a preliminary prospectus dated November 1,
2016 (the �Preliminary Prospectus�), specifically relating to the Offered Certificates, in accordance with
Rule 424(h) and Rule 430(D) under the Securities Act. The Depositor also has filed with, or proposes to file with, the Commission
pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act a prospectus specifically relating to the Offered Certificates (the �Prospectus�).
The registration statement as amended at the time when it became effective, or, if a post-effective amendment is filed with respect
thereto, as amended by such post-effective amendment at the time of its effectiveness, is referred to in this Agreement as the
�Registration Statement.� Any reference in this Agreement to the Registration Statement used in connection
with the offering of the Offered Certificates, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include
any exhibits thereto and the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 10(d) of Form SF-3 under the Securities
Act, as of the effective date of the Registration Statement or the date of the Prospectus, as the case may be, and any reference
to �amend,� �amendment� or �supplement� with respect to the Registration Statement, the Preliminary
Prospectus and the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the date the Registration Statement
became effective, or the date of the Supplement or the Prospectus, as the case may be, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the �Exchange Act�) that
are deemed to be incorporated by reference therein.

the Securities Act) (a �Free Writing Prospectus�), and (ii) the Preliminary Prospectus. If, subsequent to the
date of this Agreement, the Depositor and the Underwriter have determined that such information included an untrue statement of
material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading and the Underwriter has terminated its old purchase contracts and entered into new
purchase contracts with investors in the Offered Certificates, then �Time of Sale Information� will refer to
the information available to investors at the time of entry into the first such new purchase contract, including any information
that corrects such material misstatements or omissions (�Corrective Information�), and �Time of Sale�

(y)�with respect to information that is also contained in or otherwise made in reliance on or in conformity with the Time
of Sale Information or the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or (z)�to the extent such losses, claims, damages
or liabilities are caused by a misstatement or omission resulting from an error or omission in the Issuer Information which was
not corrected by Corrective Information subsequently supplied by the Depositor, any Seller, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer,

Notice and Procedures. If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation),
claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person that may seek indemnification pursuant to paragraph�(a) or (b) above, such person (the �Indemnified Person�) shall promptly notify the person against whom
such
�


-23-�
�
�
indemnification
may be sought (the �Indemnifying Person�) in writing; provided that the failure to notify the Indemnifying
Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under Section�7(a) or (b) except to the extent that
it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and provided,
further, that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to
an Indemnified Person otherwise than under Section�7(a) or (b). If any such proceeding shall be brought or
asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall
retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Section�7 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall
pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person
shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified
Person unless (i)�the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii)�the
Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii)�the
Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or
in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv)�the named parties in any such proceeding (including any
impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same
counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the
Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for
the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that
all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for the Underwriter, its affiliates,
directors, officers and any control persons of the Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Underwriter and any such
separate firm for the Depositor, its directors and officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the
Depositor shall be designated in writing by the Depositor. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any
proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff,
the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement
or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying
Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel for which the Indemnifying Person is responsible under
this Section 7(d), the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written
consent if (i)�such settlement is entered into more than forty-five (45) days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of
such request and (ii)�the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request
prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the applicable Indemnified
Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have
been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x)�includes
an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability
on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding

and
(y)�does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any
Indemnified Person.

(e)������������
Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in Sections�7(a) or (b) above is unavailable
to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each
Indemnifying Person under such paragraph shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result
of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities and not otherwise covered by the indemnification provided for under such paragraph
(i)�in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Indemnifying Person on the one
hand and Indemnified Person on the other from the offering of the Offered Certificates or (ii)�if the allocation provided
by clause�(i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative
benefits referred to in clause�(i) but also the relative fault of the Indemnifying Person on the one hand and the
Indemnified Person on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Depositor on the one
hand and the Underwriter on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting
expenses) received by the Depositor from the sale of the Offered Certificates and the total fees, discounts and commissions received
by the Underwriter in connection therewith bear to the aggregate offering price of the Offered Certificates. The relative fault
of the Indemnifying Person on the one hand and the Indemnified Person on the other shall be determined by reference to, among
other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact relates to information was supplied by the Indemnifying Person or the Indemnified Person and the parties�
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
�
(f)������������
Limitation on Liability. The Depositor and the Underwriter agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution
pursuant to this Section�7 were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation or by any other method
of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph�(e) above. The amount
paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph�(e) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
Section�7, in no event shall the Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which
the total fees, discounts and commissions received by it with respect to the offering of the Offered Certificates exceeds the
amount of any damages that the Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement
or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section�11(f) of
the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
The Underwriter�s obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section�7 are several in proportion to their respective
purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.

Non-Exclusive Remedies. The remedies provided for in this Section�7 are not exclusive and shall not

The obligations of the Underwriter to purchase the Certificates on the Closing Date shall be terminable by the Underwriter

sale of any payment for the Certificates.
�

Commercial Financing
If you have never had to deal with commercial real estate financing, you may find it intimidating. That is certainly the case for most first-time commercial borrowers. Commercial real estate mortgages are quite different from their residential cousins in terms of both complexity and cost. But getting the facts before you apply for a loan should eliminate any fears about this fantastic business financing technique.

The Basics of Commercial Real Estate Financing

Commercial real estate financing is very similar to residential mortgage lending in that real property is pledged as collateral against a loan to either buy or refinance the property. A business may also borrow against the equity in property it owns, which like its residential counterpart can take the form of a business line of credit or a lump sum payment for any business purpose. Commercial real estate mortgages generally require regular payments of principal and interest -- commercial mortgage rates can be either fixed or variable -- until the loan is paid in full. Moreover, a commercial lender retains a security interest in the property throughout the loan term, with the same right to foreclose if the borrower defaults as a residential lender. 

What distinguishes commercial mortgage lending from residential lending are the characteristics of the property and the borrower. Unlike residential mortgages, which are geared toward the individual and 1-4 unit residential dwellings, commercial property financing is designed for business entities -- both for profit and not-for-profit -- to mortgage nearly any type of retail, office, industrial, multi-unit (5+) unit residential, or just about any other commercially zoned real property.

Because of these property and borrower characteristics, commercial real estate mortgages are viewed as higher risk transactions by the lending industry. The limited marketability of commercial property and higher risk of borrower default translates to less generous terms and more conservative underwriting by commercial mortgage lenders than those found in the residential arena. If a lender has to take possession of a commercial property through foreclosure, it will generally have much more difficulty selling it to recoup its money than it would a house. To compensate for the greater risk, commercial mortgage rates are substantially higher as are down payment requirements, and loan terms are shorter (typically a maximum of 25/30 years). 

Commercial mortgage lenders prefer a solid business borrower, but for newer businesses or companies that cannot meet the required financial performance standards, a personal guarantee of repayment from one or more of the firm's principals may be used to compensate. 

A final important difference between commercial real estate financing and the residential variety is that commercial real estate mortgages are more expensive to process and close. Not only are they much larger loans on average than residential mortgages, but nearly every aspect of the "due diligence" phase -- from valuation, to title, to underwriting -- is more complicated and, therefore, more costly. 

An Illustration: The "Vanilla" Commercial Mortgage Loan

To help you understand how commercial mortgage lending works in practice, here are the major characteristics of a standard "vanilla" commercial mortgage loan.

Debt Coverage Ratio

Commercial real estate financing is based primarily on the income of the property rather than the borrower. The lender will want evidence that the property will produce more than enough income to cover the mortgage payments. Generally, commercial mortgage lenders require the property to produce from 1.1 to 1.25 times the monthly mortgage payment in net rental income. For example, if the monthly mortgage payment is $2,000, the property should be producing $2,200 to $2,500 after all expenses are paid. 

Down Payment

Commercial mortgage loans typically require a borrower to put a minimum of 25% down. A higher down payment may be required for certain properties that carry greater risk, newer companies or those without a solid track record of consistent profitability.

Prepayment Penalties

Commercial real estate mortgages normally carry deescalating prepayment penalties, that is, a fee due to the lender if the loan is paid off within a certain period of time after it is made. For example, the fee might be 5% of the outstanding balance during the first year, 4% the second year, and so on, with no penalty after the fifth year. For obvious reasons, prepayment penalties are a particularly important consideration for a business that may not wish to -- or be able to -- own the property long enough to avoid them.

Although these characteristics illustrate a “standard” in commercial real estate mortgages, you can find many lenders with flexibility in any of them. Generally, deviating from a standard will entail an offsetting adjustment in others to compensate for the increased risk. For example, an up-front fee or higher interest rate might reduce or entirely eliminate a prepayment penalty, while a personal guarantee from one or more company owners might reduce the required down payment.
Where to Go For Commercial Real Estate Financing

Commercial mortgage lending is widely available throughout the U.S. The three most common sources of commercial real estate mortgages are:
1. Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities2. Regional Banks3. Private Equity Companies - i.e. Life Insurance Companies / Pension Manager / Hedge Funds4. Specialty Finance Companies - i.e. Third-Party ("Conduit") and Hard Money Lenders
Commercial Mortgage Brokers
Naturally, most business owners turn to banks -- particularly ones with whom they have established relationships -- for their commercial real estate financing. On the one hand, banks tend to offer the lowest commercial mortgage rates; on the other, they are the most rigid in their lending. Many banks will refuse loans on certain classes of property or exclude companies from specific industries. They also require more documentation and may charge higher fees than other commercial mortgage lending sources.

Conduit and hard money lenders can fund commercial mortgage loans with less documentation and more quickly than banks. Because their money comes from private sources, insurance companies, and commercial lines of credit, they can be much more flexible in their lending. You will find that hard money lenders, in particular, will loan money at lightning speed on virtually any type of property with much less stringent criteria for their borrowers -- all at a cost: Hard Money Lenders charge significantly higher mortgage rates than banks.

For larger capital needs, companies often turn to private equity companies. Private equity companies can provide critical commercial real estate financing on the total cost of a project. The equity range is the difference between the total cost of the real estate and the amount the senior lender is willing to provide -- normally no more than 75 percent of costs. So, for a $5 million project, commercial mortgage lenders would typically loan no more than $3.8 million, leaving $1.2 million in the equity range for the borrower to fund. If the borrowing entity has $200,000 in cash to put into the project, it could consider a mezzanine loan or an equity capital investment to come up with the remaining $1 million. Private Equity Companies are quite versatile and they can provide creative, flexible financing solutions, but they expect a good return on investment, so their interest rates are considerably higher than those charged by commercial lenders. Commercial mortgage brokers don't fund loans directly. Instead, a good broker will conduct a thorough assessment of your needs and research the programs offered by other commercial mortgage lending sources to find you the right mortgage solution with the most competitive rates and fees. A good commercial mortgage broker will have established relationships with many different lenders offering a wide variety of lending programs, giving you access to financing you might not be able to find on your own. As an added benefit, commercial mortgage brokers handle the tedious details of loan processing and packaging, making an otherwise complex transaction less stressful and saving you much time and energy. Using just any commercial mortgage broker could cost you either in up-front fees, a higher than market interest rate, or both. A good one, though, will orchestrate a smooth transaction with an optimal loan suited to your company's specific needs at a competitive rate.

With so many choices, it is important that you shop around, but the goal of your shopping should not be just to get the best rate. As is the case in residential mortgages, commercial mortgage rates and terms will vary from one lending source to the next. But with such a big financial commitment at stake, unless you have expertise in commercial real estate financing, you need a trusted advisor to both help you understand and to guide you through the complex process that defines a commercial mortgage loan. 

Regardless of the source you ultimately use, a little preparation before you begin your search for commercial real estate financing will go a long way towards reducing stress and assuring a good outcome.

Preparation: The Key to a Smooth Commercial Mortgage Lending Process

When you are ready to begin your search for a commercial mortgage lender, some advance preparation will serve you well. The complex nature of commercial real estate financing means you cannot expect to "rate shop" multiple lenders with a few minutes on the telephone -- at least, not with any reliability. 
Any prospective lender you contact should ask you for the following information, which is needed to give you an informed, accurate decision about your company's ability to borrow and the approximate rates and terms you can expect: 1. Year-to-date profit & loss statement and balance sheet 2. Three years business income tax returns 3. Projected cash flow for the next 36 months
4. Personal Financial Statement and Resume for the Principal5. Property information

Having these items available will not only make your task easier, it will make it more likely you receive both an accurate quote and solid feedback on your loan request. Be wary of any prospective lender who will quote rates and terms without the required information. You could be in for nasty surprises later!

Commercial real estate financing is another of the business financing power tools available to your company. Unlike other types of credit for business, which typically have less attractive terms and a relatively short repayment period, commercial mortgage loans offer an excellent means to acquire property and manage risk with long-term, asset based financing, at attractive interest rates and with favorable tax treatment.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
