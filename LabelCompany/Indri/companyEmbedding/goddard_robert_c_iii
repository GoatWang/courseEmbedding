Atlanta’s Goddard Investment Group Buys Houston Landmark

Atlanta-based Goddard Investment Group acquired Heritage Plaza, a landmark 1.15 million-square-foot office complex in downtown Houston. Headed by Atlanta real estate veteran and Post Properties Chairman Robert C. Goddard III, Goddard Investment Group purchased the 53-story office complex in Houston's "Skyline District" from an institutional investor advised by ING Clarion. The sellers were represented by Richard H. Rudd of CB Richard Ellis in Houston.  The Heritage Plaza complex includes the 53-story office tower constructed in 1986, and the Federal Land Bank Building, which was built in 1935. The complex is 45% leased, according to CoStar Group information. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed, although Goddard officials did say the company acquired the office property below replacement cost. Given the current vacancies and the planned departure of ChevronTexaco from the building later this year, the project is estimated to have sold for approximately $110 to $120 per square foot, or between $125 million and $135 million total. The addition to Goddard’s portfolio further raises the company's profile in the Houston real estate market where the firm currently owns five buildingstotaling 1.7 million square feet. In addition to Heritage Plaza, Goddard also plans to buy approximately two acres adjacent to the complex, where the firm will develop a new parking garage to increase the parking ratio to more than 2 spaces per 1,000 square feet of rentable space. "We're going to offer suburban parking ratios in downtown Houston," said Russell F.  Read, a principal at Goddard Investment Group. "That will be hard to beat."
