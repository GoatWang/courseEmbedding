History[edit]




Kronos Incorporated corporate headquarters in Chelmsford, MA


Kronos was founded in 1977 by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) alumnus Mark S. Ain.[2] Under Mark Ain's leadership, Kronos sustained one of the longest records of growth and profitability as a public company in software industry history.[3] Ain's brother, Aron Ain,[4] succeeded him as chief executive officer in 2005 with Mark Ain becoming executive chairman of the Board of Directors.[5]
Originally a manufacturer of time clocks, the majority of Kronos revenue is now derived from software and services. The company provides cloud applications[6] for workforce management and human capital management, as well as consulting, education, and support services to its customers.
In March 2007, Kronos was bought out for US$1.74 billion by the lead investor Hellman & Friedman and the secondary investor JMI Equity.[7] In 2014, private equity firms Blackstone and GIC invested in Kronos alongside Hellman & Friedman and JMI Equity. In the transaction, Kronos was valued at $4.5 billion.[*]

Kronos was founded on October 31, 1977
Delivered the world's first microprocessor-based time clock in 1979
Kronos became a publicly traded company in 1992 (NASDAQ) and went private again in 2007[7]
Delivered its first PC-based time and attendance product in 1985
Under Mark Ain's leadership, Kronos sustained one of the longest records of growth and profitability as a public company in software industry history — second only to Microsoft [3][5][7]
Kronos hit major milestone and achieved $1 billion in annual revenue in 2014.*

Acquisitions[edit]
Kronos has conducted 71 acquisitions,[8] some of the most notable including:

Ad Opt Technologies[9]
Principal Decision Systems International (PDSI)[10]
The Workforce Solutions software division of SimplexGrinnell[11]
Stromberg[12]
3i Systems[13]
SaaShr.com[14]
Unicru, Inc.[15]
SMART Computer Holdings and its Spanish affiliate SMART Human Logistics[16]
Time Link International Corporation (TimeLink)[17]
Empower Software Solutions[18]

Litigation with EEOC[edit]
The Third Circuit Court of Appeals enforced a subpoena seeking production of documents by Kronos, Inc., in an administrative charge before the EEOC alleging disability discrimination. The charge was brought by an individual job applicant against Kroger Food Co., who did not hire the job applicant and used a Kronos assessment as part of its hiring process. EEOC v. Kronos Incorporated, Civ. Act. No. 11-2834 (September 14, 2012, Third Circuit).[19]
Kronos, which was not a party to the litigation, objected to the EEOC’s subpoena on the basis that the information requested was irrelevant, and production would require Kronos to disclose protected trade secret information. While the District Court sustained nearly all of these objections, the Third Circuit found that the District Court had abused its discretion in limiting the scope of the subpoena to documents pertaining to certain of the assessment tests.
This Kronos assessment, among other things, measures five personality attributes that collectively constitute the "five factor" model: conscientiousness; agreeableness; extroversion; openness; and neuroticism.[20] The Five Factor Model is a "dimensional" model of personality. A "dimension" refers to a continuum on which an individual can have various levels of a characteristic, in contrast to the dichotomous categorical approach in which an individual does or does not possess a characteristic. In the dimensional models of personality disorders, personality disorders are classified according to which characteristics are expressed at which levels. This stands in contrast to the traditional categorical models of classification, which are based on the Boolean presence or absence of symptoms and do not take into account levels of expression of a characteristic or its underlying dimension.[citation needed]
When using selection tests, or when contracting with others to administer such tests, employers need to make sure of three things in particular: First, the tests must have been properly validated for the specific positions and purposes to be used (meaning the test or other selection device must be job-related and its results appropriate for the employer's purpose). Second, the tests must be administered without regard to race, color, national origin, sex, religion, age, disability, or any other protected characteristic. Third, the tests must be routinely reviewed to be sure that they continue to be non-discriminatory as applied and from an adverse impact standpoint.[21] Kronos contends that its assessments are compliant with all applicable requirements.

Third, the tests must be routinely reviewed to be sure that they continue to be non-discriminatory as applied and from an adverse impact standpoint.[21] Kronos contends that its assessments are compliant with all applicable requirements.

History
Founded in 1972 by aviation editor James Holahan and publisher Wilson S. Leach, The Convention News Company (now branded as AIN Publications) published its first issues of NBAA Convention News at that year’s National Business Aviation Association Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio. Today AIN still publishes NBAA Convention News but has branched into other products and other aviation sectors, making it one of the most respected aviation news sources in the world.
AIN PUBLICATIONS’ ETHICS & GOOD-PRACTICE POLICIES

Accuracy and fairness. Our articles will provide all relevant facts, explain the basis for them and give all parties concerned an opportunity to offer opinions or explanations.
We will not rely on facts reported in other publications unless we have verified them and made clear where and when they first appeared.
Headlines will not misrepresent the point of an article.
We will not change photos in a way that gives a false impression of what they show. We may make minor changes to improve the quality of reproduction. We may remove the registration number (i.e., “N number” or tail number) or other identifying markings on an aircraft in a photo upon request and we will always remove such markings if their presence could give a wrong impression (e.g., if an aircraft that had nothing to do with illegal activity is used to illustrate a story about such activity).
In some situations, such as reporting characteristics of an aircraft, the only viable information source will be the manufacturer. When it is not practical to independently verify facts, we will make the source of the information clear.
In seeking information, our staff and freelance writers will be honest about the purpose of their inquiries. When individuals or representatives of companies are unwilling or unable to comment on a situation, the resulting article will make clear that we gave them an opportunity to do so. When seeking a comment, reporters will give a deadline for responding.
When we publish allegations against or criticisms of individuals or companies, their responses will appear as closely as possible to each point made. In addition, the story will clearly describe who is making these points and what vested interest he or she may have.
Objectivity. We maintain strict separation between advertising and all editorial content. Whether or not a company is an advertiser will have no effect on whether or how we cover it in our editorial pages. Editorial considerations and readers’ needs will dictate all coverage decisions.
Content and supplements produced for and funded by advertisers will be clearly identified as such, so that there will be no doubt in the mind of a typical reader that the advertising content is not pure editorial.
Articles will not be a platform for reporters’ viewpoints. The obvious exception: opinion pieces, such as editorial commentaries, blogs and reviews of aircraft, autos, etc.
Staff writers and editors should not work for individuals or companies in the aviation industry or for other aviation magazines. (Freelance writers who work for AIN Publications may work for other publications, unless stipulated otherwise in their retainer agreement with AIN.) Moreover, AIN editors and staff and freelance writers should not directly own stock in companies they write about. However, it is acceptable for stock in these companies to be held by mutual funds in which our writers and editors invest, as shareholders in funds do not control trading of their stocks.
Prepublication drafts. We generally do not provide manuscripts to sources or article subjects in advance of publication, though we may occasionally make exceptions to this rule (e.g. if an article contains complex technical information that would benefit from external review). In these situations, however, we will typically allow someone to review only portions of an article and we will retain the right to veto any suggested changes.
Travel assistance. Accepting company hospitality or assistance with travel plans could compromise our independence. On the other hand, this is sometimes the only practical way to participate in a company briefing or other event. We may accept such assistance if it involves a group media visit or an event in which other publications and reporters are participating. We will not accept invitations to travel at the expense of a company if no other media are participating. However, there may sometimes be circumstances (such as BJT’s Getaways series and demonstrations of aircraft for pilot reports in which journalists are individually invited to fly the aircraft on different dates) where this policy is not viable. In these situations, the editors will decide whether accepting hospitality or assistance would compromise our independence.
Accountability. When we receive a complaint about an article, we will quickly review it. If we’ve erred, we will apologize to the parties concerned and, where appropriate, publish a correction or clarification.
If a company or individual writes to make a noteworthy point that contradicts an article we’ve published, we will make every effort to publish the letter. In this case, the article writer will be offered the chance to make a counter-response.
Unnamed sources. If a source asks to tell a reporter something off the record before saying it, we will treat the statement only as background information that cannot be published.
While we seek to avoid unnamed sources, there may be circumstances when a credible source does not want to be or cannot be named. In such cases, we will consider the source’s motives in making the comments and seeking anonymity. The appropriate publication editor and AIN Publications editor-in-chief, in consultation with legal counsel and others, if needed, will be the judge as to whether use of the unnamed source is in the public interest.
When we do use unnamed sources, we will make every effort to corroborate information independently. Moreover, we will give as much information as possible about their background and any vested interest they may have. Especially where sources are being critical of a third party, they must provide strong supporting evidence for such comments.
Quotes. As a general rule, direct quotations will not be edited. Especially in Q&A-formatted interviews, however, we may do minor rephrasing and tightening up of grammar to improve readability. Editing should never change the point of what someone is saying.
Reader feedback. Without contacting the writer, we may publish letters and emails that have been submitted for publication and comments that have been posted on our websites. However, whenever possible, we will contact the writer of the letter or email, to confirm that the person did, in fact, write it. If the possibility exists that a letter or email was not intended for publication, we will obtain the writer’s permission before using it. Requests by letter and email writers that their identities not be published will be subject to the same scrutiny as unnamed sources.

Meet Mark Ain


Kronos founder













"When we founded Kronos four decades ago, we had a vision of revolutionizing how organizations pay their employees. Wow – how far we have come, now with tens of thousands of organizations – and more than 40 million people using our products every day in more than 100 countries. This amazing company has far surpassed our initial vision, thanks to our incredible Kronites, customers, and partners."
Mark S. AinFounder



As the oldest of five children, parent of three, and leader of one of the largest software developers in Massachusetts for 28 years, the role of mentor has been a natural and lifelong post for Mark Ain.
The son of business-savvy parents — a self-employed father, a mother who was one of the first women to graduate from Columbia Law School, and entrepreneurial grandparents — Ain exhibited his own entrepreneurial spirit and leadership skills early in life. Growing up on Long Island, New York, Ain took an active role in raising his younger siblings.
After graduating from high school, where he was on the varsity wrestling team, captain of the math team, and passionate about photography, Ain went on to college at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he knew he would eventually start his own company, telling classmates, "I will make my own way and be successful."
In addition to a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from MIT, Ain earned a master's degree in business administration, with a concentration in organizational development and marketing, from the Simon School at the University of Rochester.
After a variety of jobs including a stint with Digital Equipment Corporation and a small market research firm, Ain grew tired of the corporate game and weary of relinquishing creative ideas only to see them not executed to their full potential. He began a quest for the right product idea to start a company. During this period, he was an independent management consultant, focused on strategic planning, product development, and market research for technology companies. It was then that the mechanical time clock came to his attention. With the idea to put a microprocessor inside a time clock, Ain set to work on a prototype.
On October 31, 1977, Kronos® was incorporated, named for the Greek word for time. In June 1978, after an initial round of angel capital funding, the company moved into an old ironworks plant in Brighton, Mass. Including the proceeds of its 1992 initial public offering, the company raised only $19 million in funding — a remarkably small amount for what is now a billion-dollar company.
Ain led Kronos from 1977-2005, to become one of the world's most successful software companies. Under Ain's leadership, Kronos sustained one of the longest records of growth and profitability in the software industry and earned the reputation as the market leader in workforce management.
Today, as a member of the Board of Directors, Ain remains involved in Kronos operations. He also serves on the board of directors of several public, private, and charitable organizations. On a personal level, Ain enjoys supporting a number of charitable organizations.
Ain's success can be credited in part to his quiet and humane management style, which is best reflected by a motto of philosopher Lao-Tzu: "A leader is best when people barely know he exists. Not so good when people obey and acclaim him. Worse when they despise him. But of a good leader who talks little, when his work is done and his aim fulfilled, they will say, 'We did it ourselves.'"
