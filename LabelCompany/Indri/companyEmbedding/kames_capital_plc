The site content may change from time to time.  Please ensure you rely on the latest literature.RISK WARNINGS - Please refer to the Full Prospectus and Key Investor Information documents.Please note the following risk warnings:
        • The past performance of an investment is not a guide to future performance. 
        • The value of investments, and the income from them, may go down as well as up and is not guaranteed so an investor may not get back the amount originally invested. Any tax reliefs mentioned are those currently available and are subject to change. 
        • If the funds hold securities denominated in a currency other than sterling, changes in exchange rates may affect the value of your investment. 
        • Where charges are taken wholly or partly out of a fund's capital, distributable income will be increased at the expense of capital which will either be eroded or future growth constrained. 
        • Any investment objective, performance benchmark and yield information will be treated as a target only and should not be considered as an assurance or guarantee of the performance of the fund or any part of it.Investment in the securities of smaller and unquoted companies can involve greater risk than is customarily associated with investment in larger, more established companies. In particular, smaller companies often have limited product lines, markets or financial resources and may be dependent for their management on a smaller number of key individuals. In addition, the market for securities in smaller companies is often less liquid than that for securities in larger companies, bringing with it potential difficulties in acquiring, valuing and disposing of such securities. Proper information for determining their value or the risks to which they are exposed may also not be available.Some funds will often carry greater risks in return for higher potential rewards. Specialist funds, which invest in specialist markets or small sectors of industry, are likely to carry higher risks than most general funds. Investment in technology related stocks can be more volatile than investment in more established companies. Above average price movements can be expected.Market Risk: The potential for change in market value of instruments due to adverse movements in equity, bond, commodity, currency and other market prices, indices or interest rates or changes in the anticipated or calculated volatility of these movements.Liquidity Risk: This includes both market liquidity risk and funding risk. Market liquidity risk is the inability to trade an instrument at the desired price due to a lack of supply or market demand. Funding risk is where a fund has insufficient cash to meets its financial obligations.Counterparty Risk: The risk that the failure of a counterparty to meet its obligations leads to a financial loss to the fund, both through loss of any monies owed to the fund by the counterparty and the cost of reinstating economic exposure in the case of counterparty default.Concentration Risk: The risk of a portfolio being too concentrated in particular positions or too exposed to certain issuers. Highly concentrated positions can exacerbate market, liquidity and counterparty risk.Absolute Return Funds: While the investment objective of absolute return funds is to achieve a positive return in all market conditions, this is not guaranteed in any way. Investment professionals must ensure that they meet their obligations in relation to their understanding of this product and the risks involved, and the extent to which this product meets the needs of their clients.As a result of money laundering regulations, we may request additional proof of identification. Further details are in our prospectuses and other constitutional documents.DocumentsInvestors should only invest in our funds on the basis of the relevant offer document; this means the prospectus, Key Investor Information document or other applicable terms and conditions.These documents are freely available by calling our investor helpdesk on + 353 1 622 4493 or in writing from Citigroup Europe plc, PO Box 11167, Cardiff Lane, Dublin 2, Ireland.Kames Capital does not warrant the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of the information and materials contained on this website and expressly disclaims liability for errors or omissions in such information and materials.For Professional Investors and those investing on behalf of an underlying investor only:We will treat you as an investor who generally invests on behalf of underling clients.

Any tax reliefs mentioned are those currently available and are subject to change. •If the funds hold securities denominated in a currency other than sterling, changes in exchange rates may affect the value of your investment. •Where charges are taken wholly or partly out of a fund's capital, distributable income will be increased at the expense of capital which will either be eroded or future growth constrained. •Any investment objective, performance benchmark and yield information will be treated as a target only and should not be considered as an assurance or guarantee of the performance of the fund or any part of it.Investment in the securities of smaller and unquoted companies can involve greater risk than is customarily associated with investment in larger, more established companies. In particular, smaller companies often have limited product lines, markets or financial resources and may be dependent for their management on a smaller number of key individuals. In addition, the market for securities in smaller companies is often less liquid than that for securities in larger companies, bringing with it potential difficulties in acquiring, valuing and disposing of such securities. Proper information for determining their value or the risks to which they are exposed may also not be available.Some funds will often carry greater risks in return for higher potential rewards. Specialist funds, which invest in specialist markets or small sectors of industry, are likely to carry higher risks than most general funds. Investment in technology related stocks can be more volatile than investment in more established companies. Above average price movements can be expected.Market Risk: The potential for change in market value of instruments due to adverse movements in equity, bond, commodity, currency and other market prices, indices or interest rates or changes in the anticipated or calculated volatility of these movements. Liquidity Risk: This includes both market liquidity risk and funding risk. Market liquidity risk is the inability to trade an instrument at the desired price due to a lack of supply or market demand. Funding risk is where a fund has insufficient cash to meets its financial obligations. Counterparty Risk: The risk that the failure of a counterparty to meet its obligations leads to a financial loss to the fund, both through loss of any monies owed to the fund by the counterparty and the cost of reinstating economic exposure in the case of counterparty default. Concentration Risk: The risk of a portfolio being too concentrated in particular positions or too exposed to certain issuers. Highly concentrated positions can exacerbate market, liquidity and counterparty risk.Absolute Return Funds: While the investment objective of absolute return funds is to achieve a positive return in all market conditions, this is not guaranteed in any way. Investment professionals must ensure that they meet their obligations in relation to their understanding of this product and the risks involved, and the extent to which this product meets the needs of their clients.

If this is the case and in accordance with the fund’s prospectus we may defer a request to switch or cash in units. Whilst property valuations are conducted by an independent expert, any such valuation is a matter of the valuer's opinion. The spread between the price to buy and sell is likely to be wider than for other less specialist funds and may vary. There is no guarantee that investments in property will increase in value or that rental growth will take place. There is a risk that a property held in the Fund’s portfolio could default on its rental payments. There is the possibility that a portion of the portfolio will be held in cash if the supply of new investment opportunities is limited which, if the situation persists, may restrict the performance of the Fund. Funds that invest mainly in one type of asset are more vulnerable to market sentiment.

The site content may change from time to time. Please ensure you rely on the latest literature.RISK WARNINGS - Please refer to the Full Prospectus and Key Investor Information documents.Please note the following risk warnings:
     - The past performance of an investment is not a guide to future performance.
     - The value of investments, and the income from them, may go down as well as up and is not guaranteed so an investor may not get back the amount originally invested. Any tax reliefs mentioned are those currently available and are subject to change.
     - If the funds hold securities denominated in a currency other than sterling, changes in exchange rates may affect the value of your investment.
     - Where charges are taken wholly or partly out of a fund's capital, distributable income will be increased at the expense of capital which will either be eroded or future growth constrained.
     - Any investment objective, performance benchmark and yield information will be treated as a target only and should not be considered as an assurance or guarantee of the performance of the fund or any part of it.
Investment in the securities of smaller and unquoted companies can involve greater risk than is customarily associated with investment in larger, more established companies. In particular, smaller companies often have limited product lines, markets or financial resources and may be dependent
        for their management on a smaller number of key individuals. In addition, the market for securities in smaller companies is often less liquid than that for securities in larger companies, bringing with it potential difficulties in acquiring, valuing and disposing of such securities. Proper information for
        determining their value or the risks to which they are exposed may also not be available.Some funds will often carry greater risks in return for higher potential rewards. Specialist funds, which invest in specialist markets or small sectors of industry, are likely to carry higher risks than most general funds. Investment in technology related stocks can be more volatile
        than investment in more established companies. Above average price movements can be expected.Market Risk: The potential for change in market value of instruments due to adverse movements in equity, bond, commodity, currency and other market prices, indices or interest rates or changes in the anticipated or calculated volatility of these movements.Liquidity Risk: This includes both market liquidity risk and funding risk. Market liquidity risk is the inability to trade an instrument at the desired price due to a lack of supply or market demand. Funding risk is where a fund has insufficient cash to meets its financial obligations.Counterparty Risk: The risk that the failure of a counterparty to meet its obligations leads to a financial loss to the fund, both through loss of any monies owed to the fund by the counterparty and the cost of reinstating economic exposure in the case of counterparty default.Concentration Risk: The risk of a portfolio being too concentrated in particular positions or too exposed to certain issuers. Highly concentrated positions can exacerbate market, liquidity and counterparty risk.Absolute Return Funds: While the investment objective of absolute return funds is to achieve a positive return in all market conditions, this is not guaranteed in any way. Investment professionals must ensure that they meet their obligations in relation to their understanding of this product
        and the risks involved, and the extent to which this product meets the needs of their clients.As a result of money laundering regulations, we may request additional proof of identification.

    Please note the following risk warnings:
     • The past performance of an investment is not a guide to future performance.     
     • The value of investments, and the income from them, may go down as well as up and is not guaranteed so an investor may not get back the amount originally invested. Any tax reliefs mentioned are those currently available and are subject to change.    
        
     • If the funds hold securities denominated in a variety of currencies, changes in exchange rates may affect the value of your investment.               
     • Where charges are taken wholly or partly out of a fund's capital, distributable income will be increased at the expense of capital which will either be eroded or future growth constrained.               
     • Any investment objective, performance benchmark and yield information will be treated as a target only and should not be considered as an assurance or guarantee of the performance of the fund or any part of it.Investment in the securities of smaller and unquoted companies can involve greater risk than is customarily associated with investment in larger, more established companies. In particular, smaller companies often have limited product lines, markets or financial resources and may be dependent for their management on a smaller number of key individuals. In addition, the market for securities in smaller companies is often less liquid than that for securities in larger companies, bringing with it potential difficulties in acquiring, valuing and disposing of such securities. Proper information for determining their value or the risks to which they are exposed may also not be available.Some funds will often carry greater risks in return for higher potential rewards. Specialist funds, which invest in specialist markets or small sectors of industry, are likely to carry higher risks than most general funds. Investment in technology related stocks can be more volatile than investment in more established companies. Above average price movements can be expected.Market Risk: The potential for change in market value of instruments due to adverse movements in equity, bond, commodity, currency and other market prices, indices or interest rates or changes in the anticipated or calculated volatility of these movements.Liquidity Risk: This includes both market liquidity risk and funding risk. Market liquidity risk is the inability to trade an instrument at the desired price due to a lack of supply or market demand. Funding risk is where a fund has insufficient cash to meets its financial obligations.Counterparty Risk: The risk that the failure of a counterparty to meet its obligations leads to a financial loss to the fund, both through loss of any monies owed to the fund by the counterparty and the cost of reinstating economic exposure in the case of counterparty default.Concentration Risk: The risk of a portfolio being too concentrated in particular positions or too exposed to certain issuers. Highly concentrated positions can exacerbate market, liquidity and counterparty risk.Absolute Return Funds: While the investment objective of absolute return funds is to achieve a positive return in all market conditions, this is not guaranteed in any way. Investment professionals must ensure that they meet their obligations in relation to their understanding of this product and the risks involved, and the extent to which this product meets the needs of their clients.As a result of money laundering regulations, we may request additional proof of identification. Further details are in our prospectuses and other constitutional documents.We reserve the right to change the pricing basis of the funds and any change will mean an increase or decrease in the price at which you may deal.References to tax are based on current regulations which may be subject to change. For clarification please seek advice from your financial or tax adviser.

The site content may change from time to time.  Please ensure you rely on the latest literature.RISK WARNINGS - Please refer to the Full Prospectus and Key Investor Information documents.Please note the following risk warnings:
        • The past performance of an investment is not a guide to future performance. 
        • The value of investments, and the income from them, may go down as well as up and is not guaranteed so an investor may not get back the amount originally invested. Any tax reliefs mentioned are those currently available and are subject to change. 
        • If the funds hold securities denominated in a currency other than sterling, changes in exchange rates may affect the value of your investment. 
        • Where charges are taken wholly or partly out of a fund's capital, distributable income will be increased at the expense of capital which will either be eroded or future growth constrained. 
        • Any investment objective, performance benchmark and yield information will be treated as a target only and should not be considered as an assurance or guarantee of the performance of the fund or any part of it.Investment in the securities of smaller and unquoted companies can involve greater risk than is customarily associated with investment in larger, more established companies. In particular, smaller companies often have limited product lines, markets or financial resources and may be dependent for their management on a smaller number of key individuals. In addition, the market for securities in smaller companies is often less liquid than that for securities in larger companies, bringing with it potential difficulties in acquiring, valuing and disposing of such securities. Proper information for determining their value or the risks to which they are exposed may also not be available.Some funds will often carry greater risks in return for higher potential rewards. Specialist funds, which invest in specialist markets or small sectors of industry, are likely to carry higher risks than most general funds. Investment in technology related stocks can be more volatile than investment in more established companies. Above average price movements can be expected.Market Risk: The potential for change in market value of instruments due to adverse movements in equity, bond, commodity, currency and other market prices, indices or interest rates or changes in the anticipated or calculated volatility of these movements.Liquidity Risk: This includes both market liquidity risk and funding risk. Market liquidity risk is the inability to trade an instrument at the desired price due to a lack of supply or market demand. Funding risk is where a fund has insufficient cash to meets its financial obligations.Counterparty Risk: The risk that the failure of a counterparty to meet its obligations leads to a financial loss to the fund, both through loss of any monies owed to the fund by the counterparty and the cost of reinstating economic exposure in the case of counterparty default.Concentration Risk: The risk of a portfolio being too concentrated in particular positions or too exposed to certain issuers. Highly concentrated positions can exacerbate market, liquidity and counterparty risk.Absolute Return Funds: While the investment objective of absolute return funds is to achieve a positive return in all market conditions, this is not guaranteed in any way. Investment professionals must ensure that they meet their obligations in relation to their understanding of this product and the risks involved, and the extent to which this product meets the needs of their clients.As a result of money laundering regulations, we may request additional proof of identification. Further details are in our prospectuses and other constitutional documents.DocumentsInvestors should only invest in our funds on the basis of the relevant offer document; this means the prospectus, Key Investor Information document or other applicable terms and conditions.These documents are freely available by calling our investor helpdesk on + 353 1 622 4493 or in writing from Citigroup Europe plc, PO Box 11167, Cardiff Lane, Dublin 2, Ireland.Kames Capital does not warrant the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of the information and materials contained on this website and expressly disclaims liability for errors or omissions in such information and materials.For Professional Investors and those investing on behalf of an underlying investor only:We will treat you as an investor who generally invests on behalf of underling clients.  It is your responsibility to provide the most recent Key Investor Information (KII) to the underlying client for each investment you make on their behalf.  If you invest on your own behalf, you should ensure you access and review the KII, or request that we send it to you, before investing.  By placing any future investment with us, you will be taken to have agreed to this approach to provision of our KII.  All of our up-to-date KII are available from

Any tax reliefs mentioned are those currently available and are subject to change. •If the funds hold securities denominated in a currency other than sterling, changes in exchange rates may affect the value of your investment. •Where charges are taken wholly or partly out of a fund's capital, distributable income will be increased at the expense of capital which will either be eroded or future growth constrained. •Any investment objective, performance benchmark and yield information will be treated as a target only and should not be considered as an assurance or guarantee of the performance of the fund or any part of it.Investment in the securities of smaller and unquoted companies can involve greater risk than is customarily associated with investment in larger, more established companies. In particular, smaller companies often have limited product lines, markets or financial resources and may be dependent for their management on a smaller number of key individuals. In addition, the market for securities in smaller companies is often less liquid than that for securities in larger companies, bringing with it potential difficulties in acquiring, valuing and disposing of such securities. Proper information for determining their value or the risks to which they are exposed may also not be available.Some funds will often carry greater risks in return for higher potential rewards. Specialist funds, which invest in specialist markets or small sectors of industry, are likely to carry higher risks than most general funds. Investment in technology related stocks can be more volatile than investment in more established companies. Above average price movements can be expected.Market Risk: The potential for change in market value of instruments due to adverse movements in equity, bond, commodity, currency and other market prices, indices or interest rates or changes in the anticipated or calculated volatility of these movements. Liquidity Risk: This includes both market liquidity risk and funding risk. Market liquidity risk is the inability to trade an instrument at the desired price due to a lack of supply or market demand. Funding risk is where a fund has insufficient cash to meets its financial obligations. Counterparty Risk: The risk that the failure of a counterparty to meet its obligations leads to a financial loss to the fund, both through loss of any monies owed to the fund by the counterparty and the cost of reinstating economic exposure in the case of counterparty default. Concentration Risk: The risk of a portfolio being too concentrated in particular positions or too exposed to certain issuers. Highly concentrated positions can exacerbate market, liquidity and counterparty risk.Absolute Return Funds: While the investment objective of absolute return funds is to achieve a positive return in all market conditions, this is not guaranteed in any way. Investment professionals must ensure that they meet their obligations in relation to their understanding of this product and the risks involved, and the extent to which this product meets the needs of their clients.

If this is the case and in accordance with the fund’s prospectus we may defer a request to switch or cash in units. Whilst property valuations are conducted by an independent expert, any such valuation is a matter of the valuer's opinion. The spread between the price to buy and sell is likely to be wider than for other less specialist funds and may vary. There is no guarantee that investments in property will increase in value or that rental growth will take place. There is a risk that a property held in the Fund’s portfolio could default on its rental payments. There is the possibility that a portion of the portfolio will be held in cash if the supply of new investment opportunities is limited which, if the situation persists, may restrict the performance of the Fund. Funds that invest mainly in one type of asset are more vulnerable to market sentiment. We reserve the right to change the pricing basis of the funds and any change will mean an increase or decrease in the price at which you may deal. References to tax are based on current regulations which may be subject to change. For clarification please seek advice from your financial or tax adviser.Kames Capital is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.

Funding risk is where a fund has insufficient cash to meets its financial obligations. Counterparty Risk: The risk that the failure of a counterparty to meet its obligations leads to a financial loss to the fund, both through loss of any monies owed to the fund by the counterparty and the cost of reinstating economic exposure in the case of counterparty default. Concentration Risk: The risk of a portfolio being too concentrated in particular positions or too exposed to certain issuers. Highly concentrated positions can exacerbate market, liquidity and counterparty risk.Absolute Return Funds: While the investment objective of absolute return funds is to achieve a positive return in all market conditions, this is not guaranteed in any way. Investment professionals must ensure that they meet their obligations in relation to their understanding of this product and the risks involved, and the extent to which this product meets the needs of their clients. Property Income Fund: Where funds are invested in property or indirectly into property, investors may not be able to switch or cash in their investment when they want because investments in direct property and indirect property in the fund may not always be readily realisable. If this is the case and in accordance with the fund’s prospectus we may defer a request to switch or cash in units. Whilst property valuations are conducted by an independent expert, any such valuation is a matter of the valuer's opinion. The spread between the price to buy and sell is likely to be wider than for other less specialist funds and may vary. There is no guarantee that investments in property will increase in value or that rental growth will take place. There is a risk that a property held in the Fund’s portfolio could default on its rental payments. There is the possibility that a portion of the portfolio will be held in cash if the supply of new investment opportunities is limited which, if the situation persists, may restrict the performance of the Fund. Funds that invest mainly in one type of asset are more vulnerable to market sentiment. We reserve the right to change the pricing basis of the funds and any change will mean an increase or decrease in the price at which you may deal. References to tax are based on current regulations which may be subject to change. For clarification please seek advice from your financial or tax adviser.For Professional Investors and those investing on behalf of an underlying investor only:We will treat you as an investor who generally invests on behalf of underling clients.  It is your responsibility to provide the most recent Key Investor Information (KII) to the underlying client for each investment you make on their behalf.  If you invest on your own behalf, you should ensure you access and review the KII, or request that we send it to you, before investing.  By placing any future investment with us, you will be taken to have agreed to this approach to provision of our KII.  All of our up-to-date KII will be available from www.kamescapital.com.Kames Capital is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.

     - The past performance of an investment is not a guide to future performance.
     - The value of investments, and the income from them, may go down as well as up and is not guaranteed so an investor may not get back the amount originally invested. Any tax reliefs mentioned are those currently available and are subject to change.
     - If the funds hold securities denominated in a currency other than sterling, changes in exchange rates may affect the value of your investment.
     - Where charges are taken wholly or partly out of a fund's capital, distributable income will be increased at the expense of capital which will either be eroded or future growth constrained.
     - Any investment objective, performance benchmark and yield information will be treated as a target only and should not be considered as an assurance or guarantee of the performance of the fund or any part of it.
Investment in the securities of smaller and unquoted companies can involve greater risk than is customarily associated with investment in larger, more established companies. In particular, smaller companies often have limited product lines, markets or financial resources and may be dependent
        for their management on a smaller number of key individuals. In addition, the market for securities in smaller companies is often less liquid than that for securities in larger companies, bringing with it potential difficulties in acquiring, valuing and disposing of such securities. Proper information for
        determining their value or the risks to which they are exposed may also not be available.Some funds will often carry greater risks in return for higher potential rewards. Specialist funds, which invest in specialist markets or small sectors of industry, are likely to carry higher risks than most general funds. Investment in technology related stocks can be more volatile
        than investment in more established companies. Above average price movements can be expected.Market Risk: The potential for change in market value of instruments due to adverse movements in equity, bond, commodity, currency and other market prices, indices or interest rates or changes in the anticipated or calculated volatility of these movements.Liquidity Risk: This includes both market liquidity risk and funding risk.

    • If the funds hold securities denominated in a currency other than sterling, changes in exchange rates may affect the value of your investment.           
    • Where charges are taken wholly or partly out of a fund's capital, distributable income will be increased at the expense of capital which will either be eroded or future growth constrained.           
    • Any investment objective, performance benchmark and yield information will be treated as a target only and should not be considered as an assurance or guarantee of the performance of the fund or any part of it.Investment in the securities of smaller and unquoted companies can involve greater risk than is customarily associated with investment in larger, more established companies. In particular, smaller companies often have limited product lines, markets or financial resources and may be dependent for their management on a smaller number of key individuals. In addition, the market for securities in smaller companies is often less liquid than that for securities in larger companies, bringing with it potential difficulties in acquiring, valuing and disposing of such securities. Proper information for determining their value or the risks to which they are exposed may also not be available.Some funds will often carry greater risks in return for higher potential rewards. Specialist funds, which invest in specialist markets or small sectors of industry, are likely to carry higher risks than most general funds. Investment in technology related stocks can be more volatile than investment in more established companies. Above average price movements can be expected.Market Risk: The potential for change in market value of instruments due to adverse movements in equity, bond, commodity, currency and other market prices, indices or interest rates or changes in the anticipated or calculated volatility of these movements.Liquidity Risk: This includes both market liquidity risk and funding risk. Market liquidity risk is the inability to trade an instrument at the desired price due to a lack of supply or market demand. Funding risk is where a fund has insufficient cash to meets its financial obligations.Counterparty Risk: The risk that the failure of a counterparty to meet its obligations leads to a financial loss to the fund, both through loss of any monies owed to the fund by the counterparty and the cost of reinstating economic exposure in the case of counterparty default.Concentration Risk: The risk of a portfolio being too concentrated in particular positions or too exposed to certain issuers. Highly concentrated positions can exacerbate market, liquidity and counterparty risk.Absolute Return Funds: While the investment objective of absolute return funds is to achieve a positive return in all market conditions, this is not guaranteed in any way. Investment professionals must ensure that they meet their obligations in relation to their understanding of this product and the risks involved, and the extent to which this product meets the needs of their clients.As a result of money laundering regulations, we may request additional proof of identification.

The site content may change from time to time.  Please ensure you rely on the latest literature.RISK WARNINGS - Please refer to the Full Prospectus and Key Investor Information documents.Please note the following risk warnings:
        • The past performance of an investment is not a guide to future performance. 
        • The value of investments, and the income from them, may go down as well as up and is not guaranteed so an investor may not get back the amount originally invested. Any tax reliefs mentioned are those currently available and are subject to change. 
        • If the funds hold securities denominated in a currency other than sterling, changes in exchange rates may affect the value of your investment. 
        • Where charges are taken wholly or partly out of a fund's capital, distributable income will be increased at the expense of capital which will either be eroded or future growth constrained. 
        • Any investment objective, performance benchmark and yield information will be treated as a target only and should not be considered as an assurance or guarantee of the performance of the fund or any part of it.Investment in the securities of smaller and unquoted companies can involve greater risk than is customarily associated with investment in larger, more established companies. In particular, smaller companies often have limited product lines, markets or financial resources and may be dependent for their management on a smaller number of key individuals. In addition, the market for securities in smaller companies is often less liquid than that for securities in larger companies, bringing with it potential difficulties in acquiring, valuing and disposing of such securities. Proper information for determining their value or the risks to which they are exposed may also not be available.Some funds will often carry greater risks in return for higher potential rewards. Specialist funds, which invest in specialist markets or small sectors of industry, are likely to carry higher risks than most general funds. Investment in technology related stocks can be more volatile than investment in more established companies.

If this is the case and in accordance with the fund’s prospectus we may defer a request to switch or cash in units. Whilst property valuations are conducted by an independent expert, any such valuation is a matter of the valuer's opinion. The spread between the price to buy and sell is likely to be wider than for other less specialist funds and may vary. There is no guarantee that investments in property will increase in value or that rental growth will take place. There is a risk that a property held in the Fund’s portfolio could default on its rental payments. There is the possibility that a portion of the portfolio will be held in cash if the supply of new investment opportunities is limited which, if the situation persists, may restrict the performance of the Fund. Funds that invest mainly in one type of asset are more vulnerable to market sentiment. We reserve the right to change the pricing basis of the funds and any change will mean an increase or decrease in the price at which you may deal. References to tax are based on current regulations which may be subject to change. For clarification please seek advice from your financial or tax adviser.Kames Capital is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.

Any tax reliefs mentioned are those currently available and are subject to change. •If the funds hold securities denominated in a currency other than sterling, changes in exchange rates may affect the value of your investment. •Where charges are taken wholly or partly out of a fund's capital, distributable income will be increased at the expense of capital which will either be eroded or future growth constrained. •Any investment objective, performance benchmark and yield information will be treated as a target only and should not be considered as an assurance or guarantee of the performance of the fund or any part of it.Investment in the securities of smaller and unquoted companies can involve greater risk than is customarily associated with investment in larger, more established companies. In particular, smaller companies often have limited product lines, markets or financial resources and may be dependent for their management on a smaller number of key individuals. In addition, the market for securities in smaller companies is often less liquid than that for securities in larger companies, bringing with it potential difficulties in acquiring, valuing and disposing of such securities. Proper information for determining their value or the risks to which they are exposed may also not be available.Some funds will often carry greater risks in return for higher potential rewards. Specialist funds, which invest in specialist markets or small sectors of industry, are likely to carry higher risks than most general funds. Investment in technology related stocks can be more volatile than investment in more established companies. Above average price movements can be expected.Market Risk: The potential for change in market value of instruments due to adverse movements in equity, bond, commodity, currency and other market prices, indices or interest rates or changes in the anticipated or calculated volatility of these movements. Liquidity Risk: This includes both market liquidity risk and funding risk. Market liquidity risk is the inability to trade an instrument at the desired price due to a lack of supply or market demand. Funding risk is where a fund has insufficient cash to meets its financial obligations. Counterparty Risk: The risk that the failure of a counterparty to meet its obligations leads to a financial loss to the fund, both through loss of any monies owed to the fund by the counterparty and the cost of reinstating economic exposure in the case of counterparty default. Concentration Risk: The risk of a portfolio being too concentrated in particular positions or too exposed to certain issuers. Highly concentrated positions can exacerbate market, liquidity and counterparty risk.Absolute Return Funds: While the investment objective of absolute return funds is to achieve a positive return in all market conditions, this is not guaranteed in any way. Investment professionals must ensure that they meet their obligations in relation to their understanding of this product and the risks involved, and the extent to which this product meets the needs of their clients. Property Income Fund: Where funds are invested in property or indirectly into property, investors may not be able to switch or cash in their investment when they want because investments in direct property and indirect property in the fund may not always be readily realisable. If this is the case and in accordance with the fund’s prospectus we may defer a request to switch or cash in units. Whilst property valuations are conducted by an independent expert, any such valuation is a matter of the valuer's opinion. The spread between the price to buy and sell is likely to be wider than for other less specialist funds and may vary. There is no guarantee that investments in property will increase in value or that rental growth will take place. There is a risk that a property held in the Fund’s portfolio could default on its rental payments. There is the possibility that a portion of the portfolio will be held in cash if the supply of new investment opportunities is limited which, if the situation persists, may restrict the performance of the Fund. Funds that invest mainly in one type of asset are more vulnerable to market sentiment. We reserve the right to change the pricing basis of the funds and any change will mean an increase or decrease in the price at which you may deal. References to tax are based on current regulations which may be subject to change. For clarification please seek advice from your financial or tax adviser.For Professional Investors and those investing on behalf of an underlying investor only:We will treat you as an investor who generally invests on behalf of underling clients.  It is your responsibility to provide the most recent Key Investor Information (KII) to the underlying client for each investment you make on their behalf.  If you invest on your own behalf, you should ensure you access and review the KII, or request that we send it to you, before investing.  By placing any future investment with us, you will be taken to have agreed to this approach to provision of our KII.  All of our up-to-date KII will be available from www.kamescapital.com.Kames Capital is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.

    • The past performance of an investment is not a guide to future performance.           
    • The value of investments, and the income from them, may go down as well as up and is not guaranteed so an investor may not get back the amount originally invested. Any tax reliefs mentioned are those currently available and are subject to change. 
                 
    • If the funds hold securities denominated in a currency other than sterling, changes in exchange rates may affect the value of your investment.           
    • Where charges are taken wholly or partly out of a fund's capital, distributable income will be increased at the expense of capital which will either be eroded or future growth constrained.           
    • Any investment objective, performance benchmark and yield information will be treated as a target only and should not be considered as an assurance or guarantee of the performance of the fund or any part of it.Investment in the securities of smaller and unquoted companies can involve greater risk than is customarily associated with investment in larger, more established companies. In particular, smaller companies often have limited product lines, markets or financial resources and may be dependent for their management on a smaller number of key individuals. In addition, the market for securities in smaller companies is often less liquid than that for securities in larger companies, bringing with it potential difficulties in acquiring, valuing and disposing of such securities. Proper information for determining their value or the risks to which they are exposed may also not be available.Some funds will often carry greater risks in return for higher potential rewards. Specialist funds, which invest in specialist markets or small sectors of industry, are likely to carry higher risks than most general funds. Investment in technology related stocks can be more volatile than investment in more established companies. Above average price movements can be expected.Market Risk: The potential for change in market value of instruments due to adverse movements in equity, bond, commodity, currency and other market prices, indices or interest rates or changes in the anticipated or calculated volatility of these movements.Liquidity Risk: This includes both market liquidity risk and funding risk. Market liquidity risk is the inability to trade an instrument at the desired price due to a lack of supply or market demand. Funding risk is where a fund has insufficient cash to meets its financial obligations.Counterparty Risk: The risk that the failure of a counterparty to meet its obligations leads to a financial loss to the fund, both through loss of any monies owed to the fund by the counterparty and the cost of reinstating economic exposure in the case of counterparty default.Concentration Risk: The risk of a portfolio being too concentrated in particular positions or too exposed to certain issuers. Highly concentrated positions can exacerbate market, liquidity and counterparty risk.Absolute Return Funds: While the investment objective of absolute return funds is to achieve a positive return in all market conditions, this is not guaranteed in any way. Investment professionals must ensure that they meet their obligations in relation to their understanding of this product and the risks involved, and the extent to which this product meets the needs of their clients.As a result of money laundering regulations, we may request additional proof of identification.

ITT Inc. (NYSE:ITT) Upgraded by Zacks Investment Research to Buy

Posted by Toi Williams on Jul 18th, 2017 // No Comments 

ITT Inc. (NYSE:ITT) was upgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “hold” rating to a “buy” rating in a research note issued on Tuesday. The firm currently has a $46.00 price objective on the conglomerate’s stock. Zacks Investment Research‘s price objective would suggest a potential upside of 11.00% from the company’s previous close. 
According to Zacks, “ITT Inc. has a robust earnings surprise history, having beaten estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters. The company’s focus on business streamlining, cost controls and efficiency continues to prove beneficial to its financial performance. ITT Inc.’s diversified operations across key end markets adds to its strength. The company’s bottom line is expected to benefit from improved operating efficiency and successful cost containment actions. Further, ITT Inc.’s shares have outperformed the Zacks categorized Diversified Operations industry average over the past year. ITT Inc. has achieved operational excellence through its Lean Six Sigma program, restructuring initiatives and global sourcing efforts. However, softness in industrial, oil & gas markets and aerospace and defense business is expected to affect client spending adversely, thus restricting the company’s growth to a great extent.”
