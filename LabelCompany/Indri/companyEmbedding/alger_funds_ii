RISK/RETURN SUMMARY:
INVESTMENTS, RISKS & PERFORMANCE 
INVESTMENTS
Spectra Alchemy Fund 
GOAL: The Fund seeks
long-term capital appreciation. 
APPROACH: Under normal circumstances, the Fund invests at
least 80% of its net assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in
equity securities. The Fund may invest in companies of any market
capitalization, from larger, well-established companies to small, emerging
growth companies. The Fund's benchmark is the Russell 3000�
Growth Index, which is an index of common stocks designed to track performance
of companies with greater than average growth orientation in general. 
The equity research analysts of the Fund's Manager, Fred Alger
Management, Inc. (the "Manager" or "Alger Management"), select investments for
the Fund that represent certain investment ideas in all market capitalizations, styles
and geographies. Although the analysts may find investment ideas anywhere in the
world, the analysts may emphasize investments in securities of U.S. issuers.
Each analyst will be allocated a percentage of the Fund's total assets and will
have such allocation rebalanced on a periodic basis�at least
annually�by the Fund's Chief Investment Officer (the "CIO"). Each analyst
will, in managing his or her portion of the Fund's portfolio, be subject to
certain diversification requirements as determined by the CIO. 
The Fund invests primarily in equity securities, such as common
or preferred stocks, which are listed on U.S. exchanges or in the
over-the-counter market. The Fund invests primarily in "growth" stocks. The
Manager (and, when providing services under the Administration Agreement
referred to below, the Funds' Administrator), believes that these companies tend
to fall into one of two categories: 


�
High Unit Volume Growth

Vital, creative companies which offer goods or services to a rapidly-expanding
marketplace. They include both established and emerging firms, offering new or
improved products, or firms simply fulfilling an increased demand for an
existing line.






�
Positive Life Cycle Change

Companies experiencing a major change which is expected to produce advantageous
results. These changes may be as varied as new management, products or
technologies; restructuring or reorganization; or merger and acquisition.



The Fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in securities of
companies whose principal business activities are located in emerging market
countries, although the allocation of the Fund's assets to emerging market
countries will vary from time to time. 
The Fund may, but is not required to, use derivatives, such as
futures, options and forward contracts, as a substitute for investing directly
in an underlying asset, to increase returns, to manage foreign currency risk, or
as part of a hedging strategy. 
The Fund can leverage, that is, borrow money to buy additional
securities. By borrowing money, the Fund has the potential to increase its
returns if the increase in the value of the securities purchased exceeds the
cost of borrowing, including interest paid on the money borrowed. 
Spectra International Opportunities Fund 
GOAL: The Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation.

APPROACH: Under normal circumstances, the Fund invests at
least 80% of its net assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in
equity securities, including common stocks, American Depositary Receipts and
Global Depositary Receipts, of foreign companies. Foreign companies are
companies (i) that are organized under the laws of a foreign country; (ii) whose
principal trading market is in a foreign country; or (iii) that have a majority
of their assets, or that derive a significant portion of their revenue or
profits from businesses, investments or sales, outside the United States.

The Fund generally invests in at least three foreign countries,
and, at times, may invest a substantial portion of its assets in a single
foreign country. The Fund may invest in companies of any market capitalization,
from larger, well-established companies to small, emerging growth companies. The
Fund's benchmark is the Morgan Stanley Capital International
(MSCI�) Europe, Australasia and Far East (EAFE�)
Index, which is an unmanaged, market capitalization-weighted index that is
designed to measure the performance of publicly traded stocks issued by
companies in developed markets, excluding the United States and Canada. While
the MSCI EAFE Index excludes stocks of Canadian companies, the Fund may invest
in such stocks. 
The Fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in securities of
companies whose principal business activities are located in emerging market
countries, although the allocation of the Fund's assets to emerging market
countries will vary from time to time. 
The Manager seeks investment opportunities in companies with
fundamental strengths that indicate the potential for sustainable growth. The
Manager focuses on individual stock selection, building the Fund's portfolio
from the bottom up through extensive fundamental research. The Fund invests
primarily in "growth" stocks. The Manager believes that these companies tend to
fall into one of two categories:


�
High Unit Volume Growth

Vital,
creative companies which offer goods or services to a rapidly-expanding marketplace. They
include both established and emerging firms, offering new or improved products, or firms
simply fulfilling an increased demand for an existing line.






�
Positive Life Cycle Change



Companies experiencing a major change which is expected to
produce advantageous results. These changes may be as varied as new management,
products or technologies; restructuring or reorganization; or merger and
acquisition. 
The Fund may, but is not required to, use derivatives, such as
futures, options and forward contracts, as a substitute for investing directly
in an underlying asset, to increase returns, to manage foreign currency risk, or
as part of a hedging strategy. 
The Fund can leverage, that is, borrow money to buy additional securities.
By borrowing money, the Fund has the potential to increase its returns if the increase in
the value of the securities purchased exceeds the cost of borrowing, including interest
paid on the money borrowed. 
RISKS 
The Funds may appeal to investors who seek long-term capital
appreciation while understanding that there are risks to principal associated
with investing in growth equity portfolios. As with any fund that invests in
stocks, your investment may fluctuate in value and the loss of your investment
is a risk of investing. A Fund's price per share will fluctuate due to
changes in the market prices of its investments. An investment in a Fund may not
grow as fast as the rate of inflation. Additionally, stocks tend to be more
volatile than some other investments you could make, such as bonds. 
Prices of growth stocks tend to be higher in relation to their
companies' earnings and may be more sensitive to market, political and
economic developments than other stocks, making their prices more volatile.
Based on each Fund's investment style and objective, an investment in the
Fund may be better suited to investors who seek long-term capital growth and can
tolerate fluctuations in their investment's value. 
Trading in growth stocks may be relatively short-term, meaning a
Fund may buy a security and sell it a short time later if it is believed that an
alternative investment may provide greater future growth. This activity may
create higher transaction costs due to commissions and other expenses and
thereby adversely affect Fund performance. In addition, a high level of
short-term trading may increase the Fund's realized gains, thereby
increasing the amount that must be distributed to shareholders at the end of the
year. 
Investing in companies of all capitalizations involves the risk
that smaller issuers in which the Funds invest may have limited product lines or
financial resources or lack management depth. The Funds' investments in
small cap stocks are subject to the possibility that it may be difficult or
impossible to liquidate a security position at a time and price acceptable to a
Fund owing to the potentially less frequent trading of stocks of smaller market
capitalization companies. 
A Fund's performance will be influenced by political,
social and economic factors affecting investments in foreign companies. Special
risks associated with investments in foreign companies include exposure to
currency fluctuations, less liquidity, less developed or less efficient trading
markets, lack of comprehensive company information, political instability and
differing auditing and legal standards. 
The securities of issuers located in emerging markets can be
more volatile and less liquid than those of issuers in more mature economies.
Investing in emerging markets involves higher levels of risk, including
increased currency, information, liquidity, market, political and valuation
risks. Deficiencies in regulatory oversight, market infrastructure, shareholder
protections and company laws could expose the Fund to operational and other
risks as well. Some countries may have restrictions that could limit the Fund's
access to attractive opportunities. Additionally, emerging markets often face
serious economic problems (such as high external debt, inflation and
unemployment) that could subject the Fund to increased volatility or substantial
declines in value. 
Investments in foreign currencies are subject to the risk that
those currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar, or, in the
case of hedged positions, that the U.S. dollar will decline relative to the
currency being hedged. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate
significantly over short periods of time. A decline in the value of foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will reduce the value of securities held
by a Fund and denominated in those currencies. Foreign currencies also are
subject to risks caused by inflation, interest rates, budget deficits and low
savings rates, political factors and government controls. 
The use of leverage, such as engaging in reverse repurchase
agreements, lending portfolio securities and engaging in forward commitment
transactions, may magnify a Fund's gains or losses. 
If the Manager incorrectly predicts the price movement of a
security or market, an option held by a Fund may expire unexercised and the Fund
will lose the premium it paid for the option, or the Fund as the writer of an
option may be required to purchase or sell the optioned security at a
disadvantageous price or settle an index option at a loss. Also, an imperfect
correlation between a hedge and the securities hedged may render the hedge
partially ineffective. 
The Funds may use derivative instruments, such as options,
futures and options on futures (including those relating to stocks, indexes and
foreign currencies), and forward contracts. A small investment in derivatives
could have a potentially large impact on a Fund's performance. The use of
derivatives involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks
associated with investing directly in the underlying assets. Derivatives can be
highly volatile, illiquid and difficult to value, and there is the risk that
changes in the value of a derivative held by a Fund will not correlate with the
underlying instruments or the Fund's other investments. Derivative
instruments also involve the risk that a loss may be sustained as a result of
the failure of the counterparty to the derivative instruments to make required
payments or otherwise comply with the derivative instruments' terms.

The Manager has contractually agreed to waive its fee and/or reimburse fund
expenses through March __, 2008 to the extent necessary to limit the total
annual fund operating expenses of the Class N shares of Spectra Alchemy Fund to
1.20% of the Fund's average daily net assets and the Class N shares of Spectra
International Opportunities Fund to 1.65% of the Fund's average daily net
assets.




Example 
The following examples, which reflects the shareholder fees and
operating expenses listed previously, is intended to help you compare the cost
of investing in the Funds with the cost of investing in other mutual funds.

The examples assume that you invest $10,000 in Class N shares of
a Fund for the time periods indicated, regardless of whether or not you redeem
all of your shares a the end of those periods. Each example also assumes that
your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses
remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on
these assumptions your costs would be:

Each Fund may pay its Distributor, Fred Alger & Company,
Incorporated (the "Distributor"), a shareholder servicing fee of 0.25% of the
value of the Fund's average daily net assets for ongoing servicing and/or
maintenance of shareholder accounts. This fee will be paid out of the
distribution fee the Fund pays the Distributor for the sale and distribution of
its shares. The Distributor may pay some or all of this fee, and an additional
fee from its own resources, to other organizations that also provide servicing
and/or maintenance of shareholder accounts. 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE FUNDS' INVESTMENTS

Options 
A call option on a security gives the purchaser of the option
the right, in return for a premium paid, to buy from the writer (seller) of the
call option the security underlying the option at a specified exercise price at
any time during the term of the option. The writer is obligated upon exercise of
the option to deliver the underlying security upon payment of the exercise
price. A put option on a security gives the holder of the option, in return for
the premium paid, the right to sell the underlying security to the writer
(seller) at a specified price during the term of the option. The writer, who
receives the premium, is obligated upon exercise of the option to buy the
underlying security at the exercise price. An option on a stock index gives the
holder the right to receive a cash settlement during the term of the option
based on the amount, if any, by which the exercise price exceeds (if the option
is a put) or is exceeded by (if the option is a call) the current value of the
index, which is itself a function of the market values of the securities
included in the index. The writer of the option is obligated, in return for the
premium received, to make delivery of this amount. 
A Fund may purchase a put option on a portfolio security to seek
to protect against a decline in the market value of the security, or, if the
Fund contemplates purchasing a security in the future, purchase a call option on
the security in anticipation of an increase in the security's market value. When
a Fund writes an option, if the market value of the underlying security does not
move to a level that would make exercise of the option profitable to its holder,
the option generally will expire unexercised and the Fund will realize as profit
the premium it received. When a call option written by a Fund is exercised, the
Fund will be required to sell the underlying securities to the holder at the
exercise price and will not participate in any increase in the securities' value
above that price. When a put option written by a Fund is exercised, the Fund
will be required to purchase the underlying securities at a price in excess of
their market value. 
Use of options on securities indexes entails the risk that
trading in the options may be interrupted if trading in certain securities
included in the index is interrupted. Price movements in a Fund's portfolio
securities may not correlate precisely with movements in the level of an index
and, therefore, the use of options on indexes cannot serve as a complete hedge
and would depend in part on the ability of the Manager to predict correctly
movements in the direction of a particular market or of the stock market
generally. Because options on indexes require settlement in cash, a Fund might
be forced to liquidate portfolio securities to meet settlement obligations.

U.S. Government Securities 
U.S. Government Obligations are bills, notes, bonds and other
fixed-income securities issued by the U.S. Treasury; they are direct obligations
of the U.S. Government and differ mainly in the length of their maturities. U.S.
Government Agency Securities are issued or guaranteed by U.S.
Government-sponsored enterprises and federal agencies. Some of these securities
are supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury; the remainder
are supported only by the credit of the instrumentality, which may or may not
include the right of the issuer to borrow from the Treasury. 
Temporary Defensive and Interim Investments 
In times of adverse or unstable market, economic or political
conditions, each Fund may invest up to 100% of its assets in cash, high-grade
bonds, or cash equivalents (such as commercial paper or money market
instruments) for temporary defensive reasons. This is to attempt to protect the
Fund's assets from a temporary, unacceptable risk of loss, rather than directly
to promote the Fund's investment objective. A Fund also may hold these types of
securities pending the investment of proceeds from the sale of Fund shares or
portfolio securities or to meet anticipated redemptions of Fund shares. A Fund
may not achieve its investment objective while in a temporary defensive or
interim position. 
Other securities the Funds may invest in are discussed in the
Funds' Statement of Additional Information ("SAI").

Administrator 
Pursuant to a separate administration agreement, the
Administrator also provides administrative services to the Funds, including, but
not limited to: providing office space, telephone, office equipment and
supplies; authorizing expenditures and approving bills for payment on behalf of
the Funds; supervising preparation of periodic shareholder reports, notices and
other shareholder communications; supervising the daily pricing of each Fund's

shares, earnings reports and other financial data; monitoring relationships with
organizations providing services to the Funds, including the Funds' custodian,
transfer agent and printers; providing trading desk facilities for the Funds;
and supervising compliance by the Funds with recordkeeping and periodic
reporting requirements under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
"1940 Act"). Each Fund pays the Administrator an administrative fee at the
annual rate of 0.04% based on a percentage of the Fund's average daily net
assets. 
Legal Proceedings 
The Manager has responded to inquiries, document requests and/or
subpoenas from various regulatory authorities in connection with their
investigations of practices in the mutual fund industry identified as "market
timing" and "late trading." On October 11, 2006, the Manager, the Distributor
and Alger Shareholder Services, Inc. executed an Assurance of Discontinuance
with the Office of the New York State Attorney General ("NYAG"). On December 22,
2006, the Manager and the Distributor executed Offers of Settlement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"), and the settlement is
subject to approval of the Commission. As part of the settlements with the
Commission and the NYAG, without admitting or denying liability, the firms will
consent to the payment of $30 million to reimburse fund shareholders; a fine of
$10 million; and certain other remedial measures including a reduction in
management fees of $1 million per year for five years. The entire $40 million
and fee reduction will be available for the benefit of investors. The Manager
has advised the Trust that the proposed settlement payment is not expected to
adversely affect the operations of the Manager, the Distributor or their
affiliates, or adversely affect their ability to continue to provide services to
the Trust. 
On August 31, 2005, the West Virginia Securities Commissioner
(the "WVSC"), in an ex parte Summary Order to Cease and Desist and Notice of
Right to Hearing, concluded that the Manager and the Distributor had violated
the West Virginia Uniform Securities Act (the "WVUSA"), and ordered the Manager
and the Distributor to cease and desist from further violations of the WVUSA by
engaging in the market-timing-related conduct described in the order. The ex
parte order provided notice of their right to a hearing with respect to the
violations of law asserted by the WVSC. Other firms unaffiliated with the
Manager were served with similar orders. The Manager and the Distributor intend
to request a hearing for the purpose of seeking to vacate or modify the order.

In addition, in 2003 and 2004 several purported class actions
and shareholder derivative suits were filed against various parties in the
mutual fund industry, including the Manager, certain mutual funds managed by the
Manager, including the Trust (the "Alger Mutual Funds"), and certain current and
former Alger Mutual Fund trustees and officers, alleging wrongful conduct
related to market-timing and late-trading by mutual fund shareholders. These
cases were transferred to the U.S. District Court of Maryland by the Judicial
Panel on Multidistrict Litigation for consolidated pre-trial proceedings. In
September 2004, consolidated amended complaints involving these cases-a
Consolidated Amended Fund Derivative Complaint (the "Derivative Complaint") and
two substantially identical Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaints
(together, the "Class Action Complaint")-were filed in the Maryland federal
district court under the caption number 1:04-MD-15863 (JFM). In April 2005, a
civil lawsuit involving similar allegations was filed by the West Virginia
Attorney General and also transferred to the Maryland District Court, but such
lawsuit has since been withdrawn. 
The Derivative Complaint alleged (i) violations, by the Manager
and, depending on the specific offense alleged, by the Distributor and/or the
fund trustee defendants, of Sections 36(a), 36(b), 47, and 48 of the 1940 Act
and of Sections 206 and 215 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended,
breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of contract, (ii) various offenses by other
third-party defendants, and (iii) unjust enrichment by all the named defendants.
The Class Action Complaint alleged, in addition to the offenses listed above,
(i) violations, by the Manager, the Distributor, their affiliates, the funds
named as defendants, including the Trust, and the current and former fund
trustees and officers, of Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, Sections 10(b) (and Rule 10b-5 thereunder) and 20(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), and Section 34(b)
of the 1940 Act, (ii) breach of contract by the funds named as defendants, and
(iii) unjust enrichment of the defendants. 
Motions to dismiss the Class Action Complaint and the Derivative
Complaint were subsequently filed. On November 3, 2005, the district court
issued letter rulings dismissing both complaints in their entirety with respect
to the Alger Mutual Funds and dismissing all claims against the other Alger
defendants, other than the claims under the 1934 Act and Section 36(b) of the
1940 Act (as to which the court deferred ruling with respect to the Alger Mutual
Fund trustees), with leave to the class action plaintiffs to file amended
complaints against those defendants with respect to claims under state law.
Orders implementing the letter rulings were entered. On March 31, 2006,
attorneys for the class action plaintiffs informed the district court that they
had decided not to file amended complaints with respect to the plaintiffs' state
law claims. Answers to the Class Action Complaint were filed by the Alger
defendants on April 24, 2006. 
In subsequent orders, all remaining claims in the Class Action
Complaint and the Derivative Complaint have been dismissed, other than claims
under the 1934 Act against the Manager, the Distributor, Alger Associates, Inc.
and Alger Shareholder Services, Inc., and certain present and former members of
the senior management of the Manager and/or the Distributor, and claims under
Section 36(b) of the 1940 Act against the Manager, the Distributor, Alger
Associates, Inc. and Alger Shareholder Services, Inc. 
Under Section 9(a) of the 1940 Act, if any of the various
regulatory proceedings or lawsuits were to result in a court injunction against
the Manager or the Distributor, those entities would, in the absence of
exemptive relief granted by the Commission, be barred from serving as investment
adviser/sub-adviser or distributor for any registered investment company,
including the Trust. While exemptive relief from Section 9(a) of the 1940 Act
has been granted in certain other cases, there is no assurance that such
exemptive relief would be granted if sought. In addition, it is possible that
these matters and/or other developments resulting from these matters could
result in increased redemptions from the Trust, loss of personnel of the
Manager, diversion of time and attention of the Manager's personnel,
diminishment of financial resources of, or other consequences potentially
adverse to the Trust. The Manager cannot predict the potential effect of such
actions upon the Manager or the Trust. There can be no assurance that the
effect, if any, would not be material.

Net Asset Value 
The value of one Class N share is its "net asset value," or NAV.
The NAV is calculated as of the close of business (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern
time) every day the New York Stock Exchange is open. Generally, the Exchange is
closed on weekends and various national holidays. It may close on other days
from time to time. 
The assets of each Fund are generally valued on the basis of
market quotations, or where market quotations are not reliable or readily
available, on the basis of fair value as determined by the Manager under
procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees. 
In determining whether market quotations are reliable and
readily available, the Manager monitors information it routinely receives for
significant events it believes will affect market prices of portfolio
instruments held by the Funds. Significant events may affect a particular
company (for example, a trading halt in the company's securities on an exchange
during the day) or may affect securities markets (for example, a natural
disaster that causes a market to close). If the Manager is aware of a
significant event that has occurred after the close of the market where a
portfolio instrument is primarily traded, but before the close of the New York
Stock Exchange, that the Manager believes has affected or is likely to affect
the price of the instrument, the Manager will use its best judgment to determine
a fair value for that portfolio instrument under procedures adopted by the Board
of Trustees. 
NAV (net asset value) of a class of shares is computed by
adding together the value allocable to the class of each Fund's investments plus
cash and other assets, subtracting applicable liabilities and then dividing the
result by the number of outstanding shares of the class. 
Purchasing and Redeeming Fund Shares 
You can purchase or redeem shares on any day the New York Stock
Exchange is open. Orders will be processed at the NAV next calculated after your
purchase or redemption request is received in good order by the Transfer Agent
or other agent appointed by the Distributor. Ordinarily, the Funds will issue
your redemption check within seven days after the Transfer Agent accepts your
redemption request. However, when you buy shares with a check or via
TelePurchase or Automatic Investment Plan, the Funds will not issue payment for
redemption requests against those funds until the purchase proceeds are
available, which may take up to 15 days. The Transfer Agent or the Funds may
reject any purchase order. 
If you redeem, by sale or exchange, shares of a Fund within 30
days of purchase, the Fund may impose a redemption fee of 2.00% of the amount
redeemed. This fee will be retained by the Fund. Shares held the longest will be
treated as having been redeemed first for purposes of determining whether the
fee applies. The fee will not apply to redemptions (i) due to shareholder death
or disability, (ii) from certain omnibus accounts, (iii) of shares acquired
through reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distributions, (iv) through
certain employer-sponsored retirement plans or employee benefit plans or, with
respect to any plan, to comply with minimum distribution requirements, (v)
effected pursuant to an automatic non-discretionary rebalancing program, (vi)
pursuant to the Systematic Withdrawal Plan, or (vii) by the Fund of accounts
falling below the minimum initial investment amount. Each Fund reserves the
right to waive this fee in other circumstances if the Manager determines that
doing so is in the best interests of the Fund. 
Dividends and Distributions 
Dividends of each Fund's net investment income and distributions
of its net realized capital gains are declared and paid annually by the Fund.
The Funds expect that these annual payments to shareholders will consist
primarily of capital gains, which may be taxable to you at different rates
depending upon how long a Fund has held the securities that it sold to create
the gains, rather than the length of time you have held shares of the Fund.
Unless you choose to receive cash payments by checking the appropriate box on
your New Account Application, any dividends and distributions will be reinvested
automatically at the NAV on their payment dates. If you have chosen cash
payments and a payment is returned to a Fund as undeliverable, upon receipt that
payment will be reinvested in Fund shares at the next NAV. All subsequent
payments will be reinvested until you reinstate your cash election and provide a
valid mailing address. 
Regardless of whether you choose to take distributions in cash
or reinvest them in a Fund, they may be subject to federal and state taxes.
Because everyone's tax situation is unique, investors should see a tax advisor
about federal, state and local tax consequences of investing in the Funds.

Signature Guarantee is a guarantee by a financial institution that your

substitute. 
MARKET TIMING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES 
The Funds invests predominantly in U.S.-traded, highly liquid
securities for which current New York market-closing prices are readily
available on a daily basis at the time the Funds price their portfolios and
determine NAV per share. As a result, the Manager believes that there is little
incentive for investors to engage in frequent and/or short-term trading (often
referred to as market-timing) to benefit from "stale" pricing. Nonetheless, the
Funds recognize that in certain circumstances active in-and-out trading by Fund
shareholders, for whatever reason implemented, may be attempted and may, if
carried out on a large scale, impose burdens on a Fund's portfolio management
team, interfere with the efficient management of the Fund, increase the Fund's
transaction costs, administrative costs or tax liability or otherwise be
detrimental to the interests of the Fund and its other shareholders. The Funds
therefore discourage market timing, and to the extent possible monitors for
market timing patterns in the Funds. 
The Board of Trustees has determined that the Funds may reject
purchase orders, on a temporary or permanent basis, from investors that the
Manager is able to determine, in its reasonable business judgment, are
exhibiting a pattern of frequent or short-term trading in Fund shares or shares
of other funds sponsored by the Manager that is detrimental to the fund
involved. 
In order to detect significant market timing, the Manager will,
among other things, monitor overall subscription, redemption and exchange
activity; isolate significant daily activity, and significant activity relative
to existing account sizes to determine if there appears to be market timing
activity in an individual portfolio. While the Fund might not be able to detect
frequent or short-term trading conducted by the underlying owners of shares held
in omnibus accounts or placed through market intermediaries other than on a
fully-disclosed basis, and therefore might not be able to effectively prevent
frequent or short-term trading in those accounts, the Manager attempts to
monitor these activities in omnibus accounts and will contract with
broker-dealers that sell shares of the Funds and entities that hold omnibus
accounts with its mutual funds to seek to discourage, detect and prevent market
timing and active trading. There is no guarantee that a Fund's efforts to
identify investors who engage in excessive trading activity or to curtail that
activity will be successful. In addition, the Funds' policies against market
timing and active trading may in some cases interfere with or delay
implementation of legitimate investment decisions made by shareholders seeking
to purchase or redeem shares. 
DISCLOSURE OF PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS 
The Board of Trustees has adopted policies and procedures
relating to disclosure of each Fund's portfolio securities. These policies and
procedures recognize that there may be legitimate business reasons for holdings
to be disclosed and seek to balance those interests to protect the proprietary
nature of the trading strategies and implementation thereof by the Funds.

Generally, the policies prohibit the release of information
concerning portfolio holdings which have not previously been made public to
individual investors, institutional investors, intermediaries that distribute
the Funds' shares and other parties which are not employed by the Manager or its
affiliates, except when the legitimate business purposes for selective
disclosure and other conditions (designed to protect the Funds) are acceptable.

The Funds make their full holdings available semi-annually in
shareholder reports filed on Form N-CSR, and after the first and third fiscal
quarters in regulatory filings, on Form N-Q. These shareholder reports and
regulatory filings are filed with the SEC, as required by federal securities
laws, and are generally available within sixty (60) days of the end of the
Funds' fiscal quarter. 
In addition, the Funds make publicly available their month-end
top 10 holdings with a 15 day lag and their month-end full portfolios with a 60
day lag on their website www.spectrafunds.com and through other marketing
communications (including printed advertising/sales literature and/or
shareholder telephone customer service centers). No compensation or other
consideration is received for the non-public disclosure of portfolio holdings
information. 
In accordance with the foregoing, the Funds provide portfolio
holdings information to service providers who provide necessary or beneficial
services when such service providers need access to this information in the
performance of their services and are subject to duties of confidentiality (1)
imposed by law, including a duty not to trade on non-public information, and/or
(2) pursuant to an agreement that confidential information is not to be
disclosed or used (including trading on such information) other than as required
by law. From time to time, the Funds will communicate with these service
providers to confirm that they understand the Funds' policies and procedures
regarding such disclosure. This agreement must be approved by the (i) Manager's
legal and compliance department and (ii) Funds' Chief Compliance Officer.

The Board of Trustees periodically reviews a report disclosing
the third parties to whom the Funds' holdings information has been disclosed and
the purpose for such disclosure, and it considers whether or not the release of
information to such third parties is in the best interest of the Funds and their
shareholders. 
OTHER INFORMATION 
Under certain circumstances, your Fund may redeem some of your
shares "in kind," which means that some of the proceeds will be paid with
securities the Fund owns instead of cash. If you receive securities, you should
expect to incur brokerage or other charges in converting the securities to cash.

Shares may be worth more or less when they are redeemed than
they were at the time you bought them. For tax purposes, this means that when
you redeem them you may realize a short- or long-term capital gain or loss,
depending upon how long you have held the shares. 
The Funds and Transfer Agent have reasonable procedures in place
to determine that the instructions submitted by telephone are genuine. They
include requesting personal identification and recording calls. If the Funds and
Transfer Agent follow these procedures, they are not liable for acting in good
faith on telephone instructions. 
If you are a participant in a retirement plan, such as a 401(k)
plan, and you purchase shares in a Fund through an administrator or trustee
("Plan Administrator") that maintains a master or "omnibus" account with the
Fund for trading on behalf of retirement plans and their participants, the Plan
Administrator may apply purchase and exchange limitations which are different
than the limitations discussed herein. These limitations may be more or less
restrictive than the limitations imposed by the Fund, but in any event are
designed to detect and prevent excessive trading. Consult with your Plan
Administrator to determine what purchase and exchange limitations may be
applicable to your transactions in the Funds through your retirement plan.

From time to time the Distributor, at its expense from its own
resources, may compensate brokers, dealers, investment advisers or others
("financial intermediaries") who are instrumental in effecting investments by
their clients or customers in the Trust, in an amount up to 1% of those
investments. The Distributor may also from time to time, at its expense from its
own resources, make payments to financial intermediaries that provide
shareholder servicing, or transaction processing, with such payments structured
as a percentage of gross sales, a percentage of net assets, and/or as a fixed
dollar amount (the latter as a per account fee or as reimbursement for
transactions processing and transmission charges). Payments under these other
arrangements may vary but generally will not exceed 0.50% annually of Fund
assets or 0.50% annually of Fund sales attributable to that financial
intermediary. The Distributor determines whether to make any additional cash
payments and the amount of any such payments in response to requests from
financial intermediaries, based on factors the Distributor deems relevant.
Factors considered by the Distributor generally include the financial
intermediary's reputation, ability to attract and retain assets for the Fund,
expertise in distributing a particular class of shares of the Fund, entry into
target markets, and/or quality of service. In addition, the Distributor may make
payments to dealer firms in the form of payments for marketing support, seminar
support, training meetings, or comparable expenses in the discretion of the
Distributor. Please contact your financial intermediary for details about
revenue sharing payments it may receive. Any payments described above will not
change the price paid by investors for the purchase of shares of a Fund or the
amount of proceeds received by a Fund on the sale of shares.

THE FUNDS
Spectra Alchemy Fund
Under normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of its
net assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in equity securities.
The Fund may invest in companies of any market capitalization, from larger,
well-established companies to small, emerging growth companies. The Fund's
benchmark is the Russell 3000� Growth Index, which is an index of common
stocks designed to track performance of companies with greater than average
growth orientation in general. 
The Fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in securities of
companies whose principal business activities are located in emerging market
countries, although the allocation of the Fund's assets to emerging market
countries will vary from time to time. 
Spectra International Opportunities Fund
Under normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net
assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in equity securities,
including common stocks, American Depositary Receipts and Global Depositary
Receipts, of foreign companies. The Fund generally invests in at least three
foreign countries, and, at times, may invest a substantial portion of its assets
in a single foreign country. The Fund may invest in companies of any market
capitalization, from larger, well-established companies to small, emerging
growth companies. 
The Fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in securities of
companies whose principal business activities are located in emerging market
countries, although the allocation of the Fund's assets to emerging market
countries will vary from time to time. 
In General
Each Fund, like all other investments, can provide two types of
return: income return and capital return. Income return is the income received
from an investment, such as interest on bonds and money market instruments and
dividends from common and preferred stocks. Capital return is the change in the
market value of an investment, such as an increase in the price of a common
stock or of shares of a Fund. Total return is the sum of income return and
capital return. Thus, if a Fund over a year produces four percent in income
return and its shares increase in value by three percent, its total return is
seven percent. In general, the more capital return is emphasized over income
return in an investment program, the more risk is associated with the program.

Growth funds, such as the Funds, seek primarily capital return.
They invest primarily in common stocks and offer the opportunity of the greatest
return over the long term but can be risky since their prices fluctuate with
changes in stock market prices. Growth funds that invest in companies with
smaller market capitalizations offer potential for significant price gains if
the companies are successful, but there is also the risk that the companies will
not succeed and the price of the companies' shares will drop in value. Growth
funds that invest in larger, more established companies, generally offer
relatively less opportunity for capital return but a greater degree of safety.

Investors considering equity investing through the Funds should
carefully consider the inherent risks associated with an investment in each
Fund. Expectations of future inflation rates should be considered in making
investment decisions and even though over the long term stocks may present
attractive opportunities, the results of an equity investment managed by a
particular management firm may not match those of the market as a whole.

Each Fund may, but is not required to, use derivatives, such as
futures, options and forward contracts, as a substitute for investing directly
in an underlying asset, to increase returns, to manage foreign currency risk, or
as part of a hedging strategy. Each Fund may borrow only from banks and may not
borrow in excess of one-third of the market value of its total assets, less
liabilities other than such borrowing. These practices are deemed to be
speculative and may cause a Fund's net asset value be more volatile than the net
asset value of a fund that does not engage in these activities. 
INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND POLICIES 
The Prospectus discusses the investment objective of each Fund
and the principal strategies employed to achieve this objective. This section
contains supplemental information concerning the types of securities and other
instruments in which the Funds may invest, the investment policies and portfolio
strategies that the Funds may utilize and certain risks attendant on those
investments, policies and strategies. 
In General
Each Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing in equity
securities, such as common or preferred stocks, or securities convertible into
or exchangeable for equity securities, including warrants and rights. The Funds
will invest primarily in companies whose securities are traded on domestic stock
exchanges or in the over-the-counter market. These companies may be in the
developmental stage, may be older companies that appear to be entering a new
stage of growth progress owing to factors such as management changes or
development of new technology, products or markets, or may be companies
providing products or services with a high unit-volume growth rate. In order to
afford the Funds the flexibility to take advantage of new opportunities for
investments in accordance with its investment objectives and to meet
redemptions, each Fund may hold up to 15% of its net assets in money market
instruments and repurchase agreements and in excess of that amount (up to 100%
of its assets) during temporary defensive periods. This amount may be higher
than that maintained by other funds with similar investment objectives. There is
no guarantee that a Fund's objective will be achieved. 
Common and Preferred Stocks
Stocks represent shares of ownership in a company. Generally,
preferred stock has a specified dividend and ranks after bonds and before common
stocks in its claim on income for dividend payments and on assets should the
company be liquidated. After other claims are satisfied, common stockholders
participate in company profits on a pro-rata basis; profits may be paid out in
dividends or reinvested in the company to help it grow. Increases and decreases
in earnings are usually reflected in a company�s stock price, so common
stocks generally have the greatest appreciation and depreciation potential of
all corporate securities. While most preferred stocks pay a dividend, each Fund
may purchase preferred stock where the issuer has omitted, or is in danger of
omitting, payment of its dividend. Such investments would be made primarily for
their capital appreciation potential. Each Fund may purchase trust preferred
securities which are preferred stocks issued by a special purpose trust
subsidiary backed by subordinated debt of the corporate parent. These securities
typically bear a market rate coupon comparable to interest rates available on
debt of a similarly rated company. Holders of the trust preferred securities
have limited voting rights to control the activities of the trust and no voting
rights with respect to the parent company. 
Temporary Defensive and Interim Investments 
When market conditions are unstable, or the Funds' investment
adviser, Fred Alger Management, Inc. ("Alger Management" or the "Manager"),
believes it is otherwise appropriate to reduce holdings in stocks, the Fund can
invest in a variety of debt securities for defensive purposes. The Funds also
can purchase these securities for liquidity purposes to meet cash needs due to
the redemption of Fund shares, or to hold while waiting to reinvest cash
received from the sale of other portfolio securities. Each Fund can buy:




�
high-quality, short-term money market instruments, including those
issued by the U.S. Treasury or other government agencies;






�
commercial paper (short-term, unsecured, promissory notes of
domestic or foreign companies);






�
short-term debt obligations of corporate issuers, certificates of
deposit and bankers' acceptances of domestic and foreign banks and savings and
loan associations; and






�
repurchase agreements.



Short-term debt securities would normally be selected for
defensive or cash management purposes because they can normally be disposed of
quickly, are not generally subject to significant fluctuations in principal
value and their value will be less subject to interest rate risk than
longer-term debt securities. 
Bank Obligations 
These are certificates of deposit, bankers' acceptances, and other
short-term debt obligations. Certificates of deposit are short-term obligations
of commercial banks. A bankers' acceptance is a time draft drawn on a commercial
bank by a borrower, usually in connection with international commercial
transactions. Certificates of deposit may have fixed or variable rates.

A Fund will not invest in any debt security issued by a
commercial bank unless (i) the bank has total assets of at least $1 billion, or
the equivalent in other currencies, or, in the case of domestic banks that do
not have total assets of at least $1 billion, the aggregate investment made in
any one such bank is limited to $100,000 and the principal amount of such
investment is insured in full by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, (ii)
in the case of U.S. banks, it is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, and (iii) in the case of foreign banks, the security is, in the
opinion of the Manager, of an investment quality comparable to other debt
securities which may be purchased by the Fund. These limitations do not prohibit
investments in securities issued by foreign branches of U.S. banks, provided
such U.S. banks meet the foregoing requirements. 
Foreign Bank Obligations
Investments by a Fund in foreign bank obligations and
obligations of foreign branches of domestic banks present certain risks,
including the impact of future political and economic developments, the possible
imposition of withholding taxes on interest income, the possible seizure or
nationalization of foreign deposits, the possible establishment of exchange
controls and/or the addition of other foreign governmental restrictions that
might affect adversely the payment of principal and interest on these
obligations. In addition, there may be less publicly available and reliable
information about a foreign bank than about domestic banks owing to different
accounting, auditing, reporting and recordkeeping standards. In view of these
risks, Alger Management will carefully evaluate these investments on a
case-by-case basis. 
Short-Term Corporate Debt Securities
These are outstanding nonconvertible corporate debt securities
(e.g., bonds and debentures) which have one year or less remaining to maturity.
Corporate notes may have fixed, variable, or floating rates. 
Commercial Paper
These are short-term promissory notes issued by corporations
primarily to finance short-term credit needs. The commercial paper purchased by
a Fund may consist of U.S. dollar-denominated obligations of domestic issuers
and foreign currency-denominated obligations of domestic or foreign issuers.
Because these obligations are direct lending arrangements between the lender and
the borrower, it is not contemplated that such instruments generally will be
traded, and there generally is no established secondary market for these
obligations, although they are redeemable at face value, plus accrued interest,
at any time. Accordingly, where these obligations are not secured by letters of
credit or other credit support arrangements, a Fund's right to redeem is
dependent on the ability of the borrower to pay principal and interest on
demand.
Convertible Securities 
Each Fund may invest in convertible securities, which are debt
instruments or preferred stocks that make fixed dividend or interest payments
and are convertible into common stock. Generally, the market prices of
convertible securities tend to reflect price changes in their underlying common
stocks, but also tend to respond inversely to changes in interest rates.
Convertible securities typically entail less market risk than investments in the
common stock of the same issuers; declines in their market prices are typically
not as pronounced as those of their underlying common stocks. Like all
fixed-income securities, convertible securities are subject to the risk of
default on their issuers' payment obligations. 
Variable Rate Master Demand Notes 
These are unsecured instruments that permit the indebtedness
thereunder to vary and provide for periodic adjustments in the interest rate.
Because these notes are direct lending arrangements between a Fund and an
issuer, they are not normally traded. Although no active secondary market may
exist for these notes, a Fund may demand payment of principal and accrued
interest at any time or may resell the note to a third party. While the notes
are not typically rated by credit rating agencies, issuers of variable rate
master demand notes must satisfy Alger Management that the same criteria for
issuers of commercial paper are met. In addition, when purchasing variable rate
master demand notes, Alger Management will consider the earning power, cash
flows and other liquidity ratios of the issuers of the notes and will
continuously monitor their financial status and ability to meet payment on
demand. In the event an issuer of a variable rate master demand note were to
default on its payment obligations, a Fund might be unable to dispose of the
note because of the absence of a secondary market and could, for this or other
reasons, suffer a loss to the extent of the default. 
U.S. Government Obligations
Each Fund may invest in U.S. Government securities, which
include Treasury Bills, Treasury Notes and Treasury Bonds that differ in their
interest rates, maturities and times of issuance. Treasury Bills have initial
maturities of one year or less; Treasury Notes have initial maturities of one to
ten years; and Treasury Bonds generally have initial maturities of greater than
ten years. In addition to U.S. Treasury securities, each Fund may invest in
securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or its agencies or
instrumentalities. Some obligations issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government
agencies and instrumentalities are supported by the full faith and credit of the
U.S. Treasury; others by the right of the issuer to borrow from the Treasury;
others by discretionary authority of the U.S. Government to purchase certain
obligations of the agency or instrumentality; and others only by the credit of
the agency or instrumentality. These securities bear fixed, floating or variable
rates of interest. While the U.S. Government currently provides financial
support to such U.S. Government-sponsored agencies or instrumentalities, no
assurance can be given that it will always do so, since it is not so obligated
by law. 
Lending of Portfolio Securities
In order to generate income and to offset expenses, each Fund
may lend portfolio securities to brokers, dealers and other financial
organizations. Loans of securities by a Fund, if and when made, may not exceed
33-1/3 percent of the Fund's total assets including all collateral on such
loans, less liabilities exclusive of the obligation to return such collateral,
and will be collateralized by cash, letters of credit or U.S. Government
securities that are maintained at all times in an amount equal to at least 100%
of the current market value of the loaned securities. 
Each Fund has the authority to lend securities to brokers,
dealers and other financial organizations. A Fund will not lend securities to
Alger Management or its affiliates. By lending its securities, a Fund can
increase its income by continuing to receive interest or dividends on the loaned
securities as well as either investing the cash collateral in short-term
securities or by earning income in the form of interest paid by the borrower
when U.S. Government securities are used as collateral. The Funds will adhere to
the following conditions whenever their securities are lent: (a) the Fund must
receive at least 100% cash collateral or equivalent securities from the
borrower; (b) the borrower must increase this collateral whenever the market
value of the securities including accrued interest exceeds the value of the
collateral; (c) the Fund must be able to terminate the loan at any time; (d) the
Fund must receive reasonable interest on the loan, as well as any dividends,
interest or other distributions on the lent securities and any increase in
market value; (e) the Fund may pay only reasonable custodian fees in connection
with the loan; and (f) voting rights on the lent securities may pass to the
borrower; provided, however, that if a material event adversely affecting the
investment occurs, the Trust's Board of Trustees must terminate the loan and
regain the right to vote the securities. 
A Fund bears a risk of loss in the event that the other party to
a stock loan transaction defaults on its obligations and the Fund is delayed in
or prevented from exercising its rights to dispose of the collateral, including
the risk of a possible decline in the value of the collateral securities during
the period in which the Fund seeks to assert these rights, the risk of incurring
expenses associated with asserting these rights and the risk of losing all or a
part of the income from the transaction. 
Repurchase Agreements
Each Fund may engage in repurchase agreement transactions with
banks, registered broker-dealers and government securities dealers approved by
the Board of Trustees. Under the terms of a repurchase agreement, a Fund would
acquire a high quality money market instrument for a relatively short period
(usually not more than one week) subject to an obligation of the seller to
repurchase, and the Fund to resell, the instrument at an agreed price (including
accrued interest) and time, thereby determining the yield during the Fund's
holding period. Thus, repurchase agreements may be seen to be loans by the Fund
collateralized by the underlying instrument. This arrangement results in a fixed
rate of return that is not subject to market fluctuations during the Fund's
holding period and not necessarily related to the rate of return on the
underlying instrument. The value of the underlying securities, including accrued
interest, will be at least equal at all times to the total amount of the
repurchase obligation including interest. The Fund bears a risk of loss in the
event that the other party to a repurchase agreement defaults on its obligations
and the Fund is delayed in or prevented from exercising its rights to dispose of
the collateral securities, including the risk of a possible decline in the value
of the underlying securities during the period in which the Fund seeks to assert
these rights, the risk of incurring expenses associated with asserting these
rights and the risk of losing all or a part of the income from the agreement.
Alger Management, acting under the supervision of the Trust's Board of Trustees,
reviews the creditworthiness of those banks and dealers with which the Funds
enter into repurchase agreements to evaluate these risks and monitors on an
ongoing basis the value of the securities subject to repurchase agreements to
ensure that the value is maintained at the required level. 
Warrants and Rights
Each Fund may invest in warrants and rights. A warrant is a type
of security that entitles the holder to buy a proportionate amount of common
stock at a specified price, usually higher than the market price at the time of
issuance, for a period of years or to perpetuity. In contrast, rights, which
also represent the right to buy common shares, normally have a subscription
price lower than the current market value of the common stock and a life of two
to four weeks. Warrants are freely transferable and are traded on the major
securities exchanges. 
Illiquid and Restricted Securities
Each Fund may invest in restricted securities; i.e., securities
which are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on their resale. These
restrictions might prevent the sale of the securities at a time when a sale
would otherwise be desirable. In order to sell securities that are not
registered under the federal securities laws it may be necessary for a Fund to
bear the expense of registration. No restricted securities will be acquired if
the acquisition would cause the aggregate value of all illiquid securities to
exceed 15% of a Fund's net assets. 
Each Fund may invest in restricted securities governed by Rule
144A ("Rule 144A") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act"). In adopting Rule 144A, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
specifically stated that restricted securities traded under Rule 144A may be
treated as liquid for purposes of investment limitations if the board of
trustees (or the fund's adviser acting subject to the board's supervision)
determines that the securities are in fact liquid. The Trust's Board of Trustees
has delegated its responsibility to Alger Management to determine the liquidity
of each restricted security purchased by a Fund pursuant to Rule 144A, subject
to the Board's oversight and review. Examples of factors that will be taken into
account in evaluating the liquidity of a Rule 144A security, both with respect
to the initial purchase and on an ongoing basis, will include, among others: (1)
the frequency of trades and quotes for the security; (2) the number of dealers
willing to purchase or sell the security and the number of other potential
purchasers; (3) dealer undertakings to make a market in the security; and (4)
the nature of the security and the nature of the marketplace trades (e.g., the
time needed to dispose of the security, the method of soliciting offers and the
mechanics of transfer). If institutional trading in restricted securities were
to decline to limited levels, the liquidity of a Fund could be adversely
affected. 
A Fund will not invest more than 15% of its net assets in
"illiquid" securities, which include restricted securities, securities for which
there is no readily available market and repurchase agreements with maturities
of greater than seven days; however, restricted securities that are determined
by the Board of Trustees to be liquid are not subject to this limitation.

Rule 144A is designed to facilitate efficient trading of
unregistered securities among institutional investors. Rule 144A permits the
resale to qualified institutions of restricted securities that, when issued,
were not of the same class as securities listed on a U.S. securities exchange or
quoted on NASDAQ. 
Short Sales
Each Fund may sell securities "short against the box." While a
short sale is the sale of a security a Fund does not own, it is "against the
box" if at all times when the short position is open the Fund owns an equal
amount of the securities or securities convertible into, or exchangeable without
further consideration for, securities of the same issue as the securities sold
short. 
Foreign Securities
Each Fund may invest, without limit, in foreign securities (not
including American Depositary Receipts, American Depositary Shares or U.S.
dollar-denominated securities of foreign issuers). Foreign securities
investments may be affected by changes in currency rates or exchange control
regulations, changes in governmental administration or economic or monetary
policy (in the United States and abroad) or changed circumstances in dealing
between nations. Dividends paid by foreign issuers may be subject to withholding
and other foreign taxes that may decrease the net return on these investments as
compared to dividends paid to a Fund by domestic corporations. It should be
noted that there may be less publicly available information about foreign
issuers than about domestic issuers, and foreign issuers are not subject to
uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements
comparable to those of domestic issuers. Securities of some foreign issuers are
less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable domestic issuers and
foreign brokerage commissions are generally higher than in the United States.
Foreign securities markets may also be less liquid, more volatile and less
subject to government supervision than those in the United States. Investments
in foreign countries could be affected by other factors not present in the
United States, including expropriation, confiscatory taxation and potential
difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations. Securities purchased on
foreign exchanges may be held in custody by a foreign branch of a domestic bank.

The risks associated with investing in foreign securities are
often heightened for investments in emerging markets countries. These heightened
risks include (i) greater risks of expropriation, confiscatory taxation,
nationalization, and less social, political and economic stability; (ii) the
small size of the markets for securities of emerging markets issuers and the
currently low or nonexistent volume of trading, resulting in lack of liquidity
and in price volatility; (iii) certain national policies which may restrict the
Fund's investment opportunities including restrictions on investing in issuers
or industries deemed sensitive to relevant national interests; and (iv) the
absence of developed legal structures governing private or foreign investment
and private property. A Fund's purchase and sale of portfolio securities in
certain emerging markets countries may be constrained by limitations as to daily
changes in the prices of listed securities, periodic trading or settlement
volume and/or limitations on aggregate holdings of foreign investors. In certain
cases, such limitations may be computed based upon the aggregate trading by or
holdings of the Fund, Alger Management and its affiliates and its clients and
other service providers. The Fund may not be able to sell securities in
circumstances where price, trading or settlement volume limitations have been
reached. These limitations may have a negative impact on a Fund's performance
and may adversely affect the liquidity of the Fund's investment to the extent
that it invests in certain emerging market countries. In addition, some emerging
markets countries may have fixed or managed currencies which are not
free-floating against the U.S. dollar. Further, certain emerging markets
countries' currencies may not be internationally traded. Certain of these
currencies have experienced a steady devaluation relative to the U.S. dollar. If
a Fund does not hedge the U.S. dollar value of securities it owns denominated in
currencies that are devalued, the Fund's net asset value will be adversely
affected. Many emerging markets countries have experienced substantial, and in
some periods extremely high, rates of inflation for many years. Inflation and
rapid fluctuations in inflation rates have had and may continue to have adverse
effects on the economies and securities markets of certain of these countries.

Each Fund may invest in the securities of foreign issuers in the
form of American Depositary Receipts and American Depositary Shares
(collectively, "ADRs") and Global Depositary Receipts and Global Depositary
Shares (collectively, "GDRs") and other forms of depositary receipts. These
securities may not necessarily be denominated in the same currency as the
securities into which they may be converted. ADRs are receipts typically issued
by a United States bank or trust company which evidence ownership of underlying
securities issued by a foreign corporation. GDRs are receipts issued outside the
United States typically by non-United States banks and trust companies that
evidence ownership of either foreign or domestic securities. Generally, ADRs in
registered form are designed for use in the United States securities markets and
GDRs in bearer form are designed for use outside the United States. 
These securities may be purchased through "sponsored" or
"unsponsored" facilities. A sponsored facility is established jointly by the
issuer of the underlying security and a depositary. A depositary may establish
an unsponsored facility without participation by the issuer of the deposited
security. Holders of unsponsored depositary receipts generally bear all the
costs of such facilities, and the depositary of an unsponsored facility
frequently is under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications
received from the issuer of the deposited security or to pass through voting
rights to the holders of such receipts in respect of the deposited securities.

Derivative Transactions
Each Fund may invest in, or enter into, derivatives for a
variety of reasons, including to hedge certain market or interest rate risks, to
provide a substitute for purchasing or selling particular securities or to
increase potential returns. Generally, derivatives are financial contracts whose
value depends upon, or is derived from, the value of an underlying asset,
reference rate or index, and may relate to stocks, bonds, interest rates,
currencies or currency exchange rates, and related indexes. Examples of
derivative instruments the Funds may use include options contracts, futures
contracts, and options on futures contracts. Derivatives may provide a cheaper,
quicker or more specifically focused way for the Fund to invest than
"traditional" securities would. Alger Management, however, may decide not to
employ some or all of these strategies for a Fund and there is no assurance that
any derivatives strategy used by the Fund will succeed. 
Derivatives can be volatile and involve various types and
degrees of risk, depending upon the characteristics of the particular derivative
and the portfolio as a whole. Derivatives permit a Fund to increase or decrease
the level of risk, or change the character of the risk, to which its portfolio
is exposed in much the same way as the Fund can increase or decrease the level
of risk, or change the character of the risk, of its portfolio by making
investments in specific securities. However, derivatives may entail investment
exposures that are greater than their cost would suggest, meaning that a small
investment in derivatives could have a large potential impact on a Fund's
performance. 
If a Fund invests in derivatives at inopportune times or judges
market conditions incorrectly, such investments may lower the Fund's return or
result in a loss. A Fund also could experience losses if its derivatives were
poorly correlated with the underlying instruments or the Fund's other
investments, or if the Fund were unable to liquidate its position because of an
illiquid secondary market. The market for many derivatives is, or suddenly can
become, illiquid. Changes in liquidity may result in significant, rapid and
unpredictable changes in the prices for derivatives. 
Derivatives may be purchased on established exchanges or through
privately negotiated transactions referred to as over-the-counter derivatives.
Exchange-traded derivatives generally are guaranteed by the clearing agency that
is the issuer or counterparty to such derivatives. This guarantee usually is
supported by a daily variation margin system operated by the clearing agency in
order to reduce overall credit risk. As a result, unless the clearing agency
defaults, there is relatively little counterparty credit risk associated with
derivatives purchased on an exchange. In contrast, no clearing agency guarantees
over-the-counter derivatives. Therefore, each party to an over-the-counter
derivative bears the risk that the counterparty will default. Accordingly, Alger
Management will consider the creditworthiness of counterparties to
over-the-counter derivatives in the same manner as it would review the credit
quality of a security to be purchased by a Fund. Over-the-counter derivatives
are less liquid than exchange-traded derivatives since the other party to the
transaction may be the only investor with sufficient understanding of the
derivative to be interested in bidding for it. 
Some derivatives the Funds use involve leverage (e.g., an
instrument linked to the value of a securities index may return income
calculated as a multiple of the price movement of the underlying index). This
economic leverage will increase the volatility of these instruments as they may
increase or decrease in value more quickly than the underlying security, index,
futures contract, currency or other economic variable. Pursuant to regulations
and/or published positions of the SEC, a Fund may be required to segregate
permissible liquid assets, or engage in other measures approved by the SEC or
its staff, to "cover" the Fund's obligations relating to its transactions in
derivatives. For example, in the case of futures contracts or forward contracts
that are not contractually required to cash settle, a Fund must set aside liquid
assets equal to such contracts' full notional value (generally the total
numerical value of the asset underlying a future or forward contract at the time
of valuation) while the positions are open. With respect to futures contracts or
forward contracts that are contractually required to cash settle, however, the
Fund is permitted to set aside liquid assets in an amount equal to the Fund's
daily marked-to-market net obligation (i.e., the Fund's daily net liability)
under the contracts, if any, rather than such contracts' full notional value. By
setting aside assets equal to only its net obligations under cash-settled
futures and forwards contracts, a Fund may employ leverage to a greater extent
than if the Fund were required to segregate assets equal to the full notional
value of such contracts. 
[Neither the Trust nor the Funds will be a commodity pool. The
Trust has filed notice with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and
National Futures Association of its eligibility, as a registered investment
company, for an exclusion from the definition of commodity pool operator and
that neither the Trust nor the Funds is subject to registration or regulation as
a pool operator under the Commodity Exchange Act.] 
Futures Transactions�In General. A futures contract
is an agreement between two parties to buy and sell a security for a set price
on a future date. These contracts are traded on exchanges, so that, in most
cases, either party can close out its position on the exchange for cash, without
delivering the security. An option on a futures contract gives the holder of the
option the right to buy from or sell to the writer of the option a position in a
futures contract at a specified price on or before a specified expiration date.

Although some futures contracts call for making or taking
delivery of the underlying securities, generally these obligations are closed
out before delivery by offsetting purchases or sales of matching futures
contracts (same exchange, underlying security or index, and delivery month).
Closing out a futures contract sale is effected by purchasing a futures contract
for the same aggregate amount of the specific type of financial instrument with
the same delivery date. If an offsetting purchase price is less than the
original sale price, the Fund realizes a capital gain, or if it is more, the
Fund realizes a capital loss. Conversely, if an offsetting sale price is more
than the original purchase price, the Fund realizes a capital gain, or if it is
less, the Fund realizes a capital loss. Transaction costs also are included in
these calculations. 
Each Fund may enter into futures contracts in U.S. domestic
markets or on exchanges located outside the United States. Foreign markets may
offer advantages such as trading opportunities or arbitrage possibilities not
available in the United States. Foreign markets, however, may have greater risk
potential than domestic markets. For example, some foreign exchanges are
principal markets so that no common clearing facility exists and an investor may
look only to the broker for performance of the contract. In addition, any
profits that a Fund might realize in trading could be eliminated by adverse
changes in the currency exchange rate, or the Fund could incur losses as a
result of those changes. 
Engaging in these transactions involves risk of loss to a Fund
which could adversely affect the value of the Fund's net assets. Although each
Fund intends to purchase or sell futures contracts only if there is an active
market for such contracts, no assurance can be given that a liquid market will
exist for any particular contract at any particular time. Many futures exchanges
and boards of trade limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures
contract prices during a single trading day. Once the daily limit has been
reached in a particular contract, no trades may be made that day at a price
beyond that limit or trading may be suspended for specified periods during the
trading day. Futures contract prices could move to the limit for several
consecutive trading days with little or no trading, thereby preventing prompt
liquidation of futures positions and potentially subjecting the Fund to
substantial losses. 
Successful use of futures by a Fund also is subject to Alger
Management's ability to predict correctly movements in the direction of the
relevant market and, to the extent the transaction is entered into for hedging
purposes, to ascertain the appropriate correlation between the securities being
hedged and the price movements of the futures contract. For example, if a Fund
uses futures to hedge against the possibility of a decline in the market value
of securities held in its portfolio and the prices of such securities instead
increase, the Fund will lose part or all of the benefit of the increased value
of securities which it has hedged because it will have offsetting losses in its
futures positions. Furthermore, if in such circumstances the Fund has
insufficient cash, it may have to sell securities to meet daily variation margin
requirements. The Fund may have to sell such securities at a time when it may be
disadvantageous to do so. 
Specific Futures Transactions. Each Fund may invest in
futures contracts and options on futures contracts, including those with respect
to securities indexes, interest rates and currencies. 
Each Fund may purchase and sell index futures contracts and
options thereon. An index future obligates the Fund to pay or receive an amount
of cash equal to a fixed dollar amount specified in the futures contract
multiplied by the difference between the settlement price of the contract on the
contract's last trading day and the value of the index based on the prices of
the securities that comprise the index at the opening of trading in such
securities on the next business day. 
Each Fund may purchase and sell interest rate futures contracts
and options thereon. An interest rate future obligates the Fund to purchase or
sell an amount of a specific debt security at a future date at a specific price.

Each Fund may purchase and sell currency futures and options
thereon. A foreign currency future obligates the Fund to purchase or sell an
amount of a specific currency at a future date at a specific price. 
Options. Each Fund may purchase or sell (that is, write) listed options
on securities as a means of achieving additional return or of hedging the value
of its portfolio. A Fund may write covered call options on common stocks that it
owns or has an immediate right to acquire through conversion or exchange of
other securities in an amount not to exceed 25% of total assets. The Funds may
only buy or sell options that are listed on a national securities exchange.

If a Fund has written an option, it may terminate its obligation
by effecting a closing purchase transaction. This is accomplished by purchasing
an option of the same series as the option previously written. There can be no
assurance that a closing purchase transaction can be effected when the Fund so
desires. 
An option may be closed out only on an exchange that provides a
secondary market for an option of the same series. Although a Fund will
generally not purchase or write options that appear to lack an active secondary
market, there is no assurance that a liquid secondary market on an exchange will
exist for any particular option. In such event it might not be possible to
effect closing transactions in particular options, so that a Fund would have to
exercise its option in order to realize any profit and would incur brokerage
commissions upon the exercise of the options. If a Fund, as a covered call
option writer, were unable to effect a closing purchase transaction in a
secondary market, it would not be able to sell the underlying security until the
option expired or it delivers the underlying security upon exercise or otherwise
covers the position. A Fund will not purchase options if, as a result, the
aggregate cost of all outstanding options exceeds 10% of the Fund's total
assets, although no more than 5% will be committed to transactions entered into
for non-hedging purposes. 
A call option written by a Fund is "covered" if the Fund owns
the underlying security covered by the call or has an absolute and immediate
right to acquire that security without additional cash consideration (or for
additional cash consideration held in a segregated account by its custodian)
upon conversion or exchange of other securities held in its portfolio. A call
option is also covered if the Fund holds a call on the same security as the call
written where the exercise price of the call held is (1) equal to or less than
the exercise price of the call written or (2) greater than the exercise price of
the call written if the difference is maintained by the Fund in cash, U.S.
Government securities or other high-grade, short-term obligations in a
segregated account held with its custodian. A put option is "covered" if the
Fund maintains cash or other high-grade, short-term obligations with a value
equal to the exercise price in a segregated account held with its custodian, or
else holds a put on the same security as the put written where the exercise
price of the put held is equal to or greater than the exercise price of the put
written. 
If a Fund has written an option, it may terminate its obligation
by effecting a closing purchase transaction. This is accomplished by purchasing
an option of the same series as the option previously written. However, once a
Fund has been assigned an exercise notice, the Fund will be unable to effect a
closing purchase transaction. Similarly, if a Fund is the holder of an option it
may liquidate its position by effecting a closing sale transaction. This is
accomplished by selling an option of the same series as the option previously
purchased. There can be no assurance that either a closing purchase or sale
transaction can be effected when a Fund so desires. 
A Fund will realize a profit from a closing transaction if the
price of the transaction is less than the premium received from writing the
option or is more than the premium paid to purchase the option; the Fund will
realize a loss from a closing transaction if the price of the transaction is
more than the premium received from writing the option or less than the premium
paid to purchase the option. Because call option prices generally reflect
increases in the price of the underlying security, any loss resulting from the
repurchase of a call option may also be wholly or partially offset by unrealized
appreciation of the underlying security. Other principal factors affecting the
market value of a put or a call option include supply and demand, interest
rates, the current market price and price volatility of the underlying security
and the time remaining until the expiration date. 
In addition to options on securities, a Fund may also purchase
and sell call and put options on securities indexes. A securities index reflects
in a single number the market value of many different securities. Relative
values are assigned to the securities included in an index and the index
fluctuates with changes in the market values of the securities. The options give
the holder the right to receive a cash settlement during the term of the option
based on the difference between the exercise price and the value of the index.
By writing a put or call option on a securities index, a Fund is obligated, in
return for the premium received, to make delivery of this amount. A Fund may
offset its position in index options prior to expiration by entering into a
closing transaction on an exchange or it may let the option expire un-exercised.

Options on securities indexes are similar to options on specific
securities. However, because options on securities indexes do not involve the
delivery of an underlying security, the option represents the holder's right to
obtain, from the writer, cash in an amount equal to a fixed multiple of the
amount by which the exercise price exceeds (in the case of a put) or is less
than (in the case of a call) the closing value of the underlying securities
index on the exercise date. Therefore, while one purpose of writing such options
is to generate additional income for a Fund, the Fund recognizes that it may be
required to deliver an amount of cash in excess of the market value of a
securities index at such time as an option written by the Fund is exercised by
the holder. 
Use of options on securities indexes entails the risk that
trading in the options may be interrupted if trading in certain securities
included in the index is interrupted. The Funds will not purchase these options
unless Alger Management is satisfied with the development, depth and liquidity
of the market and Alger Management believes the options can be closed out.

Price movements in a Fund's securities may not correlate
precisely with movements in the level of an index and, therefore, the use of
options on indexes cannot serve as a complete hedge and would depend, in part,
on the ability of Alger Management to predict correctly movements in the
direction of the market generally or of a particular industry. Because options
on securities indexes require settlement in cash, Alger Management might be
forced to liquidate portfolio securities to meet settlement obligations.

Although Alger Management will attempt to take appropriate
measures to minimize the risks relating to any trading by a Fund in put and call
options, there can be no assurance that the Fund will succeed in any
option-trading program it undertakes. 
Foreign Currency Transactions. Each Fund may enter into
foreign currency transactions for a variety of purposes, including: to fix in
U.S. dollars, between trade and settlement date, the value of a security the
Fund has agreed to buy or sell; to hedge the U.S. dollar value of securities the
Fund already owns, particularly if it expects a decrease in the value of the
currency in which the foreign security is denominated; or to gain or reduce
exposure to the foreign currency for investment purposes. The currency exposure
of the Fund's portfolio typically will be unhedged to the U.S. dollar.

Foreign currency transactions may involve, for example, a Fund's
purchase of foreign currencies for U.S. dollars or the maintenance of short
positions in foreign currencies. A short position would involve the Fund
agreeing to exchange an amount of a currency it did not currently own for
another currency at a future date in anticipation of a decline in the value of
the currency sold relative to the currency the Fund contracted to receive. A
Fund's success in these transactions may depend on the ability of Alger
Management to predict accurately the future exchange rates between foreign
currencies and the U.S. dollar. 
Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short
periods of time. They generally are determined by the forces of supply and
demand in the foreign exchange markets and the relative merits of investments in
different countries, actual or perceived changes in interest rates and other
complex factors, as seen from an international perspective. Currency exchange
rates also can be affected unpredictably by intervention, or failure to
intervene, by U.S. or foreign governments or central banks, or by currency
controls or political developments in the United States or abroad. 
Swap Transactions. Each Fund may engage in swap
transactions, including currency swaps, index swaps and interest rate swaps. A
Fund may enter into swaps for both hedging purposes and to seek to increase
total return. A Fund also may enter into options on swap agreements, sometimes
called "swaptions." 
Swap agreements are two party contracts entered into primarily
by institutional investors for periods ranging from a few weeks to more than one
year. In a standard "swap" transaction, two parties agree to exchange the
returns (or differentials in rates of return) earned or realized on particular
predetermined investments or instruments. The gross returns to be exchanged or
"swapped" between the parties are generally calculated with respect to a
"notional amount," i.e., the return on or increase in value of a particular
dollar amount invested at a particular interest rate, in a particular foreign
currency, or in a "basket" of swaps or securities representing a particular
index. The "notional amount" of the swap agreement is only used as a basis upon
which to calculate the obligations that the parties to a swap agreement have
agreed to exchange. 
Most swap agreements entered into by the Funds are cash settled
and calculate the obligations of the parties to the agreement on a "net basis."
Thus, a Fund's current obligations (or rights) under a swap agreement generally
will be equal only to the net amount to be paid or received under the agreement
based on the relative values of the positions held by each party to the
agreement (the "net amount"). A Fund's current obligations under a swap
agreement will be accrued daily (offset against any amounts owed to the Fund)
and any accrued but unpaid net amounts owed to a swap counterparty will be
covered by the segregation of permissible liquid assets of the Fund. 
A swap option is a contract that gives a counterparty the right
(but not the obligation) in return for payment of a premium, to enter into a new
swap agreement or to shorten, extend, cancel or otherwise modify an existing
swap agreement, at some designated future time on specified terms. A
cash-settled option on a swap gives the purchaser the right in return for the
premium paid, to receive an amount of cash equal to the value of the underlying
swap as of the exercise date. These options typically are purchased in privately
negotiated transactions from financial institutions, including securities
brokerage firms. Depending on the terms of the particular option agreement, a
Fund generally will incur a greater degree of risk when it writes a swap option
than it will incur when it purchases a swap option. When a Fund purchases a swap
option, it risks losing only the amount of the premium it has paid should it
decide to let the option expire unexercised. However, when a Fund writes a swap
option, upon exercise of the option the Fund will become obligated according to
the terms of the underlying agreement. 
The use of swap agreements is a highly specialized activity
which involves strategies and risks different from those associated with
ordinary portfolio security transactions. If Alger Management is incorrect in
its forecasts of applicable market factors, or a counterparty defaults, the
investment performance of the Fund would diminish compared with what it would
have been if these techniques were not used. In addition, it is possible that
developments in the swap market, including potential government regulation,
could adversely affect the Fund's ability to terminate existing swap agreements
or to realize amounts to be received under such agreements. 
A Fund will enter into swap agreements only when Alger
Management believe it would be in the best interests of the Fund to do so. In
addition, a Fund will enter into swap agreements only with counterparties that
meet certain standards of creditworthiness (generally, such counterparties would
have to be eligible counterparties under the terms of the Funds' repurchase
agreement guidelines). 
Combined Transactions. Each Fund may enter into multiple
transactions, including multiple options transactions, multiple futures
transactions, multiple currency transactions including forward currency
contracts and multiple interest rate transactions, structured notes and any
combination of futures, options, currency and interest rate transactions
("component transactions"), instead of a single transaction, as part of a single
or combined strategy when, in the opinion of Alger Management, it is in the best
interests of the Fund to do so. A combined transaction will usually contain
elements of risk that are present in each of its component transactions.
Although combined transactions are normally entered into based on Alger
Management's judgment that the combined strategies will reduce risk or otherwise
more effectively achieve the desired portfolio management goal, it is possible
that the combination will instead increase such risks or hinder achievement of
the portfolio management objective. 
Future Developments. Each Fund may take advantage of
opportunities in options and futures contracts and options on futures contracts
and any other derivatives which are not presently contemplated for use by the
Fund or which are not currently available but which may be developed, to the
extent such opportunities are both consistent with the Fund's investment
objective and legally permissible for the Fund. Before a Fund enters into such
transactions or makes any such investment, the Fund will provide appropriate
disclosure in its Prospectus or this SAI. 
Borrowing
Each Fund may borrow for temporary or emergency purposes. The
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), requires a Fund to
maintain continuous asset coverage (that is, total assets including borrowings
less liabilities exclusive of borrowings) of 300% of the amount borrowed. If
such asset coverage should decline below 300% as a result of market fluctuations
or other reasons, the Fund may be required to sell some of its portfolio
holdings within three days to reduce the debt and restore the 300% asset
coverage, even though it may be disadvantageous from an investment standpoint to
sell securities at that time. The Fund also may be required to maintain minimum
average balances in connection with such borrowing or to pay a commitment or
other fee to maintain a line of credit; either of these requirements would
increase the cost of borrowing over the stated interest rate.

Investment Restrictions
The investment restrictions below have been adopted by the Trust
with respect to the Funds as fundamental policies. Under the 1940 Act, a
"fundamental" policy may not be changed without the vote of a "majority of the
outstanding voting securities" of a Fund, which is defined in the 1940 Act as
the lesser of (a) 67% or more of the shares present at a Fund meeting if the
holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund are present or
represented by proxy or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding shares. Each Fund's
investment objective is a non-fundamental policy, which may be changed by the
Board of Trustees at any time. For each Fund: 


1.
Except as otherwise permitted by the 1940 Act, or interpretations
or modifications by, or exemptive or other relief from, the SEC or other
authority with appropriate jurisdiction, and disclosed to investors, the Fund
may not borrow money, except to the extent permitted under the 1940 Act (which
currently limits borrowing to no more than 33-1/3% of the value of the Fund's
total assets).





2.
Except as otherwise permitted by the 1940 Act, or interpretations or
modifications by, or exemptive or other relief from, the SEC or other authority
with appropriate jurisdiction, and disclosed to investors, the Fund may not act
as an underwriter of securities of other issuers, except to the extent the Fund
may be deemed an underwriter under the Securities Act, by virtue of disposing of
portfolio securities.





3.
Except as otherwise permitted by the 1940 Act, or interpretations
or modifications by, or exemptive or other relief from, the SEC or other
authority with appropriate jurisdiction, and disclosed to investors, the Fund
may not lend any securities or make loans to others. For purposes of this
investment restriction, the purchase of debt obligations (including acquisitions
of loans, loan participations or other forms of debt instruments) and the entry
into repurchase agreements shall not constitute loans by the Fund.





4.
Except as otherwise permitted by the 1940 Act, or interpretations or
modifications by, or exemptive or other relief from, the SEC or other authority
with appropriate jurisdiction, and disclosed to investors, the Fund may not
issue any senior security (as such term is defined in Section 18(f) of the 1940
Act), except insofar as the Fund may be deemed to have issued a senior security
by reason of borrowing money in accordance with the Fund's borrowing policies.
For purposes of this investment restriction, collateral, escrow, or margin or
other deposits with respect to the making of short sales, the purchase or sale
of futures contracts or options, purchase or sale of forward foreign currency
contracts, and the writing of options on securities are not deemed to be an
issuance of senior security.





5.
Except as otherwise permitted by the 1940 Act, or interpretations or
modifications by, or exemptive or other relief from, the SEC or other authority
with appropriate jurisdiction, and disclosed to investors, the Fund may not
purchase, hold or deal in real estate, but the Fund may purchase and sell
securities that are secured by real estate or issued by companies that invest or
deal in real estate or real estate investment trusts and may acquire and hold
real estate or interests therein through exercising rights or remedies with
regard to such securities.





6.
Except as otherwise permitted by the 1940 Act, or interpretations or
modifications by, or exemptive or other relief from, the SEC or other authority
with appropriate jurisdiction, and disclosed to investors, the Fund may not
invest in physical commodities or physical commodities contracts, except that
the Fund may purchase and sell options, forward contracts, futures contracts,
including those related to indices, and options on futures contracts or indices
and enter into swap agreements and other derivative instruments.





7.
Except as otherwise permitted by the 1940 Act, or interpretations or
modifications by, or exemptive or other relief from, the SEC or other authority
with appropriate jurisdiction, and disclosed to investors, the Fund may not
invest more than 25% of the value of its total assets in the securities of
issuers in any single industry, provided that there shall be no limitation on
the purchase of obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its
agencies or instrumentalities or as otherwise permitted by the SEC.



Except in the case of the percentage limitation set forth in Investment
Restriction No. 1, the percentage limitations contained in the foregoing
restrictions apply at the time of the purchase of the securities and a later
increase or decrease in percentage resulting from a change in the values of the
securities or in the amount of a Fund's assets will not constitute a violation
of the restriction. 
PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS 
Decisions to buy and sell securities and other financial instruments for
the Funds are made by Alger Management, which also is responsible for placing
these transactions, subject to the overall review of the Trust's Board of
Trustees. Although investment requirements for the Funds are reviewed
independently from those of the other accounts and funds managed by Alger
Management, investments of the type the Funds may make may also be made by these
other accounts or funds. When a Fund and one or more other funds or accounts
managed by Alger Management are prepared to invest in, or desire to dispose of,
the same security or other financial instrument, available investments or
opportunities for sales will be allocated in a manner believed by Alger
Management to be equitable to each. In some cases, this procedure may affect
adversely the price paid or received by the Fund or the size of the position
obtained or disposed of by the Fund. 
Transactions in equity securities are in most cases effected on U.S. stock
exchanges or in over-the-counter markets and involve the payment of negotiated
brokerage commissions. Where there is no stated commission, as in the case of
certain securities traded in the over-the-counter markets, the prices of those
securities include undisclosed commissions or mark-ups. Purchases and sales of
money market instruments and debt securities usually are principal transactions.
These securities are normally purchased directly from the issuer or from an
underwriter or market maker for the securities. The cost of securities purchased
from underwriters includes an underwriting commission or concession and the
prices at which securities are purchased from and sold to dealers include a
dealer's mark-up or mark-down. U.S. Government securities are generally
purchased from underwriters or dealers, although certain newly-issued U.S.
Government securities may be purchased directly from the U.S. Treasury or from
the issuing agency or instrumentality. 
A Fund's turnover rate is calculated by dividing the lesser of
purchases or sales of securities for the fiscal year by the monthly average of
the value of the Fund's securities, with obligations with less than one year to
maturity excluded. A 100% turnover rate would occur, for example, if all
included securities were replaced once during the year. 
A Fund will not normally engage in the trading of securities for
the purpose of realizing short-term profits, but will adjust its holdings as
considered advisable in view of prevailing or anticipated market conditions, and
turnover will not be a limiting factor should Alger Management deem it advisable
to purchase or sell securities. 
In Alger Management's view, companies are organic entities that
continuously undergo changes in response to, among other things, economic,
market, environmental, technological, political and managerial factors.
Generally, securities will be purchased for capital appreciation and not for
short-term trading profits. However, each Fund may dispose of securities without
regard to the time they have been held when such action, for defensive or other
purposes, appears advisable. Moreover, it is Alger Management's philosophy to
pursue each Fund's investment objective by managing the Fund actively, which may
result in high portfolio turnover. Increased portfolio turnover will have the
effect of increasing the Fund's brokerage and custodial expenses. To the extent
consistent with applicable provisions of the 1940 Act and the rules and
exemptions adopted by the SEC thereunder, as well as other regulatory
requirements, the Trust's Board of Trustees has determined that portfolio
transactions will generally be executed through Fred Alger & Company,
Incorporated ("Alger Inc.") if, in the judgment of Alger Management, the use of
Alger Inc. is likely to result in price and execution at least as favorable as
those of other qualified broker-dealers and if, in particular transactions,
Alger Inc. charges the Funds involved a rate consistent with that which other
broker-dealers charge to comparable unaffiliated customers in similar
transactions. Over-the-counter purchases and sales are transacted directly with
principal market makers except in those cases in which better prices and
executions may be obtained elsewhere. Principal transactions are not entered
into with affiliates of the Trust except pursuant to exemptive rules or orders
adopted by the SEC. 
In selecting brokers or dealers to execute portfolio
transactions on behalf of the Funds, Alger Management seeks the best overall
terms available. In assessing the best overall terms available for any
transaction, Alger Management will consider the factors it deems relevant,
including the breadth of the market in the investment, the price of the
investment, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or
dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific
transaction and on a continuing basis. In addition, Alger Management is
authorized, in selecting parties to execute a particular transaction and in
evaluating the best overall terms available, to consider the brokerage and
research services, as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, provided to the Funds involved, the other
funds and/or other accounts over which Alger Management or its affiliates
exercise investment discretion to the extent permitted by law. Alger
Management's fees under its agreement with the Funds are not reduced by reason
of its receiving brokerage and research services. The Board of Trustees will
periodically review the commissions paid by the Funds to determine if the
commissions paid over representative periods of time are reasonable in relation
to the benefits received by the Fund. 
Alger Inc. does not engage in principal transactions with the
Trust and, accordingly, received no compensation in connection with securities
purchased or sold in that manner, which include securities traded in the
over-the-counter markets, money market investments and most debt securities.

Disclosure of Portfolio Holdings
The Trust, on behalf of the Funds, has ongoing arrangements with
the following persons to disclose each Fund's portfolio holdings. The Funds
provide month-end top ten holdings on a 15 day lag, and month-end full portfolio
holdings on a 60 day lag. 


CRA Rogers Casey
London Pacific Advisers
Wurts & Associates
Wilshire Associates
Callan Associates
Yanni Partners
Prima Capital Holdings, Inc.
ISI Group
Russell Investment Group
NEPC Consulting
Watson Wyatt Investment Consulting



Neither the Trust, the Funds nor any other person is directly
compensated for such disclosure, although certain persons receiving such
disclosure may be investors in one or more funds managed by Alger Management and
may therefore subject to fees applicable to all shareholders. 
NET ASSET VALUE
The price of one share of a class is based on its "net asset
value." Each Fund's net asset value is computed by adding the value of the
Fund's investments plus cash and other assets allocable to the class, deducting
applicable liabilities and then dividing the result by the number of its shares
outstanding. The net asset value of a share of a given class may differ from
that of one or more other classes. Net asset value is calculated as of the close
of business (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) time on each day the New York
Stock Exchange ("NYSE") is open. 
The New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") is generally open on each
Monday through Friday, except New Year's Day, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day
(the third Monday in January), Presidents' Day (the third Monday in February),
Good Friday, Memorial Day (the last Monday in May), Independence Day, Labor Day
(the first Monday in September), Thanksgiving Day (the fourth Thursday in
November) and Christmas Day. 
The assets of each Fund are generally valued on the basis of
market quotations. Securities whose principal market is on an exchange or in the
over-the-counter market are valued at the last reported sales price or, in the
absence of reported sales, at the mean between the bid and asked price or, in
the absence of a recent bid or asked price, the equivalent as obtained from one
or more of the major market makers for the securities to be valued. Bonds and
other fixed income securities may be valued on the basis of prices provided by a
pricing service when the Trust's Board of Trustees believes that these prices
reflect the fair market value of the securities. Other investments and other
assets, including restricted securities and securities for which market
quotations are not readily available, are valued at fair value under procedures
approved by the Trust' Board of Trustees. Short-term securities with maturities
of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, which constitutes fair value as
determined by the Trust's Board of Trustees. 
PURCHASES, REDEMPTIONS AND EXCHANGES
Shares of the Funds are offered continuously by the Funds and
are distributed on a best efforts basis by Alger Inc. as principal underwriter
for the Funds pursuant to a distribution agreement (the "Distribution
Agreement"). Under the Distribution Agreement, Alger Inc. bears all selling
expenses, including the costs of advertising and of printing prospectuses and
distributing them to prospective shareholders. 
Third-party checks will not be honored except in the case of
employer-sponsored retirement plans. You will be charged a fee for any check
returned by your bank. 
Investors may exchange stock of companies acceptable to Alger
Management for shares of the Funds with a minimum of 100 shares of each company
generally being required. The Funds believe such exchange provides a means by
which holders of certain securities may invest in the Funds without the expense
of selling the securities in the open market. The investor should furnish,
either in writing or by telephone, to Alger Management a list with a full and
exact description of all securities proposed for exchange. Alger Management will
then notify the investor as to whether the securities are acceptable and, if so,
will send a letter of transmittal to be completed and signed by the investor.
Alger Management has the right to reject all or any part of the securities
offered for exchange. The securities must then be sent in proper form for
transfer with the letter of transmittal to the Custodian of the Funds' assets.
The investor must certify that there are no legal or contractual restrictions on
the free transfer and sale of the securities. Upon receipt by the Custodian the
securities will be valued as of the close of business on the day of receipt in
the same manner as the Funds' securities are valued each day. Shares of the
Funds having an equal net asset as of the close of the same day will be
registered in the investor's name. Applicable sales charges, if any, will apply,
but there is no charge for making the exchange and no brokerage commission on
the securities accepted, although applicable stock transfer taxes, if any, may
be deducted. The exchange of securities by the investor pursuant to this offer
may constitute a taxable transaction and may result in a gain or loss for
federal income tax purposes. The tax treatment experienced by investors may vary
depending upon individual circumstances. Each investor should consult a tax
adviser to determine federal, state and local tax consequences. 
Confirmations and Account Statements
All of your transactions through the Transfer Agent, Boston
Financial Data Services, Inc., will be confirmed on separate written transaction
confirmations (other than Spectra Automatic Investment Plan transactions) and on
periodic account statements. You should promptly and carefully review the
transaction confirmations and periodic statements provided to you and notify the
Transfer Agent in writing of any discrepancy or unauthorized account activity.
Any information contained on transaction confirmations and account statements
will be conclusive unless you notify the Transfer Agent of an apparent
discrepancy or unauthorized account activity within ten (10) business days after
the information is transmitted to you. 
Purchases Through Processing Organizations
You can purchase and redeem shares through a "Processing
Organization," which is a broker-dealer, bank or other financial institution
that purchases shares of one or more Funds for its clients or customers. The
Funds may authorize a Processing Organization to receive, or to designate other
financial organizations to receive, purchase and redemption orders on a Fund's
behalf. In that case, the Fund will be deemed to have received an order when the
Processing Organization or its intermediary receives it in proper form, and the
order will be processed based on the net asset value of the Fund next calculated
after the order is received in proper form by the Processing Organization or its
designee. 
When shares are purchased this way, the Processing Organization,
rather than its customer, may be the shareholder of record of the shares. The
minimum initial and subsequent investments in classes of the Funds for
shareholders who invest through a Processing Organization will be set by the
Processing Organization. Processing Organizations, which may include broker-
dealers, banks or other financial institutions, may impose charges and
restrictions in addition to or different from those applicable if you invest in
a Fund directly. Therefore, you should read the materials provided by the
Processing Organization in conjunction with the Prospectus. Certain Processing
Organizations may receive compensation from the Funds, Alger, Inc., or any of
its affiliates. 
Automatic Investment Plan
Purchases into your account will be made on the fifteenth and/or
last business day of each month. If the fifteenth falls on a weekend or a NYSE
holiday, the purchase shall be made on the next business day. In order to
participate, your account must be held by a bank which is a member of the
Automated Clearing House. Please note that transfers from your bank account to a
fund sponsored retirement account will be considered current year contributions.

While there is no charge to shareholders for this service, a fee
will be deducted from a shareholder's Fund account in the case of insufficient
funds. A shareholder's Spectra Automatic Investment Plan may be terminated at
any time without charge or penalty by the shareholder, the Funds, the Transfer
Agent or Alger Inc. 
TelePurchase and TeleRedemption
The price the shareholder will receive will be the price next
computed after the Transfer Agent receives the TelePurchase or TeleRedemption
request from the shareholder to purchase shares or redeem shares, respectively.
You can apply for TelePurchase or TeleRedemption by completing an Additional
Services Form and returning it to the Transfer Agent. Although the Funds are
authorized to charge a fee of $17 for each Automated Clearing House redemption,
they does not currently intend to do so. To use these privileges, your bank must
be a member of the Automated Clearing House. Shares held in any Spectra
retirement plan and shares issued in certificate form are not eligible for this
service. 
Redemptions and Exchanges
You may incur a 2.00% redemption fee if you redeem shares of the
Funds within 30 days of having acquired them. Shareholders claiming waivers of
the redemption fee must assert their status at the time of redemption.

The right of redemption of shares of the Funds may be suspended,
or the date of payment postponed for more than seven days, (a) for any periods
during which the NYSE is closed (other than for customary weekend and holiday
closings), (b) when trading in the markets a Fund normally utilizes is
restricted, or an emergency, as defined by the rules and regulations of the SEC,
exists, making disposal of a Fund's investments or determination of its net
asset value not reasonably practicable or (c) for such other periods as the SEC
by order may permit for protection of a Fund's shareholders. 
No interest will accrue on amounts represented by uncashed
distribution or redemption checks. 
Telephone Redemptions
You automatically have the ability to make redemptions by
telephone unless you refuse the telephone redemption privilege. To sell shares
by telephone, please call (800)711-6141. Redemption requests received prior to
the close of business of the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) will
generally be mailed on the next business day. Shares held in any Alger
retirement plan and shares issued in certificate form are not eligible for this
service. 
Redemption proceeds are mailed to the address of record. Any
request for redemption proceeds to be sent to the address of record must be in
writing with the signature(s) guaranteed if made within 60 days of changing your
address. 
The Funds, the Transfer Agent and their affiliates are not
liable for acting in good faith on telephone instructions relating to your
account, so long as they follow reasonable procedures to determine that the
telephone instructions are genuine. Such procedures may include recording the
telephone calls and requiring some form of personal identification. You should
verify the accuracy of telephone transactions immediately upon receipt of your
confirmation statement. 
Redemptions in Kind
Payment for shares tendered for redemption is ordinarily made in
cash. However, the Board of Trustees of the Trust has adopted procedures which
provide that if the Board determines that it would be detrimental to the best
interest of the remaining shareholders of the Funds to make payment of a
redemption order wholly or partly in cash, the Fund may pay the redemption
proceeds in whole or in part by a distribution "in kind" of securities from the
Fund, in lieu of cash, in conformity with applicable rules of the SEC. The Trust
has elected to be governed by Rule 18f-1 under the 1940 Act, pursuant to which
each Fund is obligated to redeem shares solely in cash up to the lesser of
$250,000 or 1% of the net assets of the Fund during any 90-day period for any
one shareholder. If shares are redeemed in kind, the redeeming shareholder might
incur brokerage or other costs in selling the securities for cash. The method of
valuing securities used to make redemptions in kind will be the same as the
method each Fund uses to value its portfolio securities and such valuation will
be made as of the time the redemption price is determined. 
Systematic Withdrawal Plan
A systematic withdrawal plan (the "Withdrawal Plan") is
available to shareholders who own shares of a Fund with a value exceeding
$10,000 and who wish to receive specific amounts of cash periodically.
Withdrawals of at least $50 monthly (but no more than 1% of the value of a
shareholder's shares in the Fund) may be made under the Withdrawal Plan by
redeeming as many shares of the Fund as may be necessary to cover the stipulated
withdrawal payment. To the extent that withdrawals exceed dividends,
distributions and appreciation of a shareholder's investment in a Fund, there
will be a reduction in the value of the shareholder's investment and continued
withdrawal payments may reduce the shareholder's investment and ultimately
exhaust it. Withdrawal payments should not be considered as income from
investment in the Fund. 
Shareholders who wish to participate in the Withdrawal Plan and
who hold their shares in certificated form must deposit their share certificates
of a Fund from which withdrawals will be made with Alger Shareholder Services,
Inc., as agent for Withdrawal Plan members. All dividends and distributions on
shares in the Withdrawal Plan are automatically reinvested at net asset value in
additional shares of the Fund. For additional information regarding the
Withdrawal Plan, contact the Funds. 
Signature Guarantees
The Transfer Agent has adopted standards and procedures pursuant
to which Medallion Signature Guarantees in proper form generally will be
accepted from domestic banks, brokers, dealers, credit unions, and national
securities exchanges, that are participants in the New York Stock Exchange
Medallion Signature Program (MSP), the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion
Program (STAMP), and the Stock Exchanges Medallion Program (SEMP). 
Exchange Privilege
Shareholders may exchange shares of a Fund for shares of the
other portfolios of the Trust and the Alger Money Market Fund ("MMF") of The
Alger Funds, another mutual fund managed by Alger Management, and conversely may
also exchange shares of MMF for Fund shares. MMF shares acquired in such
exchanges, together with MMF shares acquired through reinvestment of dividends
on such shares, may be exchanged for shares of a Fund, but only for Fund shares
of the same class as those originally exchanged for MMF shares. These exchanges
will normally be effected at the respective net asset values of the Fund and MMF
next determined after the exchange request is accepted, with no sales charge or
transaction fee imposed. If you exchange shares of a Fund for shares of MMF
within 30 days of purchase (including purchase by exchange into the Fund), the
Fund may impose a redemption fee of 2.00% of the amount redeemed. 
Shares of MMF received in an exchange will earn dividends
beginning on the next business day after the exchange. Before exchanging Fund
shares for MMF shares, an investor should carefully read a Prospectus describing
MMF. To obtain a Prospectus for The Alger Funds and more information about such
exchanges, please call (800) 711-6141. The Funds reserve the right to terminate
or modify this exchange privilege or to charge a per-exchange fee upon notice to
shareholders. 
For tax purposes, an exchange of shares is treated as a sale of
the shares exchanged and therefore you may realize a taxable gain or loss when
you exchange shares. 
MANAGEMENT
Trustees and Officers of
the Fund
The Trust is governed by a Board of Trustees which is
responsible for protecting the interests of shareholders under Massachusetts
law. The Board of Trustees has two standing committees: an Audit Committee and a
Nominating Committee. The Audit Committee oversees (a) each Fund's accounting
and financial reporting policies and practices and its internal controls and (b)
the quality and objectivity of each Fund's financial statements and the
independent audit thereof. The function of the Nominating/Governance Committee
is to select and nominate all candidates who are not "interested persons" of the
Trust ("Independent Trustees") for election to the Trust's Board. The members of
the Committee are Lester L. Colbert, Jr., Stephen E. O'Neil and Nathan E.
Saint-Amand. The Nominating/Committee is composed of all the Independent
Trustees.

event of termination, such as death or resignation, or until his or her
successor is duly elected; each officer's term of office is one year. Each of
the Trustees has been nominated to serve on the Boards of Trustees/Directors of
the other five registered investment companies in the Fund Complex. If the
Trustees are elected to serve on the boards of those funds, each Trustee would
oversee all the portfolios in the Fund Complex. As of the date of this SAI,
there were 23 portfolios in the Fund Complex. Shareholders of certain portfolios
are being solicited to vote at a meeting scheduled to be held in January 2007 to
approve the reorganization of their portfolios into other portfolios in the Fund
Complex. If all of the reorganizations are approved by shareholders, each
Trustee will oversee 19 portfolios in the Fund Complex.

None of the Independent Trustees and none of their immediate
family members owns any securities issued by Alger Management, Alger Inc., or
any company (other than a registered investment company) controlling, controlled
by or under common control with Alger Management or Alger Inc. 
Investment Adviser and Administrator
Alger Management serves as investment adviser to each Fund
pursuant to a written agreement (the "Advisory Agreement") and under the
supervision of the Board of Trustees. As Manager, Alger Management makes
investment decisions for each Fund and continuously reviews its investment
program. Alger Management also serves as Administrator to the Funds and is
responsible for the overall administration of the Funds pursuant to a written
agreement (the "Administration Agreement"). As Administrator, Alger Management
provides administrative services to the Funds, including: providing office
space, telephone, office equipment and supplies; authorizing expenditures and
approves bills for payment on behalf of the Funds; supervising preparation of
periodic shareholder reports, notices and other shareholder communications;
supervising the daily pricing of the Funds' investment portfolios and the
publication of the net asset value of the Funds' shares, earnings reports and
other financial data; monitoring relationships with organizations providing
services to the Funds, including the Funds' custodian, transfer agent and
printers; providing trading desk facilities for the Funds; and supervising
compliance by the Funds with recordkeeping and periodic reporting requirements
under the 1940 Act. 
It is anticipated that Alger Inc., an affiliate of Alger
Management, will serve as the Trust's broker in effecting most of the Funds'
transactions on securities exchanges and will retain commissions in accordance
with certain regulations of the SEC. In addition, Alger Management employs
professional securities analysts who provide research services exclusively to
the Funds and other accounts for which Alger Management or its affiliates serve
as investment adviser or subadviser. Alger Management bears all expenses in
connection with the performance of its services under the Advisory Agreement and
the Administration Agreement. 
Alger Management has been in the business of providing
investment advisory services since 1964 and, as of December 31, 2006, had
approximately $7.6 billion under management as well as $1.9 billion in other
assets. Alger Management is owned by Alger Inc. which in turn is owned by Alger
Associates, a financial services holding company. As of the date of this SAI,
over 25% of the outstanding voting securities of Alger Associates, is indirectly
held by Mr. Frederick M. Alger, III, the former Chairman of the Board of Alger
Management and of the Trust's Board. As of October 2, 2006, Mr. Alger retired as
Chairman of the Board of Alger Management and of the Trust's Board and commenced
the process to relinquish ownership control of Alger Associates and, indirectly,
Alger Management. Upon consummation of this process, Alger Associates and,
indirectly, Alger Management, will be controlled by Mr. Alger's three daughters,
Hilary M. Alger, Nicole D. Alger and Alexandra D. Alger, each of whom will own
33% of the voting rights of Alger Management. This process is expected to be
completed in February 2007. 
Alchemy Fund pays Alger Management an advisory fee computed
daily and paid monthly at the annual rate of .81% of the Fund's average daily
net assets. International Fund pays Alger Management an advisory fee computed
daily and paid monthly at the annual rate of .96% of the Fund's average daily
net assets. Each Fund also pays Alger Management an administrative fee at the
annual rate of .04% of that Fund's average daily net assets. 
Description of Portfolio
Manager Compensation Structure 
A portfolio manager's compensation generally consists of salary
and an annual bonus. In addition, portfolio managers are eligible for standard
health and retirement benefits available to all Alger Management employees,
including a 401(k) plan sponsored by Alger Management. A portfolio manager's
base salary is typically a function of the portfolio manager's experience (with
consideration given to type, investment style and size of investment portfolios
previously managed), performance of his job responsibilities, and financial
services industry peer comparisons. Base salary is generally a fixed amount that
is subject to an annual review. The annual bonus is variable from year to year,
and considers various factors, including: 



�
the firm's overall financial results and profitability;






�
the firm's overall investment management performance;






�
current year's and prior years' investment performance (both relative and
absolute) of the portfolios for which the individual is responsible; and






�
the individual's leadership contribution within the firm.

Securities Owned by the
Portfolio Managers
The portfolio managers did not own any shares of the Funds as of
the date of this SAI. 
Potential Conflicts of
Interest 
Each Fund's portfolio managers are generally responsible for
managing several accounts for several clients. In addition to Alger mutual
funds, these other accounts may include separate accounts, mutual funds
sub-advised by Alger Management, and other investment vehicles. Moreover, the
size of these accounts can vary significantly from the size of the Funds.
Potential conflicts of interest exist when a portfolio manager has
responsibility and makes investment decisions involving such accounts. While
investment decisions for accounts are made with consideration of their
respective investment objectives and constraints, availability of cash for
investment, current holdings and size of investment positions, it is therefore
possible that a particular security may be bought or sold for only one account,
or in different amounts and at different times for different accounts. To
address this conflict, the Manager has developed trade allocation policies and
procedures designed to avoid action that would result in intentional an improper
advantage or disadvantage to any one account managed by Alger Management.
Accordingly, transactions are generally allocated among accounts in a manner
believed by the Manager to be most equitable to each account, generally using a
pro-rata allocation methodology. Exceptions to pro-rata allocation are made to
recognize the investment needs and particular restrictions of each individual
account, including but not limited to consideration of issuer concentration,
industry exposure, asset class exposure, credit exposure, available cash, desire
to eliminate and/or not establish de minimis positions, and to accounts with
specialized investment policies and objectives. 
Distribution Plan
Under a distribution plan (the "Plan") adopted in accordance
with Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act, each Fund may pay Alger Inc. a fee, at an
annual rate of up to 0.25% of the average daily net assets of the Fund's Class N
shares primarily for remittance to qualified plan service providers and other
financial intermediaries as compensation for distribution assistance and
shareholder services with respect to the Fund's shares. The Plan is a
"compensation" type plan and permits the payment at an annual rate of up to
0.25% of the average daily net assets allocable to Class N shares of the Funds
for recordkeeping and administrative services as well as activities that are
primarily intended to result in sales of shares of the Funds, including but not
limited to preparing, printing and distributing prospectuses, SAIs, shareholder
reports, and educational materials to investors; compensating selling personnel;
responding to inquiries by investors; receiving and answering correspondence;
investor-level recordkeeping and administrative services; and similar
activities. The Trustees unanimously approved the Plan on December 12, 2006, and
it will become effective, with respect to each Fund, upon the commencement of
the Fund's investment operations. The Plan and any related agreement that is
entered into by the Trust in connection with the Plan will continue in effect
for a period of more than one year only so long as continuance is specifically
approved at least annually by a vote of a majority of the Trustees and of a
majority of the Independent Trustees, and who have no direct or indirect
financial interest in the operation of the Plan or any related agreements. All
material amendments to the Plan must be approved by a majority vote of the
Trustees, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, at a meeting called
for that purpose. The Plan may not be amended to increase materially the amount
to be spent with respect to a Fund without the approval of the affected class of
shareholders of the Fund. In addition, the Plan may be terminated with respect
to a Fund at any time, without penalty, by vote of a majority of the outstanding
affected class of shares of the Fund or by vote of a majority of the Independent
Trustees. 
The Funds may compensate certain entities other than Alger Inc.
and its affiliates for providing recordkeeping and/or administrative services to
participating retirement plans and other institutional investors holding Fund
shares. This compensation may be paid at an annual rate of up to 0.25% of the
net asset value of shares of the Fund held by those accounts. 
Expenses of the Funds 
Operating expenses for the Funds generally consist of all costs
not specifically borne by Alger Management, including custodian fees, Trustees'
fees, transfer agency fees, legal fees, auditing costs, investment management
fees, fees for necessary professional and brokerage services, costs of
regulatory compliance and costs associated with maintaining legal existence and
shareholder relations. In addition, the Funds may compensate Alger Inc. for
servicing shareholder accounts. From time to time, Alger Management, in its sole
discretion and as it deems appropriate, may assume certain expenses of the Funds
while retaining the ability to be reimbursed by the Funds for such amounts prior
to the end of the fiscal year. This will have the effect of lowering a Fund's
overall expense ratio and of increasing return to investors, or the converse, at
the time such amounts are assumed or reimbursed, as the case may be. 
Distributor 
From time to time Alger Inc., at its expense from its own
resources, may compensate brokers, dealers, investment advisers or others
("financial intermediaries") who are instrumental in effecting investments by
their clients or customers in the Funds, in an amount up to 1% of those
investments. Alger Inc. may also from time to time, at its expense from its own
resources, make payments to other financial intermediaries that provide
shareholder servicing or transaction processing with such payments structured as
a percentage of gross sales, a percentage of net assets, and/or as a fixed
dollar amount (the latter as a per account fee or as reimbursement for
transaction processing and transmission charges). Payments under these other
arrangements may vary but generally will not exceed 0.50% annually of Fund
assets or 0.50% annually of Fund sales attributable to that financial
intermediary. Alger Inc. determines whether to make any additional cash payments
and the amount of any such payments in response to requests from financial
intermediaries, based on factors Alger Inc. deems relevant. Factors considered
by Alger, Inc. generally include the financial intermediary's reputation,
ability to attract and retain assets for the Funds, expertise in distributing a
particular class of shares of the Funds, entry into target markets, and/or
quality of service. 
Financial intermediaries with whom Alger Inc. has its most
significant arrangements to make additional cash compensation payments are AG
Edwards, Bear Stearns, Capital Investment Brokerage, CIBC World Markets,
Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Kemper Investors, Legg Mason Wood Walker, Leonard
& Company, Lincoln Financial Advisors, Lincoln Investment Planning, Merrill
Lynch Pierce Fenner & Smith, Oppenheimer &Co., Inc., MetLife Securities,
Morgan Stanley & Co., RBC Dain Rauscher, Retirement System Distributors,
Ryan Beck & Co., Securities America, Smith Hayes Financial, UBS, USI
Securities and Walnut Street Securities. In addition, Alger, Inc. may make
payments to dealer firms in the form of payments for marketing support, seminar
support, training meetings, or comparable expenses in the discretion of Alger
Inc. Please contact your financial intermediary for details about revenue
sharing payments it may receive. Any payments described above will not change
the price paid by investors for the purchase of shares of the Funds or the
amount of proceeds received by the Funds on the sale of shares.

CODE OF ETHICS 
Alger Management personnel ("Access Persons") are permitted to
engage in personal securities transactions, including transactions in securities
that may be purchased or held by the Funds, subject to the restrictions and
procedures of the Trust's Code of Ethics. Pursuant to the Code of Ethics, Access
Persons generally must preclear all personal securities transactions prior to
trading and are subject to certain prohibitions on personal trading. You can get
a copy of the Trust's Code of Ethics by calling the Trust toll-free at (800)
711-6141. 
TAXES 
The following is a summary of selected federal income tax
considerations that may affect the Funds and their shareholders. The summary is
not intended to substitute for individual tax advice and investors are urged to
consult their own tax advisers as to the federal, state and local tax
consequences of investing in the Funds. 
Each Fund intends to qualify as a "regulated investment company"
under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"). If qualified as a regulated investment company, a Fund will pay no
federal income taxes on its taxable net investment income (that is, taxable
income other than net realized capital gains) and its net realized capital gains
that are distributed to shareholders. To qualify under Subchapter M, a Fund
must, among other things: (1) distribute to its shareholders at least 90% of its
taxable net investment income and net realized short-term capital gains; (2)
derive at least 90% of its gross income from dividends, interest, payments with
respect to loans of securities, gains from the sale or other disposition of
securities, or other income (including, but not limited to, gains from options,
futures and forward contracts) derived with respect to the Fund's business of
investing in securities; and (3) diversify its holdings so that, at the end of
each fiscal quarter of the Fund (a) at least 50% of the market value of the
Fund's assets is represented by cash, U.S. Government securities and other
securities, with those other securities limited, with respect to any one issuer,
to an amount no greater in value than 5% of the Fund's total assets and to not
more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer, and (b) not
more than 25% of the market value of the Fund's assets is invested in the
securities of any one issuer (other than U.S. Government securities or
securities of other regulated investment companies) or of two or more issuers
that the Fund controls and that are determined to be in the same or similar
trades or businesses or related trades or businesses. In meeting these
requirements, a Fund may be restricted in the utilization of certain of the
investment techniques described above and in the Funds' prospectus. As a
regulated investment company, each Fund is subject to a non-deductible excise
tax of 4% with respect to certain undistributed amounts of income and capital
gains during the calendar year. The Trust expects each Fund to make additional
distributions or change the timing of its distributions so as to avoid the
application of this tax. Although the Trust expects each Fund to make such
distributions as are necessary to avoid the application of this tax, certain of
such distributions, if made in January, might be included in the taxable income
of shareholders in the year ended in the previous December. 
Payments reflecting the dividend income of the Funds will not
qualify for the dividends-received deduction for corporations if the Fund sells
the underlying stock before satisfying a 46-day holding period requirement (91
days for certain preferred stock). Dividends-received deductions will be allowed
to a corporate shareholder only if similar holding period requirements with
respect to shares of the Fund have been met. 
In general, any gain or loss on the redemption or exchange of
Fund shares will be long-term capital gain or loss if held by the shareholder
for more than one year, and will be short-term capital gain or loss if held for
one year or less. However, if a shareholder receives a distribution taxable as
long-term capital gain with respect to Fund shares, and redeems or exchanges the
shares before holding them for more than six months, any loss on the redemption
or exchange up to the amount of the distribution will be treated as a long-term
capital loss. 
Dividends of a Fund's net investment income and distributions of
its short-term capital gains will generally be taxable as ordinary income.
Distributions of long-term capital gains will be taxable as such at the
appropriate rate, regardless of the length of time you have held shares of the
Fund. 
If a Fund is the holder of record of any stock on the record
date for any dividends payable with respect to such stock, such dividends are
included in the Fund's gross income as of the later of (a) the date such stock
became ex-dividend with respect to such dividends (i.e., the date on which a
buyer of the stock would not be entitled to receive the declared, but unpaid,
dividends) or (b) the date the Fund acquired such stock. Accordingly, in order
to satisfy its income distribution requirements, a Fund may be required to pay
dividends based on anticipated earnings and shareholders may receive dividends
in an earlier year than would otherwise be the case. 
Investors considering buying shares of a Fund just prior to a
record date for a taxable dividend or capital gain distribution should be aware
that, regardless of whether the price of the Fund shares to be purchased
reflects the amount of the forthcoming dividend or distribution payment, any
such payment will be a taxable dividend or distribution payment. 
If a shareholder fails to furnish a correct taxpayer
identification number, fails to fully report dividend or interest income, or
fails to certify that he or she has provided a correct taxpayer identification
number and that he or she is not subject to such withholding, then the
shareholder may be subject to a 28 percent "backup withholding tax" with respect
to (i) any taxable dividends and distributions and (ii) any proceeds of any
redemption of Fund shares. An individual's taxpayer identification number is his
or her social security number. The 28 percent backup withholding tax is not an
additional tax and may be credited against a shareholder's regular federal
income tax liability. 
Shortly after the close of each calendar year, you will receive
a statement setting forth the dollar amounts of dividends and any distributions
for the prior calendar year and the tax status of the dividends and
distributions for federal income tax purposes. You should consult your tax
adviser to assess the federal, state and local tax consequences of investing in
each Fund. This discussion is not intended to address the tax consequences of an
investment by a nonresident alien. 
CUSTODIAN AND TRANSFER AGENT 
State Street Bank and Trust Company ("State Street"), One
Lincoln Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, serves as custodian of each Fund's
assets pursuant to a custodian agreement. State Street also serves as transfer
agent for the Trust, on behalf of the Funds, pursuant to a transfer agency
agreement, with transfer agent services provided by State Street's affiliate,
Boston Financial Data Services, Inc. ("Boston Financial"). Under the transfer
agency agreement, Boston Financial processes purchases and redemptions of shares
of the Funds, maintains the shareholder account records for the Funds, handles
certain communications between shareholders and the Funds and distributes any
dividends and distributions payable by the Funds. The Trust, on behalf of the
Funds, and Alger Inc. (or its affiliates) may enter into an agreement for
recordkeeping services. Similarly, the Trust, Alger Inc. (or its affiliates) and
non-affiliated third-party service providers may enter into agreements for
record keeping services. 
Under the transfer agency agreement, Boston Financial is
compensated on a per-account and, for certain transactions, a per-transaction
basis. The Trust has entered into a Shareholder Administrative Services
Agreement with Alger Shareholder Services, Inc. (an affiliate of Alger Inc. and
the Trust's transfer agent prior to November 22, 2004) to compensate Alger
Shareholder Services Inc. on a per account basis for its liaison and
administrative oversight of Boston Financial and related services. 
CERTAIN SHAREHOLDERS 
Neither Fund had offered its shares prior to the date of this
SAI and has had no shareholders. 
ORGANIZATION 
The Trust is a diversified, open-end management investment
company. From its inception in 1968 until February 12, 1996, the Trust was
organized as a Massachusetts business corporation, and had operated as a
registered closed-end investment company since 1978. Shares of closed-end
investment companies, unlike those of open-end companies, are ordinarily not
redeemable and are not continuously offered for sale to the public. On February
12, 1996, the Trust reorganized as a Massachusetts business trust and also
converted to an open-end investment company, or "mutual fund." In connection
with the reorganization, the name of the Trust was changed from "Spectra Fund,
Inc." to "Spectra Fund." The Trust is authorized to offer an unlimited number of
shares. The Trust intends to change its name to "The Spectra Funds" in early
2007. 
The Trust is a "series fund," which is a mutual fund divided
into separate portfolios, each of which is treated as a separate entity for
certain matters under the 1940 Act and for other purposes. A shareholder of one
portfolio is not deemed to be a shareholder of any other portfolio. For certain
matters shareholders vote together as a group; as to others they vote separately
by portfolio. 
To date, the Board has authorized the creation of four series of
shares. All consideration received by the Trust for shares of a series, and all
assets in which such consideration is invested, will belong to that series
(subject only to the rights of creditors of the Trust) and will be subject to
the liabilities related thereto. The income attributable to, and the expenses
of, a series will be treated separately from those of the other series. The
Trust has the ability to create, from time to time, new series without
shareholder approval. 
Rule 18f-2 under the 1940 Act provides that any matter required
to be submitted under the provisions of the 1940 Act or applicable state law or
otherwise to the holders of the outstanding voting securities of an investment
company, such as the Trust, will not be deemed to have been effectively acted
upon unless approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
each series affected by such matter. Rule 18f-2 further provides that a series
shall be deemed to be affected by a matter unless it is clear that the interests
of each series in the matter are identical or that the matter does not affect
any interest of such series. The Rule exempts the selection of the independent
registered public accounting firm and the election of Trustees from the separate
voting requirements of the Rule. 
Although, as a Massachusetts business trust, the Trust is not
required by law to hold annual shareholder meetings, it may hold meetings from
time to time on important matters, and shareholders have the right to call a
meeting to remove a Trustee or to take other action described in the Trust's
Declaration of Trust. Meetings of shareholders normally will not be held for the
purpose of electing Trustees unless and until such time as less than a majority
of the Trustees holding office have been elected by shareholders, at which time
the Trustees then in office will call a shareholders' meeting for the election
of Trustees. Under the Act, shareholders of record of no less than two-thirds of
the outstanding shares of the Trust may remove a Trustee through a declaration
in writing or by vote cast in person or by proxy at a meeting called for that
purpose. Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustees are required to call a meeting
of shareholders for the purpose of voting on the question of removal of any such
Trustee when requested in writing to do so by the shareholders of record of not
less than 10% of the Fund's outstanding shares. 
Shares do not have cumulative voting rights, which means that
holders of more than 50% of the shares voting for the election of Trustees can
elect all Trustees. Shares have equal voting rights, which cannot be adversely
modified other than by majority vote. Shares are transferable but have no
preemptive, conversion or subscription rights. Physical shares certificates are
not issued for shares of the Trust. 
Massachusetts law provides that shareholders could, under
certain circumstances, be held personally liable for the obligations of the
Trust. However, the Trust Agreement disclaims shareholder liability for acts or
obligations of the Trust and requires that notice of such disclaimer be given in
each agreement, obligation or instrument entered into or executed by the Trust
or a Trustee. The Trust Agreement provides for indemnification from the Trust's
property for all losses and expenses of any shareholder held personally liable
for the obligations of the Trust. Thus, the risk of a shareholder's incurring
financial loss on account of shareholder liability is limited to circumstances
in which the Trust itself would be unable to meet its obligations, a possibility
that the Trust believes is remote. Upon payment of any liability incurred by the
Trust, the shareholder paying the liability will be entitled to reimbursement
from the general assets of the Trust. The Trustees intend to conduct the
operations of the Trust in a manner so as to avoid, as far as possible, ultimate
liability of the shareholders for liabilities of the Trust. 
Each Fund is classified as a "diversified" investment company
under the 1940 Act. Accordingly, the Fund is required, with respect to 75% of
its assets, to limit its investment in one issuer (other than the U.S.
government) to no more than 5% of the investment company's total assets. Each
Fund intends to qualify as a "regulated investment company" under the Internal
Revenue Code; one of the requirements for such qualification is a quarterly
diversification test, applicable to 50% (rather than 75%) of the Fund's assets,
similar to the requirement stated above. 
PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES 
The Board of Trustees of the Trust has delegated authority to
vote all proxies related to each Fund's portfolio securities to Alger
Management. Alger Management, an investment adviser registered under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, maintains discretionary authority
over client accounts, including the Funds, and is responsible for voting proxies
of all foreign and domestic securities held in the Funds. Management views the
responsibility its clients have entrusted to it seriously and has adopted and
implemented written policies and procedures designed to ensure that proxies are
voted in the best interests of its clients. 
Alger Management delegates its proxy voting authority for all
foreign and domestic securities held in the Funds to Institutional Shareholder
Services, Inc. ("ISS"), a leading proxy voting service provider and registered
investment adviser. ISS votes proxies strictly in accordance with pre-determined
proxy voting guidelines in order to minimize conflicts of interest. The
pre-determined proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below, address
matters such as operations, board of directors, proxy contests, anti-takeover
defenses, mergers and corporate restructuring, state of incorporation, capital
structure, executive and director compensation, social and environmental issues
and mutual fund proxies. ISS will recuse itself from voting proxies should it
have a material conflict of interest with the company whose proxies are at
issue. Alger Management monitors ISS' proxy voting policies and procedures on a
quarterly basis to ensure that the proxies are voted in the best interests of
the Funds. 
Alger Management maintains records of its proxy voting policies
and procedures. Alger Management or ISS, on Management's behalf, maintains proxy
statements received regarding securities held by the Funds; records of votes
cast on behalf of the Funds; records of requests for proxy voting information;
and any documents prepared that were material to making a voting decision.

No later than August 31st each year, each Fund's proxy voting
record for the most recent 12 months ended June 30th will be available upon
request by calling (800) 992-3863 and/on the Fund's website and on the SEC's
website at http://www.sec.gov. 
The following is a summary of the pre-determined voting
guidelines used by Alger Management or ISS, on Alger Management's behalf, to
vote proxies of securities held by the Funds. 
Operational Issues 
Vote FOR proposals to ratify auditors, unless an auditor has a
financial interest in the company, fees for non-audit services are excessive or
there is reason to believe that the auditor's opinion is inaccurate. 
Board of Directors 
Votes on director nominees in uncontested elections are made on
a case-by-case basis, examining such factors as the independence of the
board and key board committees, attendance at board meetings, corporate
governance provisions and takeover activity. 
Proxy Contests 
Votes in a contested election of directors are evaluated on a
case-by-case basis considering such factors as the management's track
record, qualifications of director nominees and an evaluation of what each side
is offering shareholders. 
Anti-Takeover Defenses 
Vote FOR shareholder proposals that ask a company to submit its
poison pill for shareholder ratification. 
Mergers and Corporate Restructurings 
Vote on a case-by-case basis on mergers and corporate
restructurings based on factors such as financial issues and terms of the offer.

State of Incorporation 
Proposals for changing a company's state of incorporation are
evaluated on a case-by-case basis, giving consideration to both financial
and corporate governance concerns, including the reasons for reincorporating.

Capital Structure 
Vote AGAINST proposals at companies with dual-class capital
structures to increase the number of authorized shares of the class of stock
that has superior voting rights; Vote FOR proposals to approve increases beyond
the allowable increase when a company's shares are in danger of being de-listed.

Executive and Director Compensation 
Votes are determined on a case-by-case basis analyzing

Item 24.

None.






Item 25.

Indemnification.




����������
Under Section 8.4 of Registrant's Agreement and Declaration of Trust, any past
or present Trustee or officer of Registrant (including persons who serve at
Registrant's request as directors, officers or trustees of another organization
in which Registrant has any interest as a shareholder, creditor or otherwise
hereinafter referred to as a "Covered Person") is indemnified to the fullest
extent permitted by law against liability and all expenses reasonably incurred
by him in connection with any action, suit or proceeding to which he may be a
party or otherwise involved by reason of his being or having been a Covered
Person. This provision does not authorize indemnification when it is determined,
in the manner specified in the Agreement and Declaration of Trust that such
Covered Person has not acted in good faith in the reasonable belief that his
actions were in or not opposed to the best interests of Registrant. Moreover,
this provision does not authorize indemnification when it is determined, in the
manner specified in the Agreement and Declaration of Trust, that such Covered
Person would otherwise be liable to Registrant or its shareholders by reason of
willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of his
duties. Expenses may be paid by Registrant in advance of the final disposition
of any action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by such Covered
Person to repay such expenses to Registrant in the event that it is ultimately
determined that indemnification of such expenses is not authorized under the
Agreement and Declaration of Trust and either (i) the Covered Person provides
security for such undertaking, (ii) Registrant is insured against losses from
such advances, or (iii) the disinterested Trustees or independent legal counsel
determines, in the manner specified in the Agreement and Declaration of Trust,
that there is reason to believe the Covered Person will be found to be entitled
to indemnification. 
����������
Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") may be permitted to Trustees, officers
and controlling persons of Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or
otherwise, Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such
indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and
is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification
against such liabilities (other than the payment by Registrant of expenses
incurred or paid by a Trustee, officer or controlling person of Registrant in
the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such
Trustee, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being
registered, Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has
been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate
jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public
policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final
adjudication of such issue. 


Item 26.

Business and Other Connections of Investment Advisers.




����������
Fred Alger Management, Inc. ("Alger Management"), which serves as investment
manager to Registrant, is generally engaged in rendering investment advisory
services to institutions and, to a lesser extent, individuals. Alger Management
presently serves as investment adviser to one closed-end management investment
company and to four other open-end management investment companies. The list
required by this Item 26 regarding any other business, profession, vocation or
employment of a substantial nature engaged in by officers and directors of Alger
Management during the past two years is incorporated by reference to Schedules A
and D of Form ADV filed by Alger Management pursuant to the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940, as amended (SEC File No. 801-06709). 


Item 27.

Fred Alger & Company, Incorporation ("Alger Inc.") acts as principal
underwriter for Registrant, The Alger Funds, The Alger American Fund, The Alger

INVESTMENTS: THE SPECTRA FUNDS                                                  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The investment objective and primary approach of each Fund is discussed         
individually below. Each of the Funds invests primarily in equity securities of 
all capitalizations, such as common or preferred stocks. Each of the Funds      
invests primarily in "growth" stocks. The Funds' Manager, Fred Alger Management,
Inc., ("Alger Management" or the "Manager") believes that these companies tend  
to fall into one of two categories:                                             

o     HIGH UNIT VOLUME GROWTH                                                   

Vital, creative companies which offer goods or services to a rapidly
    expanding marketplace. They include both established and emerging firms,
      offering new or improved products, or firms simply fulfilling an increased
demand for an existing line.                                        

o     POSITIVE LIFE CYCLE CHANGE                                                

Companies experiencing a major change which is expected to produce  
   advantageous results. These changes may be as varied as new management,
    products or technologies; restructuring or reorganization; or merger and
acquisition.                                                        

The Funds may invest in companies of any market capitalization. The market      
capitalization of a company is its price per share multiplied by its number of  
outstanding shares.                                                             

Each Fund's portfolio manager(s) may sell a stock when it reaches a target      
price, fails to perform as expected, or when other opportunities appear more    
attractive. As a result of this disciplined investment process, each Fund may   
engage in active trading of portfolio securities. If a Fund does trade in this  
way, it may incur increased transaction costs and brokerage commissions, both of
which can lower the actual return on an investment. Active trading may also     
increase short-term gains and losses, which may affect the taxes a shareholder  
has to pay.                                                                     

Each of the Funds may purchase put and call options and sell (write) covered put
and call options on securities and securities indexes to increase gain or to    
hedge against the risk of unfavorable price movements.                          

Each of the Funds can leverage, that is, borrow money to buy additional         
securities. By borrowing money, a Fund has the potential to increase its returns
if the increase in the value of the securities purchased exceeds the cost of    
borrowing, including interest paid on the money borrowed.                       

SPECTRA FUND 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE: SPECTRA FUND SEEKS LONG-TERM CAPITAL APPRECIATION.        

PRINCIPAL STRATEGY: The Fund invests primarily in the equity securities of      
companies of any size that the Manager believes demonstrate promising growth    
potential.

SPECTRA GREEN FUND ("GREEN FUND")                                               
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE: GREEN FUND SEEKS LONG-TERM CAPITAL APPRECIATION.          

PRINCIPAL STRATEGY: Under normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of
its net assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in equity          
securities of companies of any that, in the opinion of the Manager conduct their
business in an environmentally sustainable manner, while demonstrating promising
growth potential. These are companies that have shown a commitment to           
environmental sustainability as demonstrated through their business strategies, 
practices or investments. The Fund seeks to invest in companies that have       
developed or are developing or marketing products or services that address human
needs without undermining nature's ability to support our economy into the      
future.                                                                         

The Fund's investment strategy consists of fundamental analysis combined with an
environmental sustainability investment process. In selecting stocks, the       
Manager uses fundamental analysis to identify innovative and dynamic companies  
and uses screens that identify and rank stocks within an industry or sector     
based on several sustainability characteristics.                                

SPECTRA ALCHEMY FUND ("ALCHEMY FUND")                                           
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE: THE FUND SEEKS LONG-TERM CAPITAL APPRECIATION.            

PRINCIPAL STRATEGY: Under normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of
its net assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in equity          
securities. The Fund may invest in companies of any market capitalization, from 
larger, well-established companies to small, emerging growth companies. The     
Fund's benchmark is the Russell 3000(R) Growth Index, which is an index of      
common stocks designed to track performance of companies with greater than      
average growth orientation in general.                                          

The equity research analysts of the Manager select investments for the Fund that
represent certain investment ideas in all market capitalizations, styles and    
geographies. Although the analysts may find investment ideas anywhere in the    
world, the analysts may emphasize investments in securities of U.S. issuers.    
Each analyst will be allocated a percentage of the Fund's total assets and will 
have such allocation rebalanced on a periodic basis--at least annually--by the  
Fund's Chief Investment Officer (the "CIO"). Each analyst will, in managing his 
or her portion of the Fund's portfolio, be subject to certain diversification   
requirements as determined by the CIO.                                          

The Fund may invest in securities of companies whose principal business         
activities are located in emerging market countries, although the allocation of 
the Fund's assets to emerging market countries will vary from time to time.     

The Fund may, but is not required to, use derivatives, such as futures, options 
and forward contracts, as a substitute for investing directly in an underlying

SPECTRA INTERNATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FUND ("INTERNATIONAL FUND")                 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE: THE FUND SEEKS LONG-TERM CAPITAL APPRECIATION.            

PRINCIPAL STRATEGY: Under normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of
its net assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in equity          
securities, including common stocks, American Depositary Receipts and Global    
Depositary Receipts, of foreign companies. Foreign companies are companies (i)  
that are organized under the laws of a foreign country; (ii) whose principal    
trading market is in a foreign country; or (iii) that have a majority of their  
assets, or that derive a significant portion of their revenue or profits from   
businesses, investments or sales, outside the United States.                    

The Fund generally invests in at least three foreign countries, and, at times,  
may invest a substantial portion of its assets in a single foreign country. The 
Fund may invest in companies of any market capitalization, from larger,         
well-established companies to small, emerging growth companies. The Fund's      
benchmark is the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI(R)) Europe,         
Australasia and Far East (EAFE(R)) Index, which is an unmanaged, market         
capitalization-weighted index that is designed to measure the performance of    
publicly traded stocks issued by companies in developed markets, excluding the  
United States and Canada. While the MSCI EAFE Index excludes stocks of Canadian 
companies, the Fund may invest in such stocks. The Fund also uses MSCI All      
Country World Index ex U.S. as a benchmark. The MSCI All Country World Index    
includes 48 markets.                                                            

The Fund may invest in securities of companies whose principal business         
activities are located in emerging market countries, although the allocation of 
the Fund's assets to emerging market countries will vary from time to time.     

The Manager seeks investment opportunities in companies with fundamental        
strengths that indicate the potential for sustainable growth. The Manager       
focuses on individual stock selection, building the Fund's portfolio from the   
bottom up through extensive fundamental research. In addition to using          
fundamental research, the Manager employs a "quantitative" investment approach  
to selecting investments. A quantitative investment approach relies on financial
models and computer databases to assist in the stock selection process.         
Proprietary computer models are capable of rapidly ranking a large universe of  
eligible investments using an array of traditional factors applied in financial 
analysis, such as cash flow, earnings growth, and price to earnings ratios, as  
well as other non-traditional factors.

PRINCIPAL RISKS                                                                 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RISKS APPLICABLE TO EACH FUND                                                   

As with any equity fund, your investment will fluctuate in value, and the loss  
of your investment is a risk of investing. A Fund's price per share will        
fluctuate due to changes in the market prices of its investments. The value of a
Fund's investments may not grow as fast as the rate of inflation, and stocks    
tend to be more volatile than some other investments you can make, such as      
bonds. Based on a Fund's investment objective, an investment in a Fund may be   
better suited for investors who seek long-term capital growth and can tolerate  
fluctuations in their investment's value.                                       

Prices of growth stocks tend to be higher in relation to their companies'       
earnings, and may be more sensitive to market, political and economic           
developments than other stocks, making their prices more volatile.              

Trading in growth stocks may be relatively short-term, meaning that a Fund may  
buy a security and sell it a short time later if it is believed that an         
alternative investment may provide greater future growth. This activity may     
create higher transaction costs due to commissions and other expenses and       
thereby adversely affect Fund performance. In addition, a high level of         
short-term trading may increase a Fund's realized gains, thereby increasing the 
amount of taxable distributions to shareholders at the end of the year.         

Investing in companies of all capitalizations involves the risk that smaller    
issuers in which a Fund invests may have limited product lines or financial     
resources, or lack management depth. A Fund's investments in small cap stocks   
are subject to the possibility that it may be difficult or impossible to        
liquidate a security position at a time and price acceptable to a Fund due to   
the potentially less frequent trading of stocks of smaller capitalization       
companies.                                                                      

The Funds may use derivative instruments, such as options, futures and options  
on futures (including those relating to stocks, indexes and foreign currencies),
and forward contracts. A small investment in derivatives could have a           
potentially large impact on a Fund's performance. The use of derivatives        
involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated   
with investing directly in the underlying assets. Derivatives can be highly     
volatile, illiquid and difficult to value, and there is the risk that changes in
the value of a derivative held by a Fund will not correlate with the underlying 
instruments or the Fund's other investments. Derivative instruments also involve
the risk that a loss may be sustained as a result of the failure of the         
counterparty to the derivative instruments to make required payments or         
otherwise comply with the derivative instruments' terms.                        

If the Manager incorrectly predicts the price movement of a security or market, 
an option held by a Fund may expire unexercised and the Fund will lose the      
premium it paid for the option, or the Fund as the writer of an option may be   
required to purchase or sell the optioned security at a disadvantageous price or
settle an index option at a loss. Also, an imperfect correlation between a hedge
and the securities hedged may render the hedge partially ineffective.           

                                                                             -5-

P-->485BPOS9th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�9th
The risk that the cost of borrowing money to leverage will exceed the returns   
for the securities purchased or that the securities purchased may actually go   
down in value; thus, the Fund's net asset value could decrease more quickly than
if it had not borrowed.                                                         

There may be additional risks applicable to a specific Fund because of its      
investment approach.                                                            

To the extent that a Fund invests in securities other than those that are its   
primary focus, the investment risks associated with such other investments are  
described in this Prospectus and the Statement of Additional Information. You   
should read that information carefully.                                         

RISKS APPLICABLE TO GREEN FUND                                                  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Fund's environmental sustainability investment criteria may limit the number
of investment opportunities available to the Fund, and as a result, at times the
Fund's returns may be less than those of funds that are not subject to such     
special investment considerations. Moreover, companies that promote             
environmentally sensitive programs may not perform as well as companies that do 
not pursue such goals.                                                          

RISKS APPLICABLE TO ALCHEMY FUND AND INTERNATIONAL FUND                         
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Investing in companies of all capitalizations involves the risk that smaller    
issuers in which the Funds invest may have limited product lines or financial   
resources or lack management depth. The Funds' investments in small cap stocks  
are subject to the possibility that it may be difficult or impossible to        
liquidate a security position at a time and price acceptable to a Fund owing to 
the potentially less frequent trading of stocks of smaller market capitalization
companies.                                                                      

A Fund's performance will be influenced by political, social and economic       
factors affecting investments in foreign companies. Special risks associated    
with investments in foreign companies include exposure to currency fluctuations,
less liquidity, less developed or less efficient trading markets, lack of       
comprehensive company information, political instability and differing auditing 
and legal standards.                                                            

The securities of issuers located in emerging markets can be more volatile and  
less liquid than those of issuers in more mature economies. Investing in        
emerging markets involves higher levels of risk, including increased currency,  
information, liquidity, market, political and valuation risks. Deficiencies in  
regulatory oversight, market infrastructure, shareholder protections and company
laws could expose the Fund to operational and other risks as well. Some         
countries may have restrictions that could limit the Fund's access to attractive
opportunities. Additionally, emerging markets often face serious economic       
problems (such as high external debt, inflation and unemployment) that could    
subject the Fund to increased volatility or substantial declines in value.      

Investments in foreign currencies are subject to the risk that those currencies 
will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar, or, in the case of hedged    
positions, that the U.S. dollar will decline relative to the currency being     
hedged. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over    
short periods of time. A decline in the value of foreign currencies relative to 
the U.S. dollar will reduce the value of securities held by a Fund and          
denominated in those currencies. Foreign currencies also are subject to risks   
caused by inflation, interest rates, budget deficits and low savings rates,     
political factors and government controls.

PERFORMANCE                                                                     
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following bar charts and the tables beneath them give you some indication of
the risks of investing in a Fund by showing changes in each Fund's performance  
from year to year and by showing how each Fund's average annual returns before  
taxes for the indicated periods compare with those of a broad measure of market 
performance. The tables also show the effect of taxes on each Fund's returns by 
presenting after-tax returns. These returns are calculated using the highest    
individual federal income and capital gains tax rates in effect at the time of  
each distribution and redemption, but do not reflect state and local taxes. A   
"Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of Fund Shares" may sometimes be  
higher than the other two return figures; this happens when there is a capital  
loss on redemption, giving rise to a tax benefit to the shareholder. Actual     
after-tax returns will depend on your specific situation and may differ from    
those shown. The after-tax returns shown will be irrelevant to investors owning 
Fund shares through tax-deferred accounts, such as IRAs or 401(k) plans. The    
total returns reflect reinvestment of dividends and distributions. Remember that
the Fund's past performance (before and after taxes) is not necessarily an      
indication of how it will perform in the future. The index used in the tables is
a broad index designed to track a particular market or market segment. No       
expenses, fees or taxes are reflected in the returns for the index, which is    
unmanaged. All returns for the index assume reinvestment of dividends and       
interest of the underlying securities that make up the index. Investors cannot  
invest directly in any index.

The examples assume that you invest $10,000 in Class N shares of a Fund for the 
time periods indicated. The examples also assume that your investment has a 5%  
return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the same as in   
the table above. The figures shown would be the same whether you sold your      
shares at the end of each period or kept them. Although your actual costs may be
higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

following:                                                                      

o     You invest $10,000 in the Fund and hold it for the entire 10-year period; 
and                                                                 

o     Your investment has a 5% return before expenses each year.                

There is no assurance that the annual expense ratio will be the expense ratio   
for any Fund classes for any of the years shown. To the extent that the Manager 
and any of its affiliates make any fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements    
pursuant to a voluntary or other contractual arrangement, your actual expenses  
may be less. This is only a hypothetical presentation made to illustrate what   
expenses and returns would be under the above scenarios. Your actual returns and
expenses are likely to differ (higher or lower) from those shown below.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE FUNDS' INVESTMENTS                             
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OPTIONS                                                                         
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A call option on a security gives the purchaser of the option the right, in     
return for a premium paid, to buy from the writer (seller) of the call option   
the security underlying the option at a specified exercise price at any time    
during the term of the option. The writer is obligated upon exercise of the     
option to deliver the underlying security upon payment of the exercise price. A 
put option on a security gives the holder of the option, in return for the      
premium paid, the right to sell the underlying security to the writer (seller)  
at a specified price during the term of the option. The writer, who receives the
premium, is obligated upon exercise of the option to buy the underlying security
at the exercise price. An option on a stock index gives the holder the right to 
receive a cash settlement during the term of the option based on the amount, if 
any, by which the exercise price exceeds (if the option is a put) or is exceeded
by (if the option is a call) the current value of the index, which is itself a  
function of the market values of the securities included in the index. The      
writer of the option is obligated, in return for the premium received, to make  
delivery of this amount.                                                        

A Fund may purchase a put option on a portfolio security to seek to protect     
against a decline in the market value of the security, or, if the Fund          
contemplates purchasing a security in the future, purchase a call option on the 
security in anticipation of an increase in the security's market value. When a  
Fund writes an option, if the market value of the underlying security does not  
move to a level that would make exercise of the option profitable to its holder,
the option generally will expire unexercised and the Fund will realize as profit
the premium it received. When a call option written by a Fund is exercised, the 
Fund will be required to sell the underlying securities to the holder at the    
exercise price and will not participate in any increase in the securities' value
above that price. When a put option written by a Fund is exercised, the Fund    
will be required to purchase the underlying securities at a price in excess of  
their market value.                                                             

Use of options on securities indexes entails the risk that trading in the       
options may be interrupted if trading in certain securities included in the     
index is interrupted. Price movements in a Fund's portfolio securities may not  
correlate precisely with movements in the level of an index and, therefore, the 
use of options on indexes cannot serve as a complete hedge and would depend in  
part on the ability of the Manager to predict correctly movements in the        
direction of a particular market or of the stock market generally. Because      
options on indexes require settlement in cash, the Fund might be forced to      
liquidate portfolio securities to meet settlement obligations.                  

FOREIGN SECURITIES                                                              
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Investing in foreign securities involves risks related to the political, social 
and economic conditions of foreign countries, particularly emerging market      
countries. These risks may include political instability, exchange control      
regulations, expropriation, lack of comprehensive information, national policies
restricting foreign investment, currency fluctuations, less liquidity,          
undiversified and immature economic structures, inflation and rapid fluctuations
in inflation, withholding or other taxes, and operational risks.                

                                                                            -13-

U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES                                                      
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

U.S. Government Obligations are bills, notes, bonds and other fixed-income      
securities issued by the U.S. Treasury; they are direct obligations of the U.S. 
Government and differ mainly in the length of their maturities. U.S. Government 
Agency Securities are issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government-sponsored         
enterprises and federal agencies. Some of these securities are supported by the 
full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury; the remainder are supported only by 
the credit of the instrumentality, which may or may not include the right of the
issuer to borrow from the Treasury.                                             

TEMPORARY DEFENSIVE AND INTERIM INVESTMENTS                                     
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In times of adverse or unstable market, economic or political conditions, a Fund
may invest up to 100% of its assets in cash, high-grade bonds, or cash          
equivalents (such as commercial paper or money market instruments) for temporary
defensive reasons. This is to attempt to protect the Fund's assets from a       
temporary, unacceptable risk of loss, rather than directly to promote the Fund's
investment objective. A Fund may also hold these types of securities pending the
investment of proceeds from the sale of Fund shares or portfolio securities or  
to meet anticipated redemptions of Fund shares. A Fund may not achieve its      
investment objective while in a temporary defensive or interim position.        

Other securities the Funds may invest in are discussed in the Funds' Statement  
of Additional Information.

The Manager has been an investment adviser since 1964, and manages investments  
totaling (at 12/31/06) approximately $7.5 billion in mutual fund assets as well 
as $1.9 billion in other assets. The Manager has managed the Spectra Fund since 
1974, and the Predecessor Fund to Green Fund since 2000. Pursuant to an         
investment management agreement with the Funds, the Manager makes investment    
decisions for the Funds and continuously reviews the Funds' investment programs.
These management responsibilities are subject to the supervision of the Board of
Trustees. The Funds pay the Manager fees at these annual rates based on a       
percentage of average daily net assets: Spectra Fund - 1.46; Green Fund - 0.71%;
Alchemy Fund - 0.85%; International Fund - 1.00%.                               

A discussion of the Trustees' basis for approving the advisory contracts for    
Spectra Fund is available in the Fund's annual report to shareholders for the   
fiscal year ended October 31, 2006. A discussion of the Trustees' basis for     
approving the advisory contracts for Green Fund, Alchemy Fund and International 
Fund will be available in the Funds' semi-annual report to shareholders for the 
six-month period ended April 30, 2007.

ADMINISTRATOR 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pursuant to a separate administration agreement, the Manager also provides      
administrative services to each Fund, including, but not limited to: providing  
office space, telephone, office equipment and supplies; authorizing expenditures
and approving bills for payment on behalf of the Fund; supervising preparation  
of periodic shareholder reports, notices and other shareholder communications;  
supervising the daily pricing of the Fund's investment portfolios and the       
publication of the net asset value of the Fund's shares, earnings reports and   
other financial data; monitoring relationships with organizations providing     
services to the Fund, including the Fund's custodian, transfer agent and        
printers; providing trading desk facilities for the Fund; and supervising       
compliance by the Fund with recordkeeping and periodic reporting requirements   
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). Each Fund
pays the Manager an administrative fee at the annual rate of 0.04% based on a   
percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets.                              

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS                                                               
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On October 11, 2006, the Manager, the Distributor and Alger Shareholder         
Services, Inc. executed an Assurance of Discontinuance with the Office of the   
New York State Attorney General ("NYAG"). On January 18, 2007, the Securities   
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") approved a settlement with the Manager and  
the Distributor. As part of the settlements with the NYAG and the SEC, without  
admitting or denying liability, consented to the payment of $30 million to      
reimburse fund shareholders; a fine of $10 million; and certain other remedial  
measures including a reduction in management fees of $1 million per year for    
five years. The entire $40 million and fee reduction will be available for the  
benefit of investors. The Manager has advised the Funds that the settlement     
payment is not expected to adversely affect the operations of the Manager, the  
Distributor or their affiliates, or adversely affect their ability to continue  
to provide services to the Funds.                                               

On August 31, 2005, the West Virginia Securities Commissioner (the "WVSC"), in  
an ex parte Summary Order to Cease and Desist and Notice of Right to Hearing,   
concluded that the Manager and the Distributor had violated the West Virginia   
Uniform Securities Act (the "WVUSA"), and ordered the Manager and the           
Distributor to cease and desist from further violations of the WVUSA by engaging
in the market-timing-related conduct described in the order. The ex parte order 
provided notice of their right to a hearing with respect to the violations of   
law asserted by the WVSC. Other firms unaffiliated with the Manager were served 
with similar orders. The Manager and the Distributor intend to request a hearing
for the purpose of seeking to vacate or modify the order.                       

In addition, in 2003 and 2004 several purported class actions and shareholder   
derivative suits were filed against various parties in the mutual fund industry,
including the Manager, certain mutual funds managed by the Manager, including   
Spectra Fund (the "Alger Mutual Funds"), and certain current and former Alger   
Mutual Fund trustees and officers, alleging wrongful conduct related to         
market-timing and late-trading by mutual fund shareholders. These cases were    
transferred to the U.S. District Court of Maryland by the Judicial Panel on     
Multidistrict Litigation for consolidated pre-trial proceedings.                

                                                                            -17-

In September 2004, consolidated amended complaints involving these cases-a      
Consolidated Amended Fund Derivative Complaint (the "Derivative Complaint") and 
two substantially identical Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaints        
(together, the "Class Action Complaint")-were filed in the Maryland federal     
district court under the caption number 1:04-MD-15863 (JFM). In April 2005, a   
civil lawsuit involving similar allegations was filed by the West Virginia      
Attorney General and also transferred to the Maryland District Court, but such  
lawsuit has since been withdrawn.                                               

The Derivative Complaint alleged (i) violations, by the Manager and, depending  
on the specific offense alleged, by the Distributor and/or the fund trustee     
defendants, of Sections 36(a), 36(b), 47, and 48 of the 1940 Act and of Sections
206 and 215 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, breach of       
fiduciary duty, and breach of contract, (ii) various offenses by other          
third-party defendants, and (iii) unjust enrichment by all the named defendants.
The Class Action Complaint alleged, in addition to the offenses listed above,   
(i) violations, by the Manager, the Distributor, their affiliates, the funds    
named as defendants, including Spectra Fund, and the current and former fund    
trustees and officers, of Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, Sections 10(b) (and Rule 10b-5 thereunder) and 20(a) of the   
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), and Section 34(b) 
of the 1940 Act, (ii) breach of contract by the funds named as defendants, and  
(iii) unjust enrichment of the defendants.                                      

Motions to dismiss the Class Action Complaint and the Derivative Complaint were 
subsequently filed. On November 3, 2005, the district court issued letter       
rulings dismissing both complaints in their entirety with respect to the Alger  
Mutual Funds and dismissing all claims against the other Alger defendants, other
than the claims under the 1934 Act and Section 36(b) of the 1940 Act (as to     
which the court deferred ruling with respect to the Alger Mutual Fund trustees),
with leave to the class action plaintiffs to file amended complaints against    
those defendants with respect to claims under state law. Orders implementing the
letter rulings were entered. On March 31, 2006, attorneys for the class action  
plaintiffs informed the district court that they had decided not to file amended
complaints with respect to the plaintiffs' state law claims. Answers to the     
Class Action Complaint were filed by the Alger defendants on April 24, 2006.    

In subsequent orders, all remaining claims in the Class Action Complaint and the
Derivative Complaint have been dismissed, other than claims under the 1934 Act  
against the Manager, the Distributor, Alger Associates, Inc. and Alger          
Shareholder Services, Inc., and certain present and former members of the senior
management of the Manager and/or the Distributor, and claims under Section 36(b)
of the 1940 Act against the Manager, the Distributor, Alger Associates, Inc. and
Alger Shareholder Services, Inc.

NET ASSET VALUE 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The value of one Class N share is its "net asset value," or NAV. The NAV for    
each Fund is calculated as of the close of business (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern 
time) every day the New York Stock Exchange is open. Generally, the Exchange is 
closed on weekends and national holidays. It may close on other days from time  
to time.                                                                        

The assets of each Fund are generally valued on the basis of market quotations  
or, where market quotations are not reliable or readily available, on the basis 
of fair value as determined by the Manager under procedures adopted by the Board
of Trustees. Short-term money market instruments held by a Fund are normally    
valued on the basis of amortized cost.                                          

In determining whether market quotations are reliable and readily available, the
Manager monitors information it routinely receives for significant events it    
believes will affect market prices of portfolio instruments held by the Fund.   
Significant events may affect a particular company (for example, a trading halt 
in the company's securities on an exchange during the day) or may affect        
securities markets (for example, a natural disaster causes a market to close    
early). Because certain Funds invest in securities that are primarily listed on 
foreign exchanges that trade on weekends or other days when a Fund does not     
price its shares, the value of the Fund's portfolio securities may change on    
days when you will not be able to purchase or redeem your shares. If the Manager
is aware of a significant event that has occurred after the close of the market 
where a portfolio instrument is primarily traded, but before the close of the   
New York Stock Exchange, that the Manager believes has affected or is likely to 
affect the price of the instrument, the Manager will use its best judgment to   
determine a fair value for that portfolio instrument under procedures adopted by
the Board of Trustees.                                                          

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAV (NET ASSET VALUE) OF A CLASS OF SHARES IS COMPUTED BY ADDING TOGETHER THE   
VALUE ALLOCABLE TO THE CLASS OF THE FUND'S INVESTMENTS PLUS CASH AND OTHER      
ASSETS, SUBTRACTING APPLICABLE LIABILITIES AND THEN DIVIDING THE RESULT BY THE  
NUMBER OF OUTSTANDING SHARES OF THE CLASS.

PURCHASING AND REDEEMING FUND SHARES                                            
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can purchase or redeem shares on any day the New York Stock Exchange is     
open. Orders will be processed at the NAV next calculated after your purchase or
redemption request is received in good order by the Transfer Agent or other     
agent appointed by the Distributor. Ordinarily, a Fund will issue your          
redemption check within seven days after the Transfer Agent accepts your        
redemption request. However, when you buy shares with a check or via            
TelePurchase, Automatic Investment Plan, or online, a Fund will not issue       
payment for redemption requests against those funds until the purchase proceeds 
are available, which may take up to 15 days. Payment may be postponed in cases  
where the SEC declares an emergency or normal trading is halted. The Transfer   
Agent or the Funds may reject any purchase order. Share certificates are not    
issued for shares of a Fund.                                                    

If you redeem, by sale or exchange, shares of a Fund within 30 days of purchase,
the Fund may impose a redemption fee of 2% of the amount redeemed. This fee will
be retained by the Fund. Shares held the longest will be treated as having been 
redeemed first for purposes of determining whether the fee applies. The fee will
not apply to redemptions (i) due to shareholder death or disability, (ii) from  
certain omnibus accounts, (iii) of shares acquired through reinvestment of      
dividends or capital gains distributions, (iv) through certain                  
employer-sponsored retirement plans or employee benefit plans or, with respect  
to any plan, to comply with minimum distribution requirements, (v) effected     
pursuant to an automatic non-discretionary rebalancing program, (vi) pursuant to
the Automatic Investment Plan of Systematic Withdrawal Plan, or (vii) by the    
Fund of accounts falling below the minimum initial investment amount. Each Fund 
reserves the right to waive this fee in other circumstances if the Manager      
determines that doing so is in the best interests of the Fund.                  

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS                                                     
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dividends of each Fund's net investment income and distributions of its net     
realized capital gains are declared and paid annually by the Fund. The Funds    
expect that these annual payments to shareholders will consist primarily of     
capital gains, which may be taxable to you at different rates depending upon how
long the Fund has held the securities that it sold to create the gains, rather  
than the length of time you have held shares of the Fund. Unless you choose to  
receive cash payments by checking the appropriate box on your New Account       
Application, any dividends and distributions will be reinvested automatically at
the NAV on their payment dates. If you have chosen cash payments and a payment  
is returned to the Fund as undeliverable, upon receipt that payment will be     
reinvested in Fund shares at the next NAV. All subsequent payments will be      
reinvested until you reinstate your cash election and provide a valid mailing   
address.                                                                        

Regardless of whether you choose to take distributions in cash or reinvest them 
in the Funds, they may be subject to federal and state taxes. Because everyone's
tax situation is unique, investors should see a tax advisor about federal, state
and local tax consequences of investing in a Fund.

for tax purposes, an exchange is considered a sale and a purchase. Thus, you may

(including purchase by exchange).

Each of Spectra Fund and Spectra Green Fund invests predominantly in            
U.S.-traded, highly liquid securities for which current New York market-closing 
prices are readily available on a daily basis. Each of Alchemy Fund and         
International Fund will determine a fair value for portfolio securities for     
which current market closing prices are not readily available or otherwise      
require fair valuation in the circumstances discussed under "Net Asset Value."  
Additionally, each of the Funds is subject to a redemption fee. As a result, the
Manager believes that there is little incentive for investors to engage in      
frequent and/or short-term trading (often referred to as market-timing) to      
benefit from "stale" pricing. Nonetheless, each Fund recognizes (and for Alchemy
Fund and International Fund, the presence of foreign securities in each Fund's  
portfolio) that in certain circumstances active in-and-out trading by Fund      
shareholders, for whatever reason implemented, may be attempted and may, if     
carried out on a large scale, impose burdens on the Fund's portfolio managers,  
interfere with the efficient management of a portfolio, increase the portfolio's
transaction costs, administrative costs or tax liability or otherwise be        
detrimental to the interests of the Fund and its other shareholders. Each Fund  
therefore discourages market timing, and to the extent possible monitors for    
market timing patterns in the Funds.                                            

The Board of Trustees has determined that a Fund may reject purchase orders, on 
a temporary or permanent basis, from investors that the Manager is able to      
determine, in its reasonable business judgment, are exhibiting a pattern of     
frequent or short-term trading in Fund shares or shares of other funds sponsored
by the Manager that is detrimental to the fund involved.                        

In order to detect significant market timing, the Manager will, among other     
things, monitor overall subscription, redemption and exchange activity; isolate 
significant daily activity, and significant activity relative to existing       
account sizes to determine if there appears to be market timing activity in an  
individual portfolio. While a Fund might not be able to detect frequent or      
short-term trading conducted by the underlying owners of shares held in omnibus 
accounts or placed through market intermediaries other than on a fully-disclosed
basis, and therefore might not be able to effectively prevent frequent or       
short-term trading in those accounts, the Manager attempts to monitor these     
activities in omnibus accounts and will contract with broker-dealers that sell  
shares of the Fund and entities that hold omnibus accounts with its mutual funds
to seek to discourage, detect                                                   

                                                                            -25-

and prevent market timing and active trading. There is no guarantee that a      
Fund's efforts to identify investors who engage in excessive trading activity or
to curtail that activity will be successful.

DISCLOSURE OF PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS                                                
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Board of Trustees has adopted policies and procedures relating to disclosure
of the Funds' portfolio securities. These policies and procedures recognize that
there may be legitimate business reasons for holdings to be disclosed and seek  
to balance those interests to protect the proprietary nature of the trading     
strategies and implementation thereof by the Funds.                             

Generally, the policies prohibit the release of information concerning portfolio
holdings which have not previously been made public to individual investors,    
institutional investors, intermediaries that distribute the Funds' shares and   
other parties which are not employed by the Manager or its affiliates except    
when the legitimate business purposes for selective disclosure and other        
conditions (designed to protect the Funds) are acceptable.                      

The Funds make their full holdings available semi-annually in shareholder       
reports filed on Form N-CSR and after the first and third fiscal quarters in    
regulatory filings on Form N-Q. These shareholder reports and regulatory filings
are filed with the SEC, as required by federal securities laws, and are         
generally available within sixty (60) days of the end of the Funds' fiscal      
quarter.                                                                        

In addition, the Funds make publicly available their respective month-end top 10
holdings with a 15 day lag and its month-end full portfolios with a 60 day lag  
on their web-site WWW.SPECTRAFUND.COM and through other marketing communications
(including printed advertising/sales literature and/or shareholder telephone    
customer service centers). No compensation or other consideration is received   
for the non-public disclosure of portfolio holdings information.                

In accordance with the foregoing, the Funds provide portfolio holdings          
information to service providers who provide necessary or beneficial services   
when such service providers need access to this information in the performance  
of their services and are subject to duties of confidentiality (1) imposed by   
law, including a duty not to trade on non-public information, and/or (2)        
pursuant to an agreement that confidential information is not to be disclosed or
used (including trading on such information) other than as required by law. From
time to time, the Funds will communicate with these service providers to confirm
that they understand the Funds' policies and procedures regarding such          
disclosure. This agreement must be approved by the Funds' Chief Compliance      
Officer.                                                                        

The Board of Trustees periodically reviews a report disclosing the third parties
to whom each Fund's holdings information has been disclosed and the purpose for 
such disclosure, and it considers whether or not the release of information to  
such third parties is in the best interest of the Fund and its shareholders.

Under certain circumstances, a Fund may redeem some of your shares "in kind,"   
which means that some of the proceeds will be paid with securities the Fund owns
instead of cash. If you receive securities, you should expect to incur brokerage
or other charges in converting the securities to cash.                          

Shares may be worth more or less when they are redeemed than they were at the   
time you bought them. For tax purposes, this means that when you redeem them you
may realize a short- or long-term capital gain or loss, depending upon how long 
you have held the shares.                                                       

The Funds and Transfer Agent have reasonable procedures in place to determine   
that the instructions submitted by telephone are genuine. They include          
requesting personal identification and recording calls. If the Funds and        
Transfer Agent follow these procedures, they are not liable for acting in good  
faith on telephone instructions.                                                

If you are a participant in a retirement plan, such as a 401(k) plan, and you   
purchase shares in a Fund through an administrator or trustee (the              
"Administrator") that maintains a master or "omnibus" account with the Fund for 
trading on behalf of retirement plans and their participants, the Administrator 
may apply purchase and exchange limitations which are different than the        
limitations discussed herein. These limitations may be more or less restrictive 
than the limitations imposed by the Fund, but in any event are designed to      
detect and prevent excessive trading. Consult with your Administrator to        
determine what purchase and exchange limitations may be applicable to your      
transactions in the Funds through your retirement plan.                         

From time to time the Distributor, at its expense from its own resources, may   
compensate brokers, dealers, investment advisers or others ("financial          
intermediaries") who are instrumental in effecting investments by their clients 
or customers in a Fund, in an amount up to 1% of the value of those investments.
The Distributor may also from time to time, at its expense from its own         
resources, make payments to financial intermediaries that provide shareholder   
servicing, or transaction processing, with such payments structured as a        
percentage of gross sales, a percentage of net assets, and/or as a fixed dollar 
amount (the latter as a per account fee or as reimbursement for transactions    
processing and transmission charges). Payments under these other arrangements   
may vary but generally will not exceed 0.50% annually of Fund assets or 0.50%   
annually of Fund sales attributable to that financial intermediary. The         
Distributor determines whether to make any additional cash payments and the     
amount of any such payments in response to requests from financial              
intermediaries, based on factors the Distributor deems relevant. Factors        
considered by the Distributor generally include the financial intermediary's    
reputation, ability to attract and retain assets for a Fund, expertise in       
distributing a particular class of shares of a Fund, entry into target markets, 
and/or quality of service. In addition, the Distributor may make payments to

The Financial Highlights table is intended to help you understand each Fund's   
financial performance for the indicated periods. The Green Fund's financial     
highlights represent those of the Predecessor Fund's Class I shares. Certain    
information reflects financial results for a single Fund share. The total       
returns in the tables represent the rate that an investor would have earned or  
lost on an investment in the Funds (assuming reinvestment of all dividends and  
distributions). Information has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, whose report,
along with the Funds' financial statements is included in the Annual Report,    
which is available upon request.                                                

As new funds, financial highlights information for Alchemy Fund and             
International Fund is not available as of the date of this prospectus.

THE FUNDS 
SPECTRA FUND                                                                    

The Fund invests primarily in the equity securities of companies of any size    
that Fred Alger Management, Inc. ("Alger Management, or the "Manager") believes 
demonstrate promising growth potential.                                         

GREEN FUND 

Under normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets,    
plus any borrowing for investment purposes, in equity securities of companies of
any size that, in the opinion of the Manager, conduct their business in an      
environmentally sustainable manner, while demonstrating promising growth        
potential.                                                                      

ALCHEMY FUND 

Under normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets,    
plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in equity securities. The Fund may 
invest in companies of any market capitalization, from larger, well-established 
companies to small, emerging growth companies. The Fund's benchmark is the      
Russell 3000(R) Growth Index, which is an index of common stocks designed to    
track performance of companies with greater than average growth orientation in  
general.                                                                        

The Fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in securities of companies whose    
principal business activities are located in emerging market countries, although
the allocation of the Fund's assets to emerging market countries will vary from 
time to time.                                                                   

INTERNATIONAL FUND 

Under normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets,    
plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in equity securities, including    
common stocks, American Depositary Receipts and Global Depositary Receipts, of  
foreign companies. The Fund generally invests in at least three foreign         
countries, and, at times, may invest a substantial portion of its assets in a   
single foreign country. The Fund may invest in companies of any market          
capitalization, from larger, well-established companies to small, emerging      
growth companies.                                                               

The Fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in securities of companies whose    
principal business activities are located in emerging market countries, although
the allocation of the Fund's assets to emerging market countries will vary from 
time to time.                                                                   

IN GENERAL 

Each Fund, like all other investments, can provide two types of return: income  
return and capital return. Income return is the income received from an         
investment, such as interest on bonds and money market instruments and dividends
from common and preferred stocks. Capital return is the change in the market    
value of an investment, such as an increase in the price of a common stock or of
shares of a Fund. Total return is the sum of income return and capital return.  
Thus, if a Fund over a year produces four percent in income return and its      
shares increase in value by three percent, its total return is seven percent. In
general, the more capital return is emphasized over income return in an         
investment program, the more risk is associated with the program.               

Growth funds, such as the Funds, seek primarily capital return. They invest     
primarily in common stocks and offer the opportunity of the greatest return over
the long term but can be risky since their prices fluctuate with changes in     
stock market prices. Growth funds that invest in companies with smaller market  
capitalizations offer potential for significant price gains if the companies are
successful, but there is also the risk that the companies will not succeed and  
the price of the companies' shares will drop in value. Growth funds that invest 
in larger, more established companies, generally offer relatively less          
opportunity for capital return but a greater degree of safety.                  

Investors considering equity investing through the Funds should carefully       
consider the inherent risks associated with an investment in each Fund.         
Expectations of future inflation rates should be considered in making investment
decisions and even though over the long term stocks may present attractive      
opportunities, the results of an equity investment managed by a particular      
management firm may not match those of the market as a whole.                   

Each Fund may, but is not required to, use derivatives, such as futures, options
and forward contracts, as a substitute for investing directly in an underlying  
asset, to increase returns, to manage foreign currency risk, or as part of a    
hedging strategy. Each Fund may borrow only from banks and may not borrow in    
excess of one-third of the market value of its total assets, less liabilities   
other than such borrowing. These practices are deemed to be speculative and may 
cause a Fund's net asset value be more volatile than the net asset value of a   
fund that does not engage in these activities.                                  

INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND POLICIES 

The Prospectus discusses the investment objective of each Fund and the principal
strategies employed to achieve this objective. This section contains            
supplemental information concerning the types of securities and other           
instruments in which each Fund may invest, the investment policies and portfolio
strategies that each Fund may utilize and certain risks attendant on those      
investments, policies and strategies.

P-->485BPOS40th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�40th
IN GENERAL 

Each Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing in equity securities, such
as common or preferred stocks, or securities convertible into or exchangeable   
for equity securities, including warrants and rights. The Spectra Fund and Green
Fund will invest primarily in companies whose securities are traded on domestic 
stock exchanges or in the over-the-counter market, International Fund will      
invest primarily in securities traded on foreign exchanges and Alchemy Fund may 
invest in both. These companies may be in the developmental stage, may be older 
companies that appear to be entering a new stage of growth progress owing to    
factors such as management changes or development of new technology, products or
markets, or may be companies providing products or services with a high         
unit-volume growth rate. There is no guarantee that a Fund's objective will be  
achieved.                                                                       

COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCKS                                                     

Stocks represent shares of ownership in a company. Generally, preferred stock   
has a specified dividend and ranks after bonds and before common stocks in its  
claim on income for dividend payments and on assets should the company be       
liquidated. After other claims are satisfied, common stockholders participate in
company profits on a pro-rata basis; profits may be paid out in dividends or    
reinvested in the company to help it grow. Increases and decreases in earnings  
are usually reflected in a company's stock price, so common stocks generally    
have the greatest appreciation and depreciation potential of all corporate      
securities. While most preferred stocks pay a dividend, each Fund may purchase  
preferred stock where the issuer has omitted, or is in danger of omitting,      
payment of its dividend. Such investments would be made primarily for their     
capital appreciation potential. Each Fund may purchase trust preferred          
securities which are preferred stocks issued by a special purpose trust         
subsidiary backed by subordinated debt of the corporate parent. These securities
typically bear a market rate coupon comparable to interest rates available on   
debt of a similarly rated company. Holders of the trust preferred securities    
have limited voting rights to control the activities of the trust and no voting 
rights with respect to the parent company.                                      

CASH POSITION                                                                   

In order to afford a Fund the flexibility to take advantage of new opportunities
for investments in accordance with its investment objective or to meet          
redemptions, it may, under normal circumstances, hold up to 15% of its total    
assets in money market instruments including, but not limited to, certificates  
of deposit, time deposits and bankers' acceptances issued by domestic bank and  
thrift institutions, U.S. Government securities, commercial paper and repurchase
agreements. This amount may be higher than that maintained by other funds with  
similar investment objectives.                                                  

TEMPORARY DEFENSIVE AND INTERIM INVESTMENTS                                     

When market conditions are unstable, or the Manager believes it is otherwise    
appropriate to reduce holdings in stocks, the Funds can invest up to 100% of    
assets in a variety of debt securities for defensive purposes. The Funds can    
also purchase these securities for liquidity purposes to meet cash needs due to 
the redemption of Fund shares, or to hold while waiting to reinvest cash        
received from the sale of other portfolio securities. The Funds can buy:        

o     high-quality, short-term money market instruments, including those issued 
by the U.S. Treasury or other government agencies;                  

o     commercial paper (short-term, unsecured, promissory notes of domestic or  
foreign companies);                                                 

o     short-term debt obligations of corporate issuers, certificates of deposit 
  and bankers' acceptances of domestic and foreign banks and savings and
loan associations; and                                              

o     repurchase agreements.                                                    

Short-term debt securities would normally be selected for defensive or cash     
management purposes because they can normally be disposed of quickly, are not   
generally subject to significant fluctuations in principal value and their value
will be less subject to interest rate risk than longer-term debt securities.    

BANK OBLIGATIONS                                                                

These are certificates of deposit, bankers' acceptances, and other short-term   
debt obligations. Certificates of deposit are short-term obligations of         
commercial banks. A bankers' acceptance is a time draft drawn on a commercial   
bank by a borrower, usually in connection with international commercial         
transactions. Certificates of deposit may have fixed or variable rates.         

A Fund will not invest in any debt security issued by a commercial bank unless  
(i) the bank has total assets of at least $1 billion, or the equivalent in other
currencies, or, in the case of domestic banks that do not have total assets of  
at least $1 billion, the aggregate investment made in any one such bank is      
limited to $100,000 and the principal amount of such investment is insured in   
full by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, (ii) in the case of U.S.     
banks, it is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and (iii) in
the case of foreign banks, the security is, in the opinion of the Manager, of an
investment quality comparable to other debt securities which may be purchased by
the Fund. These limitations do not prohibit investments in                      

 -3-

P-->485BPOS41st�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�41st
securities issued by foreign branches of U.S. banks, provided such U.S. banks   
meet the foregoing requirements.                                                

FOREIGN BANK OBLIGATIONS                                                        

Investments by a Fund in foreign bank obligations and obligations of foreign    
branches of domestic banks present certain risks, including the impact of future
political and economic developments, the possible imposition of withholding     
taxes on interest income, the possible seizure or nationalization of foreign    
deposits, the possible establishment of exchange controls and/or the addition of
other foreign governmental restrictions that might affect adversely the payment 
of principal and interest on these obligations. In addition, there may be less  
publicly available and reliable information about a foreign bank than about     
domestic banks owing to different accounting, auditing, reporting and           
recordkeeping standards. In view of these risks, Alger Management will carefully
evaluate these investments on a case-by-case basis.                             

SMALL CAPITALIZATION INVESTMENTS                                                

Certain companies in which a Fund will invest may still be in the developmental 
stage, may be older companies that appear to be entering a new stage of growth  
owing to factors such as management changes or development of new technology,   
products or markets or may be companies providing products or services with a   
high unit volume growth rate. Investing in smaller, newer issuers generally     
involves greater risk than investing in larger, more established issuers. Such  
companies may have limited product lines, markets or financial resources and may
lack management depth. Their securities may have limited marketability and may  
be subject to more abrupt or erratic market movements than securities of larger,
more established companies or the market averages in general.                   

CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES                                                          

Each Fund may invest in convertible securities, which are debt instruments or   
preferred stocks that make fixed dividend or interest payments and are          
convertible into common stock. Generally, the market prices of convertible      
securities tend to reflect price changes in their underlying common stocks, but 
also tend to respond inversely to changes in interest rates.                    

Convertible securities typically entail less market risk than investments in the
common stock of the same issuers; declines in their market prices are typically 
not as pronounced as those of their underlying common stocks. Like all          
fixed-income securities, convertible securities are subject to the risk of      
default on their issuers' payment obligations.                                  

VARIABLE RATE MASTER DEMAND NOTES                                               

These are unsecured instruments that permit the indebtedness thereunder to vary 
and provide for periodic adjustments in the interest rate. Because these notes  
are direct lending arrangements between a Fund and an issuer, they are not      
normally traded. Although no active secondary market may exist for these notes, 
a Fund may demand payment of principal and accrued interest at any time or may  
resell the note to a third party. While the notes are not typically rated by    
credit rating agencies, issuers of variable rate master demand notes must       
satisfy Alger Management that the same criteria for issuers of commercial paper 
are met. In addition, when purchasing variable rate master demand notes, Alger  
Management will consider the earning power, cash flows and other liquidity      
ratios of the issuers of the notes and will continuously monitor their financial
status and ability to meet payment on demand. In the event an issuer of a       
variable rate master demand note were to default on its payment obligations, a  
Fund might be unable to dispose of the note because of the absence of a         
secondary market and could, for this or other reasons, suffer a loss to the     
extent of the default.                                                          

U.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS                                                     

Each Fund may invest in U.S. Government securities, which include Treasury      
Bills, Treasury Notes and Treasury Bonds that differ in their interest rates,   
maturities and times of issuance. Treasury Bills have initial maturities of one 
year or less; Treasury Notes have initial maturities of one to ten years; and   
Treasury Bonds generally have initial maturities of greater than ten years. In  
addition to U.S. Treasury securities, each Fund may invest in securities issued 
or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or its agencies or instrumentalities. Some 
obligations issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies and                
instrumentalities are supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S.        
Treasury; others by the right of the issuer to borrow from the Treasury; others 
by discretionary authority of the U.S. Government to purchase certain           
obligations of the agency or instrumentality; and others only by the credit of  
the agency or instrumentality. These securities bear fixed, floating or variable
rates of interest. While the U.S. Government currently provides financial       
support to such U.S. Government-sponsored agencies or instrumentalities, no     
assurance can be given that it will always do so, since it is not so obligated  
by law.                                                                         

SHORT-TERM CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES                                            

These are outstanding nonconvertible corporate debt securities (e.g., bonds and 
debentures) which have one year or less remaining to maturity. Corporate notes  
may have fixed, variable, or floating rates.

COMMERCIAL PAPER                                                                

These are short-term promissory notes issued by corporations primarily to       
finance short-term credit needs.                                                

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS                                                           

Under the terms of a repurchase agreement, a Fund would acquire a high quality  
money market instrument for a relatively short period (usually not more than one
week) subject to an obligation of the seller to repurchase, and the Fund to     
resell, the instrument at an agreed price (including accrued interest) and time,
thereby determining the yield during the Fund's holding period. Repurchase      
agreements may be seen to be loans by the Fund collateralized by the underlying 
instrument. This arrangement results in a fixed rate of return that is not      
subject to market fluctuations during the Fund's holding period and not         
necessarily related to the rate of return on the underlying instrument. The     
value of the underlying securities, including accrued interest, will be at least
equal at all times to the total amount of the repurchase obligation, including  
interest. The Fund bears a risk of loss in the event that the other party to a  
repurchase agreement declares bankruptcy or defaults on its obligations and the 
Fund is delayed in or prevented from exercising its rights to dispose of the    
collateral securities, including the risk of a possible decline in the value of 
the underlying securities during the period in which the Fund seeks to assert   
these rights, the risk of incurring expenses associated with asserting these    
rights and the risk of losing all or part of the income from the agreement.     
Management reviews the creditworthiness of those banks and dealers with which   
the Fund enters into repurchase agreements to evaluate these risks and monitors 
on an ongoing basis the value of the securities subject to repurchase agreements
to ensure that the value is maintained at the required level.                   

WARRANTS AND RIGHTS                                                             

Each Fund may invest in warrants and rights. A warrant is a type of security    
that entitles the holder to buy a proportionate amount of common stock at a     
specified price, usually higher than the market price at the time of issuance,  
for a period of years or to perpetuity. In contrast, rights, which also         
represent the right to buy common shares, normally have a subscription price    
lower than the current market value of the common stock and a life of two to    
four weeks. Warrants are freely transferable and are traded on the major        
securities exchanges.                                                           

EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS 

To the extent otherwise consistent with its investment policies and applicable  
law, each Fund may invest up to 5% of its total assets in "exchange-traded      
funds" (ETFs), registered investment companies whose shares are listed on a     
national stock exchange. ETFs, which may be unit investment trusts or mutual    
funds, typically hold portfolios of securities designed to track the performance
of various broad securities indexes or sectors of such indexes. ETFs thus       
provide another means, in addition to futures and options on indexes, of        
creating or hedging stock index exposure in the Fund's investment strategies.   

RESTRICTED AND ILLIQUID SECURITIES                                              

Each Fund may invest in restricted securities; i.e., securities which are       
subject to legal or contractual restrictions on their resale. These restrictions
might prevent the sale of the securities at a time when a sale would otherwise  
be desirable. In order to sell securities that are not registered under the     
federal securities laws it may be necessary for a Fund to bear the expense of   
registration.                                                                   

The Funds may invest in restricted securities governed by Rule 144A under the   
Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Rule 144A is designed to facilitate         
efficient trading of unregistered securities among institutional investors. Rule
144A permits the resale to qualified institutions of restricted securities that,
when issued, were not of the same class as securities listed on a U.S.          
securities exchange or quoted on NASDAQ. In adopting Rule 144A, the Securities  
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") specifically stated that restricted         
securities traded under Rule 144A may be treated as liquid for purposes of      
investment limitations if the Board of Trustees (or the Fund's adviser acting   
subject to the Board's supervision) determines that the securities are, in fact,
liquid. The Board has delegated its responsibility to Alger Management to       
determine the liquidity of each restricted security purchased pursuant to Rule  
144A, subject to the Board's oversight and review. Examples of factors that will
be taken into account in evaluating the liquidity of a Rule 144A security, both 
with respect to the initial purchase and on an ongoing basis, will include,     
among others: (1) the frequency of trades and quotes for the security; (2) the  
number of dealers willing to purchase or sell the security and the number of    
other potential purchasers; (3) dealer undertakings to make a market in the     
security; and (4) the nature of the security and the nature of the marketplace  
trades (e.g., the time needed to dispose of the security, the method of         
soliciting offers, and the mechanics of transfer). If institutional trading in  
restricted securities were to decline to limited levels, the liquidity of the   
Fund's portfolio could be adversely affected.                                   

A Fund will not invest more than 15% of its net assets in "illiquid" securities,
which include restricted securities, securities for which there is no readily   
available market and repurchase agreements with maturities of greater than 7    
days; however, restricted securities that                                       

 -5-

P-->485BPOS43rd�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�43rd
are determined by the Board of Trustees to be liquid are not subject to this    
limitation.                                                                     

SHORT SALES                                                                     

Each Fund may sell securities "short against the box." While a short sale is the
sale of a security the Fund does not own, it is "against the box" if at all     
times when the short position is open the Fund owns an equal amount of the      
securities or securities convertible into, or exchangeable without further      
consideration for, securities of the same issue as the securities sold short.   

LENDING OF PORTFOLIO SECURITIES                                                 

In order to generate income and to offset expenses, each Fund may lend portfolio
securities with a value up to 33 1/3% of the Fund's total assets, including all 
collateral for such loans less liabilities exclusive of the obligation to return
such collateral, to brokers, dealers and other financial organizations. The Fund
will not lend securities to Alger Management or its affiliates. By lending its  
securities, the Fund can increase its income by continuing to receive interest  
or dividends on the loaned securities as well as by either investing the cash   
collateral in short-term securities or by earning income in the form of interest
paid by the borrower when U.S. Government securities are used as collateral. The
Fund will adhere to the following conditions whenever its securities are loaned:
(a) the Fund must receive at least 100% cash collateral or equivalent securities
from the borrower; (b) the borrower must increase this collateral whenever the  
market value of the loaned securities including accrued interest exceeds the    
value of the collateral; (c) the Fund must be able to terminate the loan at any 
time; (d) the Fund must receive reasonable interest on the loan, as well as any 
dividends, interest or other distributions on the loaned securities and any     
increase in market value; (e) the Fund may pay only reasonable custodian fees in
connection with the loan; and (f) voting rights on the loaned securities may    
pass to the borrower; provided, however, that if a material event adversely     
affecting the investment occurs, the Fund's Board of Trustees must terminate the
loan and regain the right to vote the securities.                               

A Fund bears a risk of loss in the event that the other party to a stock loan   
transaction defaults on its obligations and the Fund is delayed in or prevented 
from exercising its rights to dispose of the collateral, including the risk of a
possible decline in the value of the collateral securities during the period in 
which the Fund seeks to assert these rights, the risk of incurring expenses     
associated with asserting these rights and the risk of losing all or a part of  
the income from the transaction.                                                

FOREIGN SECURITIES                                                              

Spectra Fund may invest up to 20% of the value of its total assets, and each of 
Green Fund, Alchemy Fund and International Fund may invest without limit, in    
foreign securities (not including American Depositary Receipts, American        
Depositary Shares or U.S. dollar-denominated securities of foreign issuers).    
Foreign securities investments may be affected by changes in currency rates or  
exchange control regulations, changes in governmental administration or economic
or monetary policy (in the United States and abroad) or changed circumstances in
dealing between nations. Dividends paid by foreign issuers may be subject to    
withholding and other foreign taxes that may decrease the net return on these   
investments as compared to dividends paid to the Fund by domestic corporations. 
There may be less publicly available information about foreign issuers than     
about domestic issuers, and foreign issuers are not subject to uniform          
accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements         
comparable to those of domestic issuers. Securities of some foreign issuers are 
less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable domestic issuers and
foreign brokerage commissions are generally higher than in the United States.   
Foreign securities markets may also be less liquid, more volatile and subject to
less government supervision than those in the United States. Investments in     
foreign countries could be affected by other factors not present in the United  
States, including expropriation, confiscatory taxation and potential            
difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations. Securities purchased on      
foreign exchanges may be held in custody by a foreign bank or a foreign branch  
of a domestic bank.                                                             

The risks associated with investing in foreign securities are often heightened  
for investments in emerging markets countries. These heightened risks include   
(i) greater risks of expropriation, confiscatory taxation, nationalization, and 
less social, political and economic stability; (ii) the small size of the       
markets for securities of emerging markets issuers and the currently low or     
nonexistent volume of trading, resulting in lack of liquidity and in price      
volatility; (iii) certain national policies which may restrict the Fund's       
investment opportunities including restrictions on investing in issuers or      
industries deemed sensitive to relevant national interests; and (iv) the absence
of developed legal structures governing private or foreign investment and       
private property. A Fund's purchase and sale of portfolio securities in certain 
emerging markets countries may be constrained by limitations as to daily changes
in the prices of listed securities, periodic trading or settlement volume and/or
limitations on aggregate holdings of foreign investors. In certain cases, such  
limitations may be computed based upon the aggregate trading by or holdings of  
the Fund, Alger Management and its affiliates and its clients and other service 
providers. The Fund may not be able to sell                                     

 -6-

P-->485BPOS44th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�44th
securities in circumstances where price, trading or settlement volume           
limitations have been reached. These limitations may have a negative impact on a
Fund's performance and may adversely affect the liquidity of the Fund's         
investment to the extent that it invests in certain emerging market countries.  
In addition, some emerging markets countries may have fixed or managed          
currencies which are not free-floating against the U.S. dollar. Further, certain
emerging markets countries' currencies may not be internationally traded.       
Certain of these currencies have experienced volatility relative to the U.S.    
dollar. If a Fund does not hedge the U.S. dollar value of securities it owns    
denominated in currencies that are devalued, the Fund's net asset value will be 
adversely affected. If the Fund hedges the U.S. dollar value of securities it   
owns denominated in currencies that increase in value, the Fund will not benefit
from the hedge it purchased, and will lose the amount it paid for the hedge.    
Many emerging markets countries have experienced substantial, and in some       
periods extremely high, rates of inflation for many years. Inflation and rapid  
fluctuations in inflation rates have had and may continue to have adverse       
effects on the economies and securities markets of certain of these countries.  

Each Fund may purchase American Depositary Receipts ("ADRs"), American          
Depositary Shares ("ADSs") or U.S. dollar-denominated securities of foreign     
issuers, which are not subject to Spectra Fund's 20% foreign securities         
limitation. ADRs and ADSs are traded in U.S. securities markets and represent   
the securities of foreign issuers. While ADRs and ADSs may not necessarily be   
denominated in the same currency as the foreign securities they represent, many 
of the risks associated with foreign securities may also apply to ADRs and ADSs.

These securities may be purchased through "sponsored" or "unsponsored"          
facilities. A sponsored facility is established jointly by the issuer of the    
underlying security and a depositary. A depositary may establish an unsponsored 
facility without participation by the issuer of the deposited security. Holders 
of unsponsored depositary receipts generally bear all the costs of such         
facilities, and the depositary of an unsponsored facility frequently is under no
obligation to distribute shareholder communications received from the issuer of 
the deposited security or to pass through voting rights to the holders of such  
receipts in respect of the deposited securities.                                

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS                                                         

Each Fund may invest in, or enter into, derivatives for a variety of reasons,   
including to hedge certain market or interest rate risks, to provide a          
substitute for purchasing or selling particular securities or to increase       
potential returns. Generally, derivatives are financial contracts whose value   
depends upon, or is derived from, the value of an underlying asset, reference   
rate or index, and may relate to stocks, bonds, interest rates, currencies or   
currency exchange rates, and related indexes. Examples of derivative instruments
the Funds may use include, but are not limited to, options contracts, futures   
contracts, and options on futures contracts. Derivatives may provide a cheaper, 
quicker or more specifically focused way for the Fund to invest than            
"traditional" securities would. Alger Management, however, may decide not to    
employ some or all of these strategies for a Fund and there is no assurance that
any derivatives strategy used by the Fund will succeed.                         

Derivatives can be volatile and involve various types and degrees of risk,      
depending upon the characteristics of the particular derivative and the         
portfolio as a whole. Derivatives permit a Fund to increase or decrease the     
level of risk, or change the character of the risk, to which its portfolio is   
exposed in much the same way as the Fund can increase or decrease the level of  
risk, or change the character of the risk, of its portfolio by making           
investments in specific securities. However, derivatives may entail investment  
exposures that are greater than their cost would suggest, meaning that a small  
investment in derivatives could have a large potential impact on a Fund's       
performance.                                                                    

If a Fund invests in derivatives at inopportune times or judges market          
conditions incorrectly, such investments may lower the Fund's return or result  
in a loss. A Fund also could experience losses if its derivatives were poorly   
correlated with the underlying instruments or the Fund's other investments, or  
if the Fund were unable to liquidate its position because of an illiquid        
secondary market. The market for many derivatives is, or suddenly can become,   
illiquid. Changes in liquidity may result in significant, rapid and             
unpredictable changes in the prices for derivatives.                            

Each Fund, as permitted, may take advantage of opportunities in options and     
futures contracts and options on futures contracts and any other derivatives    
which are not presently contemplated for use by the Fund or which are not       
currently available but which may be developed, to the extent such opportunities
are both consistent with the Fund's investment objective and legally permissible
for the Fund. Before a Fund enters into such transactions or makes any such     
investment, the Fund will provide appropriate disclosure in its Prospectus or   
this Statement of Additional Information.                                       

Derivatives may be purchased on established exchanges or through privately      
negotiated transactions referred to as over-the-counter derivatives.            
Exchange-traded derivatives generally are guaranteed by the clearing agency that
is the issuer or counterparty to such derivatives. This guarantee usually is    
supported by a daily variation margin system operated by the clearing agency in 
order to reduce overall credit risk. As                                         

 -7-

P-->485BPOS45th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�45th
a result, unless the clearing agency defaults, there is relatively little       
counterparty credit risk associated with derivatives purchased on an exchange.  
In contrast, no clearing agency guarantees over-the-counter derivatives.        
Therefore, each party to an over-the-counter derivative bears the risk that the 
counterparty will default. Accordingly, Alger Management will consider the      
creditworthiness of counterparties to over-the-counter derivatives in the same  
manner as it would review the credit quality of a security to be purchased by a 
Fund. Over-the-counter derivatives are less liquid than exchange-traded         
derivatives since the other party to the transaction may be the only investor   
with sufficient understanding of the derivative to be interested in bidding for 
it.                                                                             

Some derivatives the Funds use involve leverage (e.g., an instrument linked to  
the value of a securities index may return income calculated as a multiple of   
the price movement of the underlying index). This economic leverage will        
increase the volatility of these instruments as they may increase or decrease in
value more quickly than the underlying security, index, futures contract,       
currency or other economic variable. Pursuant to regulations and/or published   
positions of the SEC, a Fund may be required to segregate permissible liquid    
assets, or engage in other measures approved by the SEC or its staff, to "cover"
the Fund's obligations relating to its transactions in derivatives. For example,
in the case of futures contracts or forward contracts that are not contractually
required to cash settle, a Fund must set aside liquid assets equal to such      
contracts' full notional value (generally the total numerical value of the asset
underlying a future or forward contract at the time of valuation) while the     
positions are open. With respect to futures contracts or forward contracts that 
are contractually required to cash settle, however, the Fund is permitted to    
set aside liquid assets in an amount equal to the Fund's daily marked-to-market 
net obligation (i.e., the Fund's daily net liability) under the contracts, if   
any, rather than such contracts' full notional value. By setting aside assets   
equal to only its net obligations under cash-settled futures and forwards       
contracts, a Fund may employ leverage to a greater extent than if the Fund were 
required to segregate assets equal to the full notional value of such contracts.

Neither the Trust nor the Funds will be a commodity pool. The Trust has filed   
notice with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and National Futures       
Association of its eligibility, as a registered investment company, for an      
exclusion from the definition of commodity pool operator and that neither the   
Trust nor the Funds is subject to registration or regulation as a pool operator 
under the Commodity Exchange Act.                                               

FUTURES TRANSACTIONS--IN GENERAL (ALL FUNDS OTHER THAN SPECTRA FUND)            

A futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy and sell a        
security for a set price on a future date. These contracts are traded on        
exchanges, so that, in most cases, either party can close out its position on   
the exchange for cash, without delivering the security. An option on a futures  
contract gives the holder of the option the right to buy from or sell to the    
writer of the option a position in a futures contract at a specified price on or
before a specified expiration date.                                             

Although some futures contracts call for making or taking delivery of the       
underlying securities, generally these obligations are closed out before        
delivery by offsetting purchases or sales of matching futures contracts (same   
exchange, underlying security or index, and delivery month). Closing out a      
futures contract sale is effected by purchasing a futures contract for the same 
aggregate amount of the specific type of financial instrument with the same     
delivery date. If an offsetting purchase price is less than the original sale   
price, the Fund realizes a capital gain, or if it is more, the Fund realizes a  
capital loss. Conversely, if an offsetting sale price is more than the original 
purchase price, the Fund realizes a capital gain, or if it is less, the Fund    
realizes a capital loss. Transaction costs also are included in these           
calculations.                                                                   

Each Fund other than Spectra Fund may enter into futures contracts in U.S.      
domestic markets or on exchanges located outside the United States. Foreign     
markets may offer advantages such as trading opportunities or arbitrage         
possibilities not available in the United States. Foreign markets, however, may 
have greater risk potential than domestic markets. For example, some foreign    
exchanges are principal markets so that no common clearing facility exists and  
an investor may look only to the broker for performance of the contract. In     
addition, any profits that a Fund might realize in trading could be eliminated  
by adverse changes in the currency exchange rate, or the Fund could incur losses
as a result of those changes.                                                   

Engaging in these transactions involves risk of loss to a Fund which could      
adversely affect the value of the Fund's net assets. Although each Fund intends 
to purchase or sell futures contracts only if there is an active market for such
contracts, no assurance can be given that a liquid market will exist for any    
particular contract at any particular time. Many futures exchanges and boards of
trade limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices      
during a single trading day. Once the daily limit has been reached in a         
particular contract, no trades may be made that day at a price beyond that limit
or trading may be suspended for specified periods during the trading day.       
Futures con-                                                                    

 -8-

P-->485BPOS46th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�46th
tract prices could move to the limit for several consecutive trading days with  
little or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of futures positions
and potentially subjecting the Fund to substantial losses.                      

Successful use of futures by a Fund also is subject to Alger Management's       
ability to predict correctly movements in the direction of the relevant market  
and, to the extent the transaction is entered into for hedging purposes, to     
ascertain the appropriate correlation between the securities being hedged and   
the price movements of the futures contract. For example, if a Fund uses futures
to hedge against the possibility of a decline in the market value of securities 
held in its portfolio and the prices of such securities instead increase, the   
Fund will lose part or all of the benefit of the increased value of securities  
which it has hedged because it will have offsetting losses in its futures       
positions. Furthermore, if in such circumstances the Fund has insufficient cash,
it may have to sell securities to meet daily variation margin requirements. The 
Fund may have to sell such securities at a time when it may be disadvantageous  
to do so.                                                                       

SPECIFIC FUTURES TRANSACTIONS. Each Fund other than Spectra Fund may invest in  
futures contracts and options on futures contracts, including those with respect
to securities indexes, interest rates and currencies.                           

Each Fund other than Spectra Fund may purchase and sell index futures contracts 
and options thereon. An index future obligates the Fund to pay or receive an    
amount of cash equal to a fixed dollar amount specified in the futures contract 
multiplied by the difference between the settlement price of the contract on the
contract's last trading day and the value of the index based on the prices of   
the securities that comprise the index at the opening of trading in such        
securities on the next business day.                                            

Each Fund other than Spectra Fund may purchase and sell interest rate futures   
contracts and options thereon. An interest rate future obligates the Fund to    
purchase or sell an amount of a specific debt security at a future date at a    
specific price.                                                                 

Each Fund other than Spectra Fund may purchase and sell currency futures and    
options thereon. A foreign currency future obligates the Fund to purchase or    
sell an amount of a specific currency at a future date at a specific price.     

OPTIONS                                                                         

Each Fund may purchase put and call options and sell (write) covered put and    
covered call options on securities and securities indexes to increase gain or to
hedge against the risk of unfavorable price movements although, as in the past, 
it does not currently intend to rely on these strategies extensively, if at all.
The Funds may only buy or sell options that are listed on a national securities 
exchange.                                                                       

A call option on a security is a contract that gives the holder of the option   
the right to buy from the writer (seller) of the call option, in return for a   
premium paid, the security underlying the option at a specified exercise price  
at any time during the term of the option. The writer of the call option has the
obligation upon exercise of the option to deliver the underlying security upon  
payment of the exercise price during the option period. A put option on a       
security is a contract that, in return for the premium, gives the holder of the 
option the right to sell to the writer (seller) the underlying security at a    
specified price during the term of the option. The writer of the put, who       
receives the premium, has the obligation to buy the underlying security upon    
exercise at the exercise price during the option period.                        

A Fund will not sell options that are not covered. A call option written by the 
Fund on a security is "covered" if the Fund owns the underlying security covered
by the call or has an absolute and immediate right to acquire that security     
without additional cash consideration (or for additional cash consideration held
in a segregated account) upon conversion or exchange of other securities held in
its portfolio. A call option is also covered if the Fund holds a call on the    
same security as the call written where the exercise price of the call held is  
(1) equal to or less than the exercise price of the call written or (2) greater 
than the exercise price of the call written if the difference is maintained by  
the Fund in cash, U.S. Government securities or other high grade short-term     
obligations in a segregated account. A put option is "covered" if the Fund      
maintains cash or other high-grade, short-term obligations with a value equal to
the exercise price in a segregated account or else holds a put on the same      
security as the put written where the exercise price of the put held is equal to
or greater than the exercise price of the put written.                          

If a Fund has written an option, it may terminate its obligation by effecting a 
closing purchase transaction. This is accomplished by purchasing an option of   
the same series as the option previously written. However, once the Fund has    
been assigned an exercise notice, the Fund will be unable to effect a closing   
purchase transaction. Similarly, if the Fund is the holder of an option it may  
liquidate its position by effecting a closing sale transaction. This is         
accomplished by selling an option of the same series as the option previously   
purchased. There can be no assurance that either a closing purchase or sale     
transaction can be effected when a Fund so desires.

A Fund will realize a profit from a closing transaction if the price of the     
transaction is less than the premium received from writing the option or is more
than the premium paid to purchase the option; the Fund will realize a loss from 
a closing transaction if the price of the transaction is more than the premium  
received from writing the option or less than the premium paid to purchase the  
option. Since call option prices generally reflect increases in the price of the
underlying security, any loss resulting from the repurchase of a call option may
also be wholly or partially offset by unrealized appreciation of the underlying 
security. Other principal factors affecting the market value of a put or a call 
option include supply and demand, interest rates, the current market price and  
price volatility of the underlying security and the time remaining until the    
expiration date.                                                                

An option position may be closed out only on an exchange which provides a       
secondary market for an option of the same series. Although the Funds will      
generally not purchase or write options that appear to lack an active secondary 
market, there is no assurance that a liquid secondary market on an exchange will
exist for any particular option. In such event it might not be possible to      
effect closing transactions in particular options, so that the Fund would have  
to exercise its option in order to realize any profit and would incur brokerage 
commissions upon the exercise of the options. If a Fund, as a covered call      
option writer, is unable to effect a closing purchase transaction in a secondary
market, it will not be able to sell the underlying security until the option    
expires or it delivers the underlying security upon exercise or otherwise covers
the position.                                                                   

In addition to options on securities, the Funds may also purchase and sell call 
and put options on securities indexes. A stock index reflects in a single number
the market value of many different stocks. Relative values are assigned to the  
stocks included in an index and the index fluctuates with changes in the market 
values of the stocks. The options give the holder the right to receive a cash   
settlement during the term of the option based on the difference between the    
exercise price and the value of the index. By writing a put or call option on a 
securities index, the Fund is obligated, in return for the premium received, to 
make delivery of this amount. The Fund may offset its position in stock index   
options prior to expiration by entering into a closing transaction on an        
exchange or it may let the option expire unexercised.                           

Use of options on securities indexes entails the risk that trading in the       
options may be interrupted if trading in certain securities included in the     
index is interrupted. The Fund will not purchase these options unless Alger     
Management is satisfied with the development, depth and liquidity of the market 
and Alger Management believes the options can be closed out.                    

Price movements in a Fund's securities may not correlate precisely with         
movements in the level of an index and, therefore, the use of options on indexes
cannot serve as a complete hedge and will depend, in part, on the ability of    
Alger Management to predict correctly movements in the direction of the stock   
market generally or of a particular industry. Because options on securities     
indexes require settlement in cash, Alger Management may be forced to liquidate 
portfolio securities to meet settlement obligations.                            

Although Alger Management will attempt to take appropriate measures to minimize 
the risks relating to any trading by the Funds in put and call options, there   
can be no assurance that a Fund will succeed in any option trading program it   
undertakes.                                                                     

A Fund will not purchase options if, as a result, the aggregate cost of all     
outstanding options exceeds 10% of the Fund's total assets, although no more    
than 5% will be committed to transactions entered into for non-hedging          
(speculative) purposes.                                                         

STOCK INDEX FUTURES AND OPTIONS ON STOCK INDEX FUTURES                          

Futures are generally bought and sold on the commodities exchanges where they   
are listed with payment of initial and variation margin as described below. The 
sale of a futures contract creates a firm obligation by the Fund, as seller, to 
deliver to the buyer the net cash amount called for in the contract at a        
specific future time. Put options on futures might be purchased to protect      
against declines in the market values of securities occasioned by a decline in  
stock prices, and securities index futures might be sold to protect against a   
general decline in the value of securities of the type that comprise the index. 
Options on futures contracts are similar to options on securities except that an
option on a futures contract gives the purchaser the right, in return for the   
premium paid, to assume a position in a futures contract and obligates the      
seller to deliver such position.                                                

A stock index future obligates the seller to deliver (and the purchaser to take)
an amount of cash equal to a specific dollar amount times the difference between
the value of a specific stock index at the close of the last trading day of the 
contract and the price at which the agreement is made. No physical delivery of  
the underlying stocks in the index is made. While incidental to its securities  
activities, the Fund may use index futures as a substitute for a comparable     
market position in the underlying securities.                                   

If a Fund uses futures, or options thereon, for hedging, the risk of imperfect  
correlation increases as the com-                                               

-10-

P-->485BPOS48th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�48th
position of the Fund varies from the composition of the stock index. In an      
effort to compensate for the imperfect correlation of movements in the price of 
the securities being hedged and movements in the price of the stock index       
futures, the Fund may, if it uses a hedging strategy, buy or sell stock index   
futures contracts in a greater or lesser dollar amount than the dollar amount of
the securities being hedged if the historical volatility of the stock index     
futures has been less or greater than that of the securities. Such "over        
hedging" or "under hedging" may adversely affect the Fund's net investment      
results if market movements are not as anticipated when the hedge is            
established.                                                                    

An option on a stock index futures contract, as contrasted with the direct      
investment in such a contract, gives the purchaser the right, in return for the 
premium paid, to assume a position in a stock index futures contract at a       
specified exercise price at any time prior to the expiration date of the option.
The Fund will sell options on stock index futures contracts only as part of     
closing purchase transactions to terminate its options positions. No assurance  
can be given that such closing transactions can be effected or that there will  
be correlation between price movements in the options on stock index futures and
price movements in the Fund's securities which are the subject of the hedge. In 
addition, the Fund's purchase of such options will be based upon predictions as 
to anticipated market trends, which could prove to be inaccurate.               

A Fund's use, if any, of stock index futures and options thereon will in all    
cases be consistent with applicable regulatory requirements and in particular   
the rules and regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and will  
be entered into only, if at all, for bona fide hedging, risk management or other
portfolio management purposes. Typically, maintaining a futures contract or     
selling an option thereon will require the Fund to deposit with a financial     
intermediary as security for its obligations an amount of cash or other         
specified assets (initial margin) which initially is typically 1% to 10% of the 
face amount of the contract (but may be higher in some circumstances).          
Additional cash or assets (variation margin) may be required to be deposited    
thereafter on a daily basis as the mark to market value of the contract         
fluctuates. The purchase of an option on stock index futures involves payment of
a premium for the option without any further obligation on the part of the Fund.
If the Fund exercises an option on a futures contract it will be obligated to   
post initial margin (and potential subsequent variation margin) for the         
resulting futures position just as it would for any position. Futures contracts 
and options thereon are generally settled by entering into an offsetting        
transaction but there can be no assurance either that the position can be offset
prior to settlement at an advantageous price, or that delivery will occur. In   
order to cover its potential obligations if the Fund enters into futures        
contracts or options thereon, the Fund will maintain a segregated account which 
will contain only liquid assets in an amount equal to the total market value of 
such futures contracts less the amount of initial margin on deposit for such    
contracts.                                                                      

A Fund will not enter into a futures contract or related option (except for     
closing transactions) if, immediately thereafter, the sum of the amount of its  
initial margin and premiums on open futures contracts and options thereon would 
exceed 5% of the Fund's total assets (taken at current value); however, in the  
case of an option that is in-the-money at the time of the purchase, the         
in-the-money amount may be excluded in calculating the 5% limitation.           

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. Each Fund other than Spectra Fund may enter into 
foreign currency transactions for a variety of purposes, including: to fix in   
U.S. dollars, between trade and settlement date, the value of a security the    
Fund has agreed to buy or sell; to hedge the U.S. dollar value of securities the
Fund already owns, particularly if it expects a decrease in the value of the    
currency in which the foreign security is denominated; or to gain or reduce     
exposure to the foreign currency for investment purposes. The currency exposure 
of the Fund's portfolio typically will be unhedged to the U.S. dollar.          

Foreign currency transactions may involve, for example, a Fund's purchase of    
foreign currencies for U.S. dollars or the maintenance of short positions in    
foreign currencies. A short position would involve the Fund agreeing to exchange
an amount of a currency it did not currently own for another currency at a      
future date in anticipation of a decline in the value of the currency sold      
relative to the currency the Fund contracted to receive. A Fund's success in    
these transactions may depend on the ability of Alger Management to predict     
accurately the future exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S.    
dollar.                                                                         

Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. 
They generally are determined by the forces of supply and demand in the foreign 
exchange markets and the relative merits of investments in different countries, 
actual or perceived changes in interest rates and other complex factors, as seen
from an international perspective. Currency exchange rates also can be affected 
unpredictably by intervention, or failure to intervene, by U.S. or foreign      
governments or central banks, or by currency controls or political developments 
in the United States or abroad.

P-->485BPOS49th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�49th
SWAP TRANSACTIONS. Each Fund other than Spectra Fund may engage in swap         
transactions, including currency swaps, index swaps and interest rate swaps. A  
Fund may enter into swaps for both hedging purposes and to seek to increase     
total return. A Fund also may enter into options on swap agreements, sometimes  
called "swaptions."                                                             

Swap agreements are two party contracts entered into primarily by institutional 
investors for periods ranging from a few weeks to more than one year. In a      
standard "swap" transaction, two parties agree to exchange the returns (or      
differentials in rates of return) earned or realized on particular predetermined
investments or instruments. The gross returns to be exchanged or "swapped"      
between the parties are generally calculated with respect to a "notional        
amount," i.e., the return on or increase in value of a particular dollar amount 
invested at a particular interest rate, in a particular foreign currency, or in 
a "basket" of swaps or securities representing a particular index. The "notional
amount" of the swap agreement is only used as a basis upon which to calculate   
the obligations that the parties to a swap agreement have agreed to exchange.   

Most swap agreements entered into by the Funds are cash settled and calculate   
the obligations of the parties to the agreement on a "net basis." Thus, a Fund's
current obligations (or rights) under a swap agreement generally will be equal  
only to the net amount to be paid or received under the agreement based on the  
relative values of the positions held by each party to the agreement (the "net  
amount"). A Fund's current obligations under a swap agreement will be accrued   
daily (offset against any amounts owed to the Fund) and any accrued but unpaid  
net amounts owed to a swap counterparty will be covered by the segregation of   
permissible liquid assets of the Fund.                                          

A swap option is a contract that gives a counterparty the right (but not the    
obligation) in return for payment of a premium, to enter into a new swap        
agreement or to shorten, extend, cancel or otherwise modify an existing swap    
agreement, at some designated future time on specified terms. A cash-settled    
option on a swap gives the purchaser the right in return for the premium paid,  
to receive an amount of cash equal to the value of the underlying swap as of the
exercise date. These options typically are purchased in privately negotiated    
transactions from financial institutions, including securities brokerage firms. 
Depending on the terms of the particular option agreement, a Fund generally will
incur a greater degree of risk when it writes a swap option than it will incur  
when it purchases a swap option. When a Fund purchases a swap option, it risks  
losing only the amount of the premium it has paid should it decide to let the   
option expire unexercised. However, when a Fund writes a swap option, upon      
exercise of the option the Fund will become obligated according to the terms of 
the underlying agreement.                                                       

The use of swap agreements is a highly specialized activity which involves      
strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio    
security transactions. If Alger Management is incorrect in its forecasts of     
applicable market factors, or a counterparty defaults, the investment           
performance of the Fund would diminish compared with what it would have been if 
these techniques were not used. In addition, it is possible that developments in
the swap market, including potential government regulation, could adversely     
affect the Fund's ability to terminate existing swap agreements or to realize   
amounts to be received under such agreements.                                   

A Fund will enter into swap agreements only when Alger Management believe it    
would be in the best interests of the Fund to do so. In addition, a Fund will   
enter into swap agreements only with counterparties that meet certain standards 
of creditworthiness (generally, such counterparties would have to be eligible   
counterparties under the terms of the Funds' repurchase agreement guidelines).  

COMBINED TRANSACTIONS. Each Fund other than Spectra Fund may enter into multiple
transactions, including multiple options transactions, multiple futures         
transactions, multiple currency transactions including forward currency         
contracts and multiple interest rate transactions, structured notes and any     
combination of futures, options, currency and interest rate transactions        
("component transactions"), instead of a single transaction, as part of a single
or combined strategy when, in the opinion of Alger Management, it is in the best
interests of the Fund to do so. A combined transaction will usually contain     
elements of risk that are present in each of its component transactions.        
Although combined transactions are normally entered into based on Alger         
Management's judgment that the combined strategies will reduce risk or otherwise
more effectively achieve the desired portfolio management goal, it is possible  
that the combination will instead increase such risks or hinder achievement of  
the portfolio management objective.                                             

FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS. Each Fund may take advantage of opportunities in options   
and futures contracts and options on futures contracts and any other derivatives
which are not presently contemplated for use by the Fund or which are not       
currently available but which may be developed, to the extent such opportunities
are both consistent with the Fund's investment objective and legally permissible
for the Fund. Before a Fund enters into such transactions or makes              

-12-

P-->485BPOS50th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�50th
any such investment, the Fund will provide appropriate disclosure in its        
Prospectus or this Statement of Additional Information.                         

BORROWINGS                                                                      

The Funds may borrow money from banks and use it to purchase additional         
securities. This borrowing is known as leveraging. Leveraging increases both    
investment opportunity and investment risk. If the investment gains on          
securities purchased with borrowed money exceed the cost of borrowing, including
interest paid on the borrowing, the net asset value of a Fund's shares will rise
faster than would otherwise be the case. On the other hand, if the investment   
gains fail to cover the cost (including interest) of borrowings, or if there are
losses, the net asset value of the Fund's shares will decrease faster than would
otherwise be the case. Each Fund may also borrow from banks for temporary or    
emergency purposes. Each Fund is required to maintain continuous asset coverage 
(that is, total assets including borrowings, less liabilities exclusive of      
borrowings) of 300% of the amount borrowed. If such asset coverage should       
decline below 300% as a result of market fluctuations or other reasons, the Fund
may be required to sell some of its portfolio holdings within three days to     
reduce the debt and restore the 300% asset coverage, even though it may be      
disadvantageous from an investment standpoint to sell securities at that time.  

INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS                                                         

Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Act"), a             
"fundamental" policy may not be changed without the vote of a "majority of the  
outstanding voting securities" of the Fund, which is defined in the Act as the  
lesser of (a) 67% or more of the shares present at a Fund meeting if the holders
of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund are present or           
represented by proxy or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding shares. Each Fund's
investment objective is a non-fundamental policy, which may be changed by the   
Board of Trustees at any time.                                                  

For each Fund:                                                                  

1. Except as otherwise permitted by the Act, or interpretations or modifications
by, or exemptive or other relief from, the SEC or other authority with          
appropriate jurisdiction, and disclosed to investors, the Fund may not borrow   
money, except to the extent permitted under the Act (which currently limits     
borrowing to no more than 33-1/3% of the value of the Fund's total assets).     

2. Except as otherwise permitted by the Act, or interpretations or modifications
by, or exemptive or other relief from, the SEC or other authority with          
appropriate jurisdiction, and disclosed to investors, the Fund may not act as an
underwriter of securities of other issuers, except to the extent the Fund may be
deemed an underwriter under the Securities Act, by virtue of disposing of       
portfolio securities.                                                           

3. Except as otherwise permitted by the Act, or interpretations or modifications
by, or exemptive or other relief from, the SEC or other authority with          
appropriate jurisdiction, and disclosed to investors, the Fund may not lend any 
securities or make loans to others. For purposes of this investment restriction,
the purchase of debt obligations (including acquisitions of loans, loan         
participations or other forms of debt instruments) and the entry into repurchase
agreements shall not constitute loans by the Fund.                              

4. Except as otherwise permitted by the Act, or interpretations or modifications
by, or exemptive or other relief from, the SEC or other authority with          
appropriate jurisdiction, and disclosed to investors, the Fund may not issue any
senior security (as such term is defined in Section 18(f) of the Act), except   
insofar as the Fund may be deemed to have issued a senior security by reason of 
borrowing money in accordance with the Fund's borrowing policies. For purposes  
of this investment restriction, collateral, escrow, or margin or other deposits 
with respect to the making of short sales, the purchase or sale of futures      
contracts or options, purchase or sale of forward foreign currency contracts,   
and the writing of options on securities are not deemed to be an issuance of    
senior security.                                                                

5. Except as otherwise permitted by Act, or interpretations or modifications by,
or exemptive or other relief from, the SEC or other authority with appropriate  
jurisdiction, and disclosed to investors, the Fund may not purchase, hold or    
deal in real estate, but the Fund may purchase and sell securities that are     
secured by real estate or issued by companies that invest or deal in real estate
or real estate investment trusts and may acquire and hold real estate or        
interests therein through exercising rights or remedies with regard to such     
securities.                                                                     

6. Except as otherwise permitted by the Act, or interpretations or modifications
by, or exemptive or other relief from, the SEC or other authority with          
appropriate jurisdiction, and disclosed to investors, the Fund may not invest in
physical commodities or physical commodities contracts, except that the Fund may
purchase and sell options, forward contracts, futures contracts, including those
related to indices, and options on futures contracts or indices and enter into  
swap agreements and other derivative instruments.                               

7. Except as otherwise permitted by the Act, or interpretations or modifications
by, or exemptive or other relief from, the SEC or other authority with          
appropriate jurisdiction, and disclosed to investors, the Fund

may not invest more than 25% of the value of its total assets in the securities 
of issuers in any single industry, provided that there shall be no limitation on
the purchase of obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its    
agencies or instrumentalities or as otherwise permitted by the SEC.             

Except in the case of the percentage limitation set forth in Investment         
Restriction No. 1, the percentage limitations contained in the foregoing        
restrictions apply at the time of the purchase of the securities and a later    
increase or decrease in percentage resulting from a change in the values of the 
securities or in the amount of the Fund's assets will not constitute a violation
of the restriction.                                                             

Each Fund is currently classified as a diversified fund under the 1940 Act. A   
diversified fund may not purchase securities of an issuer (other than           
obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its agencies or        
instrumentalities) if, with respect to 75% of the fund's total assets, (a) not  
more than 5% of the fund's total assets would be invested in securities of that 
issuer, or (b) the fund would hold more than 10% of the outstanding voting      
securities of that issuer. Under the 1940 Act, a Fund cannot change its         
classification from diversified to non-diversified without shareholder approval.

PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS 

Decisions to buy and sell securities and other financial instruments for a Fund 
are made by Alger Management, which also is responsible for placing these       
transactions, subject to the overall review of the Fund's Board of Trustees.    
Although investment requirements for each Fund are reviewed independently from  
those of the other accounts managed by Alger Management, investments of the type
the Fund might make may also be made by these other accounts. When the Fund and 
one or more other accounts managed by Alger Management are prepared to invest   
in, or desire to dispose of, the same security or other financial instrument,   
available investments or opportunities for sales will be allocated in a manner  
believed by Alger Management to be equitable to each. In some cases, this       
procedure may affect adversely the price paid or received by the Fund or the    
size of the position obtained or disposed of by the Fund.                       

Transactions in equity securities are in many cases effected on U.S. stock      
exchanges or over-the-counter markets and involve the payment of negotiated     
brokerage commissions. Where there is no stated commission, as in the case of   
certain securities traded in the over-the-counter markets, the prices of those  
securities include undisclosed commissions or mark-ups. Purchases and sales of  
money market instruments and debt securities usually are principal transactions.
These securities are normally purchased directly from the issuer or from an     
underwriter or market maker for the securities. The cost of securities purchased
from underwriters includes an underwriting commission or concession and the     
prices at which securities are purchased from and sold to dealers include a     
dealer's mark-up or mark-down. U.S. Government securities are generally         
purchased from underwriters or dealers, although certain newly-issued U.S.      
Government securities may be purchased directly from the U.S. Treasury or from  
the issuing agency or instrumentality.                                          

To the extent consistent with applicable provisions of the Act and the rules and
exemptions adopted by the SEC thereunder, as well as other regulatory           
requirements, the Board of Trustees has determined that portfolio transactions  
will be executed through Fred Alger & Company, Incorporated ("Alger Inc.") if,  
in the judgment of Alger Management, the use of Alger Inc. is likely to result  
in price and execution at least as favorable as those of other qualified        
broker-dealers and if, in particular transactions, Alger Inc. charges the Funds 
a rate consistent with that which other broker-dealers charge to comparable     
unaffiliated customers in similar transactions. Over-the-counter purchases and  
sales are transacted directly with principal market makers except in those cases
in which better prices and executions may be obtained elsewhere. Principal      
transactions are not entered into with affiliates of the Trust except pursuant  
to exemptive rules or orders adopted by the SEC.                                

In selecting brokers or dealers to execute portfolio transactions, Alger        
Management seeks the best overall terms available. In assessing the best overall
terms available for any transaction, Alger Management will consider the factors 
it deems relevant, including the breadth of the market in the investment, the   
price of the investment, the financial condition and execution capability of the
broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the      
specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In addition, Alger Management is
authorized, in selecting parties to execute a particular transaction and in     
evaluating the best overall terms available, to consider the brokerage and      
research services, as those terms are defined in section 28(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, provided to the Funds and/or the other accounts over which
Alger Management or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. Alger        
Management's fees under its agreements with the Funds are not reduced by reason 
of its receiving brokerage and research service. The Board of Trustees will     
periodically review the commissions paid by the Funds to determine if the       
commissions paid over representative periods of time are reasonable in relation 
to the benefits inuring to the Fund. During the fiscal years ended October 31,
2006, October 31, 2005 and October 31, 2004, Spectra Fund paid an aggregate     

-14-

P-->485BPOS52nd�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�52nd
of approximately $1,050,034, $1,167,262 and $1,411,537 respectively, in         
brokerage commissions, of which approximately $510,806, $640,343 and $651,251   
respectively, was paid to Alger Inc. The commissions paid to Alger Inc. during  
the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006 constituted 48.65% of the aggregate      
brokerage commissions paid by the Fund; during that year, 60.96% of the         
aggregate dollar amount of transactions by the Funds involving the payment of   
brokerage commissions was effected through Alger Inc. Alger Inc. does not engage
in principal transactions with the Funds and, accordingly, received no          
compensation in connection with securities purchased or sold in that manner,    
which include securities traded in the over-the-counter markets, money market   
investments and most debt securities. During the fiscal year ended October 31,
2006, $31,620,485 in portfolio transactions, incurring $78,167 in commissions,  
was allocated to brokers who supplied research to Spectra Fund, or Alger        
Management.                                                                     

NET ASSET VALUE 

The price of one share of a class is based on its "net asset value." The net    
asset value is computed by adding the value of the Fund's investments plus cash 
and other assets allocable to the class, deducting applicable liabilities and   
then dividing the result by the number of its shares outstanding. The net asset 
value of a share of a given class may differ from that of one or more other     
classes. Net asset value is calculated as of the close of business (normally    
4:00 p.m. Eastern time) time on each day the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") is
open.                                                                           

The New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") is generally open on each Monday through   
Friday, except New Year's Day, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day (the third Monday
in January), Presidents' Day (the third Monday in February), Good Friday,       
Memorial Day (the last Monday in May), Independence Day, Labor Day (the first   
Monday in September), Thanksgiving Day (the fourth Thursday in November) and    
Christmas Day.                                                                  

The assets of the Fund are generally valued on the basis of market quotations.  
Securities whose principal market is on an exchange or in the over-the-counter  
market are valued at the last reported sales price or, in the absence of        
reported sales, at the mean between the bid and asked price or, in the absence  
of a recent bid or asked price, the equivalent as obtained from one or more of  
the major market makers for the securities to be valued. Bonds and other fixed  
income securities may be valued on the basis of prices provided by a pricing    
service when the Board of Trustees believes that these prices reflect the fair  
market value of the securities. Other investments and other assets, including   
restricted securities and securities for which market quotations are not readily
available, are valued at fair value under procedures approved by the Board of   
Trustees. Short-term securities with maturities of 60 days or less are valued at
amortized cost, which constitutes fair value as determined by the Board of      
Trustees.                                                                       

PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS                                                       

Shares are offered continuously by the Funds and are distributed on a best      
efforts basis by Alger Inc. as principal underwriter for the Funds pursuant to a
distribution agreement (the "Distribution Agreement"). Under the Distribution   
Agreement, Alger Inc. bears all selling expenses, including the costs of        
advertising and of printing prospectuses and distributing them to prospective   
shareholders. Each of the officers of the Fund and Hilary M. Alger are          
"affiliated persons," as defined in the Act, of the Fund and of Alger Inc.      

Third-party checks will not be honored except in the case of employer-sponsored 
retirement plans. You will be charged a fee for any check returned by your bank.

Investors may exchange stock of companies acceptable to Alger Management for    
shares of a Fund with a minimum of 100 shares of each company generally being   
required. The Funds believe such exchange provides a means by which holders of  
certain securities may invest in the Funds without the expense of selling the   
securities in the open market. The investor should furnish, either in writing or
by telephone, to Alger Management a list with a full and exact description of   
all securities proposed for exchange. Alger Management will then notify the     
investor as to whether the securities are acceptable and, if so, will send a    
letter of transmittal to be completed and signed by the investor. Alger         
Management has the right to reject all or any part of the securities offered for
exchange. The securities must then be sent in proper form for transfer with the 
letter of transmittal to the Custodian of the Funds' assets. The investor must  
certify that there are no legal or contractual restrictions on the free transfer
and sale of the securities. Upon receipt by the Custodian the securities will be
valued as of the close of business on the day of receipt in the same manner as  
the Funds' securities are valued each day. Shares of a Fund having an equal net 
asset as of the close of the same day will be registered in the investor's name.
Applicable sales charges, if any, will apply, but there is no charge for making 
the exchange and no brokerage commission on the securities accepted, although   
applicable stock transfer taxes, if any, may be deducted. The exchange of       
securities by the investor pursuant to this offer may constitute a taxable      
transaction and may result in a gain or loss for federal income tax purposes.   
The tax treatment experienced by investors may vary depending upon individual   
circumstances. Each investor should

CONFIRMATIONS AND ACCOUNT STATEMENTS                                            

All of your transactions through the Transfer Agent, Boston Financial Data      
Services, Inc., will be confirmed on separate written transaction confirmations 
(other than Automatic Investment Plan transactions) and on periodic account     
statements. You should promptly and carefully review the transaction            
confirmations and periodic statements provided to you and notify the Transfer   
Agent in writing of any discrepancy or unauthorized account activity. Any       
information contained on transaction confirmations and account statements will  
be conclusive unless you notify the Transfer Agent of an apparent discrepancy or
unauthorized account activity within ten (10) business days after the           
information is transmitted to you.                                              

PURCHASES THROUGH PROCESSING ORGANIZATIONS                                      

You can purchase and redeem shares through a "Processing Organization," which is
a broker-dealer, bank or other financial institution that purchases shares of   
one or more Funds for its clients or customers. The Funds may authorize a       
Processing Organization to receive, or to designate other financial             
organizations to receive, purchase and redemption orders on the Funds' behalf.  
In that case, the Funds will be deemed to have received an order when the       
Processing Organization or its intermediary receives it in proper form, and the 
order will be processed based on the net asset value of the Funds next          
calculated after the order is received in proper form by the Processing         
Organization or its designee.                                                   

When shares are purchased this way, the Processing Organization, rather than its
customer, may be the shareholder of record of the shares. The minimum initial   
and subsequent investments in classes of the Funds for shareholders who invest  
through a Processing Organization will be set by the Processing Organization.   
Processing Organizations, which may include broker-dealers, banks or other      
financial institutions, may impose charges and restrictions in addition to or   
different from those applicable if you invest in the Funds directly. Therefore, 
you should read the materials provided by the Processing Organization in        
conjunction with the Prospectus. Certain Processing Organizations may receive   
compensation from the Funds, Alger, Inc., or any of its affiliates.             

AUTOMATIC INVESTMENT PLAN                                                       

Purchases into your account will be made on the day of the month you select. If 
the day of the month you select falls on a weekend or a NYSE holiday, the       
purchase shall be made on the next business day. In order to participate, your  
account must be held by a bank which is a member of the Automated Clearing      
House.                                                                          

Please note that transfers from your bank account to a fund sponsored retirement
account will be considered current year contributions.                          

While there is no charge to shareholders for this service, a fee will be        
deducted from a shareholder's Fund account in the case of insufficient funds. A 
shareholder's Automatic Investment Plan may be terminated at any time without   
charge or penalty by the shareholder, the Fund, the Transfer Agent or Alger Inc.
Class A Share purchases will remain subject to the initial sales charge.        

TELEPURCHASE AND TELEREDEMPTION                                                 

The price the shareholder will receive will be the price next computed after the
Transfer Agent receives the TelePurchase or TeleRedemption request from the     
shareholder to purchase shares or redeem shares, respectively. You can apply for
TelePurchase or TeleRedemption by completing an Additional Services Form and    
returning it to the Transfer Agent. Although the Funds are authorized to charge 
a fee of $17 for each Automated Clearing House redemption, they do not currently
intend to do so. To use these privileges, your bank must be a member of the     
Automated Clearing House. Shares held in any Spectra retirement plan and shares 
issued in certificate form are not eligible for this service.                   

REDEMPTIONS AND EXCHANGES                                                       

You may incur a 2% redemption fee if you redeem shares of the Funds within 30   
days of having acquired them. Shareholders claiming waivers of the redemption   
fee must assert their status at the time of redemption.                         

The right of redemption of shares of the Funds may be suspended, or the date of 
payment postponed for more than seven days, (a) for any periods during which the
NYSE is closed (other than for customary weekend and holiday closings), (b) when
trading in the markets the Fund normally utilizes is restricted, or an          
emergency, as defined by the rules and regulations of the SEC, exists, making   
disposal of the Funds' investments or determination of its net asset value not  
reasonably practicable or (c) for such other periods as the SEC by order may    
permit for protection of the Funds' shareholders.                               

No interest will accrue on amounts represented by uncashed distribution or      
redemption checks.                                                              

TELEPHONE REDEMPTIONS                                                           

You automatically have the ability to make redemptions by telephone unless you  
refuse the telephone redemption privilege. To sell shares by telephone, please  
call (800)711-6141. Redemption requests received prior to the close of business 
of the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) will generally be mailed on the   
next business day. Shares held in any Alger retirement plan and shares issued in
certificate form are not eligible for this service.                             

-16-

P-->485BPOS54th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�54th
Redemption proceeds are mailed to the address of record. Any request for        
redemption proceeds to be sent to the address of record must be in writing with 
the signature(s) guaranteed if made within 30 days of changing your address.    

The Funds, the Transfer Agent and their affiliates are not liable for acting in 
good faith on telephone instructions relating to your account, so long as they  
follow reasonable procedures to determine that the telephone instructions are   
genuine. Such procedures may include recording the telephone calls and requiring
some form of personal identification. You should verify the accuracy of         
telephone transactions immediately upon receipt of your confirmation statement. 

REDEMPTIONS IN KIND                                                             

Payment for shares tendered for redemption is ordinarily made in cash. However, 
the Board of Trustees has adopted procedures which provide that if the Board    
determines that it would be detrimental to the best interest of the remaining   
shareholders of a Fund to make payment of a redemption order wholly or partly in
cash, the Fund may pay the redemption proceeds in whole or in part by a         
distribution "in kind" of securities from the Fund, in lieu of cash, in         
conformity with applicable rules of the SEC. The Trust has elected to be        
governed by Rule 18f-1 under the Act, pursuant to which each Fund is obligated  
to redeem shares solely in cash up to the lesser of $250,000 or 1% of the net   
assets of the Fund during any 90-day period for any one shareholder. If shares  
are redeemed in kind, the redeeming shareholder might incur brokerage or other  
costs in selling the securities for cash. The method of valuing securities used 
to make redemptions in kind will be the same as the method each Fund uses to    
value its portfolio securities and such valuation will be made as of the time   
the redemption price is determined.                                             

SYSTEMATIC WITHDRAWAL PLAN                                                      

A systematic withdrawal plan (the "Withdrawal Plan") is available to            
shareholders who own shares of a Fund with a value exceeding $10,000 and who    
wish to receive specific amounts of cash periodically. Withdrawals of at least  
$50 monthly (but no more than 1% of the value of a shareholder's shares in the  
Fund) may be made under the Withdrawal Plan by redeeming as many shares of the  
Fund as may be necessary to cover the stipulated withdrawal payment. To the     
extent that withdrawals exceed dividends, distributions and appreciation of a   
shareholder's investment in a Fund, there will be a reduction in the value of   
the shareholder's investment and continued withdrawal payments may reduce the   
shareholder's investment and ultimately exhaust it. Withdrawal payments should  
not be considered as income from investment in a Fund.                          

Shareholders who wish to participate in the Withdrawal Plan and who hold their  
shares in certificated form must deposit their share certificates of the Fund   
from which withdrawals will be made with Alger Shareholder Services, Inc., as   
agent for Withdrawal Plan members. All dividends and distributions on shares in 
the Withdrawal Plan are automatically reinvested at net asset value in          
additional shares of the Fund. For additional information regarding the         
Withdrawal Plan, contact the Funds.                                             

SIGNATURE GUARANTEES                                                            

The Transfer Agent has adopted standards and procedures pursuant to which       
Medallion Signature Guarantees in proper form generally will be accepted from   
domestic banks, brokers, dealers, credit unions, and national securities        
exchanges, that are participants in the New York Stock Exchange Medallion       
Signature Program (MSP), the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program       
(STAMP), and the Stock Exchanges Medallion Program (SEMP).                      

EXCHANGE PRIVILEGE                                                              

Shareholders may exchange shares of a Fund for shares of the Alger Money Market 
Fund (the "MMF") of The Alger Funds, another mutual fund managed by Alger       
Management, and conversely may also exchange shares of the MMF for Fund shares. 
MMF shares acquired in such exchanges, together with MMF shares acquired through
reinvestment of dividends on such shares, may be exchanged for shares of a Fund,
but only for Fund shares of the same class as those originally exchanged for MMF
shares. These exchanges will normally be effected at the respective net asset   
values of the Fund and MMF next determined after the exchange request is        
accepted, with no sales charge or transaction fee imposed. If you exchange      
shares of a Fund for shares of the MMF within 30 days of purchase (including    
purchase by exchange into the Fund), the Fund may impose a redemption fee of 2% 
of the amount redeemed.                                                         

Shares of the MMF received in an exchange will earn dividends beginning on the  
next business day after the exchange. Before exchanging Fund shares for MMF     
shares, an investor should carefully read a Prospectus describing the MMF. To   
obtain a Prospectus for The Alger Funds and more information about such         
exchanges, please call (800) 711-6141. The Funds reserve the right to terminate 
or modify this exchange privilege or to charge a per-exchange fee upon notice to
shareholders.                                                                   

For tax purposes, an exchange of shares is treated as a sale of the shares      
exchanged and therefore you may realize a taxable gain or loss when you exchange
shares.

MANAGEMENT 
TRUSTEES AND OFFICERS OF THE TRUST                                              

The Trust is governed by a Board of Trustees which is responsible for protecting
the interests of shareholders under Massachusetts law. The Board of Trustees has
two standing committees: an Audit Committee and a Nominating Committee. The     
Audit Committee oversees (a) each Fund's accounting and financial reporting     
policies and practices and its internal controls and (b) the quality and        
objectivity of each Fund's financial statements and the independent audit       
thereof. The members of the Committee, which met four times during the Funds'   
last fiscal year, are Lester L. Colbert, Jr., Stephen E. O'Neil and Nathan E.   
Saint-Amand. The function of the Nominating Committee is to select and nominate 
all candidates who are not "interested persons" of the Trust ("Independent
Trustees") for election to the Trust's Board. The Nominating Committee, which   
met once during the Funds' last fiscal year, is composed of all the Independent

No director, officer or employee of Alger Management or its affiliates receives 
any compensation from the Trust for serving as an officer or Trustee of the     
Trust. Each Fund now pays each Independent Trustee $500 for each meeting        
attended, to a maximum of $2,000 per annum, plus travel expenses incurred for   
attending the meeting. The Trustees and officers of the Fund are permitted to   
purchase shares of the Fund without the payment of any sales charge. Applicable 
sales charges are waived for these individuals in order to promote the alignment
of such individuals' economic interests with the Fund. The Trust did not offer  
its Trustees any pension or retirement benefits during or prior to the fiscal   
year ended October 31, 2006. The following table provides compensation amounts

INVESTMENT MANAGER                                                              

Alger Management serves as investment adviser to each Fund pursuant to a written
agreement (the "Advisory Agreement") and under the supervision of the Board of  
Trustees. As Manager, Alger Management makes investment decisions for each Fund 
and continuously reviews its investment program. Alger Management also serves as
Administrator to the Funds and is responsible for the overall administration of 
the Funds pursuant to a written agreement (the "Administration Agreement"). As  
Administrator, Alger Management provides administrative services to the Funds,  
including: providing office space, telephone, office equipment and supplies;    
authorizing expenditures and approves bills for payment on behalf of the Funds; 
supervising preparation of periodic shareholder reports, notices and other      
shareholder communications; supervising the daily pricing of the Funds'         
investment portfolios and the publication of the net asset value of the Funds'  
shares, earnings reports and other financial data; monitoring relationships with
organizations providing services to the Funds, including the Funds' custodian,  
transfer agent and printers; providing trading desk facilities for the Funds;   
and supervising compliance by the Funds with recordkeeping and periodic         
reporting requirements under the Act.                                           

It is anticipated that Alger Inc., an affiliate of Alger Management, will serve 
as the Trust's broker in effecting most of the Funds' transactions on securities
exchanges and will retain commissions in accordance with certain regulations of 
the SEC. In addition, Alger Management employs professional securities analysts 
who provide research services exclusively to the Funds and other accounts for   
which Alger Management or its affiliates serve as investment adviser or         
subadviser. Alger Management bears all expenses in connection with the          
performance of its services under the Advisory Agreement and the Administration 
Agreement.                                                                      

Alger Management has been in the business of providing investment advisory      
services since 1964 and, as of December 31, 2006, had approximately $7.6 billion
under management as well as $1.9 billion in other assets. Alger Management is   
owned by Alger Inc. which in turn is owned by Alger Associates, a financial     
services holding company. As of the date of this SAI, Alger Associates and,     
indirectly, Alger Management, are controlled by Mr. Alger's three daughters,    
Hilary M. Alger, Nicole D. Alger and Alexandra D. Alger, each of whom owns 33%  
of the voting rights of Alger Associates.                                       

As compensation for its services, the Trust has agreed to pay the Manager an    
investment advisory fee, accrued daily and payable monthly, at the annual rates 
set forth below as a percentage of the average daily net asset value of the     
relevant Fund:

Each Fund also pays Alger Management an administrative fee at the annual rate of
..04% of that Fund's average daily net assets.                                  

For the fiscal years ended October 31, 2006, October 31, 2005, and October 31,
2004, Alger Management received $2,960,376, $3,029,513 and $3,735,425,          
respectively, from Spectra Fund under these arrangements.                       

DESCRIPTION OF PORTFOLIO MANAGER COMPENSATION STRUCTURE                         

An Alger portfolio manager's compensation generally consists of salary and an   
annual bonus. In addition, portfolio managers are eligible for standard health  
and retirement benefits available to all Alger employees, including a 401(k)    
plan sponsored by Alger. A portfolio manager's base salary is typically a       
function of the portfolio manager's experience (with consideration given to     
type, investment style and size of investment portfolios previously managed),   
performance of his job responsibilities, and financial services industry peer   
comparisons. Base salary is generally a fixed amount that is subject to an      
annual review. The annual bonus is variable from year to year, and considers    
various factors, including:                                                     

o    the firm's overall financial results and profitability;                    

o    the firm's overall investment management performance;                      

o    current  year's  and prior  years'  pre-tax  investment  performance  (both
  relative  and  absolute) of the portfolios for which the  individual  is
responsible; and                                                      

o    the individual's leadership contribution within the firm.                  

OTHER ACCOUNTS MANAGED BY PORTFOLIO MANAGER                                     

The numbers and assets (1,000,000s) of other accounts managed by the portfolio  
managers of the Funds as of October 31, 2006 are as follows. No account's       
advisory fee is based on the performance of the account.

SECURITIES OWNED BY THE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS                                      

Mr. Kelly's beneficial interest in shares of the Spectra Fund, as of the date of
this Statement of Additional Information, exceeds $100,000.                     

No other portfolio manager owns shares of the Fund he or she manages.           

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST                                                 

The portfolio managers are generally responsible for managing several accounts  
for several clients. In addition to the Funds and other funds advised by the    
Manager, these other accounts may include separate accounts, mutual funds       
sub-advised by Alger Management, and other investment vehicles. Moreover, the   
size of these accounts can vary significantly from the size of the Fund.        
Potential conflicts of interest exist when a portfolio manager has              
responsibility and makes investment decisions involving such accounts. While    
investment decisions for accounts are made with consideration of their          
respective investment objectives and constraints, availability of cash for      
investment, current holdings and size of investment positions, it is therefore  
possible that a particular security may be bought or sold for only one account, 
or in different amounts and at different times for different accounts. To       
address this conflict, Alger Management has developed trade allocation policies 
and procedures designed to avoid action that would result in intentional an     
improper advantage or disadvantage to any one account managed by Alger          
Management. Accordingly, transactions are generally allocated among accounts in 
a manner believed by Alger Management to be most equitable to each account,     
generally using a pro-rata allocation methodology. Exceptions to pro-rata       
allocation are made to recognize the investment needs and particular            
restrictions of each individual account, including but not limited to           
consideration of issuer concentration, industry exposure, asset class exposure, 
credit exposure, available cash, desire to eliminate and/or not establish de    
minimis positions, and to accounts with specialized investment policies and     
objectives.                                                                     

EXPENSES OF THE FUNDS                                                           

Operating expenses for the Funds generally consist of all costs not specifically
borne by Alger Management, including custodian fees, Trustees' fees, transfer   
agency fees, legal fees, auditing costs, investment management fees, fees for   
necessary professional and brokerage services, costs of regulatory compliance   
and costs associated with maintaining legal existence and shareholder relations.
In addition, the Funds may compensate Alger Inc. for servicing shareholder      
accounts. From time to time, Alger Management, in its sole discretion and as it 
deems appropriate, may assume certain expenses of the Funds while retaining the 
ability to be reimbursed by the Funds for such amounts prior to the end of the  
fiscal year. This will have the effect of lowering a Fund's overall expense     
ratio and of increasing return to investors, or the converse, at the time such  
amounts are assumed or reimbursed, as the case may be.                          

DISTRIBUTION PLAN                                                               

Under a distribution plan (the "Plan") adopted in accordance with Rule 12b-1    
under the Act, each Fund may pay Alger Inc. a fee, at an annual rate of up to   
0.25% of the average daily net assets of the Fund's Class N shares primarily for
remittance to qualified plan service providers and other financial              
intermediaries as compensation for distribution assistance and shareholder      
services with respect to the Fund's shares. The Plan is a "compensation" type   
plan and permits the payment at an annual rate of up to 0.25% of the average    
daily net assets allocable to Class N shares of the Funds for recordkeeping and 
administrative services as well as activities that are primarily intended to    
result in sales of shares of the Funds, including but not limited to preparing, 
printing and distributing prospectuses, Statement of Additional Information,    
shareholder reports, and educational materials to investors; compensating       
selling personnel; responding to inquiries by investors; receiving and answering
correspondence; investor-level recordkeeping and administrative services; and   
similar activities. The Plan and any related agreement that is entered into by  
the Trust in connection with the Plan will continue in effect for a period of   
more than one year only so long as continuance is specifically approved at least
annually by a vote of a majority of the Trustees and of a majority of the       
Independent Trustees, and who have no direct or indirect financial interest in  
the operation of the Plan or any related agreements. All material amendments to 
the Plan must be approved by a majority vote of the Trustees, including a       
majority of the Independent Trustees, at a meeting called for that purpose. The 
Plan may not be amended to increase materially the amount to be spent with      
respect to a Fund without the approval                                          

-22-

P-->485BPOS60th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�60th
of the affected class of shareholders of the Fund. In addition, the Plan may    
be terminated with respect to a Fund at any time, without penalty, by vote of a 
majority of the outstanding affected class of shares of the Fund or by vote of a
majority of the Independent Trustees.                                           

The Funds may compensate certain entities other than Alger Inc. and its         
affiliates for providing recordkeeping and/or administrative services to        
participating retirement plans and other institutional investors holding Fund   
shares. This compensation may be paid at an annual rate of up to 0.25% of the   
net asset value of shares of the Fund held by those accounts.                   

DISTRIBUTOR                                                                     

From time to time Alger Inc., at its expense from its own resources, may        
compensate brokers, dealers, investment advisers or others ("financial          
intermediaries") who are instrumental in effecting investments by their clients 
or customers in the Trust, in an amount up to 1% of those investments. Alger    
Inc. may also from time to time, at its expense from its own resources, make    
payments to other financial intermediaries that provide shareholder servicing or
transaction processing, with such payments structured as a percentage of gross  
sales, a percentage of net assets, and/or as a fixed dollar amount (the latter  
as a per account fee or as reimbursement for transactions processing and        
transmission charges ). Payments under these other arrangements may vary but    
generally will not exceed 0.50% annually of Trust assets or 0.50% annually of   
Trust sales attributable to that financial intermediary. Alger Inc. determines  
whether to make any additional cash payments and the amount of any such payments
in response to requests from financial intermediaries, based on factors Alger   
Inc. deems relevant. Factors considered by Alger, Inc. generally include the    
financial intermediary's reputation, ability to attract and retain assets for   
the Trust, expertise in distributing a particular class of shares of the Trust, 
entry into target markets, and/or quality of service.                           

Financial intermediaries with whom Alger Inc. has its most significant          
arrangements to make additional cash compensation payments are AG Edwards, Bear 
Stearns, Capital Investment Brokerage, CIBC World Markets, Citigroup, Goldman   
Sachs, Kemper Investors, Legg Mason Wood Walker, Leonard & Company, Lincoln     
Financial Advisors, Lincoln Investment Planning, Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner &  
Smith, MetLife Securities, Morgan Stanley & Co., Oppenheimer & Co., Inc., RBC   
Dain Rauscher, Retirement System Distributors, Ryan Beck & Co., Securities      
America, Smith Hayes Financial, UBS, USI Securities and Walnut Street           
Securities. In addition, Alger, Inc. may make payments to dealer firms in the   
form of payments for marketing support, seminar support, training meetings, or  
comparable expenses in the discretion of Alger Inc. Please contact your         
financial intermediary for details about revenue sharing payments it may        
receive. Any payments described above will not change the price paid by         
investors for the purchase of shares of a Fund or the amount of proceeds        
received by a Fund on the sale of shares.                                       

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM                                   

Ernst & Young LLP serves as the independent registered public accounting firm   
for the Fund.                                                                   

CODE OF ETHICS 

Alger Management personnel ("Access Persons") are permitted to engage in        
personal securities transactions, including transactions in securities that may 
be purchased or held by the Fund, subject to the restrictions and procedures of 
the Fund's Code of Ethics. Pursuant to the Code of Ethics, Access Persons       
generally must preclear all personal securities transactions prior to trading   
and are subject to certain prohibitions on personal trading. You can get a copy 
of the Fund's Code of Ethics by calling the Fund toll-free at (800) 711-6141.   

TAXES 

The following is a summary of selected federal income tax considerations that   
may affect the Fund and its shareholders. The summary is not intended to        
substitute for individual tax advice and investors are urged to consult their   
own tax advisers as to the federal, state and local tax consequences of         
investing in the Funds.                                                         

Each Fund intends to qualify as a "regulated investment company" under          
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). If  
qualified as a regulated investment company, a Fund will pay no federal income  
taxes on its investment company taxable income (that is, taxable income other   
than net realized long-term capital gains) and its net realized long-term       
capital gains that are distributed to shareholders. To qualify under Subchapter 
M, a Fund must, among other things, distribute to its shareholders at least 90% 
of its taxable net investment income and net realized short-term capital gains. 
In so qualifying, the Fund may be restricted in the utilization of certain of   
the investment techniques described above and in the Fund's prospectus. As a    
regulated investment company, each Fund is subject to a non-deductible excise   
tax of 4% with respect to certain undistributed amounts of income and capital   
gains during the calendar year. Each Fund expects to make additional            
distributions or change the timing of its distributions so as to avoid the      
application of this tax.                                                        

In general, any gain or loss on the redemption or exchange of Fund shares will  
be long-term capital gain or loss if held by the shareholder for more than one  
year, and will be short-term capital gain or loss if held for one year or less. 
However, if a shareholder receives a distribution taxable as long-term capital  
gain with respect to Fund shares, and redeems or exchanges the shares before    
holding them for more than six months, any loss                                 

-23-

P-->485BPOS61st�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�61st
on the redemption or exchange up to the amount of the distribution will be      
treated as a long-term capital loss.                                            

Dividends of a Fund's net investment income and distributions of its short-term 
capital gains will generally be taxable as ordinary income. Distributions of    
long-term capital gains will be taxable as such at the appropriate rate,        
regardless of the length of time you have held shares of the Fund. Only         
dividends that reflect a Fund's income from certain dividend-paying stocks will 
be eligible for the federal dividends-received deduction for corporate          
shareholders.                                                                   

If a Fund is the holder of record of any stock on the record date for any       
dividends payable with respect to such stock, such dividends are included in the
Fund's gross income as of the later of (a) the date such stock became           
ex-dividend with respect to such dividends (i.e., the date on which a buyer of  
the stock would not be entitled to receive the declared, but unpaid, dividends) 
or (b) the date the Fund acquired such stock. Accordingly, in order to satisfy  
its income distribution requirements, a Fund may be required to pay dividends   
based on anticipated earnings and shareholders may receive dividends in an      
earlier year than would otherwise be the case.                                  

Investors considering buying shares of a Fund just prior to a record date for a 
taxable dividend or capital gain distribution should be aware that, regardless  
of whether the price of the Fund shares to be purchased reflects the amount of  
the forthcoming dividend or distribution payment, any such payment will be a    
taxable dividend or distribution payment.                                       

If a shareholder fails to furnish a correct taxpayer identification number,     
fails to fully report dividend or interest income, or fails to certify that he  
or she has provided a correct taxpayer identification number and that he or she 
is not subject to such withholding, then the shareholder may be subject to a 28%
"backup withholding tax" with respect to (i) any taxable dividends and          
distributions and (ii) any proceeds of any redemption of Fund shares.           

Shortly after the close of each calendar year, you will receive a statement     
setting forth the dollar amounts of dividends and any distributions for the     
prior calendar year and the tax status of the dividends and distributions for   
federal income tax purposes. You should consult your tax adviser to assess the  
federal, state and local tax consequences of investing in each Fund. This       
discussion is not intended to address the tax consequences of an investment by a
nonresident alien.                                                              

CUSTODIAN AND TRANSFER AGENT 

State Street Bank and Trust Company, 225 Franklin Street, Boston, Massachusetts
02110, serves as custodian of the Fund's assets pursuant to a custodian         
agreement. State Street Bank & Trust Company also serves as transfer agent for  
the Fund pursuant to a transfer agency agreement, with transfer agent services  
provided by State Street's affiliate, Boston Financial Data Services, Inc.      
("Boston Financial"). Under the transfer agency agreement, Boston Financial     
processes purchases and redemptions of shares of the Fund, maintains the        
shareholder account records for the Fund, handles certain communications between
shareholders and the Fund and distributes any dividends and distributions       
payable by the Fund. The Fund and Alger Inc. (or its affiliates) may enter into 
an agreement for recordkeeping services. Similarly, the Fund, Alger Inc. (or its
affiliates) and nonaffiliated third-party service providers may enter into      
agreements for record keeping services.                                         

Under the transfer agency agreement, Boston Financial is compensated on a       
per-account and, for certain transactions, a per-transaction basis. The Trust   
has entered into a Shareholder Administrative Services Agreement with Alger     
Shareholder Services, Inc. (an affiliate of Alger Inc. and the Trust's transfer 
agent prior to November 22, 2004) to compensate Alger Shareholder Services Inc. 
on a per account basis for its liaison and administrative oversight of Boston   
Financial and related services. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006,  
the Trust paid Alger Shareholder Services, Inc. $41,711 under the Shareholder   
Administrative Services Agreement.                                              

DIVERSIFICATION 

The Fund is classified as a "diversified" investment company under the          
Investment Company Act of 1940. A "diversified" investment company is required, 
with respect to 75% of its assets, to limit its investment in any one issuer    
(other than the U.S. government) to no more than 5% of the investment company's 
total assets. The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a "regulated investment
company" under the Internal Revenue Code; one of the requirements for such      
qualification is a quarterly diversification test, applicable to 50% (rather    
than 75%) of the Fund's assets, similar to the requirement stated above.        

CERTAIN SHAREHOLDERS 

Set forth below is certain information regarding significant shareholders of the
Funds.                                                                          

The following table contains information regarding persons who are known        
to own of record 5% or more of Class N shares. All holdings are expressed as a  
percentage of the applicable Fund's outstanding shares as of February 1, 2007.  
Unless otherwise indicated, the Fund has no knowledge as to whether all or any  
portion of the shares owned of record are also owned beneficially.

*     A shareholder who owns more than 25% of the voting securities of a class  
    of shares of the Fund is deemed to "control" the Fund under the Act, and
may heavily influence a shareholder vote.                           

As of February 1, 2007, each Fund's Trustees and officers as a group hold       
directly less than 1% of the Fund's outstanding Class N shares. Fred Alger      
Management, Inc., a New York corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alger 
Associates, Inc., a New York corporation, of which Hilary M. Alger, Nicole D.   
Alger and Alexandra D. Alger are the controlling shareholders. These            
relationships may have the effect of disproportionately diminishing the voting  
power of other shareholders of the Fund.                                        

ORGANIZATION 

The Trust is an investment company. From its inception in 1968 until February
12, 1996, the Trust was organized as a Massachusetts business corporation, and  
had operated as a registered closed-end investment company since 1978. Shares of
closed-end investment companies, unlike those of open-end companies, are        
ordinarily not redeemable and are not continuously offered for sale to the      
public. On February 12, 1996, the Trust reorganized as a Massachusetts business 
trust and also converted to an open-end investment company, or "mutual fund." In
connection with the reorganization, the name of the Trust was changed from      
"Spectra Fund, Inc." to "Spectra Fund." The Trust is authorized to offer an     
unlimited number of shares. The Trust changed its name to "The Spectra Funds" on
January 4, 2007.                                                                

The Trust is a "series fund," which is a mutual fund divided into separate      
portfolios, each of which is treated as a separate entity for certain matters   
under the Act and for other purposes. A shareholder of one portfolio is not     
deemed to be a shareholder of any other portfolio. For certain matters          
shareholders vote together as a group; as to others they vote separately by     
portfolio.                                                                      

To date, the Board has authorized the creation of four series of shares. All    
consideration received by the Trust for shares of a series, and all assets in   
which such consideration is invested, will belong to that series (subject only  
to the rights of creditors of the Trust) and will be subject to the liabilities 
related thereto. The income attributable to, and the expenses of, a series will 
be treated separately from those of the other series. The Trust has the ability 
to create, from time to time, new series without shareholder approval.          

Rule 18f-2 under the Act provides that any matter required to be submitted under
the provisions of the Act or applicable state law or otherwise to the holders of
the outstanding voting securities of an investment company, such as the Trust,  
will not be deemed to have been effectively acted upon unless approved by the   
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of each series affected by such 
matter. Rule 18f-2 further provides that a series shall be deemed to be affected
by a matter unless it is clear that the interests of each series in the matter  
are identical or that the matter does not affect any interest of such series.   
The Rule exempts the selection of the independent registered public accounting  
firm and the election of Trustees from the separate voting requirements of the  
Rule.                                                                           

Although, as a Massachusetts business trust, the Trust is not required by law to
hold annual shareholder meetings, it may hold meetings from time to time on     
important matters, and shareholders have the right to call a meeting to remove a
Trustee or to take other action described in the Trust's Declaration of Trust.  
Meetings of shareholders normally will not be held for the purpose of electing  
Trustees unless and until such time as less than a majority of the Trustees     
holding office have been elected by shareholders, at which time the Trustees    
then in office will call a shareholders' meeting for the election of Trustees.  
Under the Act, shareholders of record of no less than two-thirds of the         
outstanding shares of the Trust may remove a Trustee through a declaration in   
writing or by vote cast in person or by proxy at a meeting called for that      
purpose. Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustees are required to call a meeting 
of shareholders for the purpose of voting on the question of removal of any such
Trustee when requested in                                                       

-25-

P-->485BPOS63rd�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�63rd
writing to do so by the shareholders of record of not less than 10% of the      
Trust's outstanding shares.                                                     

Shares do not have cumulative voting rights, which means that holders of more   
than 50% of the shares voting for the election of Trustees can elect all        
Trustees. Shares have equal voting rights, which cannot be adversely modified   
other than by majority vote. Shares are transferable but have no preemptive,    
conversion or subscription rights. Physical shares certificates are not issued  
for shares of the Funds.                                                        

Massachusetts law provides that shareholders could, under certain circumstances,
be held personally liable for the obligations of the Trust. However, the Trust  
Agreement disclaims shareholder liability for acts or obligations of the Trust  
and requires that notice of such disclaimer be given in each agreement,         
obligation or instrument entered into or executed by the Trust or a Trustee. The
Trust Agreement provides for indemnification from the Trust's property for all  
losses and expenses of any shareholder held personally liable for the           
obligations of a Fund. Thus, the risk of a shareholder's incurring financial    
loss on account of shareholder liability is limited to circumstances in which   
the Fund itself would be unable to meet its obligations, a possibility that the 
Trust believes is remote. Upon payment of any liability incurred by a Fund, the 
shareholder paying the liability will be entitled to reimbursement from the     
general assets of the Fund. The Trustees intend to conduct the operations of the
Funds in a manner so as to avoid, as far as possible, ultimate liability of the 
shareholders for liabilities of the Fund.                                       

PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES 

The Board of Trustees of the Fund has delegated authority to vote all proxies   
related to the Fund's portfolio securities to Alger Management, the Fund's      
investment manager. Alger Management, an investment adviser registered under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, maintains discretionary authority  
over client accounts, including the Fund, and is responsible for voting proxies 
of all foreign and domestic securities held in the Fund. Management views the   
responsibility its clients have entrusted to it seriously and has adopted and   
implemented written policies and procedures designed to ensure that proxies are 
voted in the best interests of its clients.                                     

Alger Management delegates its proxy voting authority for all foreign and       
domestic securities held in the Funds to Institutional Shareholder Services,    
Inc. ("ISS"), a leading proxy voting service provider and registered investment 
adviser. ISS votes proxies strictly in accordance with pre-determined proxy     
voting guidelines in order to minimize conflicts of interest. The pre-determined
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below, address matters such as    
operations, board of directors, proxy contests, anti-takeover defenses, mergers 
and corporate restructuring, state of incorporation, capital structure,         
executive and director compensation, social and environmental issues and mutual 
fund proxies. ISS will recuse itself from voting proxies should it have a       
material conflict of interest with the company whose proxies are at issue. Alger
Management monitors ISS' proxy voting policies and procedures on a quarterly    
basis to ensure that the proxies are voted in the best interests of the Fund.   

Alger Management maintains records of its proxy voting policies and procedures. 
Alger Management or ISS, on Management's behalf, maintains proxy statements     
received regarding securities held by the Fund; records of votes cast on behalf 
of the Fund; records of requests for proxy voting information; and any documents
prepared that were material to making a voting decision.                        

No later than August 31st each year, the Fund's proxy voting record for the most
recent 12 months ended June 30th will be available upon request by calling (800)
992-3863 and/on the Fund's website and on the Securities and Exchange           
Commission's website at HTTP://WWW.SEC.GOV.                                     

The following is a summary of the pre-determined voting guidelines used by Alger
Management or ISS, on Alger Management's behalf, to vote proxies of securities  
held by the Fund.

Votes on director nominees in uncontested elections are made on a CASE-BY-CASE  
basis, examining such factors as the independence of the board and key board    
committees, attendance at board meetings, corporate governance provisions and   
takeover activity.                                                              

PROXY CONTESTS

Vote FOR shareholder proposals that ask a company to submit its poison pill for 
shareholder ratification.

SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES

IN GENERAL 

Current performance information for the Funds may be obtained by calling the    
Fund at (800) 992-3863. Quoted performance may not be indicative of future      
performance. The performance will depend upon factors such as its expenses and  
the types and maturities of securities held by the Fund.                        

From time to time, advertisements or reports to shareholders may compare the    
yield or performance of a Fund with that of other mutual funds with a similar   
investment objective. The performance of the Fund, for example, might be        
compared with rankings prepared by Lipper Analytical Services Inc., which is a  
widely-recognized, independent service that monitors the performance of mutual  
funds, as well as with various unmanaged indices, such as the S&P 500 Index or  
the Russell 3000 Growth Index. In addition, evaluations of the Fund published by
nationally recognized ranking services or articles regarding performance,       
rankings and other Fund characteristics may appear in national publications     
including, but not limited to, BARRON'S, BUSINESS WEEK, FORBES, INSTITUTIONAL   
INVESTOR, INVESTOR'S BUSINESS DAILY, KIPLINGER'S PERSONAL FINANCE, MONEY,       
MORNINGSTAR, THE NEW YORK TIMES, USA TODAY and THE WALL STREET JOURNAL and may  
be included in advertisements or communications to shareholders. Any given      
performance comparison should not be considered as representative of the Fund's 
performance for any future period.                                              

In addition to material we routinely provide to shareholders, we may, upon      
request, make additional statistical information available regarding The Spectra
Funds. Such information will include, among other things, relative weightings   
and characteristics of Fund portfolios versus their respective index and        
security specific impact on overall portfolio performance. Please contact the

Description of certain rating categories assigned by Standard & Poor's, a       
division of the McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc ("S&P"), Moody's Investors Service,  
Inc. ("Moody's"), Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"), Dominion Bond Rating Service Limited   
("DBRS") and A. M. Best Company, Inc. ("Best").                                 

COMMERCIAL PAPER AND SHORT-TERM RATINGS                                         

The designation A-l by S&P indicates that the degree of safety regarding timely 
payment is either overwhelming or very strong. Those issues determined to       
possess overwhelming safety characteristics are denoted with a plus sign (+)    
designation. Capacity for timely payment on issues with an A-2 designation is   
strong. However, the relative degree of safety is not as high as for issues     
designated A-l.                                                                 

    The rating Prime-l (P-l) is the highest commercial paper rating assigned
by Moody's. Issuers of P-l paper must have a superior capacity for repayment of 
short-term promissory obligations and ordinarily will be evidenced by leading   
market positions in well-established industries, high rates of return of funds  
employed, conservative capitalization structures with moderate reliance on debt 
and ample asset protection, broad margins in earnings coverage of fixed         
financial charges and high internal cash generation, and well-established access
to a range of financial markets and assured sources of alternate liquidity.     
Issues rated Prime-2 (P-2) have a strong capacity for repayment of short-term   
promissory obligations. This ordinarily will be evidenced by many of the        
characteristics cited above, but to a lesser degree. Earnings trends and        
coverage ratios, while sound, will be more subject to variation. Capitalization 
characteristics, while still appropriate, may be more affected by external      
conditions. Ample alternate liquidity is maintained.                            

     The rating Fitch-l (Highest Grade) is the highest commercial paper rating
assigned by Fitch. Paper rated Fitch-l is regarded as having the strongest      
degree of assurance for timely payment. The rating Fitch-2 (Very Good Grade) is 
the second highest commercial paper rating assigned by Fitch which reflects an  
assurance of timely payment only slightly less in degree than the strongest     
issues.                                                                         

BOND AND LONG-TERM RATINGS S&P                                                  

Bonds rated AA by S&P are judged by S&P to be high-grade obligations and in the 
majority of instances differ only in small degree from issues rated AAA (S&P's  
highest rating). Bonds rated AAA are considered by S&P to be the highest grade  
obligations and possess the ultimate degree of protection as to principal and   
interest. With AA bonds, as with AAA bonds, prices move with the long-term money
market. Bonds rated A by S&P have a strong capacity to pay principal and        
interest, although they are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of 
changes in circumstances and economic conditions.                               

 S&P's BBB-rated bonds, or medium-grade category bonds, are borderline
between definitely sound obligations and those where the speculative elements   
begin to predominate. These bonds have adequate asset coverage and normally are 
protected by satisfactory earnings. Their susceptibility to changing conditions,
particularly to depressions, necessitates constant watching. These bonds        
generally are more responsive to business and trade conditions than to interest 
rates. This group is the lowest that qualifies for commercial bank investment.  

      Debt rated BB and B by S&P is regarded as having predominantly speculative
characteristics with respect to capacity to pay interest and repay principal.   
While such debt will likely have some quality and protective characteristics,   
these are outweighed by large uncertainties or major risk exposures to adverse  
conditions.                                                                     

Debt rated BB has less near-term vulnerability to default than other
speculative grade debt. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or        
exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions that could lead 
to inadequate capacity to meet timely interest and principal payments. The BB   
rating category is also used for debt subordinated to senior debt that is       
assigned an actual or implied BBB rating.                                       

      Debt rated B by S&P has greater vulnerability to default but presently has
the capacity to meet interest payments and principal repayments. Adverse        
business, financial, or economic conditions would likely impair capacity or     
willingness to pay interest and repay principal. The B rating category also is  
used for debt subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied 
BB or BB rating.                                                                

MOODY'S 

Bonds rated Aa by Moody's are judged to be of high quality by all standards.    
Together with bonds rated Aaa (Moody's highest rating) they comprise what are   
generally known as high-grade bonds. Aa bonds are rated lower than Aaa bonds    
because margins of protection may not be as large as those of Aaa bonds, or     
fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude, or

(continued)                                                                     

there may be other elements present that make the long-term risks appear        
somewhat larger than those applicable to Aaa securities. Bonds that are rated A 
by Moody's possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered
as upper medium-grade obligations. Factors giving security to principal and     
interest are considered adequate, but elements may be present that suggest a    
susceptibility to impairment in the future.                                     

     Moody's Baa-rated bonds are considered as medium-grade obligations, i.e.,
they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured. Interest payments and     
principal security appear adequate for the present, but certain protective      
elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great  
length of time. Such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and, in  
fact, have speculative characteristics as well.                                 

    Bonds rated Ba by Moody's are judged to have speculative elements; their
future cannot be considered as well-assured. Often the protection of interest   
and principal payments may be very moderate and thereby not well safeguarded    
during both good and bad times over the future. Uncertainty of position         
characterizes bonds in this class.                                              

    Bonds rated B by Moody's generally lack characteristics of the desirable
investment. Assurance of interest and principal payments or of maintenance of   
other terms of the contract over any long period of time may be small.          

     Moody's applies the numerical modifiers 1, 2 and 3 to each generic rating
classification from Aa through B. The modifier 1 indicates that the security    
ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates
a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates that the issue ranks in the   
lower end of its generic rating category.                                       

FITCH 

Bonds rated AAA by Fitch are judged by Fitch to be strictly high-grade, broadly 
marketable, suitable for investment by trustees and fiduciary institutions and  
liable to but slight market fluctuation other than through changes in the money 
rate. The prime feature of an AAA bond is a showing of earnings several times or
many times interest requirements, with such stability of applicable earnings    
that safety is beyond reasonable question whatever changes occur in conditions. 
Bonds rated AA by Fitch are judged by Fitch to be of safety virtually beyond    
question and are readily salable, whose merits are not unlike those of the AAA  
class, but whose margin of safety is less strikingly broad. The issue may be the
obligation of a small company, strongly secured but influenced as to rating by  
the lesser financial power of the enterprise and more local type of market.     

    Bonds rated A by Fitch are considered to be investment grade and of high
credit quality. The obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is    
considered to be strong, but may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in       
economic conditions and circumstances than bonds with higher ratings.           

     BBB-rated bonds are considered to be investment grade and of satisfactory
credit quality. The obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is    
considered to be adequate. Adverse changes in economic conditions and           
circumstances, however, are more likely to have adverse impact on these bonds,  
and therefore impair timely payment. The likelihood that the ratings of these   
bonds will fall below investment grade is higher than for bonds with higher     
ratings.                                                                        

    Fitch's BB-rated bonds are considered speculative. The obligor's ability
to pay interest and repay principal may be affected over time by adverse        
economic changes. However, business and financial alternatives can be identified
which could assist the obligor in satisfying its debt service requirements.     

   Fitch's B-rated bonds are considered highly speculative. While bonds in
this class are currently meeting debt service requirements, the probability of  
continued timely payment of principal and interest reflects the obligor's       
limited margin of safety and the need for reasonable business and economic      
activity throughout the life of the issue.                                      

DBRS 

Bonds rated AAA by DBRS are considered to be of the highest credit              
quality, with exceptionally strong protection for the timely repayment of       
principal and interest. Earnings are considered stable, the structure of the    
industry in which the entity operates is strong, and the outlook for future     
profitability is favorable. There are few qualifying factors present which would
detract from the performance of the entity, the strength of liquidity and       
coverage ratios is unquestioned and the entity has established a creditable     
track record of superior performance. Given the extremely tough definition which

APPENDIX 
(continued)                                                                     

DBRS has established for this category, few entities are able to achieve a AAA  
rating.                                                                         

     Bonds rated AA are of superior credit quality, and protection of interest
and principal is considered high. In many cases, they differ from bonds rated   
AAA only to a small degree. Given the extremely tough definition which DBRS has 
for the AAA category (which few companies are able to achieve), entities rated  
AA are also considered to be strong credits which typically exemplify           
above-average strength in key areas of consideration and are unlikely to be     
significantly affected by reasonably foreseeable events.                        

    Bonds rated A are of satisfactory credit quality. Protection of interest
and principal is still substantial, but the degree of strength is less than with
AA rated entities. While a respectable rating, entities in the A category are   
considered to be more susceptible to adverse economic conditions and have       
greater cyclical tendencies than higher rated companies.                        

Bonds rated BBB are considered to be of adequate credit quality.    
Protection of interest and principal is considered adequate, but the entity is  
more susceptible to adverse changes in financial and economic conditions, or    
there may be other adversities present which reduce the strength of the entity  
and its rated securities.                                                       

Bonds rated BB are defined to be speculative, where the degree of   
protection afforded interest and principal is uncertain, particularly during    
periods of economic recession. Entities in the BB area typically have limited   
access to capital markets and additional liquidity support and, in many cases,  
small size or lack of competitive strength may be additional negative           
considerations.                                                                 

Bonds rated "B" are regarded as highly speculative and there is a   
reasonably high level of uncertainty as to the ability of the entity to pay     
interest and principal on a continuing basis in the future, especially in       
periods of economic recession or industry adversity.                            

A.M. BEST                                                                       

The issuer of long-term debt rated aaa has, in A.M. Best's opinion, an          
exceptional ability to meet the terms of its obligation. The rating aa is       
assigned to issues where the issuer has, in A.M. Best's opinion, a very strong  
ability to meet the terms of its obligation., and issues are rated a where the  
ability to meet the terms of the obligation is regarded as strong. The issuer of
debt rated bbb is considered to have an adequate ability to meet the terms of   
its obligation but to be more susceptible to changes in economic or other       
conditions.                                                                     

The issuer of bb-rated long-term debt has, in A.M. Best's opinion,  
speculative credit characteristics, generally due to a moderate margin of       
principal and interest payment protection and vulnerability to economic changes.
The issuer of long-term debt rated b is considered to have extremely speculative
credit characteristics, generally due to a modest margin of principal and       
interest payment protection and extreme vulnerability to economic changes.

Item 25.  INDEMNIFICATION                                                       

       Under Section 8.4 of Registrant's Agreement and Declaration of Trust,
any past or present Trustee or officer of Registrant (including persons who     
serve at Registrant's request as directors, officers or Trustees of another     
organization in which Registrant has any interest as a shareholder, creditor or 
otherwise [hereinafter referred to as a "Covered Person"]) is indemnified to the
fullest extent permitted by law against liability and all expenses reasonably   
incurred by him in connection with any action, suit or proceeding to which he   
may be a party or otherwise involved by reason of his being or having been a    
Covered Person. This provision does not authorize indemnification when it is    
determined, in the manner specified in the Agreement and Declaration of Trust,  
that such Covered Person has not acted in good faith in the reasonable belief   
that his actions were in or not opposed to the best interests of Registrant.    
Moreover, this provision does not authorize indemnification when it is          
determined, in the manner specified in the Agreement and Declaration of Trust,  
that such Covered Person would otherwise be liable to Registrant or its         
shareholders by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or   
reckless disregard of his duties. Expenses may be paid by Registrant in advance 
of the final disposition of any action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an   
undertaking by such Covered Person to repay such expenses to Registrant in the  
event that it is ultimately determined that indemnification of such expenses is 
not authorized under the Agreement and Declaration of Trust and either (i) the  
Covered Person provides security for such undertaking, (ii) Registrant is       
insured against losses from such advances, or (iii) the disinterested Trustees  
or independent legal counsel determines, in the manner specified in the         
Agreement and Declaration of Trust, that there is reason to believe the Covered 
Person will be found to be entitled to indemnification.                         

       Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities
Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") may be permitted to Trustees, officers and   
controlling persons of Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or      
otherwise, Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC") such indemnification is against public policy as
expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event  
that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the       
payment by Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a Trustee, officer or     
controlling person of Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit  
or proceeding) is asserted by such Trustee, officer or controlling person in    
connection with the securities being registered, Registrant will, unless in the 
opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,    
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such         
indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities   
Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
