When I came into PM in the middle of my career, Tom was not only effective in helping me hit the ground running but also in giving me the confidence I needed to do PM as if it were something I’d always been doing.  He’s also great one-on-one; Tom and I tailored a one day one-on-one workshop that enable me to advance so much faster on the implementation of PM principles.  I really look forward to our next meeting.See moreSee lessDetails of original recommendation: 
"I have taken two Product Management training classes with Tom. He is a very knowledgeable instructor in the science of Product management. Coming into a new career as a PM for Alcoa after a 20 year history in sales and marketing, Tom and the 280 group helped to formulate a method of applying Product Management best practices in managing the AFS product through the complete life cycle from inception to launch and retirement. Tom also tutored me in obtaining the AIPMM certification. 
Great teacher and would be happy to recommend Tom to any one who would ask.

                    Evans
                




                            By R. S. Thomas





Evans? Yes, many a timeI came down his bare flightOf stairs into the gaunt kitchenWith its wood fire, where crickets sangAccompaniment to the black kettle’sWhine, and so into the coldDark to smother in the thick tideOf night that drifted about the wallsOf his stark farm on the hill ridge.It was not the dark filling my eyesAnd mouth apalled me; not even the dripOf rain like blood from the one treeWeather-tortured. It was the darkSilting the veins of that sick manI left stranded upon the vastAnd lonely shore of his bleak bed.
