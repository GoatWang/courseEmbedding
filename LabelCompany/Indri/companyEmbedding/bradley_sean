A final thought from the PGA Merchandise Show





The PGA Merchandise Show is the one time each year where everyone in the golf industry gathers in Orlando to show off all of the new clubs, gadgets and gear for the upcoming season. We're on the ground all week doing the legwork for you – here's a round-up of some items that have caught our eye so far. Keep checking this page, as we'll be updating it continually throughout the week.
Bradley Putter Company, bradleyputters.com









All Bradley Putters are hand-crafted from a tree burl. 
Sean Zak

Three months ago, Bradley Converse was Black Friday shopping at The Real Mother Goose craft shop in Portland, Oregon and became inspired to create a putter. Fast forward 61 days and he’s now here in his own booth at the PGA Show in Orlando, selling people on his product.
That product is (and will be known) as a Bradley Putter, a putter with a highly-furnished wooden head that comes hand-designed from Oregon burl wood. The wood comes from a longtime family friend who owns Oregon Burls.




Converse, who last worked as a military engineer, takes tiny blocks of the wood, glues in metal weight inserts for legitimate putter feel, and hand-constructs the face and sides, all from his garage in Grants Pass, Oregon. It’s something he doesn’t think could be accomplished by a standard milling machine, considering the delicate nature of deformed grain known to burls.
Endless species of wood in southern Oregon means endless types of burls and all kinds of options for Bradley Putter Co. Add in some dye and you’ve got even more customization via ROYGBIV (nine colors to be exact). “If I want a red, white and blue putter, [Oregon Burls] can dye it red, white and blue. All that crazy stuff.” Converse says.
The process ends with Converse himself buffing the putter head until he feels it is ready to be yanked from your bag and used on the green. This level of intimacy in production of a Bradley Putter will cost buyers anywhere from $500 on the basic end to $25,000. “There’s a spectrum,” Converse says. From order to completion, securing a Bradley putter takes less than one week. Pretty efficient for a two-month-old company.
In that time, Bradley worked via the scientific method to improve his product every day. Check out their Instagram feed for a timeline from the first iteration to the fourth to the seventh and even more. According to Converse, each was made to improve on singular aspects where past versions failed, like weighting distribution, durability, etc.
After brainstorming the idea on Black Friday, Converse “had two putters by the following Wednesday. Took ‘em to the course. The first putter sucked…Not gonna lie, it was a bad putter.”


“Right now, my employee back home, he’s making putters and trying to break them right now, just so we know the whole spectrum,” Converse says. “I’ve already broken several by hitting them like 5-irons, just to know what is happening with it.”
Note how he used the singular form of employee. Bradley Putter Co is currently a four person enterprise. Their next big step is to conform to USGA standards.
“It’s not conforming yet, but it will be conforming,” Converse says, detailing exactly what he needs to do when he gets back to his garage. In that way, Bradley Putter Co. is not quite out of the woods yet, but it holds plenty of promise. “As of an hour ago,” he continued, “we are the official putter company of the Swing Thought Tour.”
As mainstream a move as that may seem, Converse promises Bradley Putter Co. will forever be intimate. He wants customers to visit Grants Pass and see their eventual shop (they are about to sign a lease). He believes word of mouth has been his biggest marketing asset and wants owners to share a story about their putter every time they play a round of golf.
“You’re never going to see these on Amazon. That’s not what it’s about,” Converse says. “You buy these for yourself. You buy these because you love golf, you appreciate craftsmanship, you appreciate ‘Made in America,’ you appreciate small town economies, you appreciate stories and experiences. That’s why you buy a Bradley Putter.”

Indianapolis Putter from Toulon Design, odysseygolf.com







The Indianapolis from Toulon Design is the company's first shot at a high-MOI mallet.
Mike Chwasky





The new Indianapolis ($399-$460) putter from Toulon Design is the company’s first attempt at a high-MOI mallet, and it’s pretty impressive. Inspired by the technology used in the automotive industry, the Indianapolis features a multi-material design that produces an astounding MOI that exceeds 5400, providing outstanding stability and forgiveness on off-center hits.
Of the total overall weight of 360g, the milled aluminum face makes up only about 25%, which helps move the CG away from the face and toward the rear of the clubhead, and also contributes to a soft but responsive feel at impact. The milled steel sole takes up about 50% of the total weight, ensuring the CG is extremely low, while a lightweight carbon composite crown section saves enough discretionary weight to allow for about 65g to be repositioned in the rear wings of the clubhead.

“We wanted it to punch way above it’s weight for high MOI but not make it so big like many other high MOI mallets. In order to do that we knew we had to have multi-material construction and look at it from a totally clean sheet of paper.” - Sean Toulon
The carbon composite crown not only saves weight to produce a lower, deeper CG and exceptionally high MOI but also dampens vibration for enhanced feel while also providing an array of both subtle and more obvious alignment features. In fact, the unique shape and contrasting aluminum face and carbon composite crown section provide up to ten different alignment aids, both parallel and perpendicular to the target line, for more accurate aim at address.
The Indianapolis will be available at retail on March 31.

Setup Eye, setupeye.com







Setup Eye makes sure you are never misaligned to the target.
Setupeye.com

Golfers of all abilities can struggle with alignment. Even tour pros occasionally lean on caddies to point them the right direction. Enter the SetupEye.
Les and Sandra Egan, a chipper couple from County Clare, Ireland, created the new gadget to help golfers line up at their target. The inspiration was simple:
“I invented it because I’m a lousy golfer,” Les said with a laugh.
Four years after sketching out the concept, the small devices are here at the PGA Show, and soon could find their way to your golf bag.
They work in a two-step process. First, peer through the scope to lock in your target. (The flag, a tree, etc.) Then, place the unit on the ground, at the center of your stance. Next comes what Sandra describes as the “secret sauce.” The device will rotate and shoot a narrow beam of light vertically through the ball to help line up your clubface. After a few seconds, it spins and fires another laser to align your stance.




The SetupEye checks in at a pricey $395, but it’s certainly innovative. It’s also cheaper than bringing a caddie to line up each shot you take this season. They are assembled and shipped from Ireland, and will available in about eight weeks.

Hudson Sutler Cooler Bags, hudsonsutler.com







The 18-can and 30-can cooler bags from Hudson Sutler.
Coleman McDowell

Hudson Sutler set out in 2012 with the goal to make a better duffel bag. Consider it done, and then some. Five years later the company is making its debut at the PGA Show with a booth chock full of duffels, backpacks, totes, dopp kitts and cooler bags in a wide variety of color combinations. They're all made in the United States and at least 10 pairs of hands touch each item before it lands on your front step. The most eye-catching item? The 18-pack and 30-pack cooler bags. It's got a waterproof liner that's used for life rafts, a hardy canvas exterior and a reinforced bottom. This thing is not leaking. It can be carried to the golf course, the beach, the lake – anywhere where 18 beers are wanted.




While setting up their booth on Tuesday, the crew at Hudson Sutler had one of the sample bags filled to the brim with drinks and ice. They accidentally left it there overnight with all the ice still in it, but when Wednesday morning came around, the ice hadn't melted and the drinks were still cold. 
The 30-pack is $130, and the 18-pack is $99.

GoGolf GPS, gogolfgps.com







GoGolf GPS can clip onto your sunglasses or hat.
Jeff Ritter

This PGA Show has some creative products for GPS. Yesterday I found a golf glove with a GPS bug attached to the flap. Today? It’s on your glasses.
The product is called GoGolf GPS, and it features a miniscule unit that weights less than one third of an ounce and clips snugly onto your specs – or, by substituting a larger clip, onto your cap or visor.
It does look a tad goofy.
“I had a guy yesterday tell me he thought I was taping videotaping him,” John Leighton, the company’s general sales manager, said with a laugh. “We had to explain it to him.”




GoGolf users download a free app, which has maps on more than 30,000 courses, and links up to the device via Bluetooth. Unlike every other GPS I’ve seen, which requires golfers to read yardage info from a phone or rangefinder, this one transmits information via audio. During the round, golfers simply press a small button on the GPS, and a voice will read you the yardage to the middle of the green. (Volume is adjustable.)
If you’re a player who likes to listen to tunes, you can also run Pandora while simultaneously using the GPS, at a volume that won’t distract your playing partners.

The rechargeable battery is good for nine rounds. Maybe the coolest thing of all is a price -- $69 – that is less than half the cost of a rangefinder and most other GPS-related gizmos. They expect to begin filling orders in March.

Bushnell Excel GPS Watch, bushnellgolf.com









The Bushnell Excel GPS watch comes pre-loaded with information about 35,000 courses worldwide.





Pre-loaded with 35,000 courses worldwide, this sleek GPS features built-in Bluetooth technology so that you can quickly download the most up-to-date and accurate information from the company’s Golf App on your smartphone. (Other Bushnell models have to be hooked up to a computer to update). You can also sync the Excel to receive alerts for incoming texts, e-mails and calls. Plus, the color display has auto-brightness adjustment for easy readability in all conditions, while yielding yardages to hazards and the front, middle and back of any green. Additional highlights include a shot-distance calculator, pedometer, and automatic course-recognition and hole-advancement functions. Available in white, black, and charcoal, you get fourteen hours of play in GPS mode. In stores this April; $250.

Highland Pants by Bonobos Golf, bonobos.com







The Highland pant now comes in four fits: tailored, slim, straight and athletic.
Coleman McDowell





The Highland pant is already one of the best golf pants you can buy – and now it’s designed for even more players. Bonobos previously offered tailored, slim and straight styles, and now it’s added an “athletic” cut for golfers who want the clean lines of a tapered leg but need extra room in the seat and thighs. 
Bonobos was started with the aim of creating high-quality pants that fit perfectly. The Bonobos Golf line (formerly under the Maide Golf umbrella) takes that mantra to the course. What makes these pants stand out from the competition? The details: a curved waistband that’s flattering and comfortable, no extra material where it’s not needed and a performance polyester blend that allows for enough stretch during a round while avoiding the shiny look that says "I just came from the golf course."
The pants come in 14 color choices and start at $108. In addition to the Highland, Bonobos also offers a Tour Highland, a Lightweight Highland, Heathland and Palmetto styles. Options for everyone.

Precision Pro NX7 Rangefinders, precisionprogolf.com







The Precision Pro NX7 can deliver yardages up to 400 yards away in seconds.
Coleman McDowell





Precision Pro has two new rangefinders, the NX7 and NX7 Pro, to help you save strokes, and time, while making your way around the links. The powerful, ergonomic designs are 25% smaller and 30% faster than the Nexus, delivering distances up to 400 yards in less than half of a second.  Both waterproof models are accurate by plus or minus one yard, have 6x magnification, a user-friendly target lock function, and no-slip grip for a comfortable and secure fit in hand. Aside from that, the NX7 Pro features slope technology to compensate for elevation changes and provides a short vibrating pulse when it locks onto the target. (The slope mode can be turned off to make it legal for tournament play).  
The NX7 ($200) and NX7 Pro ($250) will be available March 1. Plus, the company will be offering rebates valued at $30 for the NX7 and $50 for the NX7 Pro until June 30. The not-too-pricey packages will also include a two-year warranty and free CR2 battery replacements.

Bubba's Jetpack, oakleygolf.com







Now this can speed up a round! Bubba Watson's jetpack was on display on the show floor.
Sean Zak





It was just six months ago that Oakley partnered up with Bubba Watson to announce “Bubba’s Jet Pack,” a new and aptly named means of transportation on the golf course.
Finally, the public was able to feast its eyes on the product up close and personal Wednesday at the PGA Show in Orlando. Watson himself was on hand at the event to take pictures with the jet pack (named “BW-Air) as well as conduct interviews with the media and hit balls in a simulator. (Fans were able to compete for prizes all day on the simulator to get closer than Watson’s approach to 6 feet.)
The jet pack, which took three years of collaboration to create and is produced in New Zealand, is able to fly up to 3,000 feet in the air via a 210 horsepower engine powering two ducted fans. The rear side of the “flying golf cart” boasts likely the most significant part: a spot for the golf bag.
In sheer size, the jet pack is a behemoth, stretching more than seven feet tall, stretching just as wide and weighing about 400 pounds. All of that is to say that it currently is illegal to fly in the United States without a pilot’s license. There are only two that have been produced and there’s just one pilot in the world who can take the jet pack for a cruise. Sorry, Bubba; time for pilot’s school!

Zero Friction Distance Pro GPS Gloves, zerofriction.com







The Distance Pro GPS glove allows for yardages to be seen at a glance.
Jeff Ritter





This year, on-course GPS in available in the palm of your hand.
Or more specifically, on the back of it.
Meet the Distance Pro GPS glove by Zero Friction, the first navigation system that attaches directly to the back of your golf glove.  
Zero Friction has been around for more than a decade, and two years ago got into the glove business. I couldn’t take their new, high-tech glove to a course, but from what I saw in the convention center, using it seems like a breeze. Just power it up on your way to the first tee, and then open the corresponding (free) app on your phone. The GPS is compatible with both iPhone and Android, and the devices communicate via Bluetooth.
Yardages will display on full-color hole maps on your phone screen, while distance to the front and back of the green, and the flagstick, also appear on the flap of your glove. The GPS is outfitted for more than 35,000 courses, so odds are good your local muni is online.   
The GPS device weighs less than a half an ounce, and after wearing it for a few minutes, I forgot it was there. A pack of two gloves and the GPS hits shelves this week, starting at $139. Johnny Miller has signed on as a pitchman, but I didn’t see him at the show today.
Maybe I could’ve found him with GPS.

Virtual Green Putting Simulator, fullswinggolf.com
Golf simulators have become mainstream, and with good reason. But for all they offer in hooking you up to Pebble Beach from your Brooklyn basement, putting has always been the most difficult aspect to replicate. That’s where Virtual Green comes in.
Virtual Green is owned by the popular simulator company FullSwing and promises to “replicate any putt in golf.” That means – quite literally – any putt, even memorable ones from the past.




The platform simulator uses pinpoint technology located beneath the surface to raise and lower specific sections of the synthetic green to build a new, specific putting surface from scratch. Players can use the accompanying software to select how much break, and just how intense the break on their corresponding putt.
For instance, on Wednesday at the PGA Show, Jordan Spieth’s coach Cameron McCormick helped event attendees read and (try to) make the same putt Spieth hit on the 16th green in the final round of the 2015 U.S. Open at Chambers Bay. If you need a refresher on that putt, see below. As we found out Wednesday, it’s very difficult.

McCormick was able to adjust the intensity of the left-to-right breaking putt on 20% intervals, 100% being as close as possible to the original putt Spieth made 18 months ago.
Unlike mainstream simulators that measure only the physics of a putt and project it onto a simulator screen, Virtual Green actually allows you to watch the ball either lip out of the physical cup, or drop in for birdie. Thankfully, there’s plenty of room for celebratory fist pumps.

​IceBlock Putter, iceblockputter.com







The Ice Block putter stands by itself in order for the player to get the best alignment possible before putting.
Sean Zak





Often at the PGA Show – among the thousands of products that can make the event quite dizzying – products must stand out visually to grab your eye. One new product stands out on its own, literally. It is the IceBlock Putter.
The name makes sense, as the putter head is oblong and transparent, like a block of ice. In this scenario, however, your block of ice holds up a putter shaft on its own. It's eye catching.
The novel concept of a “stand alone” putter came to creator Daniel F. à Wengen (a Swiss surgeon who owns a slew of patents, 23 in all from hearing aids to nose implants) as he wanted to improve how players stroke their putts. His theory is that too many players strike with an open face at impact, so he placed multiple alignment marks atop the putter to help reel in attention to face angle.
The block holds the shaft upright, allowing the player to back away on the green and read their putt with the putter in clear view. From that, Wengen believes he has solved an address issue, relative to the specific read of the green.
“You put it on the putting green, you leave it there, you take a step back, you look through [the putter head],” Wengen says. “You adjust the face angle until it is perfectly right where you want the ball to go.”
Then, of course, you make the putt. One glaring fault is that the putter stands on its own mainly on flat green locations, but not where there is significant undulation. Good news, though! The putter has already been ruled to conform by the R&A.

All that remains is making the stroke, which requires little effort (the head is nearly 500 grams). The putter is available at IceBlockPutter.com, but will hit you with a driver-esque price of $249.99.

Golf Board, golfboard.com







The Golf Board brings some youthful energy to our classic game.
Jeff Ritter

Golf, we all know, has its share of problems. When explaining lackluster participation numbers, one term often cited is the dreaded F-word. Fun, of course.
Is golf too stuffy? At times, perhaps. Enter GolfBoard, a company now in its fourth year producing motorized, skateboard-style carts. I bumped into the GolfBoard display at Demo Day, and at first glance, operating one seemed tricky.
“Lots of people think it’s tough, but it’s a breeze!” said Jeff Dowell, Golf Board’s high-energy President.
Accepting the challenge, I hopped on. Driving the board really was simple. You stand in place, one foot in front of the other, like a skateboard. Your clubs ride in front. At the center of the handlebars lies the throttle. Just press it down to move forward. Release it, and the engine cuts out for a quick stop. Turning takes some self-trust: lean one direction or the other, and the board responds. It requires some effort to toss your body weight into the corners, but it’s also a blast. I never fell off, or even felt close to biting it.




Dowell said that when he started producing boards, which start at $6,500, he expected sporty millennials to drive his business. Surprisingly, many retirees have also gravitated to it.
“It’s all about lifestyle,” Dowell said. “If you’re athletic, you can do it.”
Dowell says boarders rip through 18 holes 30% faster than twosomes in a golf cart, because you don’t have to track two golf balls, and 15% faster than walkers. GolfBoard has currently outfitted more than 250 courses around the world, including tracks in the U.S., UK, Spain, Portugal, Indonesia and Australia. And not all courses are flat resorts. The boards can handle uneven terrain.
“They’re even more fun, and easier, on hills,” Dowell said. “They chew ‘em up and spit ‘em out.”
Sounds like fun, doesn’t it?

EPON AF-105 Driver, epongolf.com







The new EPON AF-105 is the first with a multi-material clubface.
Mike Chwasky





The EPON AF-105 driver ($1,000) features a traditional pear shaped, super deep face aimed at better players with faster clubhead speeds. The first Epon driver with a multi material clubface (both KS-120 and Ti-9 titanium), the AF-105 produces extra forgiveness on off-center hits without sacrificing ballspeed or distance. In addition, an extremely thin and light beta titanium crown creates a CG location that’s approximately 7% lower than that of the previous AF-103 for higher launch angles and more carry distance.
“Endo’s EPON products are the epitome of what a forging manufacturer is capable of producing without any limitations,” says Jeff Sheets, Technical Director for EPON Golf USA. “The EPON products are the cream of the crop.”
For those not, “in the know,” EPON products are manufactured by ENDO Manufacturing Co Ltd., one of the most respecting forging facilities in the world. ENDO continues to make products for many of the industry’s biggest OEM brands but has also been making it’s own products under the EPON name since it’s inception as a subsidiary in 1977.

The Putting Stroke Teacher, tpsteacher.com









The Putting Stroke teacher helps you keep your arms working as a single unit in the putting stroke.
Sean Steinemann





For my money, the Putting Stroke Teacher is by far one of the easiest, most effective putting aids out there.
The idea is simple, grip your putter like you normally do and then position the yellow rod across your forearms. This will create that perfect “V” with your arms and shoulders. From there all you have to do is make a stroke. The Putting Stroke Teacher takes your hands completely out of the stroke and allows you to feel what a perfect stroke is supposed to be like.
The best part? It takes only five minutes to set up and folds down to a manageable size that conveniently fits in any golf bag. So whether it’s before your round, a putting practice session or even if you just have 10 free minutes at home, you can turn your very own putter into an aid will help you groove a solid, repeatable putting stroke. Something every golfer can benefit from.

Cure Putter RX Series, cureputters.com







The Cure putter line features adjustable weights for a fully customized putter.
Sean Zak





Walk around the PGA Show, or even just peruse a golf retail store, and you’ll find all kinds of adjustability in drivers. Everyone wants their driver to be THEIR driver. But what about putters?
Adjustability in putters isn’t exactly innovative, but poll your local country club and you’ll likely find a large majority of non-adjustable putters. These things, as we know, feel great one day and not so great the next.

Enter: the Cure Putters RX series.
This unique brand of putters has been around for years, allowing folks to determine how heavy (and therefore how comfortable) their putter head will be.
Extra weighting, which is added to the rear of the heel and toe of the club, can adjust the weight of the three putters by upwards of 65%. Of course, if you want something in the middle, that’s also offered by Cure. The brand sells an extended weight kit for $40 that can even include colored weighting for the artsy players out there.
The adjustability is not relegated to weight alone. The putter shaft connects with the putter head on a rotating block that can change the angle at which it connects. Sound confusing? That just means your putter can feel much more upright or drop the grip toward a flatter angle.
The price of these putters ($290) is serious business, but when the adjustability offers more than a single setting, to some it may be well worth it.

Swing Shirt, golfswingshirt.com









The Swing Shirt is designed to keep your swing in sync.
Sean Steinemann





Chances are, if you watch the Golf Channel, you have seen the Swing Shirt commercial. But it’s the story behind the training aid that is the best part.
Ray Rapcavage — a true golf addict in every sense of the word — was hitting balls in in the front yard of his New Jersey home in mid-January when he was hit with a mini case of the shanks. Determined to beat the dreaded “s-word,” Ray took an old sweater, turned it so the arm hole was positioned at his chest and then put both his arms through the one arm hole and began hitting balls. The improvement was so astonishing, that Ray made his wife come out in the brutal winter cold to watch him hit balls. Four years later, Ray has sold tens of thousands of the American-made Swing Shirts and PGA Tour player Padraig Harrington frequently practices with the shirt. Long story short, if you’re looking for a more connected, powerful golf swing — the Swing Shirt is for you.
(And, yes, it actually works, tried it myself.)

Honma TW737 460, honmagolf.com
The largest and most forgiving in the new Honma TW737 line (that also includes 445, 450, and 455 models), the TW737 460 ($500) features a thin, rolled Ti5N titanium face for increased ballspeeds and distance as well as a long, shallow back shape to encourage higher launch angles. Weight that’s saved through the use of a lightweight crown is redistributed to an 8-gram sole weight that’s located in a low, forward portion of the clubhead. The result is a CG that’s also low and forward, encouraging very low spin rates that would normally be associated with smaller volume clubheads. Some of the saved weight is also positioned in the low heel area of the clubhead, making the large clubhead easier to square at impact.
“This is a unique product,” says Adam Sheldon, GM of Honma USA. “Any average to better player who wants one of the lowest spinning 460cc drivers would do well to get fitted for the TW737 460.”
The TW737 460 driver is available at select retailers now.

HAPPY CUSTOMERS

 

"My beautiful October day included most, if not all, types of weather you could imagine [...] but I had a team behind my husband and I with six (count them SIX) alternative locations to take our pictures before the wedding. This team stuck it out with my husband and I with their rain jackets on and tarps covering their expensive equipment. They were beyond ready to do whatever we asked of them and it showed every moment.  It felt like we were with a bunch of our friends all day."Christina & Brett"Brad and his team at Bradley Productions are masters of their craft.  Work with them, live in the moment on your day with no worry about your pictures and video, and enjoy your pictures and video before memories of your event even have time to fade (seriously, that was an amazingly rapid turn-around time).  Is there a grade above 100 on a 100-point scale?  If so, Bradley Productions earned it."Jamie & Chris"You guys have captured our day with grace and beauty. We are forever grateful."Brad & Gwyn"I got married four months ago and watch my video probably every week....and I cry every time. 
I cant wait until I am 90 years old showing this video to my kids, grandkids...maybe great grandkids!"Emily & Zach"Seeing how they capture the commotion and excitement drew me to [Bradley Productions]. The group working at this company understand what is important and what to capture. If you want an amazing video done by enthusiastic cameramen, look no further! you found them!"Jessica & Jonathan"Bradley Productions was one of our biggest recommendations for others getting married now."Kevin & Nikki"Bradley Productions is the best of the best! They were amazing start to finish. Great communication every step of the way. They were very professional the day of the wedding, and hands-down the best vendor we worked with. We could not be happier with the way our video came out. There was so much thought and attention to detail that went into every second. Their work is incredible, and our video is something we will treasure forever. This company is truly in a league of their own."Ryan & Colleen"If I could give Bradley Productions a 10 out of 5, I would do it. They went above and beyond what we dreamed of for documenting our day. Our pictures are jaw dropping, and they fought through the rain to make them so beautiful. Our video is something from Hollywood, and unbelievable. Their work speaks for itself, but I want to stand on a mountain and cheer how much I loved working with them. Of all of our vendors and decisions, this was by far the best choice we made for our wedding. Other than the groom, of course.
Bonus, they also help keep things on time. They helped move us around throughout the day to stick to a schedule we made before the wedding. This was really helpful, especially when family tries to hug you right after and you need to get moving."Amy & Jon"We can't say enough great things about Bradley Productions!! Hiring them was one of the best wedding decisions we made. Dara, Jeremy and Brad felt like old friends by the end of the day – they were excited for our wedding and blended in seamlessly. Best of all, they crafted a beautiful film capturing the laughter, tears, and quiet moments in between that we will treasure forever."Caroline & Matt"We couldn't be happier with Bradley Productions! From our first interaction, we were struck by the professionalism and passion that this team has for their work. They made us feel at ease and their enthusiasm was contagious. Our wedding video is so beautifully shot and edited, it perfectly captures the joy and excitement of that day. We will certainly treasure it for years to come!"Susanna & PeterHAPPY CUSTOMERS""My beautiful October day included most, if not all, types of weather you could imagine... but I had a team behind my husband and I with six (count them SIX) alternative locations to take our pictures before the wedding. This team stuck it out with my husband and I with their rain jackets on and tarps covering their expensive equipment. They were beyond ready to do whatever we asked of them and it showed every moment.  It felt like we were with a bunch of our friends all day."

-Christina & BrettHAPPY CUSTOMERS""I got married four months ago and watch my video probably every week....and I cry every time. I can't wait until I am 90 years old showing this video to my kids, grandkids...maybe great grandkids!"

-Emily & ZachHAPPY CUSTOMERS""These guys were unreal. They were worth every penny and I would 100% hire them again. Everyone involved fit right in, knew exactly what we wanted and they were hands down my favorite vendor." 

-Ryan & ColleenHAPPY CUSTOMERS""If I could give Bradley Productions a 10 out of 5, I would do it. They went above and beyond what we dreamed of for documenting our day...Their work speaks for itself, but I want to stand on a mountain and cheer how much I loved working with them. Of all of our vendors and decisions, this was by far the best choice we made for our wedding." 

-Amy & Jon

HAPPY CUSTOMERS""Taking photos with Bradley Productions felt unusually natural. Neither of us is particularly comfortable in front of a camera, but the BP team helped us to completely forget we were being filmed... We truly could not be happier with our finished product." 

-Jamie & ChrisHAPPY CUSTOMERS""Bradley Productions literally captured every single moment, every laugh, cry, tear, happiness - there is nothing more perfect than our wedding video. We can't watch it without being so overly emotional and grateful that we found people who TRULY care about not only their product, but US as PEOPLE. Working with them was truly an honor and we feel like we created friendships with each of them."

-Sara & DavidHAPPY CUSTOMERS""We couldn't be happier with Bradley Productions! From our first interaction, we were struck by their professionalism and the passion that this team has for their work. They made us feel at ease and their enthusiasm was contagious."

-Susanna & PeterHAPPY CUSTOMERS""We can't say enough great things about Bradley Productions!! Hiring them was one of the best wedding decisions we made. [The team] felt like old friends by the end of the day – they were excited for our wedding and blended in seamlessly. Best of all, they crafted a beautiful film capturing the laughter, tears, and quiet moments in between that we will treasure forever."

High school career[edit]
Bradley played for Emery High School (Castle Dale, Utah) from 1987 to 1990. He was one of the most successful basketball players in Utah high school history, finishing with career averages of 20.3 points, 11.5 rebounds, and 5.4 blocked shots per game.[3] During his time at the school, Emery racked up a 68-4 record and won two state championships. Bradley was named All-State three times and twice earned the season MVP award. In his senior year, he averaged 25 points, 17 rebounds, and 9 blocks per contest. He was named All-American by several national publications, including Parade Magazine, Street and Smith, USA Today, and others. He turned in a strong performance at the McDonald's All-American Game (12 points, 10 rebounds, and 6 blocks), earning the Most Valuable Player award for the West team. As of 2015, Bradley still holds Utah state records for blocked shots in a single game (17), season (208), and career (506).[4]
College career[edit]
Bradley was heavily recruited by many colleges from across the country, but ultimately decided to play at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. During his freshman season (1990–91), he started all 34 games for BYU, averaging 14.8 points and 7.7 rebounds per game. But his main contribution to the team was shot-blocking: he led the entire nation in total blocks (177) and average (5.2 per game)—setting an NCAA freshman record in both categories.[5] In one game against Eastern Kentucky (EKU), Bradley blocked 14 shots, tying the NCAA single-game record set by Navy's David Robinson in 1986. In that same game, Bradley also established a new career high by scoring 29 points.[6]
BYU received a bid to the NCAA tournament that season, and Bradley continued his dominating defense. In a first round game against Virginia, he set a tournament single-game record with 10 blocked shots, leading the Cougars to a 61-48 victory.[7] However, he struggled with foul trouble in the second round, and BYU lost to Arizona, 76-61.[citation needed]
Bradley collected several awards and honors for his outstanding freshman season. He was named the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) Freshman of the Year, in addition to All-WAC defensive team and newcomer team honors. He was also named Honorable Mention All-American by the Associated Press (AP). After the end of the season, he left school to serve as a Mormon missionary. After finishing a two-year mission to Australia, he decided not to return to college basketball. Instead, he entered the 1993 NBA draft.[citation needed]
Professional career[edit]
Philadelphia 76ers[edit]
Bradley entered the professional ranks as one of the most intriguing and highly debated prospects in the history of the NBA draft. Supporters claimed his tremendous size and surprising athleticism would allow him to dominate the league. Critics argued that he would struggle in the NBA due to his thin build (listed at just 235 pounds) and lack of experience (just one season of college basketball, followed by a two-year hiatus from the sport due to his church mission). Ultimately, he was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers with the second overall pick, behind Chris Webber and ahead of Penny Hardaway. Given the novelty of a 7-foot-6 center playing for the 76ers, Bradley was issued jersey number 76.
Philadelphia's management saw Bradley as a major project with huge long-term potential. The team acquired legendary big man Moses Malone to serve as a mentor for Bradley, hoping to develop his skills in the low post.[8] Also, the franchise hired strength and conditioning consultant Pat Croce and registered dietitian Jeanie Subach to add bulk to Bradley's skinny frame.[9] His rookie season (1993–94) produced mixed results. In his first game, Bradley totaled just 6 points and 5 rebounds but he did manage to block 8 shots in 25 minutes.[10]
It was a sign of things to come. For much of his career, Bradley was inconsistent in scoring and rebounding, but he always excelled at blocking shots. He averaged 10.3 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 3.0 blocks per game in his first season – good enough to earn NBA All-Rookie Second Team honors. But he shot a dismal 40.9 percent from the floor and constantly struggled with turnovers and foul trouble. He suffered a season-ending injury in February of that year, dislocating his kneecap in a collision with Portland's Harvey Grant.[11]
Bradley returned to full strength in his second season, playing in all 82 games for the 76ers. His scoring actually declined a bit (9.5 points per game), but his rebounding and shot-blocking increased. He racked up 274 rejections, setting a franchise record for most blocks in a single season. Bradley gave Philly fans a glimpse of his potential in a contest against the Los Angeles Clippers in November, posting career highs of 28 points and 22 rebounds in a 97-83 victory. He also tied a career high with 9 blocked shots, and was credited with 9 additional "intimidations" as the Clippers were held to their lowest-ever point total against the 76ers.[12] He finished the season in strong fashion, posting 13 double-doubles in his last 17 games.
New Jersey Nets[edit]
However, despite these highlights, Bradley continued to baffle and frustrate Philadelphia with his inconsistent play. Just 12 games into his third season (1995–96), the 76ers ended the "Shawn Bradley experiment", trading him to the New Jersey Nets for Derrick Coleman. He played the final 67 games of the year with the Nets, and tantalized Nets fans with some strong play in the second half of the season. In February, he dominated a match-up against fellow giant Gheorghe Mureșan, leading the Nets to a 99-81 victory against the Washington Bullets. Bradley scored a season-high 27 points over the 7-foot-7 Mureşan, and also added 9 rebounds and 4 blocked shots.[13]
Bradley lifted his game to new levels in March 1996. He posted a career-high 32 points and added 15 rebounds against Dallas early in the month,[14] and set another career high a week later with 10 blocked shots against the Phoenix Suns. He recorded his first career triple-double in the very next game, tallying 19 points, 17 rebounds, and a career-best 11 blocked shots in another match-up against Mureşan and the Bullets. In April, Bradley posted back-to-back triple-doubles (against Boston and Toronto); in the process, he became the first player in NBA history to record consecutive games of double-figure blocked shots twice in a single season.[15] His season averages for 1995–96 were 11.9 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 3.7 blocks per game[16] – all career highs.
The Nets began the 1996–97 season under new management: John Calipari was named head coach in the off-season, and John Nash replaced Willis Reed as general manager. Reed had been a big believer in Bradley, but Calipari and Nash weren't nearly as excited about the 7-foot-6 enigma. In an effort to save some cash against the salary cap, the Nets traded their big center (and his big contract) to the Dallas Mavericks in a blockbuster mid-season deal that involved nine players.[17]
Dallas Mavericks[edit]
Bradley embraced yet another "fresh start" with a new franchise. With increased playing time in Dallas, Bradley posted some of the best numbers of his career. In a game against the Clippers, he tied his career high by scoring 32 points – the most ever by a center in the history of the Mavericks franchise. He also added a season-high 16 rebounds in that same contest. He finished the year with averages of 13.2 points and 8.4 rebounds per game – breaking career highs set during the previous season. But most importantly, Bradley provided strong defense in the paint that Dallas had been lacking before his arrival. In fact, Bradley finished the year as the top shot-blocker in the entire league, averaging 3.4 swats per contest. It was the first time any Mavericks player had ever led the NBA in any statistical category.
And yet, Bradley continued to be plagued by maddening inconsistency that defined his entire professional career. During the 1997–98 season, Dallas coach Jim Cleamons experimented by bringing Bradley off the bench in several games (instead of his usual role as starter). In one particular game, it paid off in a major way: Bradley totaled 22 points, 22 rebounds, and a career-high 13 blocked shots in an April contest against the Trail Blazers. Bradley became the fifth NBA player to record at least 20 points, 20 rebounds, and 10 blocks in a single game, and the first to do so off the bench.[5] The previous players to record a 20-20-10 game with points, rebounds, and blocks were Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Elvin Hayes, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Shaquille O'Neal. Bradley finished the year with a team-record 214 blocked shots; his average of 3.3 per game ranked third in the NBA.
Bradley played 7 more seasons in the league, remaining with the Mavericks until his retirement in 2005. Over that span, his playing time slowly declined, mainly due to some injuries and constant juggling of the team's lineups and rotations by coach Don Nelson. In particular, Bradley's offensive role became very limited, but he remained an imposing defensive presence. In fact, in the 2000–01 season, he broke his own team record by blocking 228 shots for Dallas – the highest total in the NBA that year. The Mavericks emerged as a perennial playoff contender, mostly due to the rise of star players such as Dirk Nowitzki and Steve Nash, but Bradley's defense made a significant contribution. He finished his career with averages of 8.1 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks in 23.5 minutes of action per game.
International career[edit]
Bradley has competed internationally for Germany; he and Dallas teammate Dirk Nowitzki were members of the German national basketball team that finished in fourth place at the EuroBasket 2001 in Turkey. In order to participate in this tournament, Bradley made use of his German birth to obtain German citizenship.[18]
Post-basketball career[edit]
After his retirement as a player, Bradley became involved with West Ridge Academy, a coeducational private school for at-risk youths in West Jordan, Utah. Bradley's role with the school involves some of the functions of a vice principal, counselor, and coach. Describing Bradley, school executive director Ken Allen said, "Shawn has a great presence—due to his size—and has immediate credibility with the kids. His instant credibility when he's talking to kids makes him an incredible mentor. He is a great example of someone who has worked hard and been very successful. Being so tall wasn't always easy for him. He knows about being the 'odd kid' and dealing with that."[19]
On March 19, 2010, Bradley filed papers to run as a Republican against incumbent Democratic Rep. Tim Cosgrove for the 44th District seat in the Utah House of Representatives.[20][21] On November 2, 2010, Bradley lost the election to Cosgrove, earning 46.49% of the vote against Cosgrove's 51.13%.[22]
Personal life[edit]
As of 2006, Bradley and his wife Annette have six children: daughters Cheyenne, Chiera, Chelsea, and Charity and sons Chance and Chase. He lives in St. George, Utah,[23] and enjoys baseball, water skiing, horseback riding, and listening to country music.[15][24]
Bradley is a devout Mormon. When he was 19, he served for two years as a Missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Canberra, Australia.[25]
Bradley has participated in many charitable endeavors. In the 2000–01 season he donated $25 for each blocked shot to Bryan's House, a managed facility for children affected by HIV and AIDS. He is a national spokesman for the Children's Miracle Network.[15][24] Bradley has also participated in the "Basketball Without Borders" program with other NBA players like Dikembe Mutombo, DeSagana Diop and Malik Rose and found his experiences with children in Africa uplifting.[26] He and his family have also participated in treating leprosy colonies in India through the Rising Star Outreach.[27]
TV and movie appearances[edit]
Bradley had a role in the film Space Jam in 1996,[28] depicted as one of the NBA stars who lose their talent alongside Muggsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, Charles Barkley, and Patrick Ewing. Bradley was the last of all of the players in Space Jam to retire.[29] He also appeared as himself in an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger,[28] and had a cameo appearance as an auto mechanic in The Singles Ward movie.[28] In 2011, he appeared in a music video tribute to Jimmer Fredette, along with former BYU football star Chad Lewis and legendary coach LaVell Edwards.[30] He has also appeared in an episode of Studio C.[31]

High school career[edit]
Bradley played for Emery High School (Castle Dale, Utah) from 1987 to 1990. He was one of the most successful basketball players in Utah high school history, finishing with career averages of 20.3 points, 11.5 rebounds, and 5.4 blocked shots per game.[3] During his time at the school, Emery racked up a 68-4 record and won two state championships. Bradley was named All-State three times and twice earned the season MVP award. In his senior year, he averaged 25 points, 17 rebounds, and 9 blocks per contest. He was named All-American by several national publications, including Parade Magazine, Street and Smith, USA Today, and others. He turned in a strong performance at the McDonald's All-American Game (12 points, 10 rebounds, and 6 blocks), earning the Most Valuable Player award for the West team. As of 2015, Bradley still holds Utah state records for blocked shots in a single game (17), season (208), and career (506).[4]
College career[edit]
Bradley was heavily recruited by many colleges from across the country, but ultimately decided to play at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. During his freshman season (1990–91), he started all 34 games for BYU, averaging 14.8 points and 7.7 rebounds per game. But his main contribution to the team was shot-blocking: he led the entire nation in total blocks (177) and average (5.2 per game)—setting an NCAA freshman record in both categories.[5] In one game against Eastern Kentucky (EKU), Bradley blocked 14 shots, tying the NCAA single-game record set by Navy's David Robinson in 1986. In that same game, Bradley also established a new career high by scoring 29 points.[6]
BYU received a bid to the NCAA tournament that season, and Bradley continued his dominating defense. In a first round game against Virginia, he set a tournament single-game record with 10 blocked shots, leading the Cougars to a 61-48 victory.[7] However, he struggled with foul trouble in the second round, and BYU lost to Arizona, 76-61.[citation needed]
Bradley collected several awards and honors for his outstanding freshman season. He was named the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) Freshman of the Year, in addition to All-WAC defensive team and newcomer team honors. He was also named Honorable Mention All-American by the Associated Press (AP). After the end of the season, he left school to serve as a Mormon missionary. After finishing a two-year mission to Australia, he decided not to return to college basketball. Instead, he entered the 1993 NBA draft.[citation needed]
Professional career[edit]
Philadelphia 76ers[edit]
Bradley entered the professional ranks as one of the most intriguing and highly debated prospects in the history of the NBA draft. Supporters claimed his tremendous size and surprising athleticism would allow him to dominate the league. Critics argued that he would struggle in the NBA due to his thin build (listed at just 235 pounds) and lack of experience (just one season of college basketball, followed by a two-year hiatus from the sport due to his church mission). Ultimately, he was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers with the second overall pick, behind Chris Webber and ahead of Penny Hardaway. Given the novelty of a 7-foot-6 center playing for the 76ers, Bradley was issued jersey number 76.
Philadelphia's management saw Bradley as a major project with huge long-term potential. The team acquired legendary big man Moses Malone to serve as a mentor for Bradley, hoping to develop his skills in the low post.[8] Also, the franchise hired strength and conditioning consultant Pat Croce and registered dietitian Jeanie Subach to add bulk to Bradley's skinny frame.[9] His rookie season (1993–94) produced mixed results. In his first game, Bradley totaled just 6 points and 5 rebounds but he did manage to block 8 shots in 25 minutes.[10]
It was a sign of things to come. For much of his career, Bradley was inconsistent in scoring and rebounding, but he always excelled at blocking shots. He averaged 10.3 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 3.0 blocks per game in his first season – good enough to earn NBA All-Rookie Second Team honors. But he shot a dismal 40.9 percent from the floor and constantly struggled with turnovers and foul trouble. He suffered a season-ending injury in February of that year, dislocating his kneecap in a collision with Portland's Harvey Grant.[11]
Bradley returned to full strength in his second season, playing in all 82 games for the 76ers. His scoring actually declined a bit (9.5 points per game), but his rebounding and shot-blocking increased. He racked up 274 rejections, setting a franchise record for most blocks in a single season. Bradley gave Philly fans a glimpse of his potential in a contest against the Los Angeles Clippers in November, posting career highs of 28 points and 22 rebounds in a 97-83 victory. He also tied a career high with 9 blocked shots, and was credited with 9 additional "intimidations" as the Clippers were held to their lowest-ever point total against the 76ers.[12] He finished the season in strong fashion, posting 13 double-doubles in his last 17 games.
New Jersey Nets[edit]
However, despite these highlights, Bradley continued to baffle and frustrate Philadelphia with his inconsistent play. Just 12 games into his third season (1995–96), the 76ers ended the "Shawn Bradley experiment", trading him to the New Jersey Nets for Derrick Coleman. He played the final 67 games of the year with the Nets, and tantalized Nets fans with some strong play in the second half of the season. In February, he dominated a match-up against fellow giant Gheorghe Mureșan, leading the Nets to a 99-81 victory against the Washington Bullets. Bradley scored a season-high 27 points over the 7-foot-7 Mureşan, and also added 9 rebounds and 4 blocked shots.[13]
Bradley lifted his game to new levels in March 1996. He posted a career-high 32 points and added 15 rebounds against Dallas early in the month,[14] and set another career high a week later with 10 blocked shots against the Phoenix Suns. He recorded his first career triple-double in the very next game, tallying 19 points, 17 rebounds, and a career-best 11 blocked shots in another match-up against Mureşan and the Bullets. In April, Bradley posted back-to-back triple-doubles (against Boston and Toronto); in the process, he became the first player in NBA history to record consecutive games of double-figure blocked shots twice in a single season.[15] His season averages for 1995–96 were 11.9 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 3.7 blocks per game[16] – all career highs.
The Nets began the 1996–97 season under new management: John Calipari was named head coach in the off-season, and John Nash replaced Willis Reed as general manager. Reed had been a big believer in Bradley, but Calipari and Nash weren't nearly as excited about the 7-foot-6 enigma. In an effort to save some cash against the salary cap, the Nets traded their big center (and his big contract) to the Dallas Mavericks in a blockbuster mid-season deal that involved nine players.[17]
Dallas Mavericks[edit]
Bradley embraced yet another "fresh start" with a new franchise. With increased playing time in Dallas, Bradley posted some of the best numbers of his career. In a game against the Clippers, he tied his career high by scoring 32 points – the most ever by a center in the history of the Mavericks franchise. He also added a season-high 16 rebounds in that same contest. He finished the year with averages of 13.2 points and 8.4 rebounds per game – breaking career highs set during the previous season. But most importantly, Bradley provided strong defense in the paint that Dallas had been lacking before his arrival. In fact, Bradley finished the year as the top shot-blocker in the entire league, averaging 3.4 swats per contest. It was the first time any Mavericks player had ever led the NBA in any statistical category.
And yet, Bradley continued to be plagued by maddening inconsistency that defined his entire professional career. During the 1997–98 season, Dallas coach Jim Cleamons experimented by bringing Bradley off the bench in several games (instead of his usual role as starter). In one particular game, it paid off in a major way: Bradley totaled 22 points, 22 rebounds, and a career-high 13 blocked shots in an April contest against the Trail Blazers. Bradley became the fifth NBA player to record at least 20 points, 20 rebounds, and 10 blocks in a single game, and the first to do so off the bench.[5] The previous players to record a 20-20-10 game with points, rebounds, and blocks were Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Elvin Hayes, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Shaquille O'Neal. Bradley finished the year with a team-record 214 blocked shots; his average of 3.3 per game ranked third in the NBA.
Bradley played 7 more seasons in the league, remaining with the Mavericks until his retirement in 2005. Over that span, his playing time slowly declined, mainly due to some injuries and constant juggling of the team's lineups and rotations by coach Don Nelson. In particular, Bradley's offensive role became very limited, but he remained an imposing defensive presence. In fact, in the 2000–01 season, he broke his own team record by blocking 228 shots for Dallas – the highest total in the NBA that year. The Mavericks emerged as a perennial playoff contender, mostly due to the rise of star players such as Dirk Nowitzki and Steve Nash, but Bradley's defense made a significant contribution. He finished his career with averages of 8.1 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks in 23.5 minutes of action per game.
International career[edit]
Bradley has competed internationally for Germany; he and Dallas teammate Dirk Nowitzki were members of the German national basketball team that finished in fourth place at the EuroBasket 2001 in Turkey. In order to participate in this tournament, Bradley made use of his German birth to obtain German citizenship.[18]
Post-basketball career[edit]
After his retirement as a player, Bradley became involved with West Ridge Academy, a coeducational private school for at-risk youths in West Jordan, Utah. Bradley's role with the school involves some of the functions of a vice principal, counselor, and coach. Describing Bradley, school executive director Ken Allen said, "Shawn has a great presence—due to his size—and has immediate credibility with the kids. His instant credibility when he's talking to kids makes him an incredible mentor. He is a great example of someone who has worked hard and been very successful. Being so tall wasn't always easy for him. He knows about being the 'odd kid' and dealing with that."[19]
On March 19, 2010, Bradley filed papers to run as a Republican against incumbent Democratic Rep. Tim Cosgrove for the 44th District seat in the Utah House of Representatives.[20][21] On November 2, 2010, Bradley lost the election to Cosgrove, earning 46.49% of the vote against Cosgrove's 51.13%.[22]
Personal life[edit]
As of 2006, Bradley and his wife Annette have six children: daughters Cheyenne, Chiera, Chelsea, and Charity and sons Chance and Chase. He lives in St. George, Utah,[23] and enjoys baseball, water skiing, horseback riding, and listening to country music.[15][24]
Bradley is a devout Mormon. When he was 19, he served for two years as a Missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Canberra, Australia.[25]
Bradley has participated in many charitable endeavors. In the 2000–01 season he donated $25 for each blocked shot to Bryan's House, a managed facility for children affected by HIV and AIDS. He is a national spokesman for the Children's Miracle Network.[15][24] Bradley has also participated in the "Basketball Without Borders" program with other NBA players like Dikembe Mutombo, DeSagana Diop and Malik Rose and found his experiences with children in Africa uplifting.[26] He and his family have also participated in treating leprosy colonies in India through the Rising Star Outreach.[27]
TV and movie appearances[edit]
Bradley had a role in the film Space Jam in 1996,[28] depicted as one of the NBA stars who lose their talent alongside Muggsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, Charles Barkley, and Patrick Ewing. Bradley was the last of all of the players in Space Jam to retire.[29] He also appeared as himself in an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger,[28] and had a cameo appearance as an auto mechanic in The Singles Ward movie.[28] In 2011, he appeared in a music video tribute to Jimmer Fredette, along with former BYU football star Chad Lewis and legendary coach LaVell Edwards.[30] He has also appeared in an episode of Studio C.[31]

High school career[edit]
Bradley played for Emery High School (Castle Dale, Utah) from 1987 to 1990. He was one of the most successful basketball players in Utah high school history, finishing with career averages of 20.3 points, 11.5 rebounds, and 5.4 blocked shots per game.[3] During his time at the school, Emery racked up a 68-4 record and won two state championships. Bradley was named All-State three times and twice earned the season MVP award. In his senior year, he averaged 25 points, 17 rebounds, and 9 blocks per contest. He was named All-American by several national publications, including Parade Magazine, Street and Smith, USA Today, and others. He turned in a strong performance at the McDonald's All-American Game (12 points, 10 rebounds, and 6 blocks), earning the Most Valuable Player award for the West team. As of 2015, Bradley still holds Utah state records for blocked shots in a single game (17), season (208), and career (506).[4]
College career[edit]
Bradley was heavily recruited by many colleges from across the country, but ultimately decided to play at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. During his freshman season (1990–91), he started all 34 games for BYU, averaging 14.8 points and 7.7 rebounds per game. But his main contribution to the team was shot-blocking: he led the entire nation in total blocks (177) and average (5.2 per game)—setting an NCAA freshman record in both categories.[5] In one game against Eastern Kentucky (EKU), Bradley blocked 14 shots, tying the NCAA single-game record set by Navy's David Robinson in 1986. In that same game, Bradley also established a new career high by scoring 29 points.[6]
BYU received a bid to the NCAA tournament that season, and Bradley continued his dominating defense. In a first round game against Virginia, he set a tournament single-game record with 10 blocked shots, leading the Cougars to a 61-48 victory.[7] However, he struggled with foul trouble in the second round, and BYU lost to Arizona, 76-61.[citation needed]
Bradley collected several awards and honors for his outstanding freshman season. He was named the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) Freshman of the Year, in addition to All-WAC defensive team and newcomer team honors. He was also named Honorable Mention All-American by the Associated Press (AP). After the end of the season, he left school to serve as a Mormon missionary. After finishing a two-year mission to Australia, he decided not to return to college basketball. Instead, he entered the 1993 NBA draft.[citation needed]
Professional career[edit]
Philadelphia 76ers[edit]
Bradley entered the professional ranks as one of the most intriguing and highly debated prospects in the history of the NBA draft. Supporters claimed his tremendous size and surprising athleticism would allow him to dominate the league. Critics argued that he would struggle in the NBA due to his thin build (listed at just 235 pounds) and lack of experience (just one season of college basketball, followed by a two-year hiatus from the sport due to his church mission). Ultimately, he was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers with the second overall pick, behind Chris Webber and ahead of Penny Hardaway. Given the novelty of a 7-foot-6 center playing for the 76ers, Bradley was issued jersey number 76.
Philadelphia's management saw Bradley as a major project with huge long-term potential. The team acquired legendary big man Moses Malone to serve as a mentor for Bradley, hoping to develop his skills in the low post.[8] Also, the franchise hired strength and conditioning consultant Pat Croce and registered dietitian Jeanie Subach to add bulk to Bradley's skinny frame.[9] His rookie season (1993–94) produced mixed results. In his first game, Bradley totaled just 6 points and 5 rebounds but he did manage to block 8 shots in 25 minutes.[10]
It was a sign of things to come. For much of his career, Bradley was inconsistent in scoring and rebounding, but he always excelled at blocking shots. He averaged 10.3 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 3.0 blocks per game in his first season – good enough to earn NBA All-Rookie Second Team honors. But he shot a dismal 40.9 percent from the floor and constantly struggled with turnovers and foul trouble. He suffered a season-ending injury in February of that year, dislocating his kneecap in a collision with Portland's Harvey Grant.[11]
Bradley returned to full strength in his second season, playing in all 82 games for the 76ers. His scoring actually declined a bit (9.5 points per game), but his rebounding and shot-blocking increased. He racked up 274 rejections, setting a franchise record for most blocks in a single season. Bradley gave Philly fans a glimpse of his potential in a contest against the Los Angeles Clippers in November, posting career highs of 28 points and 22 rebounds in a 97-83 victory. He also tied a career high with 9 blocked shots, and was credited with 9 additional "intimidations" as the Clippers were held to their lowest-ever point total against the 76ers.[12] He finished the season in strong fashion, posting 13 double-doubles in his last 17 games.
New Jersey Nets[edit]
However, despite these highlights, Bradley continued to baffle and frustrate Philadelphia with his inconsistent play. Just 12 games into his third season (1995–96), the 76ers ended the "Shawn Bradley experiment", trading him to the New Jersey Nets for Derrick Coleman. He played the final 67 games of the year with the Nets, and tantalized Nets fans with some strong play in the second half of the season. In February, he dominated a match-up against fellow giant Gheorghe Mureșan, leading the Nets to a 99-81 victory against the Washington Bullets. Bradley scored a season-high 27 points over the 7-foot-7 Mureşan, and also added 9 rebounds and 4 blocked shots.[13]
Bradley lifted his game to new levels in March 1996. He posted a career-high 32 points and added 15 rebounds against Dallas early in the month,[14] and set another career high a week later with 10 blocked shots against the Phoenix Suns. He recorded his first career triple-double in the very next game, tallying 19 points, 17 rebounds, and a career-best 11 blocked shots in another match-up against Mureşan and the Bullets. In April, Bradley posted back-to-back triple-doubles (against Boston and Toronto); in the process, he became the first player in NBA history to record consecutive games of double-figure blocked shots twice in a single season.[15] His season averages for 1995–96 were 11.9 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 3.7 blocks per game[16] – all career highs.
The Nets began the 1996–97 season under new management: John Calipari was named head coach in the off-season, and John Nash replaced Willis Reed as general manager. Reed had been a big believer in Bradley, but Calipari and Nash weren't nearly as excited about the 7-foot-6 enigma. In an effort to save some cash against the salary cap, the Nets traded their big center (and his big contract) to the Dallas Mavericks in a blockbuster mid-season deal that involved nine players.[17]
Dallas Mavericks[edit]
Bradley embraced yet another "fresh start" with a new franchise. With increased playing time in Dallas, Bradley posted some of the best numbers of his career. In a game against the Clippers, he tied his career high by scoring 32 points – the most ever by a center in the history of the Mavericks franchise. He also added a season-high 16 rebounds in that same contest. He finished the year with averages of 13.2 points and 8.4 rebounds per game – breaking career highs set during the previous season. But most importantly, Bradley provided strong defense in the paint that Dallas had been lacking before his arrival. In fact, Bradley finished the year as the top shot-blocker in the entire league, averaging 3.4 swats per contest. It was the first time any Mavericks player had ever led the NBA in any statistical category.
And yet, Bradley continued to be plagued by maddening inconsistency that defined his entire professional career. During the 1997–98 season, Dallas coach Jim Cleamons experimented by bringing Bradley off the bench in several games (instead of his usual role as starter). In one particular game, it paid off in a major way: Bradley totaled 22 points, 22 rebounds, and a career-high 13 blocked shots in an April contest against the Trail Blazers. Bradley became the fifth NBA player to record at least 20 points, 20 rebounds, and 10 blocks in a single game, and the first to do so off the bench.[5] The previous players to record a 20-20-10 game with points, rebounds, and blocks were Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Elvin Hayes, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Shaquille O'Neal. Bradley finished the year with a team-record 214 blocked shots; his average of 3.3 per game ranked third in the NBA.
Bradley played 7 more seasons in the league, remaining with the Mavericks until his retirement in 2005. Over that span, his playing time slowly declined, mainly due to some injuries and constant juggling of the team's lineups and rotations by coach Don Nelson. In particular, Bradley's offensive role became very limited, but he remained an imposing defensive presence. In fact, in the 2000–01 season, he broke his own team record by blocking 228 shots for Dallas – the highest total in the NBA that year. The Mavericks emerged as a perennial playoff contender, mostly due to the rise of star players such as Dirk Nowitzki and Steve Nash, but Bradley's defense made a significant contribution. He finished his career with averages of 8.1 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks in 23.5 minutes of action per game.
International career[edit]
Bradley has competed internationally for Germany; he and Dallas teammate Dirk Nowitzki were members of the German national basketball team that finished in fourth place at the EuroBasket 2001 in Turkey. In order to participate in this tournament, Bradley made use of his German birth to obtain German citizenship.[18]
Post-basketball career[edit]
After his retirement as a player, Bradley became involved with West Ridge Academy, a coeducational private school for at-risk youths in West Jordan, Utah. Bradley's role with the school involves some of the functions of a vice principal, counselor, and coach. Describing Bradley, school executive director Ken Allen said, "Shawn has a great presence—due to his size—and has immediate credibility with the kids. His instant credibility when he's talking to kids makes him an incredible mentor. He is a great example of someone who has worked hard and been very successful. Being so tall wasn't always easy for him. He knows about being the 'odd kid' and dealing with that."[19]
On March 19, 2010, Bradley filed papers to run as a Republican against incumbent Democratic Rep. Tim Cosgrove for the 44th District seat in the Utah House of Representatives.[20][21] On November 2, 2010, Bradley lost the election to Cosgrove, earning 46.49% of the vote against Cosgrove's 51.13%.[22]
Personal life[edit]
As of 2006, Bradley and his wife Annette have six children: daughters Cheyenne, Chiera, Chelsea, and Charity and sons Chance and Chase. He lives in St. George, Utah,[23] and enjoys baseball, water skiing, horseback riding, and listening to country music.[15][24]
Bradley is a devout Mormon. When he was 19, he served for two years as a Missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Canberra, Australia.[25]
Bradley has participated in many charitable endeavors. In the 2000–01 season he donated $25 for each blocked shot to Bryan's House, a managed facility for children affected by HIV and AIDS. He is a national spokesman for the Children's Miracle Network.[15][24] Bradley has also participated in the "Basketball Without Borders" program with other NBA players like Dikembe Mutombo, DeSagana Diop and Malik Rose and found his experiences with children in Africa uplifting.[26] He and his family have also participated in treating leprosy colonies in India through the Rising Star Outreach.[27]
TV and movie appearances[edit]
Bradley had a role in the film Space Jam in 1996,[28] depicted as one of the NBA stars who lose their talent alongside Muggsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, Charles Barkley, and Patrick Ewing. Bradley was the last of all of the players in Space Jam to retire.[29] He also appeared as himself in an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger,[28] and had a cameo appearance as an auto mechanic in The Singles Ward movie.[28] In 2011, he appeared in a music video tribute to Jimmer Fredette, along with former BYU football star Chad Lewis and legendary coach LaVell Edwards.[30] He has also appeared in an episode of Studio C.[31]

High school career[edit]
Bradley played for Emery High School (Castle Dale, Utah) from 1987 to 1990. He was one of the most successful basketball players in Utah high school history, finishing with career averages of 20.3 points, 11.5 rebounds, and 5.4 blocked shots per game.[3] During his time at the school, Emery racked up a 68-4 record and won two state championships. Bradley was named All-State three times and twice earned the season MVP award. In his senior year, he averaged 25 points, 17 rebounds, and 9 blocks per contest. He was named All-American by several national publications, including Parade Magazine, Street and Smith, USA Today, and others. He turned in a strong performance at the McDonald's All-American Game (12 points, 10 rebounds, and 6 blocks), earning the Most Valuable Player award for the West team. As of 2015, Bradley still holds Utah state records for blocked shots in a single game (17), season (208), and career (506).[4]
College career[edit]
Bradley was heavily recruited by many colleges from across the country, but ultimately decided to play at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. During his freshman season (1990–91), he started all 34 games for BYU, averaging 14.8 points and 7.7 rebounds per game. But his main contribution to the team was shot-blocking: he led the entire nation in total blocks (177) and average (5.2 per game)—setting an NCAA freshman record in both categories.[5] In one game against Eastern Kentucky (EKU), Bradley blocked 14 shots, tying the NCAA single-game record set by Navy's David Robinson in 1986. In that same game, Bradley also established a new career high by scoring 29 points.[6]
BYU received a bid to the NCAA tournament that season, and Bradley continued his dominating defense. In a first round game against Virginia, he set a tournament single-game record with 10 blocked shots, leading the Cougars to a 61-48 victory.[7] However, he struggled with foul trouble in the second round, and BYU lost to Arizona, 76-61.[citation needed]
Bradley collected several awards and honors for his outstanding freshman season. He was named the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) Freshman of the Year, in addition to All-WAC defensive team and newcomer team honors. He was also named Honorable Mention All-American by the Associated Press (AP). After the end of the season, he left school to serve as a Mormon missionary. After finishing a two-year mission to Australia, he decided not to return to college basketball. Instead, he entered the 1993 NBA draft.[citation needed]
Professional career[edit]
Philadelphia 76ers[edit]
Bradley entered the professional ranks as one of the most intriguing and highly debated prospects in the history of the NBA draft. Supporters claimed his tremendous size and surprising athleticism would allow him to dominate the league. Critics argued that he would struggle in the NBA due to his thin build (listed at just 235 pounds) and lack of experience (just one season of college basketball, followed by a two-year hiatus from the sport due to his church mission). Ultimately, he was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers with the second overall pick, behind Chris Webber and ahead of Penny Hardaway. Given the novelty of a 7-foot-6 center playing for the 76ers, Bradley was issued jersey number 76.
Philadelphia's management saw Bradley as a major project with huge long-term potential. The team acquired legendary big man Moses Malone to serve as a mentor for Bradley, hoping to develop his skills in the low post.[8] Also, the franchise hired strength and conditioning consultant Pat Croce and registered dietitian Jeanie Subach to add bulk to Bradley's skinny frame.[9] His rookie season (1993–94) produced mixed results. In his first game, Bradley totaled just 6 points and 5 rebounds but he did manage to block 8 shots in 25 minutes.[10]
It was a sign of things to come. For much of his career, Bradley was inconsistent in scoring and rebounding, but he always excelled at blocking shots. He averaged 10.3 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 3.0 blocks per game in his first season – good enough to earn NBA All-Rookie Second Team honors. But he shot a dismal 40.9 percent from the floor and constantly struggled with turnovers and foul trouble. He suffered a season-ending injury in February of that year, dislocating his kneecap in a collision with Portland's Harvey Grant.[11]
Bradley returned to full strength in his second season, playing in all 82 games for the 76ers. His scoring actually declined a bit (9.5 points per game), but his rebounding and shot-blocking increased. He racked up 274 rejections, setting a franchise record for most blocks in a single season. Bradley gave Philly fans a glimpse of his potential in a contest against the Los Angeles Clippers in November, posting career highs of 28 points and 22 rebounds in a 97-83 victory. He also tied a career high with 9 blocked shots, and was credited with 9 additional "intimidations" as the Clippers were held to their lowest-ever point total against the 76ers.[12] He finished the season in strong fashion, posting 13 double-doubles in his last 17 games.
New Jersey Nets[edit]
However, despite these highlights, Bradley continued to baffle and frustrate Philadelphia with his inconsistent play. Just 12 games into his third season (1995–96), the 76ers ended the "Shawn Bradley experiment", trading him to the New Jersey Nets for Derrick Coleman. He played the final 67 games of the year with the Nets, and tantalized Nets fans with some strong play in the second half of the season. In February, he dominated a match-up against fellow giant Gheorghe Mureșan, leading the Nets to a 99-81 victory against the Washington Bullets. Bradley scored a season-high 27 points over the 7-foot-7 Mureşan, and also added 9 rebounds and 4 blocked shots.[13]
Bradley lifted his game to new levels in March 1996. He posted a career-high 32 points and added 15 rebounds against Dallas early in the month,[14] and set another career high a week later with 10 blocked shots against the Phoenix Suns. He recorded his first career triple-double in the very next game, tallying 19 points, 17 rebounds, and a career-best 11 blocked shots in another match-up against Mureşan and the Bullets. In April, Bradley posted back-to-back triple-doubles (against Boston and Toronto); in the process, he became the first player in NBA history to record consecutive games of double-figure blocked shots twice in a single season.[15] His season averages for 1995–96 were 11.9 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 3.7 blocks per game[16] – all career highs.
The Nets began the 1996–97 season under new management: John Calipari was named head coach in the off-season, and John Nash replaced Willis Reed as general manager. Reed had been a big believer in Bradley, but Calipari and Nash weren't nearly as excited about the 7-foot-6 enigma. In an effort to save some cash against the salary cap, the Nets traded their big center (and his big contract) to the Dallas Mavericks in a blockbuster mid-season deal that involved nine players.[17]
Dallas Mavericks[edit]
Bradley embraced yet another "fresh start" with a new franchise. With increased playing time in Dallas, Bradley posted some of the best numbers of his career. In a game against the Clippers, he tied his career high by scoring 32 points – the most ever by a center in the history of the Mavericks franchise. He also added a season-high 16 rebounds in that same contest. He finished the year with averages of 13.2 points and 8.4 rebounds per game – breaking career highs set during the previous season. But most importantly, Bradley provided strong defense in the paint that Dallas had been lacking before his arrival. In fact, Bradley finished the year as the top shot-blocker in the entire league, averaging 3.4 swats per contest. It was the first time any Mavericks player had ever led the NBA in any statistical category.
And yet, Bradley continued to be plagued by maddening inconsistency that defined his entire professional career. During the 1997–98 season, Dallas coach Jim Cleamons experimented by bringing Bradley off the bench in several games (instead of his usual role as starter). In one particular game, it paid off in a major way: Bradley totaled 22 points, 22 rebounds, and a career-high 13 blocked shots in an April contest against the Trail Blazers. Bradley became the fifth NBA player to record at least 20 points, 20 rebounds, and 10 blocks in a single game, and the first to do so off the bench.[5] The previous players to record a 20-20-10 game with points, rebounds, and blocks were Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Elvin Hayes, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Shaquille O'Neal. Bradley finished the year with a team-record 214 blocked shots; his average of 3.3 per game ranked third in the NBA.
Bradley played 7 more seasons in the league, remaining with the Mavericks until his retirement in 2005. Over that span, his playing time slowly declined, mainly due to some injuries and constant juggling of the team's lineups and rotations by coach Don Nelson. In particular, Bradley's offensive role became very limited, but he remained an imposing defensive presence. In fact, in the 2000–01 season, he broke his own team record by blocking 228 shots for Dallas – the highest total in the NBA that year. The Mavericks emerged as a perennial playoff contender, mostly due to the rise of star players such as Dirk Nowitzki and Steve Nash, but Bradley's defense made a significant contribution. He finished his career with averages of 8.1 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks in 23.5 minutes of action per game.
International career[edit]
Bradley has competed internationally for Germany; he and Dallas teammate Dirk Nowitzki were members of the German national basketball team that finished in fourth place at the EuroBasket 2001 in Turkey. In order to participate in this tournament, Bradley made use of his German birth to obtain German citizenship.[18]
Post-basketball career[edit]
After his retirement as a player, Bradley became involved with West Ridge Academy, a coeducational private school for at-risk youths in West Jordan, Utah. Bradley's role with the school involves some of the functions of a vice principal, counselor, and coach. Describing Bradley, school executive director Ken Allen said, "Shawn has a great presence—due to his size—and has immediate credibility with the kids. His instant credibility when he's talking to kids makes him an incredible mentor. He is a great example of someone who has worked hard and been very successful. Being so tall wasn't always easy for him. He knows about being the 'odd kid' and dealing with that."[19]
On March 19, 2010, Bradley filed papers to run as a Republican against incumbent Democratic Rep. Tim Cosgrove for the 44th District seat in the Utah House of Representatives.[20][21] On November 2, 2010, Bradley lost the election to Cosgrove, earning 46.49% of the vote against Cosgrove's 51.13%.[22]
Personal life[edit]
As of 2006, Bradley and his wife Annette have six children: daughters Cheyenne, Chiera, Chelsea, and Charity and sons Chance and Chase. He lives in St. George, Utah,[23] and enjoys baseball, water skiing, horseback riding, and listening to country music.[15][24]
Bradley is a devout Mormon. When he was 19, he served for two years as a Missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Canberra, Australia.[25]
Bradley has participated in many charitable endeavors. In the 2000–01 season he donated $25 for each blocked shot to Bryan's House, a managed facility for children affected by HIV and AIDS. He is a national spokesman for the Children's Miracle Network.[15][24] Bradley has also participated in the "Basketball Without Borders" program with other NBA players like Dikembe Mutombo, DeSagana Diop and Malik Rose and found his experiences with children in Africa uplifting.[26] He and his family have also participated in treating leprosy colonies in India through the Rising Star Outreach.[27]
TV and movie appearances[edit]
Bradley had a role in the film Space Jam in 1996,[28] depicted as one of the NBA stars who lose their talent alongside Muggsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, Charles Barkley, and Patrick Ewing. Bradley was the last of all of the players in Space Jam to retire.[29] He also appeared as himself in an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger,[28] and had a cameo appearance as an auto mechanic in The Singles Ward movie.[28] In 2011, he appeared in a music video tribute to Jimmer Fredette, along with former BYU football star Chad Lewis and legendary coach LaVell Edwards.[30] He has also appeared in an episode of Studio C.[31]

High school career[edit]
Bradley played for Emery High School (Castle Dale, Utah) from 1987 to 1990. He was one of the most successful basketball players in Utah high school history, finishing with career averages of 20.3 points, 11.5 rebounds, and 5.4 blocked shots per game.[3] During his time at the school, Emery racked up a 68-4 record and won two state championships. Bradley was named All-State three times and twice earned the season MVP award. In his senior year, he averaged 25 points, 17 rebounds, and 9 blocks per contest. He was named All-American by several national publications, including Parade Magazine, Street and Smith, USA Today, and others. He turned in a strong performance at the McDonald's All-American Game (12 points, 10 rebounds, and 6 blocks), earning the Most Valuable Player award for the West team. As of 2015, Bradley still holds Utah state records for blocked shots in a single game (17), season (208), and career (506).[4]
College career[edit]
Bradley was heavily recruited by many colleges from across the country, but ultimately decided to play at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. During his freshman season (1990–91), he started all 34 games for BYU, averaging 14.8 points and 7.7 rebounds per game. But his main contribution to the team was shot-blocking: he led the entire nation in total blocks (177) and average (5.2 per game)—setting an NCAA freshman record in both categories.[5] In one game against Eastern Kentucky (EKU), Bradley blocked 14 shots, tying the NCAA single-game record set by Navy's David Robinson in 1986. In that same game, Bradley also established a new career high by scoring 29 points.[6]
BYU received a bid to the NCAA tournament that season, and Bradley continued his dominating defense. In a first round game against Virginia, he set a tournament single-game record with 10 blocked shots, leading the Cougars to a 61-48 victory.[7] However, he struggled with foul trouble in the second round, and BYU lost to Arizona, 76-61.[citation needed]
Bradley collected several awards and honors for his outstanding freshman season. He was named the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) Freshman of the Year, in addition to All-WAC defensive team and newcomer team honors. He was also named Honorable Mention All-American by the Associated Press (AP). After the end of the season, he left school to serve as a Mormon missionary. After finishing a two-year mission to Australia, he decided not to return to college basketball. Instead, he entered the 1993 NBA draft.[citation needed]
Professional career[edit]
Philadelphia 76ers[edit]
Bradley entered the professional ranks as one of the most intriguing and highly debated prospects in the history of the NBA draft. Supporters claimed his tremendous size and surprising athleticism would allow him to dominate the league. Critics argued that he would struggle in the NBA due to his thin build (listed at just 235 pounds) and lack of experience (just one season of college basketball, followed by a two-year hiatus from the sport due to his church mission). Ultimately, he was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers with the second overall pick, behind Chris Webber and ahead of Penny Hardaway. Given the novelty of a 7-foot-6 center playing for the 76ers, Bradley was issued jersey number 76.
Philadelphia's management saw Bradley as a major project with huge long-term potential. The team acquired legendary big man Moses Malone to serve as a mentor for Bradley, hoping to develop his skills in the low post.[8] Also, the franchise hired strength and conditioning consultant Pat Croce and registered dietitian Jeanie Subach to add bulk to Bradley's skinny frame.[9] His rookie season (1993–94) produced mixed results. In his first game, Bradley totaled just 6 points and 5 rebounds but he did manage to block 8 shots in 25 minutes.[10]
It was a sign of things to come. For much of his career, Bradley was inconsistent in scoring and rebounding, but he always excelled at blocking shots. He averaged 10.3 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 3.0 blocks per game in his first season – good enough to earn NBA All-Rookie Second Team honors. But he shot a dismal 40.9 percent from the floor and constantly struggled with turnovers and foul trouble. He suffered a season-ending injury in February of that year, dislocating his kneecap in a collision with Portland's Harvey Grant.[11]
Bradley returned to full strength in his second season, playing in all 82 games for the 76ers. His scoring actually declined a bit (9.5 points per game), but his rebounding and shot-blocking increased. He racked up 274 rejections, setting a franchise record for most blocks in a single season. Bradley gave Philly fans a glimpse of his potential in a contest against the Los Angeles Clippers in November, posting career highs of 28 points and 22 rebounds in a 97-83 victory. He also tied a career high with 9 blocked shots, and was credited with 9 additional "intimidations" as the Clippers were held to their lowest-ever point total against the 76ers.[12] He finished the season in strong fashion, posting 13 double-doubles in his last 17 games.
New Jersey Nets[edit]
However, despite these highlights, Bradley continued to baffle and frustrate Philadelphia with his inconsistent play. Just 12 games into his third season (1995–96), the 76ers ended the "Shawn Bradley experiment", trading him to the New Jersey Nets for Derrick Coleman. He played the final 67 games of the year with the Nets, and tantalized Nets fans with some strong play in the second half of the season. In February, he dominated a match-up against fellow giant Gheorghe Mureșan, leading the Nets to a 99-81 victory against the Washington Bullets. Bradley scored a season-high 27 points over the 7-foot-7 Mureşan, and also added 9 rebounds and 4 blocked shots.[13]
Bradley lifted his game to new levels in March 1996. He posted a career-high 32 points and added 15 rebounds against Dallas early in the month,[14] and set another career high a week later with 10 blocked shots against the Phoenix Suns. He recorded his first career triple-double in the very next game, tallying 19 points, 17 rebounds, and a career-best 11 blocked shots in another match-up against Mureşan and the Bullets. In April, Bradley posted back-to-back triple-doubles (against Boston and Toronto); in the process, he became the first player in NBA history to record consecutive games of double-figure blocked shots twice in a single season.[15] His season averages for 1995–96 were 11.9 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 3.7 blocks per game[16] – all career highs.
The Nets began the 1996–97 season under new management: John Calipari was named head coach in the off-season, and John Nash replaced Willis Reed as general manager. Reed had been a big believer in Bradley, but Calipari and Nash weren't nearly as excited about the 7-foot-6 enigma. In an effort to save some cash against the salary cap, the Nets traded their big center (and his big contract) to the Dallas Mavericks in a blockbuster mid-season deal that involved nine players.[17]
Dallas Mavericks[edit]
Bradley embraced yet another "fresh start" with a new franchise. With increased playing time in Dallas, Bradley posted some of the best numbers of his career. In a game against the Clippers, he tied his career high by scoring 32 points – the most ever by a center in the history of the Mavericks franchise. He also added a season-high 16 rebounds in that same contest. He finished the year with averages of 13.2 points and 8.4 rebounds per game – breaking career highs set during the previous season. But most importantly, Bradley provided strong defense in the paint that Dallas had been lacking before his arrival. In fact, Bradley finished the year as the top shot-blocker in the entire league, averaging 3.4 swats per contest. It was the first time any Mavericks player had ever led the NBA in any statistical category.
And yet, Bradley continued to be plagued by maddening inconsistency that defined his entire professional career. During the 1997–98 season, Dallas coach Jim Cleamons experimented by bringing Bradley off the bench in several games (instead of his usual role as starter). In one particular game, it paid off in a major way: Bradley totaled 22 points, 22 rebounds, and a career-high 13 blocked shots in an April contest against the Trail Blazers. Bradley became the fifth NBA player to record at least 20 points, 20 rebounds, and 10 blocks in a single game, and the first to do so off the bench.[5] The previous players to record a 20-20-10 game with points, rebounds, and blocks were Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Elvin Hayes, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Shaquille O'Neal. Bradley finished the year with a team-record 214 blocked shots; his average of 3.3 per game ranked third in the NBA.
Bradley played 7 more seasons in the league, remaining with the Mavericks until his retirement in 2005. Over that span, his playing time slowly declined, mainly due to some injuries and constant juggling of the team's lineups and rotations by coach Don Nelson. In particular, Bradley's offensive role became very limited, but he remained an imposing defensive presence. In fact, in the 2000–01 season, he broke his own team record by blocking 228 shots for Dallas – the highest total in the NBA that year. The Mavericks emerged as a perennial playoff contender, mostly due to the rise of star players such as Dirk Nowitzki and Steve Nash, but Bradley's defense made a significant contribution. He finished his career with averages of 8.1 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks in 23.5 minutes of action per game.
International career[edit]
Bradley has competed internationally for Germany; he and Dallas teammate Dirk Nowitzki were members of the German national basketball team that finished in fourth place at the EuroBasket 2001 in Turkey. In order to participate in this tournament, Bradley made use of his German birth to obtain German citizenship.[18]
Post-basketball career[edit]
After his retirement as a player, Bradley became involved with West Ridge Academy, a coeducational private school for at-risk youths in West Jordan, Utah. Bradley's role with the school involves some of the functions of a vice principal, counselor, and coach. Describing Bradley, school executive director Ken Allen said, "Shawn has a great presence—due to his size—and has immediate credibility with the kids. His instant credibility when he's talking to kids makes him an incredible mentor. He is a great example of someone who has worked hard and been very successful. Being so tall wasn't always easy for him. He knows about being the 'odd kid' and dealing with that."[19]
On March 19, 2010, Bradley filed papers to run as a Republican against incumbent Democratic Rep. Tim Cosgrove for the 44th District seat in the Utah House of Representatives.[20][21] On November 2, 2010, Bradley lost the election to Cosgrove, earning 46.49% of the vote against Cosgrove's 51.13%.[22]
Personal life[edit]
As of 2006, Bradley and his wife Annette have six children: daughters Cheyenne, Chiera, Chelsea, and Charity and sons Chance and Chase. He lives in St. George, Utah,[23] and enjoys baseball, water skiing, horseback riding, and listening to country music.[15][24]
Bradley is a devout Mormon. When he was 19, he served for two years as a Missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Canberra, Australia.[25]
Bradley has participated in many charitable endeavors. In the 2000–01 season he donated $25 for each blocked shot to Bryan's House, a managed facility for children affected by HIV and AIDS. He is a national spokesman for the Children's Miracle Network.[15][24] Bradley has also participated in the "Basketball Without Borders" program with other NBA players like Dikembe Mutombo, DeSagana Diop and Malik Rose and found his experiences with children in Africa uplifting.[26] He and his family have also participated in treating leprosy colonies in India through the Rising Star Outreach.[27]
TV and movie appearances[edit]
Bradley had a role in the film Space Jam in 1996,[28] depicted as one of the NBA stars who lose their talent alongside Muggsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, Charles Barkley, and Patrick Ewing. Bradley was the last of all of the players in Space Jam to retire.[29] He also appeared as himself in an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger,[28] and had a cameo appearance as an auto mechanic in The Singles Ward movie.[28] In 2011, he appeared in a music video tribute to Jimmer Fredette, along with former BYU football star Chad Lewis and legendary coach LaVell Edwards.[30] He has also appeared in an episode of Studio C.[31]

High school career[edit]
Bradley played for Emery High School (Castle Dale, Utah) from 1987 to 1990. He was one of the most successful basketball players in Utah high school history, finishing with career averages of 20.3 points, 11.5 rebounds, and 5.4 blocked shots per game.[3] During his time at the school, Emery racked up a 68-4 record and won two state championships. Bradley was named All-State three times and twice earned the season MVP award. In his senior year, he averaged 25 points, 17 rebounds, and 9 blocks per contest. He was named All-American by several national publications, including Parade Magazine, Street and Smith, USA Today, and others. He turned in a strong performance at the McDonald's All-American Game (12 points, 10 rebounds, and 6 blocks), earning the Most Valuable Player award for the West team. As of 2015, Bradley still holds Utah state records for blocked shots in a single game (17), season (208), and career (506).[4]
College career[edit]
Bradley was heavily recruited by many colleges from across the country, but ultimately decided to play at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. During his freshman season (1990–91), he started all 34 games for BYU, averaging 14.8 points and 7.7 rebounds per game. But his main contribution to the team was shot-blocking: he led the entire nation in total blocks (177) and average (5.2 per game)—setting an NCAA freshman record in both categories.[5] In one game against Eastern Kentucky (EKU), Bradley blocked 14 shots, tying the NCAA single-game record set by Navy's David Robinson in 1986. In that same game, Bradley also established a new career high by scoring 29 points.[6]
BYU received a bid to the NCAA tournament that season, and Bradley continued his dominating defense. In a first round game against Virginia, he set a tournament single-game record with 10 blocked shots, leading the Cougars to a 61-48 victory.[7] However, he struggled with foul trouble in the second round, and BYU lost to Arizona, 76-61.[citation needed]
Bradley collected several awards and honors for his outstanding freshman season. He was named the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) Freshman of the Year, in addition to All-WAC defensive team and newcomer team honors. He was also named Honorable Mention All-American by the Associated Press (AP). After the end of the season, he left school to serve as a Mormon missionary. After finishing a two-year mission to Australia, he decided not to return to college basketball. Instead, he entered the 1993 NBA draft.[citation needed]
Professional career[edit]
Philadelphia 76ers[edit]
Bradley entered the professional ranks as one of the most intriguing and highly debated prospects in the history of the NBA draft. Supporters claimed his tremendous size and surprising athleticism would allow him to dominate the league. Critics argued that he would struggle in the NBA due to his thin build (listed at just 235 pounds) and lack of experience (just one season of college basketball, followed by a two-year hiatus from the sport due to his church mission). Ultimately, he was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers with the second overall pick, behind Chris Webber and ahead of Penny Hardaway. Given the novelty of a 7-foot-6 center playing for the 76ers, Bradley was issued jersey number 76.
Philadelphia's management saw Bradley as a major project with huge long-term potential. The team acquired legendary big man Moses Malone to serve as a mentor for Bradley, hoping to develop his skills in the low post.[8] Also, the franchise hired strength and conditioning consultant Pat Croce and registered dietitian Jeanie Subach to add bulk to Bradley's skinny frame.[9] His rookie season (1993–94) produced mixed results. In his first game, Bradley totaled just 6 points and 5 rebounds but he did manage to block 8 shots in 25 minutes.[10]
It was a sign of things to come. For much of his career, Bradley was inconsistent in scoring and rebounding, but he always excelled at blocking shots. He averaged 10.3 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 3.0 blocks per game in his first season – good enough to earn NBA All-Rookie Second Team honors. But he shot a dismal 40.9 percent from the floor and constantly struggled with turnovers and foul trouble. He suffered a season-ending injury in February of that year, dislocating his kneecap in a collision with Portland's Harvey Grant.[11]
Bradley returned to full strength in his second season, playing in all 82 games for the 76ers. His scoring actually declined a bit (9.5 points per game), but his rebounding and shot-blocking increased. He racked up 274 rejections, setting a franchise record for most blocks in a single season. Bradley gave Philly fans a glimpse of his potential in a contest against the Los Angeles Clippers in November, posting career highs of 28 points and 22 rebounds in a 97-83 victory. He also tied a career high with 9 blocked shots, and was credited with 9 additional "intimidations" as the Clippers were held to their lowest-ever point total against the 76ers.[12] He finished the season in strong fashion, posting 13 double-doubles in his last 17 games.
New Jersey Nets[edit]
However, despite these highlights, Bradley continued to baffle and frustrate Philadelphia with his inconsistent play. Just 12 games into his third season (1995–96), the 76ers ended the "Shawn Bradley experiment", trading him to the New Jersey Nets for Derrick Coleman. He played the final 67 games of the year with the Nets, and tantalized Nets fans with some strong play in the second half of the season. In February, he dominated a match-up against fellow giant Gheorghe Mureșan, leading the Nets to a 99-81 victory against the Washington Bullets. Bradley scored a season-high 27 points over the 7-foot-7 Mureşan, and also added 9 rebounds and 4 blocked shots.[13]
Bradley lifted his game to new levels in March 1996. He posted a career-high 32 points and added 15 rebounds against Dallas early in the month,[14] and set another career high a week later with 10 blocked shots against the Phoenix Suns. He recorded his first career triple-double in the very next game, tallying 19 points, 17 rebounds, and a career-best 11 blocked shots in another match-up against Mureşan and the Bullets. In April, Bradley posted back-to-back triple-doubles (against Boston and Toronto); in the process, he became the first player in NBA history to record consecutive games of double-figure blocked shots twice in a single season.[15] His season averages for 1995–96 were 11.9 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 3.7 blocks per game[16] – all career highs.
The Nets began the 1996–97 season under new management: John Calipari was named head coach in the off-season, and John Nash replaced Willis Reed as general manager. Reed had been a big believer in Bradley, but Calipari and Nash weren't nearly as excited about the 7-foot-6 enigma. In an effort to save some cash against the salary cap, the Nets traded their big center (and his big contract) to the Dallas Mavericks in a blockbuster mid-season deal that involved nine players.[17]
Dallas Mavericks[edit]
Bradley embraced yet another "fresh start" with a new franchise. With increased playing time in Dallas, Bradley posted some of the best numbers of his career. In a game against the Clippers, he tied his career high by scoring 32 points – the most ever by a center in the history of the Mavericks franchise. He also added a season-high 16 rebounds in that same contest. He finished the year with averages of 13.2 points and 8.4 rebounds per game – breaking career highs set during the previous season. But most importantly, Bradley provided strong defense in the paint that Dallas had been lacking before his arrival. In fact, Bradley finished the year as the top shot-blocker in the entire league, averaging 3.4 swats per contest. It was the first time any Mavericks player had ever led the NBA in any statistical category.
And yet, Bradley continued to be plagued by maddening inconsistency that defined his entire professional career. During the 1997–98 season, Dallas coach Jim Cleamons experimented by bringing Bradley off the bench in several games (instead of his usual role as starter). In one particular game, it paid off in a major way: Bradley totaled 22 points, 22 rebounds, and a career-high 13 blocked shots in an April contest against the Trail Blazers. Bradley became the fifth NBA player to record at least 20 points, 20 rebounds, and 10 blocks in a single game, and the first to do so off the bench.[5] The previous players to record a 20-20-10 game with points, rebounds, and blocks were Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Elvin Hayes, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Shaquille O'Neal. Bradley finished the year with a team-record 214 blocked shots; his average of 3.3 per game ranked third in the NBA.
Bradley played 7 more seasons in the league, remaining with the Mavericks until his retirement in 2005. Over that span, his playing time slowly declined, mainly due to some injuries and constant juggling of the team's lineups and rotations by coach Don Nelson. In particular, Bradley's offensive role became very limited, but he remained an imposing defensive presence. In fact, in the 2000–01 season, he broke his own team record by blocking 228 shots for Dallas – the highest total in the NBA that year. The Mavericks emerged as a perennial playoff contender, mostly due to the rise of star players such as Dirk Nowitzki and Steve Nash, but Bradley's defense made a significant contribution. He finished his career with averages of 8.1 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks in 23.5 minutes of action per game.
International career[edit]
Bradley has competed internationally for Germany; he and Dallas teammate Dirk Nowitzki were members of the German national basketball team that finished in fourth place at the EuroBasket 2001 in Turkey. In order to participate in this tournament, Bradley made use of his German birth to obtain German citizenship.[18]
Post-basketball career[edit]
After his retirement as a player, Bradley became involved with West Ridge Academy, a coeducational private school for at-risk youths in West Jordan, Utah. Bradley's role with the school involves some of the functions of a vice principal, counselor, and coach. Describing Bradley, school executive director Ken Allen said, "Shawn has a great presence—due to his size—and has immediate credibility with the kids. His instant credibility when he's talking to kids makes him an incredible mentor. He is a great example of someone who has worked hard and been very successful. Being so tall wasn't always easy for him. He knows about being the 'odd kid' and dealing with that."[19]
On March 19, 2010, Bradley filed papers to run as a Republican against incumbent Democratic Rep. Tim Cosgrove for the 44th District seat in the Utah House of Representatives.[20][21] On November 2, 2010, Bradley lost the election to Cosgrove, earning 46.49% of the vote against Cosgrove's 51.13%.[22]
Personal life[edit]
As of 2006, Bradley and his wife Annette have six children: daughters Cheyenne, Chiera, Chelsea, and Charity and sons Chance and Chase. He lives in St. George, Utah,[23] and enjoys baseball, water skiing, horseback riding, and listening to country music.[15][24]
Bradley is a devout Mormon. When he was 19, he served for two years as a Missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Canberra, Australia.[25]
Bradley has participated in many charitable endeavors. In the 2000–01 season he donated $25 for each blocked shot to Bryan's House, a managed facility for children affected by HIV and AIDS. He is a national spokesman for the Children's Miracle Network.[15][24] Bradley has also participated in the "Basketball Without Borders" program with other NBA players like Dikembe Mutombo, DeSagana Diop and Malik Rose and found his experiences with children in Africa uplifting.[26] He and his family have also participated in treating leprosy colonies in India through the Rising Star Outreach.[27]
TV and movie appearances[edit]
Bradley had a role in the film Space Jam in 1996,[28] depicted as one of the NBA stars who lose their talent alongside Muggsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, Charles Barkley, and Patrick Ewing. Bradley was the last of all of the players in Space Jam to retire.[29] He also appeared as himself in an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger,[28] and had a cameo appearance as an auto mechanic in The Singles Ward movie.[28] In 2011, he appeared in a music video tribute to Jimmer Fredette, along with former BYU football star Chad Lewis and legendary coach LaVell Edwards.[30] He has also appeared in an episode of Studio C.[31]

Our First Thoughts on the 2017 Ducati Scrambler Desert Sled and Triumph Street Scrambler

Two bikes, same country, different rides. What are the boys’ thoughts?

2017 Ducati Scrambler Desert Sled


Bradley Adams

This week, Sean and Bradley had the unique opportunity to roll around the Spanish desert with two of the latest and greatest scramblers. Those rides didn’t cross paths, but seeing as how they were both in the same time zone and the guys weren't sleeping anyway due to that whole jet-lag thing, we decided to set them up on Slack and see what they had to say about the rides.
Both are working on their full first-ride reviews, which you can and should read right here at cycleworld.com sometime this week. In the meantime, here are some of their initial, sleep-deprived thoughts on two dramatically different takes on the scrambler design.
badams [2:28 PM]
Hey princess, you still awake?
sean [2:29 PM]
Yeah bud. Just finished dinner and one or three drinks at the bar.
[2:29]
I saw your posts on instagram, you're really into that Ducati huh?
badams [2:31 PM]
Mmm. They knocked it out of the park with this Desert Sled. Seriously.
sean [2:32 PM]
To be honest, I sorta assumed it would be a performer, but I still can't get into the looks. Guess that’s a personal thing and I’m just weird like that.
badams [2:32 PM]
It's not always about looks, Sean.... But seriously, performance-wise, it's better than I even thought it would be. Really and truly off-road capable.
sean [2:32 PM]
Alright alright, tell me more then. I wanna hear all about how it performs. Because I still don't believe it can perform THAT well
badams [2:39 PM]
No really, it does. It's completely and utterly raised the bar within the scrambler category. Ten minutes into the ride we were in this wash that would've eaten up anything else in the category. And this thing just charged right through. Stand up, shift your weight back, and it's more than willing to tackle the technical stuff.
I'm not saying it's a dirt bike. But I'm saying it's 10x more capable than any other so-called scrambler out there right now.


Triumph Street Scrambler


Sean MacDonald

sean [2:41 PM]
Okay, but what about rocks. Those freakin' things are what always really get me. What do you do about rocks?
badams [2:41 PM]
Umm, I avoid them like 7-11 sushi?
[2:41]
Why would you not?
[2:42]
Do you purposely hit those on a dirt bike? Like, “Oh a rock, let me go torture my kidneys on that just for giggles…
sean [2:42 PM]
hahahahaha!
[2:42]
A) Suck a fart
B) SOMETIMES you can't help it and there are rocks everywhere. Are you telling me you only rode on fire roads and some sand? Because lots of ADV bikes will do that PLENTY fine.
badams [2:44 PM]
Put it this way, the first thing anyone said after our first stop was, "I can't believe they actually took us on this route."
[2:45]
SO sandy and technical.


2017 Ducati Scrambler Desert Sled


Bradley Adams

sean [2:45 PM]
Dangit. That's actually awesome.
[2:45]
We did about a half-mile of dirt today, and by dirt I mean fire road.
badams [2:45 PM]
Yeah, because the Triumph is more about looks.
sean [2:46 PM]
Okay, hold on.
[2:46]
A) I love lists.
B) You can just suck it right now.
C) Looks matter, but so does on road performance, and the Triumph is AWESOME at that.
badams [2:47 PM]
But that's the thing!!! This Desert Sled lost basically nothing in terms of on-road performance.
sean [2:47 PM]
Yeah, but seriously, there were times today where I forgot I was on the hipster/Jurassic World bike and thought I was on a supermoto (albeit underpowered).
Just SENDING IT into corners.


Triumph Street Scrambler


Sean MacDonald

badams [2:48 PM]
You'd have sent it bigger on the Desert Sled...
[2:48]
Just my opinion.
sean [2:48 PM]
Okay, but the Ducati was never THAT great of a road bike. Snatchy throttle and bouncy suspension. You telling me all of that is fixed?
badams [2:50 PM]
Throttle was actually smoother than I thought it would be. The engine is all Euro 4 compliant, so there are some tweaks to the tuning. And it helped. Suspension is a good balance between comfort and support. And that extra travel front and rear is a godsend.
[2:50]
Remember Ducati updated the chassis a bit too. It’s stiffer, the engine mounts to the frame different so there aren’t any issues with load when you jump the thing, and the swingarm is longer.
[2:51]
Should we even be comparing performance on these bikes? I mean they're different customers, aren't they?
[2:52]
Like, with the Triumph, is the guy buying that even intending to go off-road?
sean [2:53 PM]
Not at all. I mean, it's better off road than the last one, but that isn't saying much.
[2:53]
but
[2:53]
BUT


2017 Ducati Scrambler Desert Sled


Bradley Adams

[2:53]
It's soooooo good on road. Like, howling with laughter/screaming at our lead rider to go faster while scraping hard parts good.
[2:53]
And it's 10000x better looking while doing so.
[2:54]
I mean, I don't go offroad that often on my daily ride, and we have dual sports and dirt bikes for when we do, so how is this not the best option for daily use? The ONLY option is if it's somehow better on road. That's the only way I'll accept that it doesn't look even close to as nice.
badams [2:58 PM]
I wouldn't say better on road, but it's not any worse. And here's the thing, I ride motorcycles for the adventure. If I see a dirt road leading off of a highway, I'm absolutely 100% going to take that detour. And I don't want to have to turn around the second said road gets a little technical.
[2:59]
And that's why I like the Desert Sled so much. Nothing's holding you back from going farther. Getting deeper into the desert. Having more FUN!
[3:00]
I literally laughed in my helmet 90% of today. I like that. I want more of that.
sean [3:00 PM]
So did I!
[3:01]
But also, you're the dude taking roads on a Yamaha FJ-09 that I was on a KTM 1190 Adventure R...you'd be fine on most things.


Triumph Street Scrambler


Sean MacDonald

badams [3:02 PM]
I mean, I don't find pleasure in taking things where they don't belong. I'll do it. But I know I shouldn't be and that kind of sucks the fun out of it a bit. With this thing, you never feel like you're doing something you shouldn't be.
[3:03]
For the sake of actually getting some sleep tonight though, let's get to the nitty-gritty here. What are the biggest takeaways from the ride on the Triumph today?
[3:03]
And yes...you can give me another freakin' list if you want.
sean [3:03 PM]
Hahahaha, only if A is for you to shut up.
[3:04]
No, no. Here's the thing. It's just really good. They've reduced the weight a little, but lowered the bike a lot. It no longer feels like a big heavy bike. In fact, you no longer think about the size or weight.
[3:06]
It keeps being (if not more so) the prettiest thing out there. Only now it's fun, easy to ride, accessible, and quick for all. If people can get over the off-road thing, then I think it's the best one on the market. At least if you want to ride something pretty instead of something Japanese or expensive.
badams [3:08 PM]
But scrambler-wise, you mean?
sean [3:09 PM]
If you like classically styled things I mean.


2017 Ducati Scrambler Desert Sled


Bradley Adams

badams [3:11 PM]
Okay got it. I mean, those are really, really good points. Lighter weight, less intimidating, and pretty. It does sound like a good package.
sean [3:12 PM]
It's so good, dude. No more worrying about getting your feet down or managing the weight, even at a stop. No more of that feeling like when you're leaning back in a desk chair and it almost tips. You know that feeling, I’ve seen that fear in your face before, hahaha.
[3:13]
Seriously though, just confidence across the board. At a stop and at lean and at 100 miles per hour (wait, didn't you say something about posting this?)
badams [3:14 PM]
People would have stopped reading at your third list...
sean [3:14 PM]
Whatever man.
Question. If you had to mark the Scrambler Desert Sled's performance by something, what would you liken it to?
badams [3:17 PM]
Oh man, my brain's going to hurt trying to figure this one out.
sean [3:17 PM]
GOOD, you need to not be great at something every once in a while.
badams [3:18 PM]
Maybe like a really, really good KLR650, with just a little less long-range comfort?
[3:18]
Is that bad? I can't tell if that's a bad thing.
[3:19]
I didn't mean for it to be. Everyone loves a KLR...


Triumph Street Scrambler


Sean MacDonald

sean [3:19 PM]
I hate the KLR, try again.
badams [3:19 PM]
Yeah, but would you hate a really, really good KLR?
sean [3:20 PM]
Okay, no. that sounds lovely. Especially if it was Italian and didn't give me speed wobbles on the freeway.
[3:20]
Also, screw you for almost making me see your side.
badams [3:21 PM]
Seriously, think about it... pretty good off-road (better than any real street-oriented scrambler thing) but more comfortable than an enduro, so you can actually ride it a significant amount of street miles before jumping on a trail.
[3:21]
CoughBajatripCough.
sean [3:21 PM]
Is this one of those things I'm not going to believe until I try it for myself?
[3:21]
But then I'm going to agree with you wholeheartedly?
badams [3:22 PM]
Yeah, it's basically like that.
[3:22]
Even grumpy Sean will love it.


2017 Ducati Scrambler Desert Sled


Bradley Adams

sean [3:22 PM]
Ugh, you'd think I'd learn.
badams [3:22 PM]
Ha. And honestly, I'll probably love the Triumph too. Just in a different environment.
[3:23]
I'm glad they both stepped it up this year. I think both bikes are going to pump some much-needed life back into the scrambler segment.
sean [3:24 PM]
Yeah
[3:25]
I mean, I believe you because you don't actually get excited about stuff that isn't awesome, but I still think in the end I might choose pretty over real off-road capability. I mean, unless it's KTM 350 or 500 EXC-F good. Because that's all I really want to ride in the dirt.
[3:25]
But who knows, Ducati may have created one bike to do it all. Getting you this excited is incredible enough as is.
badams [3:26 PM]
Yeah, yeah, I'm hard to please, we know.
[3:26]
Fair enough. And I'll admit, there are some downsides. Like the weight and price (456 lbs./$11,395).
sean [3:27 PM]
I could have a KTM for half that weight, and that price. And I could make it look cooler.....


Triumph Street Scrambler


Sean MacDonald

badams [3:28 PM]
But I think big picture it's a step in a really cool direction. The DS is the scrambler I've been wanting for years now. And not only did Ducati finally build it, but they built it beyond our expectations.
[3:28]
That's pretty cool to be able to say.
sean [3:29 PM]
For once, you've said something I can't argue with.
badams [3:29 PM]
Boom, I win!
sean [3:29 PM]
NOT WHAT I SAID
badams [3:29 PM]
What I read...
[3:30]
But okay, I'm going to bed. You're first ride going up soon?
[3:30]
your* --- someone's going to yell at me on FB about that...
sean [3:31 PM]
Hahahahah, how you made a mistake before me I'll never know.
[3:31]
And yeah, it'll be up soonish. At least I'm faster than you at something
badams [3:33 PM]
Okay, I'll grab some Five Hour Energy drinks soon as I get home and try to get mine up too, then we can compare.
sean [3:33 PM]
DEAL.
[3:34]
Rad. I’m signing off then.
[3:34]
Go Desert Sled!
[3:34]
Woo. All the wins.
sean [3:34 PM]
I hate you.
[3:35]
Goodnight, and see ya back in the office.
badams [3:35 PM]
I hate that I laughed at that and people are going to read the same thing and think we are idiots...
sean [3:35 PM]
yuuuuup.
badams [3:36 PM]
Oh well, the truth had to come out at some point. But yes, night bud. See you back in Irvine.

Overview: From hidden genes to new chemistry 
The Laboratory of Genetically Encoded Small Molecules The Rockefeller University and Howard Hughes Medical Institute
The lab's research interests center on both the discovery and the functional characterization of new small molecules from previously inaccessible genetic sources. We are particularly interested in the use of both functional and sequence-based strategies to access bioactive small molecules from both uncultured bacteria and the genomes of sequenced bacterial pathogens. Gaining functional access to previously inaccessible natural product biosynthetic pathways should significantly increase the number and diversity of natural products that are available for use in the development of small molecule therapeutics as well as provide a better understanding of how these metabolites are used by bacterial pathogens. Our research program is multidisciplinary, relying on techniques from the fields of molecular biology, analytic chemistry, microbiology and genomics. A background in any of these fields is welcome in the lab.

We are always looking for well-qualified postdocs and graduate students with backgrounds in microbiology, analytical chemistry, molecular biology, synthetic biology or bioinformatics and an interest in natural product chemistry. To apply for a postdoctoral position in the lab please send a CV and cover letter directly to Sean. The Rockefeller University has two graduate programs that may interest potential graduate students. We have a general graduate program (http://www.rockefeller.edu/graduate/) and a chemical biology program (http://www.triiprograms.org/tpcb/) both of which are dynamic world-class graduate programs.

problems-can-solve

What Problems Can You Solve?Employee ManagementEmployee TrainingEmployee RetentionEmployee TurnoverEmployee DevelopmentEmployee Skillset
Do you have this problem?
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics found that companies with fewer that 100 employees gave only 12 minutes of manager training every 6 months.  Organizations with 100-500 employees provided just 6 minutes.
Here is our solution:
We need to commit to investing more in training.  Bradley On Demand covers a wide array of content areas from the entry level employee to a variety of management level positions.
Do you have this problem?
Employees want more training! A longitudinal research project commissioned by Middlesex University found that from a 4,300 workers sample, 74% felt that they weren’t achieving their full potential at work due to a lack of development opportunities.
Here is our solution:
Bradley on Demand provides a systematic opportunity to learn the necessary skill sets and will provide a variety of Certification Programs to advance your professional development
Do you have this problem?
Employees are disengaged at work!  As many as 1 in 3 people leave their organization within the first year, either voluntarily or involuntarily.  And an astonishing 22% of staff turnover happens within the first 6 weeks of employment.  Additionally, a 2014 Gallup research uncovered that only 13% of employees are “Highly Engaged” and 26% are “Actively Disengaged”.
Here is our solution:
If this applies to your organization, its time to do something about it. Higher retention rates and less labor turnover is crucial for the success of your business.  Bradley on Demand is a unique way to show your employees that you are committed to them by investing in their success and professional development.
Do you have this problem?
Latest estimates show that the cost of losing an employee in the first year can be up to 3 times the person’s salary.  That’s a loss of over $100 Billion in the U.S. alone.  If broken down to a total loss to an individual organization from ineffective training:  It’s actually a staggering $13.5 Million per year, per 1000 employees.
Here is our solution:
What does this mean for you? It means that it is vital that you invest in your formal on-boarding process.  If you don’t there is good possibility that you will be contributing to the above figure through employee turnover.
Do you have this problem?
7 out of 10 respondents in a 2015 survey said that job-related training and development opportunities directly influence in their decision to stay within a company. 7 out of 10 respondents in a 2015 survey said that job-related training and development opportunities directly influence in their decision to stay within a company.
Here is our solution:
Invest in Bradley On Demand to provide a component of retaining your employees by expanding their knowledge of your industry, your organization, and offering more development options through our Certification Programs. After all, the cost of retaining present employees is much less than the cost of replacing them.
Do you have this problem?
Learning research revealed that only 12% of learners say that they apply the skills from the training that they receive on the job.  Additionally, from the manager’s perspective, according to a 2015 ATD research study, only 38% of managers and 62% of HR Managers believe that their learning programs meet their learner’s needs.  In other words, this suggests that learner needs are not being mapped effectively before developing a training program.
Here is our solution:
Bradley on Demand utilizes Learning Best Practices and integrates an applied approach to teaching the learner actual processes needed to function in their various positions.

The Real Dealer Synergy CEO
								
				
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VSno-4lbpo

This is a true story about Dealer Synergy's CEO, Sean V. Bradley.   Busted for counterfeiting money by the Secret Service, busted for dealing drugs in a NJ mall, and he became a snitch for the DEA for a NYC drug ring he was involved in before serving time in a federal prison.  According to his website, Dealer Synergy is "voted #1 by the nation's top dealers."  Is he a legit car guy who has been in the automotive business his whole life, or is he a professional drug dealing, counterfeiting, lying, tattletale con-man who would throw anyone under the bus to protect himself?  You be the judge!  http://www.dealersynergy.com  http://automotiveinternetsales.com http://www.internetsales20group.com  ~ Limelight (2011) available on Amazon, Netflix, and anywhere DVDs are sold.

Buyer Beware! This Company will Steal Your Money
								
				
Sean V. Bradley and Dealer Synergy will take tens of thousands of dollars of your dealerships money and give you nothing in return! They are scam artists! He will disrespect and belittle your employees. His team of hacks will screw up your CRM and it will take you forever to fix it. You will NOT get what you paid for and he will treat you like trash. Dealer Synergy is a SCAM!

Try some country music, pop music, relive the music from the 80s and much more. Whatever the musical preference, there s a karaoke party waiting for you. Records and turntables Still got a thing for vinyl? It s OK. We get that. Satisfy that old-school itch and shop for records in a variety of categories or choose a bundled collection from select popular artists, both old and new. Then spin those RPMs just like you used to because some things should never go out of style. If you should need a record player to go with that vinyl, you can combine old and new technologies with a turntable that includes: an AM/FM radioa cassette playera CD player USB and Bluetooth technology An added USB connection let s you convert vinyl to digital media or Bluetooth technology will let you stream music from other, more modern devices   all with precisely the style you're going for. Throw it back with a vintage record player look or grab a unit that mimics the turntables in a trendy club. Mobile music Of course, you can also take the more modern-day approach and listen to your music on any mobile device, including iPads and tablets. Save the storage space around your house or in your car and go digital. A 16-gigabyte device can hold roughly 3,500 songs. That s a lot of music to listen to   conveniently. And if you want to bump it up to 64 gigs, you re looking at 15,000 songs. Now that s an impressive music collection. Give the gift of music Music makes a fantastic gift any time of the year, so consider making a wish list of albums you'd love and encouraging your family and friends to do the same. Or, simply give them an electronic gift card. iTunes e-gifts are incredibly thoughtful and handy and come in a variety of denominations, from $10 to $100. These unique codes are provided via email and are perfect for anyone who likes apps, games, music, movies, television shows, books and more. They can be used in the App Store, or with iTunes, iBooks   even toward an Apple Music membership, if desired. Google Play gift codes also provide access to the latest entertainment   whether it s music, movies, TV, books, magazines, apps or games. Let that special someone enjoy their favorite songs, flicks and more on any sized screen across Android, iOS and the web. There s also a Microsoft Groove Music pass, which provides instant access to millions of songs. Your music, your way With so many options, it has never been easier to listen to your favorite music. And with Walmart's Every Day low prices, there's no reason not to expand your music library and add to your loved one s collection, too. Save Money.

If you see these words on the product page for your item, you have the additional option to pick the item up for free at your chosen Walmart location or receive it at your designated location for free as long as you spend $35 or more. If your purchase is less than $35, you can upgrade to free shipping for $5.99.On the left-hand side of all the pages on our website, you'll see a section that section labeled Shipping & Pickup. Beneath that, you'll find the option for 2-Day Shipping. Click the radio button next to 2-Day Shipping and the page will reload, displaying only items that are available for free two-day shipping. As long as you place your order by 2 p.m., you can expect delivery in two business days. This means that, if you order your item after 2 p.m. on a Friday, you won't receive it until the following Wednesday. However, if you order it on Tuesday before 2 p.m., you can expect to get it by the following Friday. Keep in mind that weekends and holidays don't count as business days for shipping. Also, be sure to note that the 2 p.m. cutoff time is relative to the time zone where we're shipping your item from, not the time zone from where you're ordering it.Other shipping optionsRemember that any item that's marked with 2-Day Shipping on its page is also eligible for free shipping on qualifying purchase amounts.

Again, this free shipping is only for purchases of $35 or more.
