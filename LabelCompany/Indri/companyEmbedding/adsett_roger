Prior to AstraZeneca, Mr. Adsett was a senior analyst at Accenture, from 1991 to 1994.  Mr. Adsett holds an M.B.A. from The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and a B.A. in English and Economics from Bucknell University. Insmed also announced the granting of an inducement award to Mr. Adsett pursuant to NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(c)(4). Mr. Adsett will receive an option to purchase shares of Insmed common stock equivalent to the value of $850,000 as material inducement to entering into employment with the company. The exact number of options will be determined using a Black-Scholes calculation based upon the closing price on the Nasdaq Global Select Market at the end of the day on the first business day of the month following his date of hire. The agreement governing this option award will be consistent with Insmed’s standard stock option inducement award agreement. The options have a 10-year term and will vest pursuant to Insmed’s standard four-year vesting schedule, with 25% of the shares subject to the option award vesting on the first anniversary of his commencement of employment and 12.5% of the shares subject to the option award vesting on each six-month anniversary date thereafter through the fourth anniversary of the date of grant, subject to Mr. Adsett’s continued employment by Insmed on each applicable vesting date. The inducement grants were approved by Insmed’s Compensation Committee on September 26, 2016. About Insmed Insmed Incorporated is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the unmet needs of patients with rare diseases. The company is advancing a global phase 3 clinical study of ARIKAYCE (liposomal amikacin for inhalation) in nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) lung disease, a rare and often chronic infection that is capable of causing irreversible lung damage and can be fatal. There are currently no products indicated for the treatment of NTM lung disease in the United States or European Union (EU). Insmed’s earlier-stage clinical pipeline includes INS1009, a nebulized prodrug formulation of treprostinil that the company believes may offer a differentiated product profile with therapeutic potential in rare pulmonary disorders such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), sarcoidosis, and severe refractory asthma. To complement its internal research, Insmed actively seeks in-licensing opportunities for a broad range of rare diseases.  For more information, visit www.insmed.com. “Insmed” and “ARIKAYCE” are the company's trademarks.

Roger Adsett, Shire





    Jun 01, 2008 

    By Pharmaceutical Executive Editors    
Pharmaceutical Executive





Roger Adsett


VP and General Manager, Gastroenterology, Shire
NOTED FOR: Strong leadership, building blockbuster brandsVISION: "Explain it so others internalize—not recite—it" 






 Roger Adsett 
Roger Adsett knows big brands. He cut his teeth at Astra Merck, heading up marketing for Nexium, then moved to England to serve as global brand director for AstraZenica's Symbicort. Now re-settled in the Northeast corridor, he's translating marketing savvy and global know-how to Shire's GI business—with good results. Last year's launch of Lialda sent business soaring, without cannibalizing Pentasa sales. Shire brands now serve more than a quarter of the oral mesalamine market. And with a co-promotion deal signed with TAP, Adsett will bring his blockbuster mindset to the realm of specialty sales.

Insmed appoints Roger Adsett as Chief Commercial Officer 




































































 Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Skip to secondary sidebarMain navigationInsmed appoints Roger Adsett as Chief Commercial Officer
Insmed has appointed Roger Adsett, a former global brand director for Symbicort, as its new Chief Commercial Officer in preparation for commercialization of Arikayce inhaled liposomal amikacin. Adsett also spent a portion of his time with AstraZeneca overseeing global marketing strategy for Rhinocort and Rhinocort Aqua. He was most recently Senior VP, Head of Gastrointestinal and Internal Medicine Business Unit at Shire. 
Arikayce is in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) lung disease. In June 2016, the company announced that it had withdrawn an MAA for Arkikayce that it had submitted to the EU in 2014, saying that it would resubmit the application once it had data from an ongoing Phase 3 trial.
Insmed President and CEO Will Lewis Commented, “Roger is a seasoned executive with a proven track record of success in bringing therapies to market. I am very pleased he will be joining Insmed as we look forward to the commercialization of Arikayce and additional products. Roger has extensive experience of ensuring optimal performance of marketed products and his global marketing expertise will be invaluable to our future as we prepare to become a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company.”
Adsett said, “I am thrilled to have the opportunity to join Insmed at such a promising time in the company’s history. I am looking forward to working with the talented team here to execute on the company’s global strategy, and to further its goal of meeting the unmet therapeutic needs of patients with NTM lung disease and other rare disorders.”

Insmed Inc.



09/27/2016 | Press release | Distributed by Public on 09/27/2016 06:12
Insmed Appoints Roger Adsett as Chief Commercial Officer








        BRIDGEWATER, N.J., Sept. 27, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Insmed Incorporated (Nasdaq:INSM), a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the unmet needs of patients with rare diseases, today announced the appointment of Roger Adsett as chief commercial officer. Mr. Adsett was most recently senior vice president, head of the gastrointestinal and internal medicine business unit at Shire plc. 


        As chief commercial officer and a member of Insmed's senior leadership team, Mr. Adsett will be charged with overseeing the development and execution of Insmed's global commercial strategy for ARIKAYCE™ (liposomal amikacin for inhalation), which is under development to treat patients with non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) lung infections. Mr. Adsett will be responsible for building and leading the commercial organization to ensure effective execution of brand development, product launches, and ongoing commercialization strategies, including sales and marketing. 
      

        'Roger is a seasoned executive with a proven track record of success in bringing therapies to market. I am very pleased he will be joining Insmed as we look forward to the commercialization of ARIKAYCE and additional products,' said Will Lewis, president and chief executive officer of Insmed.  'Roger has extensive experience of ensuring optimal performance of marketed products and his global marketing expertise will be invaluable to our future as we prepare to become a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company.'
      

        Commenting on his appointment, Mr. Adsett said, 'I am thrilled to have the opportunity to join Insmed at such a promising time in the company's history. I am looking forward to working with the talented team here to execute on the company's global strategy, and to further its goal of meeting the unmet therapeutic needs of patients with NTM lung disease and other rare disorders.'
      

        Prior to joining Insmed, Mr. Adsett held various leadership roles with Shire from 2005 to 2016. During his time as senior vice president of its gastrointestinal and internal medicine business unit, Mr. Adsett oversaw Shire's global commercial P&L across six specialty and two rare disease brands. Previously, he also served as Shire's gastrointestinal business unit leader, responsible for building the global leading mesalamine business. Before joining Shire, Mr. Adsett worked at AstraZeneca for 11 years, most recently serving as the global brand director for Symbicort®, a medicine for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Prior to AstraZeneca, Mr. Adsett was a senior analyst at Accenture, from 1991 to 1994.  Mr. Adsett holds an M.B.A. from The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and a B.A. in English and Economics from Bucknell University.
      

        Insmed also announced the granting of an inducement award to Mr. Adsett pursuant to NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(c)(4). Mr. Adsett will receive an option to purchase shares of Insmed common stock equivalent to the value of $850,000 as material inducement to entering into employment with the company. The exact number of options will be determined using a Black-Scholes calculation based upon the closing price on the Nasdaq Global Select Market at the end of the day on the first business day of the month following his date of hire. The agreement governing this option award will be consistent with Insmed's standard stock option inducement award agreement. The options have a 10-year term and will vest pursuant to Insmed's standard four-year vesting schedule, with 25% of the shares subject to the option award vesting on the first anniversary of his commencement of employment and 12.5% of the shares subject to the option award vesting on each six-month anniversary date thereafter through the fourth anniversary of the date of grant, subject to Mr. Adsett's continued employment by Insmed on each applicable vesting date. The inducement grants were approved by Insmed's Compensation Committee on September 26, 2016.
      

About Insmed


        Insmed Incorporated is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the unmet needs of patients with rare diseases. The company is advancing a global phase 3 clinical study of ARIKAYCE (liposomal amikacin for inhalation) in nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) lung disease, a rare and often chronic infection that is capable of causing irreversible lung damage and can be fatal. There are currently no products indicated for the treatment of NTM lung disease in the United States or European Union (EU). Insmed's earlier-stage clinical pipeline includes INS1009, a nebulized prodrug formulation of treprostinil that the company believes may offer a differentiated product profile with therapeutic potential in rare pulmonary disorders such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), sarcoidosis, and severe refractory asthma. To complement its internal research, Insmed actively seeks in-licensing opportunities for a broad range of rare diseases.  For more information, visit www.insmed.com.
