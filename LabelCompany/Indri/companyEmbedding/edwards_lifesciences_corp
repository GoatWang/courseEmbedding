Edwards Lifesciences (EW) Q2 Earnings: A Surprise in Store?


July 19, 2017, 09:16:00 AM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com









































Shutterstock photo


  Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW   is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 earnings on Jul 26, after market close. Last quarter, the company had posted a positive earnings surprise of 14.63%. It is worth noting that Edwards Lifesciences has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 7.21%. Let's take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.  Factors at Play    Edwards Lifesciences posted strong global sales in the last reported quarter, primarily buoyed by strength in Transcatheter Heart Valve(TAVR). Banking on continued therapy adoption across all geographies with notable strength in the U.S., the company is expected to maintain this bullish trend in the second quarter of 2017 as well.  In the TAVR space, Edwards Lifesciences reported highly encouraging European post-approval clinical trial results for its SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve in May 2017. The company also demonstrated successful results pertaining to its CENTERA valve for transcatheter aortic valve replacement procedures in the much awaited EuroPCR 2017 held in May.  Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS   Surprise         Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS   Surprise    |      Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Quote  We are also upbeat about the company's initiative of strategic investment in research and development and receipt of regulatory approvals for those products. Moving on, the latest breakthrough achieved in its TAVR segment is the FDA approval for its SAPIEN 3 valve in early Jun 2017. Bullish on the company's ongoing performance, management raised growth expectations to the high end of the projected full-year 2017 guidance for each segment. Moreover, we note that the company projected total sales between $810 million and $850 million and adjusted earnings per share of 82 cents to 92 cents for the second quarter. Apart from this, management completed the acquisition of Israel-based Valtech Cardio, a developer of Cardioband System for transcatheter repair of the mitral and tricuspid valves, toward the end of 2016. All these are expected to boost the top line in the quarter to be reported. On the flip side, tough competition in the cardiac devices market and reimbursement issues continues to challenge the company. We also believe that unfavorable foreign currency will affect the company's gross margin in to-be-reported quarter.  Earnings Whispers  Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Edwards Lifesciences this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive   Earnings ESP    and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.  Zacks ESP  : Edwards Lifesciences has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.41 You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter  .  Zacks Rank  : Edwards Lifesciences has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, an ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.  Stocks to Consider  Here are a few companies you may want to consider as our proven model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:   Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX  has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see   the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   . Align Technology, Inc. ALGN  has an Earnings ESP of +1.37% and a Zacks Rank #2. Stryker Corporation SYK  has an Earnings ESP of +0.66% and a Zacks Rank #2.  Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?    Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.    Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.

Mad Money with Jim Cramer

Cramer Remix: Snap is the No. 1 reason to own Facebook


 "Mad Money" host Jim Cramer shares his take on the unfortunate fate of Snap. Cramer also sits down with the CEO of Edwards Lifesciences, who spoke to his company's revolutionary medical devices. Then, he digs into one rallying biotechnology stock to see what could be next.

            Cramer Remix: Snap is the No. 1 reason to own Facebook   
			                        Wednesday, 19 Jul 2017 |  7:25  PM ET |  01:08 




When a caller asked Jim Cramer for his thoughts on the fate of Snap Inc., he did not hesitate to give the social media company a dooming prognosis.
"Snap is the No. 1 reason why you want to own Facebook, because we thought that Instagram would be challenged by Snap. It turns out that's not the case," the "Mad Money" host said.
On Tuesday, shares of Snap fell to less than half of the stock's all-time high as analyst downgrades mostly related to the company's ability to improve its advertising platform poured in.

Challenges from Facebook's Instagram continue to push shares lower, despite Snap's new roll-outs of a Maps feature and a daily news show with NBC.



Tuesday's Deals: Companies on the Defense?

The call came after Cramer reviewed Tuesday's news of two separate deals: a potential merger between Discovery and Scripps Networks Interactive and spice company McCormick buying Reckitt Benckiser's food division.
"While the potential Discovery-Scripps deal, at about $10 billion is more than twice the size of the $4.2 billion food transaction ... these are happening for similar reasons. Companies, afraid of losing their relevance and their clout, are merging with their peers or rivals in order to produce stronger entities with more appeal to their masters, meaning their distributors and their ultimate customers," Cramer said.
To understand why these two deals are so similar, Cramer compared the companies' distribution methods: Just like you walk through aisles of a supermarket to find products, you scroll through cable offerings to find things to watch.



Rekindling Investors' Interest

Despite various investing outlets inciting fear in the stock market about "single-stock risk," Cramer has seen average investors coming out of the woodwork to buy strong individual stocks.
"I know there are tons of statistics showing an almost inexorable decline in interest in the stock market as a whole," the "Mad Money" host said. "But there's something afoot right now, right now after nine straight sessions where the Nasdaq has rallied a total of 4.7 percent."
Lately, more people have been approaching Cramer not just for photos, but for conversations about his view on the market and on specific stocks he has recommended — a good sign, he said.



Boring, Un-Sexy, Dull... And a Buy?

Investors may worry about what is causing the stock market's monster rally, but Cramer insists that it is all about boring stocks like financial technology player Equifax.
Shares of Equifax, one of the country's three biggest credit reporting agencies, have been on fire, rallying almost 20 percent in 2017 and far outpacing the S&P 500 index over the last five years.
How? Equifax makes money from the fees it collects from banks for checking customers' credit scores, selling software to help banks do that, providing workforce solutions for companies' human resources departments, and selling subscription-based credit monitoring and identity theft protection to individual consumers.
The company also uses data and analytics technologies to provide unique insights on over 820 million consumers and over 91 million businesses around the world.



Edwards Lifesciences CEO: Surgical Evolution

Michael Mussallem, Edwards Lifesciences


Then, Cramer sat down with Mike Mussallem, the chairman and CEO of Edwards Lifesciences, to hear more about how the medical device company is continuing to grow.
"There's been a great evolution in technology, and surgery is still very important. And certain patients, really, their life depends on surgery. But this idea came about now almost 20 years ago and the first implant done almost 10 years ago, and it's really revolutionized the treatment for these patients," Mussallem told Cramer on Tuesday.
The stock of Edwards has run up 24 percent so far in 2017, so Cramer dug deeper to find out how Mussallem thought the company, which specialized in artificial heart valves, should best be valued.
"The way you want to think about it is the total cost of the procedure," the CEO said. "It's not very often where we have these incredible technologies where you get better outcomes, right, better mortality, less strokes, you get improved quality of life for these patients, which is a big deal, and you have better economics. This is one of those triple wins."



Portola Pharmaceuticals: Takeover Potential

Having skyrocketed 190 percent so far this year, Portola Pharmaceuticals' stock seems to have regained its strength after Jim Cramer dubbed the biotech a disaster just over a year ago.
After Wall Street fell out of love with biotech stocks as a whole several years ago, the stock fell from the $50s to the teens in late 2015. But since the FDA recently granted its leading drug regulatory approval, the stock has been on fire, climbing to nearly $65 as of Tuesday.
"I don't think it's crazy to speculate about a potential takeover here," the "Mad Money" host said. "If you're looking to speculate on a relatively young biotech, you have got my blessing here, although ideally I think you should wait for the next market-wide pullback to give you a better entry point. Oh, and given the dearth of new drugs being created by the big pharmaceutical industry companies, I do believe that if Portola has a huge amount of success, it will garner the attention of the big dogs."
And even if you are not one for speculation, FDA approval is a game-changer for Portola, as it will give the company more solid footing in a market still wary of development-stage biotechs, Cramer said.



Lightning Round: I Want More From This Pharma Name

In Cramer's lightning round, he sped through his take on some callers' favorite stocks, including:
Pfizer: "You know, it's fine. No one ever got hurt buying Pfizer. I'd like to see some new products out of there or a big acquisition or maybe the split-up that they've been talking about, but it's not going to run away from you, believe me."
Forterra: "Yeah, it's a pipe company, and the problem with a pipe company is if you go back over the CSX presentation this morning, they said pipe sales, their actual cargo, are way down. I don't want to be involved with that. Too much pipe involved with infrastructure. Let's see what Nucor says when they report to see if there's hope for infrastructure. I'm not clear."
Disclosure: CNBC parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Snap.

Our history
Edwards Lifesciences’ roots date to 1958, when Miles “Lowell” Edwards set out to build the first artificial heart.

His fascination with healing the heart was sparked in his teens, when he suffered two bouts of rheumatic fever, which can scar heart valves and eventually cause the heart to fail.

                Edwards Lifesciences Corp: A Tick Above (EW)            


    By Kristina Zucchi, CFA | March 24, 2016 — 4:36 PM EDT    






Share





















































Heart disease is not only the number one killer in America, but cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the world. And that’s why the highest amount of healthcare spending in almost every country is for cardiovascular disease. There are a range of products and therapies that are used in the treatments of these diseases, paving the way for a broad contingency of companies to operate in this space. One such company is Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW), a $18.7 billion Californian healthcare company that develops technologies focused on structural heart disease. “A pioneer in the development and commercialization of heart valve therapies, we are the world's leading manufacturer of heart valve systems and repair products used to replace or repair a patient's diseased or defective heart valve,” states the company in its annual report. 
Beginning in 1958, Edwards Lifesciences Corp started working on artificial heart components, and the first successful mitral valve replacement used an Edwards Lifesciences Corp valve in 1960. Continuing its technological advancements on the valve, vascular and monitoring systems products, Edwards Lifesciences Corp consistently strived to incorporate new technologies and be the first to market with innovative products. The company was spun-off from Baxter Corporation in 2000 and started trading as EW at that time. 
Business Operations
Edwards Lifesciences Corp operates in three business units: Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy, Surgical Heart Valve Therapy and Critical Care. The majority of sales are made directly through the company's sales force both in the United States and abroad. Internationally, the company also uses independent distributors. Sales in the United States made up about 51% of total sales in 2015 while international sales made up the remainder, broken down by major markets as follows: Europe 29%, Japan 10% and rest of world 11%.

Source: EW 2015 10K
Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy leverages the company’s Surgical Heart Valve knowledge and experience to design non-surgical replacement heart valves. These products are sold in more than 65 countries and are most known for the SAPIEN brand. The growth in these products was 25% in 2015 following a 33% growth year in 2014, the fastest growing unit for the company, comprising 46%, 41%, 35% and 29% of net sales in 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012 respectively.
Surgical Heart Valve Therapy, the lifeblood of the company since its inception, is the surgical tissue heart valve product line, known for its Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT pericardial valve and the line of PERIMOUNT Magna Ease valves. Sales of this unit accounted for approximately 36%, 31%, 34% and 36% of net sales in 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012 respectively. Following a 3% growth year in 2014, Edwards Lifesciences Corp experienced a negative 5% growth in 2015 primarily impacted by negative foreign currency translation which was in part offset by higher sales.
Critical Care provides products that monitor heart function in surgical and intensive care settings. These products play an important role in enhancing surgical recovery by enabling appropriate tissue and organ perfusion, and ultimately patient outcomes and survival. These hemodynamic monitoring technologies are used before, during and after surgeries. Sales represented approximately 21%, 15%, 17% and 19% of net sales in 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Similar to Surgical Heart Valve Therapy unit sales, Critical Care revenues were also impacted by foreign currency translations in 2015, resulting in a growth of negative 4.5% after growing 3% in 2014.
The company defines success by the development of innovative therapies. In 2015, Edwards Lifesciences Corp invested 15.4% of net sales in research and development to focus on innovation and create a robust product pipeline of new technologies to spur future growth.

Competition
This industry is highly competitive and dependent on the latest breakthrough technologies. Similar to technology products, Edwards Lifesciences Corp products could be “rendered obsolete or uneconomical as a result of technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies, including drug therapies,” according to the company. Impacting the competitiveness are exogenous factors such as regulatory reform, industry and customer consolidation, and evolving patient needs.
Specific competitors for its products include Medtronic PLC (MDT), St. Jude Medical Inc (STJ) and Sorin Group in the Surgical and Transcatheter Heart Valve units. In Critical Care, competitors are more dispersed but include ICU Medical Inc (ICUI), PULSION Medical Systems SE (PUS.ME), a subsidiary of Getinge AB, and LiDCO Group PLC (LDRUF).
Valuation
The company currently trades at a much higher multiple than its peers St. Jude Medical Inc and ICU Medical Inc, but below Medtronic PLC. Its trailing price to earnings (P/E) is 38.9x with a price-to-earnings to growth (PEG) of 2.3x. Its forward P/E is 28.6x and its book value per share is 11.6 based on data from Yahoo! Finance.
The Bottom Line
The industry in which Edwards Lifesciences Corp competes is increasingly moving towards technologies that are less invasive, requiring shorter recovery time with higher quality outcomes. It is a competitive industry that necessitates more and more research dollars spent to develop the latest technologically improved products and procedures. The company is trading higher than its peers St. Jude Medical and ICU Medical Inc, and below the med-tech giant Medtronic PLC, a premium that Edwards Lifesciences Corp warrants due to “the potential upside with Mitral, strong US TAVR market growth potential, and potential value in the company's next generation TAVI valve pipeline” according to Bank of America research.
