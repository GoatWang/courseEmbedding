Internet Infrastructure | Columbia Capital
















































 
















LIMITED PARTNER ACCESS»









Columbia believes we are in a 10+ year “bull market” for bandwidth demand driven by a number of factors, including the growth of wireless data and cloud computing.  Accordingly, we are actively looking for companies and assets that are enablers to this growth trend, such as unique fiber networks, support infrastructure, and differentiated data center and interconnection facilities.   Important criteria for us when evaluating businesses in this sector typically include highly specific considerations of the underlying physical assets, which lead to the degree of economic moat.
…Internet Infrastructure requires very detailed operational reporting, a high degree of transparency, and a clear comprehension of the link between incremental capital deployment and value creation.
Like many capital intensive business models, Internet Infrastructure requires very detailed operational reporting, a high degree of transparency, and a clear comprehension of the link between incremental capital deployment and value creation.  We have invested in businesses that meet these criteria across a variety of geographies and through a number of different stages of capital formation and remain highly motivated to pursue new opportunities.

“Columbia Capital has been much more than just our lead investor, they have been my partner every step of the way – from helping pull together the original thesis, to seeding the Company, to assisting us with acquisitions. A result of their long tenure in the communications space is that they know our sectors cold, which has helped us in so many ways over the years. It is a real pleasure working day in and day out with investors who share the same values and who are striving for the same result – working with people who you like and respect to build great businesses and create shareholder value.”
