You'll walk in and be greeted  - and even if you have to wait a minute because they're busy giving awesome service to other customers in the lobby (which is always nice and cool - I've been there several times) there's some posh black leather sofa's to sit on...you'll fall right in.You can be assured they're going to take care of your mobile device (trust me, I've been assured - and reassured - and in the end; my results couldn't have been better) - and they guarantee their repairs for a year......if by some reason there is a problem; put your concerns on the manager, Chris - who will take care of your issue...and make sure that its resolved.I brought my LG-P999 - I had a problem with a cracked screen. In the end - my screen was replaced with a part directly from LG (OEM Part - Original Equipment Manufacturer) - and the screen works as good as it did the day that it came out of the box.I recently bought a Samsung GalaxyS Blaze 4G - but since my phone is repaired - I'm back to my LG...If I have any problems in the future with my devices and they can do the repair - this place will be the one and only stop.I made a comment on how good the service was with the girls; and I'm not going to say that Chris is as sweet as a pecan pie (maybe as sweet as a lemon {hehe}) the service he provided was outstanding and his managerial skills came through like a bolt of lightening. Any business that uses him should be greatful - in the end I know that I was.Good job Dr. Phonez - and keep it up!Shahbaz Yazdani MDbeto.garza79 ratedDr. Yazdani is simply a brilliant physician. It impresses me just how precise his diagnostic always is. Sure, everybody can think twice before going with him because he doesn't accept insurance, but this is a minimal fee when you value your money, time, and most of all, your health.He pulled me out of a severe sinus infection in just one visit and with only one treatment. An issue that couldn't be solved by a primary doctor and a renowned specialist in 5 and 3 visits, respectively during the course of more than 3 months. Absurd.Going with Dr. Yazdani is a walk through the park. He's punctual, super smart, and very friendly, as well as his staff.If you're lucky enough to live in San Antonio and are having health problems, just pay a visit to Dr. Yazdani. I'm sure he will be the best doctor you'll ever meet.Thanks, Dr. Sprint StoreLord R. rated  have been a customer with Sprint for years but have been looking around for another carrier since Sprint refused to grandfather my 5G hotspot in order to keep it unlimited. On April 25, 2014, I went to this location with an attitude. When I arrived, I noticed Verizon was nearby where I was planning to go if I did not get satisfaction at Sprint. To my surprise, I received the best customer service  ever from Lead Ruston Scott. Sprint needs to employ more experienced salespersons like Ruston Scott. With his expertise, I was able to upgrade to a new phone, losing my 5GB hotspot, however Ruston was able to get me a free hotspot device which will give me the option to make my monthly bill lower. Sorry Verizon but Ruston saved me a walk to your store, a couple of doors downStone Oak Urgent Caremonicaellis ratedThe physician and his staff are probably the nicest people I have ever met at a medical facility. I had fevers, temperature, night sweats, and failure to thrive for a while and luckily the doctor ran some blood work and diagnosed me with a curable form of leukemia. I am grateful to Stone Oak Urgent Care & Family Practice for saving my life and will continue to see him as my PCP and will recommend anybody to go here as you will not find a more nice and intelligent physician out there as this guy has an MBA and PhD in addition to his medical degree. Also, the new location on Stone Oak Blvd is brand new and amazingly beautiful, which is an added bonus to the great physician. Thank you Stone Oak Urgent Care & Family Practice!!!!!!!!!!! Doctor PhonezCavett M. ratedThis happened at the 410 & San Pedro location.I took my phone on Saturday and it was "fixed" within a couple of hours--no problem. I had a broken headphone jack on my iPhone and they replaced the piece. Then that night my phone wouldn't charge and died. Apparently that piece they "fixed" is connected to the charging port. Took it back the next day and had major attitude from the front desk associate, Lauren. Took 4 hours to fix the problem this time. When I came to pick up my phone Lauren was horrible at customer service again. Not someone I would want working at the front counter of my business. Ultimately, it was fixed, but wasted 4 hours on a Sunday w/ bad customer service to get there. Won't go back to that location again.Stone Oak Family PracticeMelly R. ratedI've been going to this doctor for 6 or 7 years and the office staff have always handled my calls, questions, messages and the like with professionalism and ease. I get calls back same day or next. And I love that he's added an assistant to his practice. If he can't see me, she can. Wait time varies; I've waited 5 minutes, I've waited 40 minutes. But I know that sometimes I'm the one making others wait due to my issues, so I try to be patient while others see him. I've heard the office staff handling difficult patients before and I can say I've never heard them be rude or careless with their words. I give the whole office and Doctor Ramirez 5 stars across the board.Stone Oak Family Doctors PAjhujikol ratedNothing but wonderful experiences for me.. I think my review should be weighted because I've been using to this practice for me and my family for many years - for everything from annual checkups to emergencies such as mystery rashes, flu-like symptoms, etc... I really appreciate the time Doctors take with us. I also appreciate that we can be seen as walk-ins when it's an emergency.  I'm wondering if many of the bad reviewers are just angry people or... seriously... I thought they were talking about some other place entirely. My advice - establish a relationship with a family doctor in this practice. Stone Oak Family Practiceheathernw18 ratedDr. Ramirez is not only the ni...Dr. Ramirez is not only the nicest Dr. I had ever seen but probably the nicest person I have ever met. He easily spent 20+ minutes with me. Very caring gentleman. When I went in he first told me about himself, his family and how long he has been practicing. At the end of the visit he told me that he doesn't have an answering service because he gives out his personal cell phone number to all his patients. That is something I have never heard a Dr. do. I felt so comfortable in his office. His office staff is amazing as well. I highly recommend Dr. Ramirez.Stone Oak Urgent Caretiffineywilliams ratedLook no further for great care with smile! My family has been coming to see Dr.Gogu now for almost 4yrs now. We've been to several Texas Med Clinic's and none of them compared to the level of kindness, service, and care that we always receive going to Stone Oak Urgent Care. I love the fact that they have late hours and opened on Saturday/Sunday without having to wait a crazy amount of time. Dr. Gogu is very personable, soft spoken, patient and good with children. They don't try to nickle and dime your insurance by forcing unnecessary office visits. Sprint StoreA. B. ratedMy husband, son, and I went to store to upgrade our phones.  Dezirae was very knowledgeable and thorough in explaining our options.  Maria, the manager, and Dezirae make an outstanding duo!  Immediately recommended that our 2 daughters go here to upgrade their phones.  We left as very happy Sprint customers.Did You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.
