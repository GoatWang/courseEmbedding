Fitch to Rate CD 2016-CD2 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates; Presale Issued | Business Wire


























































      Fitch to Rate CD 2016-CD2 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates; 
      Presale Issued
    





November 15, 2016 11:07 AM Eastern Standard Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: CD 2016-CD2 Commercial Mortgage Trust (US 
      CMBS)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/890447


      Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on German American Capital 
      Corp.'s CD 2016-CD2 mortgage trust commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates, series 2016-CD2.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$17,465,263 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$69,061,053 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$34,742,105 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$252,631,579 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$308,873,684 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$721,789,474b class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$39,015,789 class A-M 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$721,789,474c class V1-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$76,811,579ab class X-B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$76,811,579 class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$76,811,579c class V1-B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$42,673,684ab class X-C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$42,673,684 class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$42,673,684c class V1-C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$57,304,211ab class X-D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$57,304,211a class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$57,304,211c class V1-D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$28,043,158ab class X-E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$28,043,158a class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$10,972,632ab class X-F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$10,972,632a class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (a) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      (b) Notional amount and interest only.
    

      (c) Exchangeable certificates
    

      Expected ratings do not reflect final ratings and are based on 
      information provided by the issuer as of Nov. 11, 2016. A vertical 
      credit risk retention interest representing 5% of each class (as of the 
      closing date) is expected to be retained as part of risk retention 
      compliance. Fitch does not expect to rate the $37,797,120 class X-G, the 
      $37,797,120 class G, the $76,812,910 class V1-E or the $975,391,857 
      class V2.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 30 loans secured by 37 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $975.4 
      million as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by German American Capital Corporation and Citigroup Global Markets 
      Realty Corp.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 91.1% of the properties by balance and 
      cash flow analysis of 92.4% of the pool.
    

      The transaction has a Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
      of 1.19x, a Fitch stressed loan-to-value (LTV) of 105.8%, and a Fitch 
      debt yield of 8.49%. Fitch's aggregate net cash flow represents a 
      variance of 12.4% to issuer cash flows.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Fitch Leverage: The pool has leverage statistics in-line with recent 
      Fitch-rated multiborrower transactions. The pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV 
      for the trust are 1.19x and 105.8%, respectively, while the 2016 YTD 
      averages are 1.20x and 105.7%. Excluding credit-opinion loans, the 
      pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.17x and 110.7%, respectively.
    

      Concentrated by Loan Size: The top 10 loans compose 66.9% of the pool, 
      which is worse than the 2015 and 2016 YTD averages of 49.3% and 54.5%, 
      respectively. The pool's loan concentration index (LCI) is 563, which is 
      above the 2016 YTD average of 418. For this transaction, the losses 
      estimated by Fitch's deterministic test at 'AAAsf' exceeded Fitch's base 
      model loss estimate. Due to the exceptionally high property quality 
      (84.7% of the top 10 loans received a property quality grade of 'B+' or 
      higher) and strong location (65.5% of the top 10 are located within the 
      New York Metro market), Fitch's concluded loss estimate at 'AAAsf' is 
      100 basis points lower than indicated by Fitch's deterministic test.
    

      Investment-Grade Credit-Opinion Loans: Two loans representing 11% of the 
      pool have investment-grade credit opinions, above the 2016 YTD average 
      of 7.3%. 10 Hudson Yards (6.9% of the pool) received an investment-grade 
      credit opinion of 'BBBsf*' on a stand-alone basis. 667 Madison Avenue 
      (4.1% of the pool) received an investment-grade credit opinion of 
      'BBB-sf*' on a stand-alone basis.
    

      Weak Amortization: Eleven loans (58.2%) are full-term interest-only and 
      seven loans (25.9%) are partial interest-only. Fitch-rated transactions 
      in 2016 YTD had an average full-term interest-only percentage of 32.4% 
      and a partial interest-only percentage of 36%. Based on the scheduled 
      balance at maturity, the pool will pay down by only 5.5%, which is 
      significantly below the 2016 YTD average of 10.4%.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 8.5% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI); for properties for which 
      a full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to CD 2016-CD2 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivities to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'AAsf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'Asf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 12.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Fitch was provided with due diligence information from Ernst & Young 
      LLP. The due diligence focused on a comparison and re-computation of 
      certain characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. 
      Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the findings did 
      not have an impact on our analysis.
    

      REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS
    

      A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and 
      enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering 
      document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by 
      accessing the appendix referenced under 'Related Research' below. The 
      appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es to those Fitch 
      considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report 
      titled 'Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions,' dated May 31, 2016.'

      Copyright © 2016 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its 
      subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 
      1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or 
      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning 
      of the Corporations Act 2001.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch Assigns Final Ratings to CD 2016-CD2 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates
Tweet


Print



      Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to 
      the German American Capital Corp.'s CD 2016-CD2 mortgage trust 
      commercial mortgage pass-through certificates, series 2016-CD2:
    

      --$17,465,263 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$69,061,053 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$34,742,105 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$252,631,579 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$308,873,684 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$721,789,474b class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$39,015,789 class A-M 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$721,789,474c class V1-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$76,811,579ab class X-B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$76,811,579 class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$76,811,579c class V1-B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$42,673,684 class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$42,673,684c class V1-C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$57,304,211ab class X-D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$57,304,211a class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$57,304,211ac class V1-D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$28,043,158ab class X-E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$28,043,158a class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$10,972,632ab class X-F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$10,972,632a class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (a) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      (b) Notional amount and interest only.
    

      (c) Exchangeable certificates.
    

      A vertical credit risk retention interest representing 5% of each class 
      (as of the closing date) is retained as part of risk retention 
      compliance. Fitch does not rate the $37,797,120 class X-G, the 
      $37,797,120 class G, the $76,812,910 class V1-E or the $975,391,857 
      class V2.
    

      Fitch has withdrawn the expected rating on the interest-only class X-C 
      certificates as they are no longer being offered.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 30 loans secured by 37 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $975.4 
      million as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by German American Capital Corporation and Citigroup Global Markets 
      Realty Corp.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 91.1% of the properties by balance and 
      cash flow analysis of 92.4% of the pool.
    

      The transaction has a Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
      of 1.19x, a Fitch stressed loan-to-value (LTV) of 105.8%, and a Fitch 
      debt yield of 8.49%. Fitch's aggregate net cash flow represents a 
      variance of 12.4% to issuer cash flows.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Fitch Leverage: The pool has leverage statistics in-line with recent 
      Fitch-rated multiborrower transactions. The pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV 
      for the trust are 1.19x and 105.8%, respectively, while the 2016 YTD 
      averages are 1.20x and 105.7%. Excluding credit-opinion loans, the 
      pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.17x and 110.7%, respectively.
    

      Concentrated by Loan Size: The top 10 loans compose 66.9% of the pool, 
      which is worse than the respective 2015 and 2016 YTD averages of 49.3% 
      and 54.5%. The pool's loan concentration index (LCI) is 563, which is 
      above the 2016 YTD average of 418. For this transaction, the losses 
      estimated by Fitch's deterministic test at 'AAAsf' exceeded Fitch's base 
      model loss estimate. Due to the exceptionally high property quality 
      (84.7% of the top 10 loans received a property quality grade of 'B+' or 
      higher) and strong location (65.5% of the top 10 are located within the 
      New York Metro market), Fitch's concluded loss estimate at 'AAAsf' is 
      100 basis points lower than indicated by Fitch's deterministic test.
    

      Investment-Grade Credit-Opinion Loans: Two loans representing 11% of the 
      pool have investment-grade credit opinions, above the 2016 YTD average 
      of 7.3%. 10 Hudson Yards (6.9% of the pool) received an investment-grade 
      credit opinion of 'BBBsf*' on a stand-alone basis. 667 Madison Avenue 
      (4.1% of the pool) received an investment-grade credit opinion of 
      'BBB-sf*' on a stand-alone basis.
    

      Weak Amortization: Eleven loans (58.2%) are full-term interest-only and 
      seven loans (25.9%) are partial interest-only. Fitch-rated transactions 
      in 2016 YTD had an average full-term interest-only percentage of 32.4% 
      and a partial interest-only percentage of 36%. Based on the scheduled 
      balance at maturity, the pool will pay down by only 5.5%, which is 
      significantly below the 2016 YTD average of 10.4%.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 8.5% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to CD 2016-CD2 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivities to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'AAsf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'Asf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 12.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Fitch was provided with due diligence information from Ernst & Young 
      LLP. The due diligence focused on a comparison and re-computation of 
      certain characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. 
      Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the findings did

      Copyright © 2016 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its 
      subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 
      1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or 
      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third-party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning 
      of the Corporations Act 2001.
