  About  



SERVING THE INDUSTRY OVER SIXTY FIVE YEARSKerr Engineered Sales Company is known for over 65 years of knowledge and expertise in natural gas, pipeline, industrial, water and power industries. From stopple or pig orders to complex, fully integrated systems, Kerr delivers depth and level of service that cannot be beat. Cost savings and efficiency are the goals for every project.“The Kerr staff knows the industry better than our own employees.” is often said by the companies represented.  Our hands-on approach and extensive product application knowledge is trusted to provide solutions and ensure the job is done. Efficient, safe systems that avoid factory shutdowns and costly mechanical failures across multiple industries is what Kerr has been providing since 1952.







History 1952 - 2017A. J. Kerr Sr. (Art) founded Kerr Engineered Sales Company in 1952 after a twenty eight year career in sales and marketing to the oil, gas and water industries including Vice President of Sales for Rockwell Manufacturing Company. He uncovered a need for technical sales and solutions for manufacturers expanding to the northeast. Art and son Jack (A.J. Kerr, Jr.) formed the company to meet this need initially for two manufacturers, T. D. Williamson, Inc. and Peerless Mfg. Co. who continue to partner with Kerr 65 years later.David and Thomas, Jack’s sons have been running the company since 1997. Together with the team of application specialists and inside sales, they continue the tradition of high touch service and technical expertise while adapting to the constant changes in the industries.
