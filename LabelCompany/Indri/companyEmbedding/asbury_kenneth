Kenneth Asbury









President and Chief Executive Officer
Kenneth Asbury is President and Chief Executive Officer of CACI International Inc.
A proven industry leader, Mr. Asbury has extensive experience in business development, including 30 years leading highly successful systems, solutions, and services expansion programs at all levels. 
At CACI, Mr. Asbury has made business development his top priority, resulting in consistently strong contract awards and a vigorous focus on strategic campaigns to capture large and complex projects. He  implemented a three-part growth strategy: win new business, drive operational excellence, and continue CACI's successful mergers and acquisitions program as the first priority for capital deployment. His achievements include leading CACI's acquisition of Six3 Systems Inc., the largest acquisition in the company's history. The acquisition brought CACI highly specialized and differentiated strategic solutions, services, and products for the country's most sensitive national security missions in cyberspace, C4ISR, and precision geolocation capabilities that CACI now offers across its customer base. 
Under his leadership, CACI has been named one of Fortune magazine's "World's Most Admired Companies" both in the IT sector and in Virginia, where CACI is headquartered. The award affirms the company's reputation as an IT innovator that attracts talented professionals for its customers' most challenging missions.  
Mr. Asbury is a champion of hiring veterans and veterans with disabilities, recognizing they have the talent, character, and dedication to deliver exceptional support for the national missions CACI serves. With programs across the full spectrum of recruiting, hiring, and mentoring veterans, as well as philanthropic assistance to veterans and their families, CACI under Mr. Asbury's guidance is a national leader in this area.
In his support for the outstanding reputation of CACI and its people, Mr. Asbury continues to foster a workplace of mutual respect, honesty, and integrity. He exemplifies the company's long-standing cultural commitment to good character and acting ethically, and demonstrates this in a leadership style that promotes employee engagement and open communication.  
Mr. Asbury joined CACI from Arctic Slope Regional Corporation - Federal, where he was President and CEO overseeing an almost 100 percent increase in program win rate in one year. Prior to this, Mr. Asbury built a track record of superior enterprise growth and customer value at Lockheed Martin, where he led one business unit to more than $6 billion in new contract wins and $3.7 billion in sales, and achieved a 75 percent new business win rate and double-digit sales in another.
Mr. Asbury served in the U.S. Army Security Agency as a translator/interpreter. He is a graduate of the University of Oklahoma.
