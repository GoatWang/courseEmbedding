Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/25/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    AMD earnings: How did we get here?
                                                


                                                    MarketWatch – 
                                                    2:12 PM ET 07/25/2017
                                                


Potential for GPUs and new PC and server chips has pushed previously derided AMD to big gains. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) has long struggled as the neglected and largely derided step-sibling of Intel Corp., but the stock has exploded in the past year or so even as revenue has remained below record levels accomplished when shares traded for less than $5.. AMD started moving higher not long after Nvidia Corp. began its own massive ascent, which is a big clue.

Losing isn't really an option for Intel Corp. But winning may also be hard to come by, at least for a while. Intel (INTC) remains the world's largest chip maker by revenue, with more than $60 billion in sales expected for this year. And it maintains near total dominance in two key markets--personal computers and servers.

Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.
