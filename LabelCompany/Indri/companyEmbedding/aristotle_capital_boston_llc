Global Equity


The Global Equity strategy predominantly focuses on high-quality businesses domiciled in developed countries around the world and allows for a limited allocation (typically less than 10%) to emerging markets. Securities have a minimum market capitalization of $2 billion at initial investment. The portfolio represents a diversified set of high-conviction holdings (typically 40–55) that we believe are trading at a discount to fair value and possess catalysts to unlock that value within our three- to five-year investment horizon. The strategy invests in common stocks, both American Depository Receipts (ADRs) and Ordinary Shares (ORDs).
The objective of the strategy is to optimize long-term performance versus the MSCI World Index with a focus on mitigating risk over a multi-year time period.

Investment Criteria


Aristotle Capital’s experienced investment team spends the majority of its time studying businesses. We employ a bottom-up, fundamental approach to security selection that requires in-depth research of individual companies and their competitors, suppliers and customers. We concentrate on the factors within management’s control rather than macroeconomic factors, economic cycles or market sentiment.
Our disciplined investment process focuses on identification of the following investment criteria, all three of which are required for investment in any of our portfolios:

High or improving quality—aids in managing downside risk
Attractive valuation—provides a margin of safety
Business-specific catalysts—help us to avoid the “value trap,” which occurs when cheap companies continue to get cheaper

LOS ANGELES & BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aristotle, which manages more than $14 billion* in assets, today 
      announces that Aristotle Capital Boston, LLC (Aristotle Boston) was 
      named the 2017 Small- to Mid-Cap Equity Manager of the Year by Financial 
      Investment News Emerging Manager Monthly.
    


      Financial Investment News is one of the industry’s leading providers of 
      information, news and data to sales, marketing and client service 
      professionals working in U.S. institutional asset management. The award 
      categories are domestic all-cap, large-cap, mid-cap, small- to mid-cap 
      and small-cap equity; international equity and domestic fixed income. To 
      be eligible for the awards, managers must have submitted 2016 year-end 
      data to Informa PSN by January 27, 2017, have less than $2 billion in 
      assets under management, at least $10 million in product assets and have 
      2016 full-year performance figures as well as 2015 year-end product 
      asset information. Across all categories, 308 products were considered 
      for the awards. The three finalists in each group were selected using a 
      quantitative screening process, and the seven winners, one for each 
      category, of the 11th Annual Emerging Manager Monthly Awards 
      were selected by a highly respected pool of industry experts.
    

      The Aristotle Boston team has been part of the Aristotle family of 
      affiliates since late 2014 and is led by Dave Adams, CFA and Jack 
      McPherson, CFA, who have worked together since 2006. Each portfolio 
      manager has more than 27 years of industry experience. The Boston-based 
      team manages Small Cap and Small/Mid Cap equity strategies, which totals 
      approximately $1.7 billion in assets under management as of March 31, 
      2017. Aristotle Boston is focused on value-added strategies. It 
      constructs portfolios with diversified companies that it believes are of 
      high quality and purchased at discount to their intrinsic values.
    

      “We are honored to be recognized for pursuing our passion, which is 
      investing in small and mid-cap companies,” said Dave Adams. “Aristotle’s 
      well-crafted platform allows us to concentrate on in-depth company 
      research, which we pair with a long-term investment horizon, so we can 
      develop a quality-oriented portfolio in an effort to deliver alpha to 
      our clients.”
    

      The Emerging Manager Monthly award can be found here.
