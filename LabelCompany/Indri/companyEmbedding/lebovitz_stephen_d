Stephen D. Lebovitz Nominated for ICSC Chairmanship

                              Stephen D. Lebovitz Nominated for ICSC Chairmanship
New York, January 22, 2015 – The International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC) announced today that Stephen D. Lebovitz, president and CEO of CBL & Associates Properties, Inc., has been selected by ICSC’s Board of Trustees nominating committee to serve as the association’s chairman for the 2015–2016 term.  If, as expected, Lebovitz is elected at ICSC’s annual meeting of members in May during RECon, he will succeed Robert F. Welanetz, global retail real estate advisor for Blackstone Real Estate Partners, and become the association’s 56th chairman.
Lebovitz, along with his father Charles who served as CEO until 2010, and two brothers — Alan, the firm’s senior vice president for asset management; and Michael, who is executive vice president for development and administration — have overseen the dramatic growth of CBL since it went public in 1993. Today the firm boasts a $10 billion market capitalization and some $4 billion in equity value, about 80 malls or large open-air centers, and an additional 50 smaller community, power and open-air centers.
“Under Stephen’s skillful leadership, we have watched CBL grow and prosper, even during some very challenging economic times,” said Michael P. Kercheval, ICSC’s president and CEO. “ICSC has similarly benefited from his insights and extraordinary energy. I can’t think of anyone more suited to leading our organization in the coming year.”

Even before Lebovitz joined CBL, he cultivated an early enthusiasm for the industry, working summer jobs during his years at Stanford University at such companies as JMB Realty Corp., Trammel Crow Co., and — between college and Harvard Business School — Goldman Sachs. “I had this magnetic attraction to real estate,” he said, noting that he has also taught college courses on the subject.

Lebovitz has been active in ICSC since the very beginning of his career. Shortly after graduating from Harvard Business School and setting up CBL’s Northeast office, in Boston, he was invited by past ICSC Chairman Stephen Karp, now chairman of New England Development, to get involved in ICSC and become the organization’s state director for Massachusetts. He was subsequently named ICSC’s Eastern divisional vice president and has also served as an ICSC state operations chairman, an ICSC trustee and on the Executive Committee. Lebovitz has also been an active ICSC faculty member. “ICSC really has been the facilitator for so many relationships that I’ve been able to develop over the years in the business,” Lebovitz said. “By volunteering, by working, that’s how you get to know people.”

ICSC should also do all it can to toot the industry’s horn when it comes to shopping centers’ contribution to society, Lebovitz says. “There are so many positives that shopping centers add to the economy, to communities, to individuals,” he said. “I just think we need to do all we can to get that story out there.”
“Stephen’s vast industry expertise, coupled with his extensive ICSC volunteer experience, makes him uniquely qualified to lead this organization, given the many changes the industry and the association are facing in today’s dynamic retail environment,” said Drew Alexander, president and CEO of Weingarten Realty Investors and chairman of ICSC’s Nominating Committee of the Board of Trustees.

Lebovitz, 54, does not spend all his spare time in malls though, and his philanthropic activities are many. He is a trustee of Milton (Mass.) Academy. He is a former director, campaign chairman and committee chairman for the Combined Jewish Philanthropies of Boston and received that organization’s Edwin Sidman Leadership Award in 2014. He is also a former member of the Trust Board of Boston Children’s Hospital.

An avid cyclist, Lebovitz won a silver medal and a bronze medal competing in the international Maccabiah Games last year. In addition, he has completed the annual Pan-Mass Challenge fundraiser for cancer research these past 15 years and the Leadville Trail 100 mountain bike race these past eight years. Lebovitz lives with his wife, Lisa, in Weston, Mass., and they have four children.
Founded in 1957, ICSC is the premier global trade association of the shopping center industry. Its more than 68,000 members in over 100 countries include shopping center owners, developers, managers, marketing specialists, investors, retailers and brokers, as well as academics and public officials.  For more information, visit www.icsc.org.

Mayfaire Town Center
 


 

 




 





 


WILMINGTON, N.C., June 18, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The Mayfaire Town Center and Mayfaire Community Center have been acquired by CBL & Associates Properties, Inc., a publicly traded real estate investment trust (REIT) based in Chattanooga, TN.
The sale, which closed June 18, is not expected to result in immediate changes that will be noticed by consumers. However, Hyman Brody, CEO of BrodyCo, Inc., who co-manages, along with Jeff Zimmer, the eastern N.C. investor group that developed Mayfaire, said that CBL is a well-known operator of upscale town centers and properties, and has the experience, contacts and capital to take Mayfaire to a new level.
Once a horse farm, Mayfaire Town Center and Mayfaire Community Center have become one of North Carolina's premier shopping and leisure destinations. "We've completed all but one phase in the development of Mayfaire and have accomplished what we set out to achieve," Brody said. "As successful as Mayfaire has been, we think it would benefit from fresh thinking and new ownership to take it to the next level. CBL was the right buyer at the right time. We believe the future of Mayfaire is bright."
"We are excited to add Mayfaire Town Center to the CBL portfolio," said Stephen D. Lebovitz, CBL's president and chief executive officer.  "The Brody and Zimmer families have done a tremendous job of building Mayfaire into the preeminent retail destination in the three-county area. The mixed use complex has become a central part of the growing and dynamic Wilmington community.  Customers visit for the great stores, restaurants, entertainment options and for the enjoyable experience.  With our strong network of retail relationships, we see numerous opportunities to elevate this experience even further, delivering more of the premier brands and restaurants that residents and tourists have come to expect from the center.  Mayfaire will also enjoy a synergistic relationship with our other assets in the Carolinas, primarily Friendly Center in Greensboro, NC, one of our most successful properties generating strong growth and consistent demand from high quality retailers, including the recently opened Lululemon store.  We expect similar success from Mayfaire Town Center and are pleased to join the Wilmington community."
CBL is one of the largest shopping mall real estate investment trusts in the country, with more than 140 properties, including 90 malls and open-air centers. In addition to Friendly Center, N.C. developments include: Cross Creek Mall in Fayetteville, Cary Towne Center and Triangle Town Center in Raleigh. CBL knows the Southeast and has extensive contacts in the retail industry, Brody said.
The original Mayfaire ownership continues to believe in the Wilmington market and will focus on the existing Mayfaire office park and the 40 acres it recently purchased adjacent to Mayfaire. "We are extremely proud of Mayfaire, which has brought a new level of retail choice to the Wilmington market," Brody said. "We have a special team of associates that has helped make this project successful. Mayfaire has enjoyed good relationships with the city and county governments, and it has positively added to the tax and employment base without requesting any special incentives."
Mayfaire, the 400-acre mixed-use development, has been referred to as "the new downtown" and "the rising star of commerce" as this property continues to flourish after more than a decade since its inception.   The property includes approximately one million square feet of retail including Belk's, Regal Cinemas, Dick's Sporting Goods, Barnes & Noble, J. Crew, Pottery Barn and Williams-Sonoma.  The development also partnered with several leading developers to attract two hotels (Hilton Garden Inn and Homewood Suites), an office complex and over 700 residential units to the project.
Savills Studley, a New York-based investment capital markets group that specializes in real estate, represented the Seller on the transaction.  Jerome R. Eatman of Lynch Eatman of Raleigh, N.C. completed the legal closing on behalf of the Seller. 
Mayfaire Town Center is a result of the partnership of Hyman Brody and Robert Beller of BrodyCo, Inc., based in Greenville, NC, and Herbert, Alan, Arlene (Schreiber) and Jeffery Zimmer of the Wilmington, NC-based Zimmer Development Company.

Retail Dynasty: Family-Run CBL Thrives Under Stephen Lebovitz

Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

As a real estate expert and Harvard Business School management professor, Arthur Segel is in demand around the world as a guest lecturer. When he packed his bags last month to teach a land-valuation class inIndia, he brought along a favorite case that has become a staple of the real estate survey course he has taught at Harvard for many years. To develop the case, he enlisted a Harvard Business School graduate he met 25 years ago, while still an executive for Boston Properties Inc. Segel describes his co-author as thoughtful, intellectually curious, an excellent listener and genuinely humble—an uncommon and appealing combination among Harvard’s high-powered MBA candidates.
 
Although the case study is familiar to legions of Harvard Business School alumni, Segel’s collaborator has other claims to fame. As president & CEO of CBL & Associates Properties Inc., Stephen Lebovitz leads a retail REIT that owns an 86 million-square-foot, 26-state portfolio of 159 properties, including 85 regional malls and open-air centers. Since succeeding the firm’s founder—his father, Charles Lebovitz, who remains active as executive chairman—as CEO three years ago, Lebovitz has shepherded the Chattanooga, Tenn.-based firm through the aftermath of a difficult recession.
 
On his watch, the company has maintained solid leasing, started to reduce leverage and selectively pursued new developments. He has also built on the firm’s longtime strategy of staking out dominant positions in markets that are usually outside the nation’s biggest metropolitan areas. In many cases, its 85 regional malls and open-air centers are the only game in town.
 
Lebovitz’s associates say that he combines the best qualities of an earlier era with an up-to-the-minute corporate and capital markets knowhow. Like his father, they say, Lebovitz is a tough-minded but trustworthy dealmaker who considers a handshake agreement to be as binding as a written contract. “In an industry filled with a lot of personalities, I don’t think there’s anybody that doesn’t like Charles and Stephen,” said Michael Graziano, managing director & co-head of real estate investment banking at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which has arranged financing for CBL and advises the firm on a continuing basis. Graziano calls Stephen Lebovitz “a trustworthy, ethical guy … an individual that everybody likes to work with.” And the younger Lebovitz brings a Wall Street background and elite business school training to the complex new realities of public real estate companies.
 
Those bona fi des have enabled Lebovitz to navigate a slow, uneven economic recovery. Last October, CBL sealed one of the year’s blockbuster joint ventures: a $1.1 billion alliance with TIAA-CREF. By transferring property-related debt to the institutional giant and applying cash proceeds from the transaction to reduce leverage by another $219 million, CBL trimmed its outstanding debt by $486 million. That accomplishment was also a milestone in an effort that has reduced the company’s debt by $1.2 billion since 2008.
 
The deal recapitalized four of CBL’s trophy mall properties: WestCountyCenter, a 1.3 million-square-foot super-regional mall in Des Peres,Mo., aSt. Louissuburb; Oak Park Mall, a 1.5 million-square-foot center inOverland Park,Kan.; and CoolSprings Galleria, a 1 million-square- foot super-regional mall in Franklin, Tenn., a suburb ofNashville. During last year’s second quarter, CBL extended and modified three secured-credit facilities valued at $1.2 billion. By basing interest on LIBOR plus 200 to 300 basis points—the rate will vary with CBL’s corporate leverage ratio—the new terms will trim borrowing costs by 200 basis points on average. Last year, same-store net operating income edged up 1.4 percent overall as portfolio occupancy reached 93.6 percent, a year-over-year uptick of 120 basis points. Funds from operations rose 14 cents per diluted share, to $2.22.
 
Reflecting the retail sector’s still-modest recovery, Lebovitz is also approving a select group of development projects. As consumers continue their quest for value, CBL, like other retail developers, is finding fertile ground in outlet centers. In January, CBL and Horizon Group Properties Inc. announced a 75-25 joint venture to develop a 370,000-square-foot outlet center, The Outlet Shoppes atAtlanta. Located inWoodstock, a northwesternAtlantasuburb, the project is scheduled for a summer 2013 opening.
 
That project follows last summer’s opening of the 350,000-square-foot Outlet Shoppes atOklahoma City. A joint venture of CBL and Horizon, the project is theSoonerState’s first such center, and—characteristically—the only property of its type within a 145-mile-wide radius. In the community-center category, the 127,000-square-foot Waynesville Commons, inWaynesville,N.C., is scheduled to come online this fall.
 
Even as CBL forges ahead with the first wave of post-recession development, it continues to focus on existing properties. Lebovitz and the company’s leadership team have earned a reputation for first-rate leasing, property management, tenant service and marketing. Last year, the company ranked 20th on the CPE-MHN index of best-run real estate companies and 18th among property managers. “They watch the details— they sweat the details,” said David Zoba, senior vice president & head of global real estate for Gap Inc., which leases about 285,000 square feet in CBL properties nationwide. “A lot of people that have properties in secondary markets don’t run them as well.” Keeping assets like CBL’s profitable demands especially sharp management, Zoba explained, because “in secondary markets, you’re not going to get the highest rents in the industry.”
 
As part of its stewardship, CBL selects a handful of regional malls every year for makeovers. Though many of the centers are already dominant in their markets, the strategy recognizes a fundamental truth of retail real estate: “In order to keep customers coming back, the properties have to be fresh and up to date,” Lebovitz said. This year’s list includes regional malls inTexas,MississippiandNorth Carolina. The 1 million-square-foot Cross Creek Mall inFayetteville,N.C., will get new entrances, interior décor and graphics, amenities and landscaping. Besides attending to curb appeal, CBL constantly reviews the tenant mix. “We’re very proactive in terms of moving stores around,” Lebovitz asserted. “We’re not waiting on the lease to expire to make those kinds of changes.”
 
Financial Report
 
Recent analyst reports regarding CBL offer a spectrum of impressions. In a February update, Green Street Advisors analyst Cedrik Lachance calls CBL “a good operator,” citing a 120-basis-point jump in occupancy last year and rent appreciation on new leases. For the past two years, the company has been a net asset seller and has allocated proceeds to retiring debt. And CBL’s 7.0 ratio of debt to EBITDA “is (a little lower than) the mall sector average,” Lachance wrote.
 
That said,Green Streetalso offers a few cautionary notes. CBL’s leverage, at 62 percent, is 10 percent higher than the sector for the mall sector as a whole, Lachance argued. In 2012 and 2013, almost 30 percent of CBL’s total pro rata debt obligations—$1.5 billion—will come due. Lachance calls CBL’s expectation that it can meet those needs through non-core asset sales, CMBS, bank lending and existing credit lines “a fair assumption”; nevertheless, he warns against expecting that both a vibrant transaction market and adequate CMBS financing will always be available at the same time.
 
A report by KeyBanc Capital Markets’ Todd Thomas offers a similarly nuanced view. The company’s conservative guidance and “a steady capital markets and leasing environment could lead to upside throughout the year.” Thomas also argued that CBL’s $1.1 billion revolving credit line is enough to meet $800 million in debt obligations this year, even if the real estate capital markets go through a downturn. The mixed picture in the retail market presents leasing challenges; although leasing velocity remains steady, about 45 percent of new leases during the fourth quarter of 2011 derived from short-term deals. A case in point—a 25-location deal with struggling Pacific Sunwear—speaks to the continuing softness in some quarters.
 
When Lebovitz stepped into the CEO role in 2010, he immediately had to contend with the fallout of the recession. Net operating income slipped 1.3 percent year over year in both 2009 and 2010—the first such declines since the company’s IPO in 1993. “What we tried to do was anticipate what was coming and make the difficult decisions early,” Lebovitz recalled. “Waiting and putting off tough decisions is not something that helps anyone.” Like most REITs, CBL had to reduce expenses by trimming staff, curtailing its development pipeline and postponing property renovations.
 
The company also moved swiftly to shore up its balance sheet, reaching out early to its lenders and restructuring lines of credit. CBL pulled off a feat that was unusual among REITs during the capital markets crisis. By working with its financiers and in some cases changing the mix of lenders, it extended its credit facilities without having to reduce their capacity. That same year, CBL also extended or refinanced nine mortgages and construction loans valued at $360 million. All told, the efforts gave it $1.6 billion in financial flexibility.
 
While some REITs felt compelled to shut down their pipelines completely in 2009 and 2010, “we divided projects into phases,” he explained. “That allowed us to move forward with what we had leased.” In October 2009, CBL and its partner, Forum Development Group L.L.C., opened The Promenade, a power center in D’Iberville,Miss., that was the biggest new retail project on the Gulf Coast of Mississippi since Hurricane Katrina. Although the center was planned for 700,000 square feet at full build-out, CBL opened only the 480,000-square-foot first phase, which was 96 percent pre-leased to a roster of tenants led by anchors Target, Best Buy, PetSmart, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Marshall’s and ULTA.
 
Other CBL openings during the recession include The Forum atGrandview, a community center inMadison,Miss., developed jointly with The MattiaceCo.The project’s 110,000-square-foot first phase opened fully leased in November 2010. And in March 2010, CBL and The Benchmark Group unveiled Phase I of The Pavilion atPort Orange, a 415,000-square-foot center in theCentral Floridacity ofPort Orange. With a roster of 30-plus tenants, the center opened 92 percent leased.
 
Fast Learner
Lebovitz gravitated toward a real estate career at an early age. Dinnertable discussions exposed him to the business, and his summer jobs were often in construction or real estate. After earning a degree in political science and human biology from Stanford in 1984, Lebovitz spent two years as a financial analyst in the real estate department of Goldman, Sachs & Co. That experience, he said, laid a vital foundation. “Goldman gave me a huge amount of financial experience and understanding— how to underwrite a piece of real estate, how to package it for sale,” he explained.
 
Following graduation fromHarvardBusinessSchoolin 1988, Lebovitz joined CBL & Associates Inc., the forerunner of today’s firm. At the time, CBL was eyeing growth opportunities with Wal-Mart and Home Depot, two regular clients in the company’s Southeast properties. A further priority was building ties to New England-based retailers like BJ’s Wholesale Club, TJ Maxx and Marshalls. Already planted in theBostonarea, Lebovitz got the assignment of opening an office there to serve as the base camp for the company’s Northeast expansion. The first project was a 120,000-square-foot community center inPortland,Me.But financing proved to be a tall order. In the depths of the savings-and-loan crisis, it was impossible to secure construction loans from potential lenders inNew England. Lebovitz’s search led him back toChattanooga, where a longtime CBL lender agreed to finance the project.
 
The experience was an early lesson in the value of building relationships. Lebovitz spent 1988 to 1999 rising steadily through the ranks. While still running the company’s Northeast activities in 1993, he put his capital markets expertise to work when CBL made its initial public offering. He was promoted to senior vice president of community-center development in 1996, moved up to executive vice president for development in 1997, and began overseeing acquisitions as well the next year. The appointment as company president came in 1999.
 
Not long afterward, CBL began work on a pivotal deal: the $1.2 billion purchase of 21 regional malls and two other centers from The Richard E. Jacobs Group. Completed in 2001, the acquisition put CBL on the course to its current footprint, increasing the number of regional malls from 30 to 51 and its portfolio to 162 properties.
 
CBL’s next blockbuster acquisition could well be some years away, as the company sticks to debt reduction, selective development and improving productivity at existing centers. For now, this approach is producing gains, but Lebovitz would be the first to tell you that there are no guarantees for even the most powerful, best-run firms. Still, Moses Lebovitz would surely be pleased to know that a third generation of able executives is dedicated to keeping the family business in such good repair.

Waiting For The Shoe To Drop | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Waiting For The Shoe To DropJun.  9, 2017  7:00 AM ET|| Includes: AKR, AMZN, BRX, CBL, DDR, GGP, GPT, KIM, KRG, MAC, PEI, REG, ROIC, RPT, SHLD, SKT, SPG, SRG, TCO, UBA, UE, WHLR, WPC, WPG, WRI, WSRby: Brad ThomasBrad Thomas Dividend growth investing, REITs, newsletter provider, valueMarketplaceREIT BeatSummary"Retailer negativity has exploded," Conor Flynn, CEO of Kimco Realty."Negative media is relentless," Stephen D. Lebovitz, CEO of CBL Properties."If you follow popular media, Amazon will be the only surviving retailer," Steve Tanger, CEO of Tanger Factory Outlet.I just finished up REITWeek 2017 in New York City, and I decided that I would write an article to summarize my collective feelings surrounding the conference and the REIT market in general. First off, based on attendance numbers, REITWeek was a success, there were over 3,000 in attendance, and most all of the investor presentation rooms were filled with people. A few rooms were standing room only, notably Taubman Centers (NYSE:TCO) and Tanger Factory Outlet Centers (NYSE:SKT). I have attended numerous REITWeek conferences over the years, and it seemed that the latest conference had the most investor participation. I was also glad to see my co-author and I sell over 50 signed books of The Intelligent REIT Investor (message me if you would like an autographed copy). It was great to see many of my friends there, and it was especially good to have my daughter, Lauren Thomas, participating as a rising retail rock star reporter at CNBC. What a terrific time to be writing on the retail industry; here’s a few headline quotes from the conference:  "There will be a massive wave of retail bankruptcies." - Gordon DuGan, CEO of Gramercy Property Trust (NYSE:GPT) "If you follow popular media, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will be the only surviving retailer." - Steve Tanger, CEO of Tanger Factory Outlet Centers "Retailer negativity has exploded." - Conor Flynn, CEO of Kimco Realty (NYSE:KIM) "The U.S. is over-retailed. The Amazon effect is real." - Mark DeCesaris, CEO of W.P. Carey (NYSE:WPC) "Negative media is relentless." - Stephen D. Lebovitz, CEO of CBL Properties (NYSE:CBL) "The battle is who can do brick & mortar better". - Sandeep Mathrani, CEO of GGP, Inc. (NYSE:GGP) "Many retailers peddle the same product." - Joseph F. Coradino, CEO or PREIT (NYSE:PEI) 
 After listening to over 15 presentations in two days, I became almost disoriented. Who do you believe? The media? The Industrial REITs (that own buildings leased to Amazon)? Or the Retail REITs? In fact, as I reflect on my two days at REITWeek (in which Retail REITs were the "talk of the town") and after soaking up the valuable intel from the various management teams, I have reached one simple conclusion, and you can find out by reading my article or simply scrolling down to the bottom of it. Focus on Quality  As you know, quality has become the big focus for me in the Retail REIT sector. In January, I opted to move out of the lower-quality names to focus almost exclusively on the blue-chip REITs such as Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG), Taubman Centers, Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Kimco Realty and Brixmor (NYSE:BRX). While the yields are enticing for many of the lower-quality REITs, my decision to focus on the higher-quality names is based on the argument that "the cream always rises to the top". I don’t know about you, but I like investing in growth stocks (not just REITs), and when I see companies that are growing earnings and dividends, it’s a true sign that there are good things ahead. Take a look at these mall REITs below, based on FFO/share data: 

 As you can see, I have BUY recommendations on SPG, SKT, TCO, PEI, MAC and GGP. I have HOLD or SELL ratings on CBL, WPG, and SRG. Now let’s review the Shopping Center REITs, based on FFO/share data: 


 As you see, I have BUY Ratings on WSR, UBA, ROIC, REG, UE, and KRG, and I have STRONG BUY Ratings on KIM and BRX. Note: My BUY recommendation for WSR is value-based as I do not consider the quality the same as the others whatsoever. I have HOLD or SELL recommendations for WHLR, WRI, RPT, DDR, and AKR. I believe that we are beginning to see a bifurcation in quality within the Retail REIT sector and that can easily be viewed by inspecting the P/FFO multiples and/or dividend yields for these REITs. While the dividend yields may be attractive for REITs such as WPG, CBL, WHLR, and DDR, it’s important for investors to consider the reasons for focusing on quality (even if the payout ratios are attractive). Is the retail sector experiencing secular or cyclical shifts? Perhaps it’s both, but I attribute the pullback to the biggest gorilla in the room, and it’s not Amazon! When Will Sears File Bankruptcy?  As I said, it’s great having a daughter who covers retail and does all of the heavy lifting. Recently, Lauren Thomas wrote this article, Sears just surprised Wall Street with a narrower-than-expected loss; shares jump 25%, and she explained: Sears (NASDAQ:SHLD) inked a deal to extend a portion of a $500 million secured loan facility and annuitize $515 million of its pension obligations. The retailer said it's now targeting a reduction in its outstanding debt and pension obligations of $1.5 billion this fiscal year… Cash injections from Lampert's hedge fund, ESL Investments, and his heavy ownership of Sears' unsecured debt helped convince some investors that the company would avoid filing Chapter 11 this year. There is little doubt that Sears will "eventually" file bankruptcy, and based upon the latest news, the likelihood for bankruptcy will be after the holidays. As (Lauren) Thomas suggests, "they (Sears) are doubling down on defensive measures - such as reducing shipments and asking for better payment terms - to protect against the risk of nonpayment as Sears warns about its finances."
 It’s clear that the REIT market is already pricing in a Sears bankruptcy that will leave many Mall REITs scrambling for cover. The Mall REITs with the most Sears exposure include PEI, CBL, WPG, and of course SRG. Earlier this week, I listened to the CBL presentation (at REITWeek) and I heard Lebovitz say that "our balance sheet is stronger than ever". He was referring to the company’s $850 million line of credit and $225 million of free cash flow. I asked him about the co-tenancy requirements that are included in many of the mall leases and he said that most of the agreements require two anchors to vacate, so even if Sears did file, the in-line tenants would not be impacted. However, should Sears file, CBL (and similar landlords) would be forced to pay additional expenses (such as taxes, insurance, and maintenance) that would eat into cash flow. Nonetheless, I consider CBL’s dividend safe, and that’s one of the reasons that I decided to upgrade from a SELL to a HOLD. Why not a BUY? Lebovitz also made an interesting point, and one that made me ponder the entire retail REIT sector. He said that most retail bankruptcies occur in the first quarter of the year and that he was not expecting to see many more in 2017. Then I thought to myself, why would I want to own shares in CBL now (even though the dividend is safe) when the "next shoe to drop" is likely in Q1-18. Of course, when I say shoe, I am referring to Sears. It’s clear that the Mall REITs have priced in the potential for bankruptcy, but the overhang is likely to linger until the poop hits the fan. Trouble is still brewing, and whether it’s a secular or a cyclical shift, I don’t think it’s prudent to place any bets on CBL, WPG, or SRG until there is more clarity. My take: There is clearly a secular shift when it comes to technology and Amazon has truly disrupted the land of brick and mortar. At some point (Q1-18?), Amazon will be declared a winner (over Sears), but that does not mean that all retailers will go away. In fact, I would argue that most retailers have adapted to the changes and are successfully thriving in both retail, outlet, and online channels.
 My best advice, always invest in quality since the "cream rises to the top" and don’t forget "there is one big shoe left to drop."
