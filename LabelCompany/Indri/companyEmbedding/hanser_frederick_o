The Regional Business Council

                    In 2000, the Regional Business Council was launched with 50 mid-cap business executives, the first effort in the St. Louis region to bring together the leaders of mid-cap companies. In recent years, the St. Louis region’s business community has seen an increase in highly successful mid-cap companies that employ a large percentage of the region’s workforce. Thus, this coalition is essential to enhancing the well-being and vitality

of the region.

These companies, that are generous with their time and resources, include civic and philanthropic involvement as priorities within their companies. Brought together for the first time, these businesses can now leverage their corporate involvement and investment.

The collective effort of RBC members is dramatically expanding the breadth and depth of involvement and investment in the community. Realizing that it cannot lend its support to every worthy cause, the RBC is committed to putting its considerable talent, resources and determination behind business, civic and philanthropic priorities where RBC members can make a substantive contribution. 

Today the RBC is composed of 100 CEOs representing some of the region’s largest employers. These companies have a tremendous impact on the economic health of the region, employing over 120,000 people and generating over $65 billion in revenue annually. Most RBC companies are headquartered in the region and all have a vested interest in the development of the region’s 16 counties.

Founded in 1994, the Everglades Foundation, Inc. is the only non-profit organization solely committed to protecting and restoring America's Everglades through leadership, science and education.  It advances scientifically sound and achievable solutions aimed at reversing environmental damage to this great ecosystem, from the Kissimmee River Watershed to the St. Lucie & Caloosahatchee Rivers and south to Florida Bay. It accomplishes this by building consensus among public and private organizations, forming coalitions, setting priorities and promoting a widespread understanding of the Everglades and its irreplaceable environmental and economic value.                     As the water supply for over 8 million Floridians and a major driver of Florida's economy, America's Everglades is an interrelated series of wetlands beginning just south of Orlando and extending south to the Gulf of Mexico and Florida Keys.  Its freshwater flows through Lake Okeechobee and expands to a swath 50 miles wide, 120 miles long and several feet deep.  Moving at the rate of 100 feet a day, this water ultimately reaches the Florida Straits, where freshwater and saltwater meet.
