Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Airbus said it was on track to meet a target of 10 A350 deliveries a month by the end of 2018 as it hit a milestone of 100 deliveries since Europe's newest wide-body jet came into service, but doubts remained over its A320neo plans. Airbus Chief Operating Officer and President of Commercial Aircraft Fabrice Bregier reaffirmed the A350 target after delivering a A350-900 jetliner to China Airlines.

GE's stock has dropped on the day that the last six quarterly reports were released. General Electric Chief Executive Jeff Immelt has one more earnings report to cement his legacy, and recent history suggests it may be best for investors to prepare to be disappointed--again. GE is scheduled to reveal second-quarter results on Friday, July 21, before the market opens.

















                                                    GE's stock falls as Jeff Immelt's 64th and last quarter is another disappointment

Shares suffered the worst one-day post-earnings performance in over four years. Shares of General Electric Co. (GE) tumbled to the lowest close in nearly two years on Friday, as outgoing Chief Executive Jeff Immelt ended his reign of the industrial conglomerate with a downbeat outlook. But Friday's share weakness may come as little surprise to long-term investors.

This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal. General Electric Co. (GE), a company in transition that also is changing its CEO, told investors Friday that they would have to wait four months to hear the new boss's strategy for boosting results. GE investors, who have missed out on the broader stock market's rally, were in no mood to be patient.

U.S. stocks closed lower Friday, with the Dow industrials finishing lower for the week, as General Electric Co.' s outlook cast a cloud over earnings season, which is just getting started.

(GS) helping to lead blue chips lower. For the week, the Dow finished 0.3% lower, snapping a two-week win streak.

General Electric Co. (GE) told investors that profits are under pressure and they would have to wait several months to get a better sense of its business, sending shares to their lowest levels in more than a year. GE improved its cash flow and ramped up cost-cutting efforts-- two areas of investor focus-- in Chief Executive Jeff Immelt's last quarter at the helm. But the Boston-based conglomerate tempered profit expectations for the current year and said investors would have to wait...

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.
