Clean and affordable water for a better tomorrow.Anfiro™ is a water technology start-up addressing global freshwater scarcity. We are using our self-assembling polymers to create chlorine resistant and high permeability reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) membranes that vastly outperform current membrane technology. This enables us to significantly reduce the cost of water treatment and desalination, enabling clean and affordable water for a better tomorrow.

Current RO membranes are inefficientAs water traverses an RO membrane it must do so through the many apertures within the porous structure. In conventional polyamide RO membranes these pores are a chaotic mesh of interconnected passages that twist and turn throughout the membrane. This type of structure provides a lot of resistance to the passage of water molecules across the membrane, and the net result is low permeability membranes that require a high operating pressure.















Anfiro's membrane technologyOur membranes create a nanoscale porous pattern of cylindrical pores that go straight through the membrane selective layer, with minimal pore-to-pore size variability. The result is a massive increase in permeability without sacrificing selectivity performance. Anfiro's self-assembling polymer technology is enabling a new generation of energy-efficient membranes that can significantly reduce the operational and capital costs of an RO system.Chlorine is one of the most widely used water disinfectants, yet current RO membranes are permanently damaged when exposed to chlorine. Unlike current membrane technology, Anfiro's polymer materials are not degraded by exposure to chlorine. This enables chlorine to be used throughout the RO stage, which reduces bio-fouling and can lead to a longer membrane lifespan.

Doubling as a mixer, straw and shooter, Kickstick garnered attention for its original concept from companies as big as Bacardi and Malibu Rum. With major companies fearful of change, we have decided to create our own brand of shots. With the liquor and energy shot industries completely inundated, we have found an open market in vitamin shots, and we will dominate it.http://www.kickstick.me/KnipBioPrivate CompanyFounded 2013UnknownAquaculture is the fastest growing animal sector and is one of the best sources of protein to accommodate the world’s growing population of 9 billion by 2030.

KnipBio's high-yield proprietary fermentation technology offers a more economical, healthier and sustainable alternative than today's approaches.Surface Loven/aFounded date unknownUnknownThere's no denying the attraction of a Lino floor;it's easy to clean, hard wearing, warm and it's got some seriously green credentials too.

Non-toxic and anti-microbial, these rugs are perfect for high mess areas where a textile rug just won't cut it.
