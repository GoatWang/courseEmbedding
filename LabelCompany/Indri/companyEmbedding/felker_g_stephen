Avondale Mills Closes Doors, Sells Some Facilities

July 23, 2006 




Citing unfair global competition exacerbated by a disastrous train derailment in January 2005
							outside one of its plants in Graniteville, S.C., Monroe, Ga.-based Avondale Mills Inc. has closed
							its doors after 161 years of operation. The closure affects 4,000 associates – many representing
							the second, third, fourth or even fifth generation of their families to have worked for the company
							– at its various facilities in Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina. 
In a letter to Avondale associates announcing the decision to go out of business, G. Stephen
							Felker Sr., chairman, president and CEO, saluted those associates, writing: “The people of Avondale
							have performed well. I am proud of our long record of success and am grateful to our associates and
							friends for their efforts. Events occurred that have taken our future from us. I regret that I
							could not prevent it.” 
One of the leading and most respected textile manufacturers in the United States, Avondale
							hadin recent years invested more than $300 million to upgrade facilities and equipment in an effort
							to bolster its competitive position in a difficult global environment. But the train accident,
							which caused a chlorine spill that took the lives of several Avondale associates and caused
							insurmountable damage to the plant, ultimately derailed the company itself. As Felker also wrote in
							his letter: “We have worked hard for a year and a half to recover, but the damage is too great.
							Without the train derailment and chemical spill, we were challenged. With it, we were destroyed.” 
Avondale has actively been seeking buyers for some of its facilities and has already sold
							three linked ring-spinning plants to Parkdale Mills Inc., Gastonia, N.C. – a move that has saved
							700 jobs. 




Also in the works is a possible sale of Woodhead Plant in Graniteville, a specialty coating
							operation for such applications as boat covers, tents and awnings. According to Stephen Felker Jr.,
							manager, corporate development, several parties are interested in the plant, which he described as
							a “very unique” operation.
