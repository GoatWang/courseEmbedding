Thomas D. Bell Jr. Elected Chairman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce







Tuesday, June 8, 2010 - 8:00pm
	WASHINGTON, D.C.—The U.S. Chamber of Commerce's board of directors today elected Thomas D. Bell Jr. chairman for 2010. In his new role, Bell will address, work with, and call to action state and local chambers, associations, other business groups, and civic and charitable organizations to advance pro-growth policies and programs. He will take an active role in advancing the Chamber's Campaign for Free Enterprise and in helping elect pro-business, pro-free enterprise representatives during the election season.
	"Tom has a track record of excellence running first class organizations both as a chief executive and as a chairman," said Chamber President and CEO Thomas J. Donohue. "I expect to work with him closely and am confident that he will greatly benefit the Chamber's goals and initiatives."
	Currently Bell is also chairman of SecurAmerica, a national contract security firm, and vice chairman of Goddard Investment Group, a real estate partnership. Previously, he served as chairman of the board and CEO of Cousins Properties Inc. He was named vice chairman of the board and chairman of the Executive Committee in January 2001. Subsequently, he was elected president and CEO by the company's board in January 2002. Bell assumed the role of chairman of the board upon the retirement of Cousins Properties founder and Chairman Tom Cousins in December 2006.
	Bell brings a wealth of experience in corporate management, governance, and leadership in both the public and private sectors. Prior to joining Cousins, he spent 10 years at Young & Rubicam Inc., retiring as chairman and CEO when it merged with WPP. Before becoming chairman and CEO of Young & Rubicam Inc., he served as chairman and CEO of Young & Rubicam Advertising, CEO of Burson-Marsteller, and CEO of Young & Rubicam's Diversified Communications Group.
	Bell is a member of the boards of Grady Memorial Hospital Corp., Emory University, the Regal Entertainment Group, AGL Resources Inc., Norfolk Southern Corp., and the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. He served as the 2005 chairman of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce and as chairman of the chamber's Quality Growth Task Force.
	During the Reagan Administration, Bell chaired the Committee on the Next Agenda, which focused on prioritizing issues for President Reagan's second term. He also chaired the Workforce 2000 Advisory Committee for U.S. Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman. Earlier in his career, Bell was chief of staff to then-Senator William Brock (R-TN).
	Bell's biography can be found here: www.uschamber.com/about/board/bell.htm
	A high resolution photo of Bell can be found at www.uschamber.com/press/photos/photo_search.htm?t=d
	The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the world's largest business federation representing the interests of more than 3 million businesses of all sizes, sectors, and regions, as well as state and local chambers and industry associations.
