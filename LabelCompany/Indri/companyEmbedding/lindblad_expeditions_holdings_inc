TOP 10
REASONS TO EXPEDITION WITH
LINDBLAD-NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC









1
The human genetic drive to head out in ships and discover new things. For 50 years, we’ve been introducing travelers to this exhilarating way to experience the planet's wonders.









2
Authentic expedition ships Ranging from 28 guests to 148 guests, our 11 ships, scaled to go where cruise ships can’t, are equipped to bring you deep inside places where no infrastructure of docks or ports exist.









3
More of what you’re ‘out there’ for An onboard fleet of Zodiacs, kayaks, paddle boards, and snorkel gear for all, lets us make up-close, personal discoveries virtually anywhere. Plus, bow cams, hydrophones, video microscopes to reveal wonders.









4
Exclusively ours: the undersea Discover the virtually unknown Antarctica, Arctic or Alaska beneath the ship—through our undersea specialist’s icy dives. Watch vivid HD video—in the dry warmth of the ship’s Lounge, perhaps with a cocktail in hand.









5
Renowned expedition teams Over 50 years, we achieved a reputation for the best expedition teams in the business. Their experience, personalities, superb spotting and storytelling skills ensure that you’ll see, do and understand more.









6
National Geographic photographers aboard Inspiration and expert tips from top pros on every departure of NG Explorer & NG Orion, and on select other departures. Hit the B&H gear lockers aboard to try out new cameras and glass. And when you book, find out about exclusive B&H gear discounts.









7
Lindblad-National Geographic Certified photo instructors-naturalists Aboard every ship, they help you with camera settings and basics, and to understand wildlife to better anticipate behavior that leads to great shots.









8
Global Perspectives Guest Speakers On NG Explorer—travel with experts from the top tiers of journalism, science, and exploration. And on all our trips, count on rewarding local encounters, from concerts to hang-outs.









9
Adventure without adversity We’re inspired by historic expeditions but—no deprivation. Dining is excellent, with an emphasis on sustainable, locally sourced ingredients wherever possible. Onboard Wellness makes exploring a mind-body activity. 









10
Going beyond limits & expectations To be on an expedition means to be free, no ‘port’ schedule. We can be the first to set foot somewhere—because we are an expedition travel company and this is our mission.

Sven-Olof Lindblad, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Lindblad has started 2017 with significant operating momentum as bookings for future travel are up nearly 60% from the same period a year ago. While first quarter financial results were negatively impacted by unique voyage cancellations, the meaningful demand we are seeing for both existing and new vessels across our expedition fleet reinforces the appeal of our product and the opportunity we have to grow this business as we expand our current capacity. The National Geographic Quest will launch next month and has virtually sold out its inaugural Alaskan season, while its sister ship the National Geographic Venture is well under way for delivery in June 2018. We are also close to finalizing our plans for a new build blue water vessel to be delivered in the second quarter of 2019. This increased capacity, combined with a loyal and expanding customer base which seeks an authentic expedition experience that we have a proven track record of providing, is expected to generate significant earnings growth and create additional shareholder value in the years ahead."
FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
Tour Revenues
First quarter tour revenues of $63.1 million increased $1.6 million, or 3%, as compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to contributions from Natural Habitat, which was acquired in May of 2016, mostly offset by lower Lindblad segment revenues due in large part to an estimated $9.1 million impact from voyage cancellations. These voyage cancellations included four highly booked expeditions on the National Geographic Orion to repair the engine and the cancellation of two highly booked expeditions on the National Geographic Sea Lion to repair the air conditioning system. Excluding the impact of these voyage cancellations, the Company estimates that total Company tour revenue would have increased 17% to $72.3 million.
Lindblad segment revenues of $53.2 million decreased $8.4 million, or 14%, compared to 2016, due to an $8.9 million decrease in ticket revenues driven by the voyage cancellations, partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in other tour revenues. Other tour revenues increased due to $1.9 million of insurance revenue related to the National Geographic Orion cancellations, which was mostly offset by lower other tour revenue due to the voyage cancellations. Excluding the impact of the voyage cancellations, the Company estimates that Lindblad segment revenue would have increased 1% to $62.3 million mainly due to the launch of charter expeditions in Cuba, offset by lower overall Occupancy.
Available Guest Nights declined by 18% as compared with the first quarter a year ago, primarily due to the voyage cancellations, partially offset by the launch of charter expeditions in Cuba. Lindblad segment Net Yield of $1,008 was in-line with the first quarter a year ago as increased pricing was offset by the impact of voyage cancellations on itineraries with higher net yields, as well as from a decline in overall Occupancy.  Occupancy decreased to 87% from 92% a year ago primarily due to the cancellation of high occupancy voyages as well as from lower bookings during the first half of 2016 due to concerns over the Zika virus and terrorism and from a delay in direct mail marketing.
Net Income
Net income for the first quarter was $0.6 million, $0.01 per diluted share, as compared with net income of $10.5 million, $0.23 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2016. The $9.8 million decrease is primarily due to the lower operating results and $2.9 million of additional stock based compensation expense in the current year primarily related to grants under the 2016 CEO Share Allocation Plan, which provides our CEO the ability to transfer shares from his existing holdings in the Company to eligible employees. 
Adjusted EBITDA
First quarter adjusted EBITDA of $10.3 million decreased $7.3 million, or 42%, compared to the same period in 2016, due to a $7.7 million decrease at the Lindblad segment, partially offset by $0.4 million of contributions from Natural Habitat.  Excluding the estimated $6.5 million impact from the voyage cancellations, total Company adjusted EBITDA would have declined 5% to $16.7 million and Lindblad segment adjusted EBITDA would have declined 7% to $16.3 million, primarily reflecting the lower Occupancy.
On a reported basis, the decline in the Lindblad segment primarily reflects the lower tour revenues in 2017 as well as higher charter costs, partially offset by a decline in fuel costs and lower operating expenses on the vessels with cancelled voyages.

The impact of the cancelled voyages on tour revenues was calculated as booked tour revenue at the time of cancellation less insurance proceeds.  The impact of the cancelled voyages on operating income and adjusted EBITDA was calculated as booked tour revenue at the time of cancellation less insurance proceeds and estimated operating costs. 
Liquidity
The Company's cash and cash equivalents were $103.8 million as of March 31, 2017, as compared with $135.4 million as of December 31, 2016. The decrease primarily reflects purchases of property and equipment of $22.8 million, mostly related to the construction of two new coastal vessels partially offset by $2.7 million in net cash provided by operating activities. The current quarter also reflects $5.6 million of cash used to repurchase stock and warrants.
Free cash flow use was $20.1 million for the first quarter of 2017 as compared with $7.9 million in the first quarter of 2016 primarily due to the capital expenditures for the new vessels. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment.
LINDBLAD FLEET ACTIVITIES
The Company expanded its travel offerings in December 2016 with new expeditions in Cuba that will operate on a seasonal basis from December through March.
The Company's two new-build coastal vessels are proceeding on schedule. The first vessel, National Geographic Quest, is expected to launch on June 26, 2017 and will sail in Alaska and British Columbia during the summer of 2017 before voyaging to Costa Rica and Panama to provide expeditions for the Northern Hemisphere winter season. The second vessel, National Geographic Venture, is expected to launch in June of 2018.
STOCK AND WARRANT REPURCHASE PLAN
Pursuant to its existing $35 million stock and warrant repurchase plan, during the first quarter the Company repurchased 513,372 warrants for $1.1 million at an average price of $2.15 and 480,864 shares of stock for $4.5 million at an average price of $9.25.  As of May 3, 2017 the Company had repurchased 5.4 million warrants and 830,382 shares under the plan for a total of $21.6 million and had $13.4 million remaining under the plan.  As of May 3, 2017 there were 45.1 million common shares and 10.7 million warrants outstanding.
FINANCIAL OUTLOOK 
The Company's current expectations for the full year 2017 are as follows:

Tour revenues of $275 - $281 million (14 – 16% growth) 
Adjusted EBITDA of $47 - $49 million (12 – 17% growth)

This outlook includes the estimated $9.1 million revenue impact and estimated $6.5 million adjusted EBITDA impact associated with the cancellation of four voyages on the National Geographic Orion and two voyages on the National Geographic Sea Lion for necessary repairs.  As of May 1, 2017, the Lindblad segment had 92% of full year 2017 projected guest ticket revenues on the books versus 93% of full year 2016 revenue at the same time last year.  The Company also continues to anticipate it will achieve its long-range revenue and adjusted EBITDA targets.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The Company uses a variety of operational and financial metrics, including non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted EBITDA, Occupancy, Net Yields and Net Cruise Costs, to enable it to analyze its performance and financial condition. The Company utilizes these financial measures to manage its business on a day-to-day basis and believes that they are the most relevant measures of performance. Some of these measures are commonly used in the cruise and tourism industry to evaluate performance. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures provide expanded insight to assess revenue and cost performance, in addition to the standard GAAP-based financial measures. There are no specific rules or regulations for determining non-GAAP measures, and as such, they may not be comparable to measures used by other companies within the industry.
The presentation of non-GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The definitions of non-GAAP financial measures along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial information to GAAP are included in the supplemental financial schedules beginning on page 10.

The Company has scheduled a conference call at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on May 9, 2017 to discuss the earnings of the Company. The conference call can be accessed by dialing (844) 378-6487 (United States), (855) 669-9657 (Canada) or (412) 542-4182 (outside the U.S.).

Operational and Financial Metrics
Adjusted EBITDA is net income (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization, net interest expense, other income (expense), and income tax benefit (expense), and other supplemental adjustments. Other supplemental adjustments include certain non-operating items such as stock-based compensation, the National Geographic fee amortization, merger-related expenses, and acquisition-related expenses. The Company believes adjusted EBITDA, when considered along with other performance measures, is a useful measure as it reflects certain operating drivers of the business, such as sales growth, operating costs, selling and administrative expense, and other operating income and expense. The Company believes adjusted EBITDA helps provide a more complete understanding of the underlying operating results and trends and an enhanced overall understanding of the Company's financial performance and prospects for the future. While adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measure under GAAP, management uses this financial measure to evaluate and forecast business performance. adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income as it does not take into account certain requirements, such as unearned passenger revenues, capital expenditures and related depreciation, principal and interest payments, and tax payments. The Company's use of adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other companies within the industry.
The following metrics apply to the Lindblad segment:
Adjusted Net Cruise Cost represents Net Cruise Cost adjusted for Non-GAAP other supplemental adjustments which include certain non-operating items such as stock-based compensation, the National Geographic fee amortization, merger-related expenses, and acquisition-related expenses.
Available Guest Nights is a measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin (except single occupancy for a single capacity cabin) multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period. The Company also records the number of guest nights available on its limited land programs in this definition.
Gross Cruise Cost represents the sum of cost of tours plus merger-related expenses, selling and marketing expense, and general and administrative expense.
Gross Yield represents tour revenues less insurance proceeds divided by Available Guest Nights. 
Guest Nights Sold represents the number of guests carried for the period multiplied by the number of nights sailed within the period.
Maximum Guests is a measure of capacity and represents the maximum number of guests in a period and is based on double occupancy per cabin (except single occupancy for a single capacity cabin).
Net Cruise Cost represents Gross Cruise Cost excluding commissions and certain other direct costs of guest ticket revenues and other tour revenues.
Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel represents Net Cruise Cost excluding fuel costs.
Net Revenue represents tour revenues less insurance proceeds, commissions and direct costs of other tour revenues.
Net Yield represents Net Revenue divided by Available Guest Nights.
Number of Guests represents the number of guests that travel with the Company in a period.
Occupancy is calculated by dividing Guest Nights Sold by Available Guest Nights.
Voyages represent the number of ship expeditions completed during the period.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
