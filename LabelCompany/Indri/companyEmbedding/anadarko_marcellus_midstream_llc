Pennsylvania
The Marcellus Shale is estimated to hold the second-largest deposit of natural gas in the world.


$90MillionLocal Infrastructure ImprovementsResponsible Development in the Marcellus
Anadarko is among the largest producers of clean-burning natural gas in the United States, and a significant portion of the company’s production comes from the Marcellus Shale in north-central Pennsylvania, where the company currently produces more than 380 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. That’s enough to fuel the daily heating and cooling needs of more than 2 million American homes.
Prudent Development
Anadarko is committed to safely producing natural gas in a manner that protects Pennsylvania’s natural resources and is focused on the shared prosperity of the communities around us.
Together with a group of leading Marcellus producers, Anadarko developed a set of Recommended Standards and Practices for Exploration and Production of Natural Gas and Oil from Appalachian Shales, called the Appalachian Shale Recommended Practices Group (ASRPG). Learn more about these efforts at asrpg.org.
The company’s commitment to public safety extends to the improvement and maintenance of roadways in its operating areas. Since 2006, Anadarko and its partners have invested more than $90 million to upgrade more than 370 miles of private, state-route, state forest and township roads and enhance driver awareness in north-central Pennsylvania.

Anadarko sells Marcellus shale natural gas assets








December 22, 2016



By
 PennEnergy Editorial Staff




Source: Anadarko














































Anadarko Petroleum Corporation has agreed to sell its operated and non-operated upstream assets and operated midstream assets in the Marcellus Shale of north-central Pennsylvania to Alta Marcellus Development, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Alta Resources Development, LLC, for approximately $1.24 billion. The midstream assets in the Marcellus owned by Western Gas Partners, LP (NYSE: WES), Anadarko's sponsored master limited partnership, are excluded from the agreement.[Native Advertisement]
"With this transaction, we have announced or closed monetizations totaling well in excess of $5 billion in 2016, while principally focusing Anadarko's U.S. onshore activities on our world-class oil-levered assets in the Delaware and DJ basins," said Al Walker, Anadarko Chairman, President and CEO. "Our Marcellus team has done a superb job of maximizing the value of our position in this natural gas play, and we are grateful for their efforts and dedication."
The Marcellus Shale divestiture includes approximately 195,000 net acres and, at the end of the third quarter of 2016, sales volumes from these properties totaled approximately 470 million cubic feet per day.
The transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2017, subject to customary closing conditions and adjustments. Jefferies LLC marketed the assets, and Sidley Austin LLP served as Anadarko's legal counsel.

Anadarko to sell Marcellus assets to Alta Resources for $1.24 billion








HOUSTON, Dec. 21


12/21/2016



By
OGJ editors








































Anadarko Petroleum Corp., The Woodlands, Tex., has agreed to sell its operated and nonoperated upstream assets and operated midstream assets in the Marcellus shale of north-central Pennsylvania to Alta Marcellus Development LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Houston-based Alta Resources Development LLC, for $1.24 billion.
The deal, expected to close during first-quarter 2017, includes 195,000 net acres. At the end of the third quarter, sales volumes from the properties totaled 470 MMcfd. Excluded from the agreement are the Marcellus midstream assets owned by Western Gas Partners LP, Anadarko's sponsored master limited partnership.








"With this transaction, we have announced or closed monetizations totaling well in excess of $5 billion in 2016, while principally focusing Anadarko's US onshore activities on our world-class oil-levered assets in the Delaware and DJ basins," said Al Walker, Anadarko chairman, president, and chief executive officer.
Anadarko in November sold its Carthage upstream and midstream assets in East Texas to Castleton Commodities International LLC (CCI) for $1 billion (OGJ Online, Nov. 12, 2016). The firm this month also closed on its $2-billion purchase of Freeport McMoRan Oil & Gas’s deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets (OGJ Online, Sept. 12, 2016).
Anadarko last week confirmed that it added 2 rigs in each of its Delaware and DJ basin positions early in the fourth quarter (OGJ Online, Dec. 16, 2016). The firm plans to further increase activity in each area, expecting to end first-quarter 2017 with 14 operated rigs in the Delaware and 6 in the DJ, compared with 7 and 1 in the basins, respectively, at the end of this year’s third quarter.
