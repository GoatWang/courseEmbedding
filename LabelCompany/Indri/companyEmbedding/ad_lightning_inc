Get ahead of Ad Quality issues
Ad Lightning's complete set of Ad Quality tools save time, improve page performance and eliminate costly user experience problems.








Real-time Ad Quality Scoring
Ad Lightning watches your site around-the-clock, assessing the overall quality of in-flight campaigns and automatically alerting you and your demand partners of critical ad issues.

Complete Coverage
 Our unique approach takes into account device, browser, geographic and cookie data to most accurately represent the advertisements your users are experiencing. Easily preview all of the ads in our searchable database.
Metrics that Matter
 Whether it's IAB compliance or customized site specs, Ad Lightning's flexible scoring methodology reports on key performance attributes like speed, size, format, waterfall and volume of network requests.
Malware Protection
 Disruptive and malicious ads frustrate users and put websites and users at risk. Ad Lightning sends instant notifications if mobile redirects, malware or other disruptions, like autoplay video, are detected on your site.
Data Security
Safeguard your proprietary site data by ensuring all of your ads are SSL compliant and only approved third parties are executing JavaScript on your pages.















A Complete Solution
Our technology goes beyond ad level reporting, helping Publishers and Ad Platforms focus on improving the overall customer ad experience.

Pre-flight Campaign Checks
Pre-flight scans help AdOps teams more easily QA campaign creatives prior to launch, ensuring they meet guidelines for compliance, content and security before going live.
Page Load Monitoring
There are a lot of factors that impact page load. Ad Lightning's detailed reports make it simple to isolate the effect advertisements have on a website.
Partner Optimization Reporting
 Ongoing trend analysis provides unique insight into overall traffic quality by demand source, allowing Publishers and their demand partners to work together to optimize inventory.
Flexible Integration
Getting started with Ad Lightning requires no integration. Flexible options exist to tie integrate data from your ad server or to push data to third party tools already in your tech stack.

The LEC Advantage
The LEC advantage is the heart and soul of our products and services. LEC technical development superiority, consulting services and solutions implementations.

DAS® No-Strike Warranty
Catastrophe prevention
Financial risk mitigation
Risk management training

The LEC advantage over the other vendors is our market leading experience, knowledge and expertise. We have an excellent library of technical articles, research papers, client success stories and product presentations that document the success of our patented solutions. The LEC management team members are recognized experts in the field of lightning control and prevention, with a strong background of business and financial leadership. We understand the need to justify and do cost benefit analysis of any expenditure. At the same time we also know, first hand, that any reasonable risk analysis will support exploring our products and services.
DAS® No-Strike Warranty
LEC provides the only No Strike Warranty in the industry on our DAS® solutions, when installed, maintained and supervised by LEC our DAS® prevents direct strikes with a 99% success rate, minimizing the risks to facilities and operations. The benefits can be substantial: reduced downtime, reduced maintenance/repair costs, improved reliability, increased personnel safety and a healthier bottom line.
DAS®
The Dissipation Array® System (DAS®) prevents lightning strikes at thousands of sites in over 60 countries, with a 99.87% success rate measured over 60,000 system years. The DAS® prevents lightning strikes by reducing the local, storm-induced electric fields, interrupting the formation of upward streamers and thus preventing lightning strikes in the protected area… read more
Catastrophe Prevention
LEC solutions are truly preventive, combining lightning prevention, protection, grounding and surge suppression to create an “isolation zone” that inhibits direct strikes to the protected site and minimizes the effects of any strikes nearby.
Financial Risk Mitigation
Our customers and prospects all have three primary areas of concern from a lightning strike: personnel safety, environmental impact (including human cost and suffering) and financial consequences. Every one of these elements can have a measurable financial impact, from interruption of business flow, breakdown of systems, loss of product and production and add-on costs such as disaster clean up, environmental impact lawsuits and Federal oversight costs.
Risk Management Training
The LEC risk management training can be delivered on-site or off-site for large industry groups. Risk management training programs incorporate risk assessment, prevention, guidance and recommendation, financial planning and an on-going program of advice and guidance post-implementation.

Welcome to LightningProtection.com
Home of Lightning Eliminators & Consultants, Inc. Protecting Industries from lightning disasters for over 45 years.






 



Lightning Eliminators & Consultants, Inc. (LEC) is dedicated to providing integrated lightning protection and lightning prevention products, solutions and services. In association with grounding systems and surge protection solutions, LEC utilizes innovative patented charge transfer technology, in concert with comprehensive and integral consulting, assessment and design. All work is based on state of the art engineering principles and physics to divert direct lightning strikes and protect against lightning’s secondary effects. Lightning Eliminators successfully installed and continues to maintain lightning protection systems and solutions in over 90 countries and throughout the United States since 1971. To learn more visit “About Lightning Protection”
 
 
 





LIGHTNING PROTECTION
Lightning Protection
Unlike lightning rods & ESE’s which rely on collecting a strike and inviting the charge into your facility, LEC products deter the strike from forming within the area you need protected and avoid the risk altogether.

 
 
 




GROUNDING/EARTHING
Grounding Rod
Critical for personal safety, sustainability and continuous operations, proper grounding serves as the foundation for a complete lightning protection solution, reducing risk and optimizing performance.

 
 
 




SURGE PROTECTION
Lightning and other transients can damage sensitive electronics, causing expensive downtime and repairs. LEC surge protectors protect against damage from these electrical surges.

 
 
 




SERVICES & CONSULTING
Lightning Safety
LEC offers a wide range of services employing the expertise of our engineers and consultants including maintenance, inspection, recertification, installation, design and planning, testing, training and more.

Contemporary lighting is an updated mix of the latest trends and styles. Classified by simple smooth angles, grays, monochromes, mixed with clear or white glass.
	




Modern lighting is characterized by clean, sharp lines dominantly in brushed steels and chromes. Modern Lighting transforms lighting fixtures into an artpiece for your home.
	




Traditional lighting is characterized by smooth classic lines that range a variety of historical periods and will make any home look more elegant.
	






Transitional lighting is defined as a mix of contemporary and traditional. This style fuses two top selling styles into one beautiful design for your space.
	




Rustic lighting is known for use of earthy tones, sturdy wrought irons and antler decorations. Rustic lighting fits in everything from a cabin, home in the mountains, or home in the suburbs.
	




Colonial lighting is marked by simple, traditional lines often combined with the use of basic woods or irons. Lanterns, chandeliers and wall sconces with candle-style bulbs make a simple yet attractive luminaire for any space.

Voltage



Low Voltage

			 These outdoor lights run on low voltage direct current (DC) between 12V and 24V. They require an external transformer, and can easily be installed by a homeowner. Wiring between lights can be buried directly in the ground
		






Line Voltage

			 These outdoor lights run on mains power, which is the same power that is inside your home (AC). They do not require an external transformer, but they are best left to professional installation, since they must pass electrical code inspection in most areas.

Why don't we show the price?

					Like many retailers, LightingDirect.com can choose to set its own prices independently. And even though manufacturers require LightingDirect.com and other retailers to display a product's "minimum advertised price" (or MAP), the retailer can choose to sell for less than that. But the price must be conveyed in other ways, and each individual manufacturer's MAP policy determines where the price can be seen.
				

					To see the price for this product at LightingDirect.com, you'll need to place it in your shopping cart, and maybe even proceed to final checkout. If you're not ready to buy the product, simply remove it from the cart.
				

					LightingDirect.com apologizes for any inconvenience. We'd just like to offer you the chance to save extra money while we adhere to manufacturers' MAP policies. LightingDirect.com is also working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact customers and their buying behavior.

Why don't we show the price?

					Like many retailers, LightingDirect.com can choose to set its own prices independently. And even though manufacturers require LightingDirect.com and other retailers to display a product's "minimum advertised price" (or MAP), the retailer can choose to sell for less than that. But the price must be conveyed in other ways, and each individual manufacturer's MAP policy determines where the price can be seen.
				

					To see the price for this product at LightingDirect.com, you'll need to place it in your shopping cart, and maybe even proceed to final checkout. If you're not ready to buy the product, simply remove it from the cart.
				

					LightingDirect.com apologizes for any inconvenience. We'd just like to offer you the chance to save extra money while we adhere to manufacturers' MAP policies. LightingDirect.com is also working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact customers and their buying behavior.
