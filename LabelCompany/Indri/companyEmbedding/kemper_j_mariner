By Sharon Silke Carty, USA TODAY
KANSAS CITY, Mo.  On a shelf near his computer monitors, UMB Financial CEO J. Mariner Kemper keeps a small bottle of amber cologne. It smells horrible, honestly, but that doesn't matter. He rarely opens it.
The cologne was made by a customer in the 1950s, who took a substantial loan to start a line of men's scents. He quickly failed, and the bank's collateral included a warehouse full of the worthless bottles. The bank, then run by Kemper's grandfather, gave them out as Christmas presents.
The bottle is a reminder to act conservatively, Kemper says.
"My father always said you should row close to shore," says Kemper, 37. "I've taken that to mean in everything we do, we need to manage the risks. ... Never do something that could take the whole business down."
Sticking to its conservative approach earned Kansas City, Mo.-based UMB the No. 2 spot, behind Bank of Hawaii, on Forbes magazine's rating at the end of 2009 of the 100 largest U.S. banks from best to worst.

Cross-state rival Commerce Bank, with headquarters in St. Louis and Kansas City, followed a similar strategy, landing itself at No. 3 on the Forbes list.
"There's something in the water here," he says.
It also could be the genes. Commerce's CEO is Kemper's cousin, David Kemper.
Their great-grandfather, W.T. Kemper, had stakes in several banks: Two, through various name changes, became today's UMB and Commerce.
While other banks in the past decade chased profits in subprime mortgages and financial instruments whose risks most people, including the bankers, did not understand, UMB, a regional bank with operations in seven states, and Commerce, which operates in five states, made relatively conservative loans and cautiously managed customers' money.
Now, as Congress deliberates over new regulations for financial companies, bankers such as Kemper feel they're being punished for someone else's recklessness.
Mariner Kemper and David Kemper, 59, don't sit around at Sunday dinner sharing strategy. The financial ties between the Kemper family's two banks were severed in the 1980s.
The cousins rarely see each other, except at an industry event or family weddings or funerals. And their companies' growth plans are different: UMB is expanding in financial services; Commerce is developing its retail business.
But their approaches are very similar: Both believe in conservative lending, both focus on developing strong managers, both are civic-minded and support community and arts causes.
"My father always says banking should be a boring business," says John Kemper, David Kemper's son and Commerce Bank's strategic planning director.
Boring — but sturdy 
These banks "were built to withstand a recession, maybe even a depression, and still be ahead of their competitors," says Peyton Green, an analyst at Sterne Agee. "That's very different from most banks."
Nearly 215 banks have failed since January 2009, 73 this year, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. That compares with just 25 in 2008 and three in 2007.
Banks and financial institutions have $244.9 billion of the federal money spent in the recession to shore up the economy, according to non-profit website ProPublica, about 45.7% of the total spent on business bailouts.
Many banks got into trouble on mortgages, says Doug Bernstein, head of law firm Plunkett Cooney's banking, bankruptcy and creditors' rights practice group, because they started taking too much risk on the loans.
"If you want to gain market share, maybe you're going to loan 90%" of the property's assessed value, he says. "They were up to 100% or more in some cases. If something goes bad, or unemployment rises, are your delinquencies going to go up? Sure."
Bad things did happen and delinquencies still are going up: The non-current loan rate for all banks was 5.46% in the first quarter, up from 3.77% a year ago for all banks, according to the FDIC.
But delinquency rates at UMB and Commerce remain low: Just 0.015% of UMB's loans are more than 90 days past due; for Commerce, it's 0.4%.
Also, neither UMB nor Commerce took any federal aid, despite pressure from the government to participate. "They said it was the patriotic thing to do," Mariner Kemper says. "But it never made sense to us."
Past tough times 
UMB and Commerce have survived tough times in the past: Bank runs were common in the 1890s in the Midwest, as crop failures hit wide swaths of the population and squeezed entire communities financially.
Commerce, opened in Wild West Kansas City in 1865 by W.T. Kemper, made it through those runs on skill and goodwill. It backed some smaller banks in trouble and saw the favors returned when it faced hard times.
During the Depression, UMB CEO R. Crosby Kemper Sr. reached out to customers after business hours, unheard of then, to quell their fear.
In March 1933, Commerce Bank CEO W.T. Kemper dealt with a run on his bank with apples: He bought them at the farmer's market and cheerily handed them out to panicked customers in line.
While the companies became Kansas City institutions, the family (and its money) got involved in everything from politics to the 19,500-seat Kemper Arena to the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art downtown.
Caution was out of favor 
While holding fast to loan-ratio guidelines and credit-score standards now appears to have served them well, it earned criticism in the past decade because it made them appear to be underperforming.
In 2004, UMB was trudging along with its conventional strategy of investing most of its deposits in government Treasuries.
Historically low interest rates crushed rates of return and the bank's earnings fell 27% from 2003. As a result, share prices stayed nearly flat at about $24.
Mariner Kemper took over the bank that spring from older brother R. Crosby Kemper III, who now heads Kansas City's library system. One of his first moves, however, was anything but conservative: He asked his father to step down as chairman of the board.













 David Kemper of Commerce Bancshares.





"I didn't want to 'job-shadow' for the rest of my life," he says, referring to the practice of having a new hire follow a veteran around to learn the ropes.
He has since moved to create profit centers for the bank so it is less dependent on interest rates and loans for revenue. The company expanded into financial services, including adding a small insurance company, health care card processing and back-office work for fund managers.
Commerce Bank under CEO David Kemper has a different strategy: It is focused on retail banking, lending money in the community and supporting local businesses.
David Kemper says he wants Commerce to be a "super community bank" — large enough to meet the needs of businesses and individuals, but retaining the feel, ties and service of a small-town bank.
"We want to do business with people we know in places we know," he says. "We've got the resources, but we're small enough to really know what's going on in the community."
Commerce Bank shifted its headquarters from Kansas City, where it still has a significant presence, to St. Louis, where David Kemper decided to raise his family 25 years ago. Kemper has pushed his executives to become part of St. Louis: The top 10 each sit on one or two charity or business boards; the bank sponsors arts and education programs.
"We only do as well as the community," David Kemper says. "It's the right thing to do, and it's good for business."
Branching out 
While Kemper family members remain in top jobs at both companies, the executive ranks are broadening.
Mariner Kemper is CEO of UMB Financial Holdings, but Peter deSilva now is the CEO of UMB Bank, the first non-Kemper over the wholly owned subsidiary.
David Kemper and his brother, Jonathan Kemper, are the only family members on Commerce Bank's 12-member board. And the CEOs at both companies also say family members aren't given priority over qualified outsiders.
But there is something to be said for lifelong grooming. Mariner Kemper grew up unavoidably steeped in the family business and had his first job at UMB as a teenager, verifying employment claims on credit applications.
However, he also studied political science, as well as ceramics, at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Wash.
As a child, he says, he resented the bank.
"I grew up in a family where every conversation was about the bank," he says. "Most people don't like having things shoved down their throats."
But he realized as a young adult, he says, "that it would have been unfortunate for me not to recognize the opportunity in front of me."
He asked for a job in Colorado, where his then-girlfriend, now-wife, Megan, lived. He began building a commercial loans business in Colorado and quickly grew that portfolio to $1 billion.
Mariner Kemper took over the bank at age 31, young for an otherwise conservative company — but about the same age his father was when he began running it.
He still lives in Denver and has an office there, while spending a few days each week in his Kansas City office.
He says the job is satisfying, but wearing.
"I love what I do, but I have been consumed by it," he says.
Different paths 
The four children of Mariner Kemper's older cousin, Commerce Bank CEO David Kemper, are closer to his age but have taken different paths, even if headed into the family business.
A day at the office is a day at NBC's The Office for David Kemper's two daughters: Carrie writes for the TV comedy, and Ellie appears in the show as receptionist Erin.
Son Billy is studying history at Stanford. John, 32, the Commerce director of strategic planning, also went to Stanford, then worked for management consultants McKinsey & Co. before taking a job at the bank. His father says that outside experience gives his son perspective.
His insight will be needed as Commerce, like UMB, looks to expand while other banks are faltering. But the bank plans to expand with, you guessed it, a conservative approach.
The cost of such caution is some missed opportunities, David Kemper says, but it pays off in the long term.
"We've definitively missed buying some banks," he says. "But we'd rather hit singles and doubles and have a very high batting average than hitting some home runs."

J. Mariner Kemper
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
UMB Financial Corp.
Mariner Kemper is Chief Executive Officer and Chairman for UMB Financial Corporation. During his more than 13 years with the company, Mr. Kemper has served many roles including President of UMB Bank Colorado and Executive Vice President of UMB Financial Corporation. He has been in his current role since May 2004.
Under Mr. Kemper’s leadership, UMB continues its claim as one of the  largest independent banks in America  and remains fiercely committed to its customers. Since 1913, UMB has provided a  wide range of products and services that help customers reach their financial  dreams. UMB operates with the highest integrity and focus on growing clients’  business and investments and controlling their financial risks. 
Because UMB operates transparently and responsibly, the company’s  financial portfolios remain resilient and sound. As Mr. Kemper states, “We have  some of the most intelligent and experienced people in the financial industry  who truly understand how to manage relationships – creating comfort and trust  with customers. I’m proud to say that for more than 95 years, we have remained  a safe, stable and strong financial services company built to survive and  thrive in all times.”
A Kansas City native, Mr. Kemper plays an  important role in both civic and philanthropic endeavors.  He is involved in a variety of organizations,  but one of the causes he is most passionate about is the arts. He currently  serves as a trustee for the Denver   Art Museum and as a board  member for The Arts Council of Metropolitan Kansas City.
His first large  leadership role for the arts came in the late 1990s when he was appointed  Campaign Chairperson for the Commission on Art, Culture & Film in Denver.  During that time, he was instrumental in  bringing a significant amount of art to public construction projects such as  the Denver Center for the Performing Arts and the  Denver Public Library.  As a trustee for  the Denver Art Museum, Mariner co-chairs the Corporate  Committee.
In addition to his  passion for the arts, Mr. Kemper also is involved with several other civic and  philanthropic initiatives. His involvement includes board member for the American  Royal in Kansas City,  member of the Kansas City Civic Council, member of the Kansas City Downtown  Council, board member of the Denver Public Schools Foundation and board member  of National Jewish Health, among others.
Professionally, Mr.  Kemper also has continued this charitable legacy through his business  practices. One of UMB’s core philosophies is its commitment to the communities  it serves.  In addition to providing a  solid portfolio of financial products, the company also has utilized associate  volunteerism and corporate philanthropy to build a reputation as a strong  community partner.
Under Mr. Kemper’s  leadership, the company continues to emphasize expansion of access and  appreciation of the arts, furthering economic development, advancing  educational opportunities, agriculture, and promoting health and wellness. UMB  recently added sustainability as a core focus as well.
Mr. Kemper is a  frequent resource for local and national media. He was recently a special guest  on Bloomberg Television, and a featured columnist in the Kansas   City, St. Louis and Denver Business Journals. Mr. Kemper and UMB have  been featured in banking and finance stories for SmartMoney, Reuters, The Denver Post and The Kansas City Star, among others.
A graduate of the  University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington, Mr. Kemper has received  several accolades including Denver  Business Journal’s “40 under 40” and 5280  Magazine’s “22 to Watch in 2002.”

The Board of Directors is the governing body for the institution, charged with setting policy, approving large expenditures and approving the hiring of all officers. In addition, the Directors help raise funds and boost attendance at special events around the country.
Officers and Administration
The Officers and Administration work closely with the Board of Directors to create a vision for the institution. These leaders then work to implement that vision with all faculty, staff and supporters by recruiting great people and setting policy.
Council of National Trustees
The Council of National Trustees acts as ambassadors for National Jewish Health. They help to organize events, raise funds and spread the word about our institution – in their own communities throughout the country.

What Makes Us Different?
Property Data + People Data
Our reports include the traditional info you’d expect to find about a property (ownership, deeds, tax info, etc.), but we dig deeper and offer background records on people too.
Find criminal background records on owners, registered sex offenders in the neighborhood, and more.










The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.



Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"
