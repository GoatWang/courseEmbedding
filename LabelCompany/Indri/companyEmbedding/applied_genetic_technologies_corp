Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation Key Developments

Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation Announces Publication of IND-Enabling Preclinical Data Demonstrating the Safety and Efficacy of AGTC-402 in the Treatment of Achromatopsia
Jun 15 17
Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation announced the publication of IND-enabling preclinical data demonstrating the safety and efficacy of AGTC-402 in the treatment of achromatopsia (ACHM) due to mutations in the CNGA3 gene. The study, Safety and Efficacy Evaluation of rAAV2tYF-PR.1-hCNGA3 Vector Delivered by Subretinal Injection in CNGA3 Mutant Achromatopsia Sheep appears in the June issue of Human Gene Therapy Clinical Development and was led by researchers at the Volcani Center and Hebrew University in Israel. The gene-based therapy used in this study, AGTC-402, utilizes AGTC’s proprietary AAV technology to deliver a functional copy of the human CNGA3 gene. Achromatopsia results from mutations in one of several genes. Two of these genes, CNGA3 and CNGB3, encode the alpha and beta subunits, respectively, of an ion channel that is essential for proper function of cone cells within the retina. About 75% of ACHM patients have mutations in one of these two genes; the remainder of cases result from mutations in one of several other genes. The study was conducted in 13 sheep with day-blindness due to mutations in the CNGA3 gene. This large animal model has been used successfully in the evaluation of other AAV-based gene therapies for ACHM. Nine animals received a low (n=4) or high (n=5) dose of AGTC-402 administered as a single subretinal injection to the right eye. A positive efficacy control group of four animals received a different AAV-CNGA3 vector shown to be effective in a previous study. Four animals distributed across the three experimental groups received an injection of carrier vehicle in the left eye. Animals were followed for 13 weeks post-injection. Key findings from the study include: Electroretinography (ERG) testing (30 Hz and CFFF) showed a significant increase in cone responses in treated eyes at Weeks 6 and 12 compared with pre-treatment responses (P<0.05) in all groups. ERG responses were also significantly higher at Weeks 6 and 12 when comparing treated and untreated eyes in animals receiving AGTC-402 (P<0.05). Animals receiving the positive efficacy control vector had significant increases in the 30 Hz response at Weeks 6 and 12 and in the CFFF response at 12 Weeks (P<0.05). Maze navigation tests showed significantly shorter navigation times (P<0.05) and reduced obstacle collisions in the vector-treated eye for all groups. Immunohistochemical analysis showed expression of the human CNGA3 gene in all 13 vector-treated eyes but not in untreated or vehicle treated eyes. No serum antibodies against the human CNGA3 protein were detected in any vector-treated animal. Subretinal injections were generally well tolerated and were not associated with any systemic toxicity. Most animals had mild to moderate side effects thought to be related to the surgical procedure, including inflammation, swelling and bleeding, which generally resolved without further intervention.


AGTC Announces Topline Safety Data for X-Linked Retinoschisis Phase 1/2 Study
Jun 8 17
Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation announced topline safety data for the dose escalation phase of the company's Phase 1/2 X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS) clinical trial, a program partnered with Biogen. Dr.  Pennesi will present results for the first 12 subjects enrolled in the low, middle and high dose groups of the Phase 1/2 dose escalation study.  Several subjects have been followed for more than one year. Mild to moderate ocular inflammation was observed in the treated eye for the majority of patients and resolved or was controlled either without further intervention or after treatment with topical or oral corticosteroids. No treatment related serious adverse events were reported and the treatment was generally well tolerated.


Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation Presents New Data on its AAV-Based Gene Therapies for the Treatment of Achromatopsia and X-Linked Retinitis Pigmentosa at the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy Annual Meeting
May 11 17
Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation announced the presentation of new data from studies in animal models of achromatopsia (ACHM) and X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) that support the company’s clinical development programs in these indications. The data were presented at the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy 20th Annual Meeting, taking place in Washington, D.C., May 10-13. ACHM and XLRP are rare inherited retinal diseases. ACHM results from mutations in either of the CNGB3 or CNGA3 genes. Mutations in these genes account for approximately 75% of the total achromatopsia patient population. Individuals with achromatopsia have markedly reduced visual acuity, extreme light sensitivity, and complete loss of color discrimination. XLRP affects boys, causing night blindness by the time they are ten, and progresses to legal blindness by their early forties. AGTC is developing a gene-based therapy for XLRP in collaboration with Biogen and expects to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) Application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for this product candidate this year. No systemic toxicity was associated with treatment and no consistent test article-related effects were observed. Two out of five animals treated with the higher dose of AAV2tYF-PR1.7-CNGA3 had microscopic findings of outer retinal atrophy, with or without inflammatory cells in the retina and choroid that were considered procedural- and/or test article-related. All vector-treated eyes demonstrated CNGA3 expression, and developed cone-mediated electroretinogram (ERG) responses with no change in rod-mediated ERG responses. Improvements in maze navigation times and obstacle collisions were observed in all vector-treated eyes compared with control eyes and with pre-dose results in the treated eyes. The researchers conclude that these results support the use of AAV2tYF-PR1.7-hCNGA3 in clinical studies in patients with achromatopsia caused by mutations in CNGA3. The poster will include results from a study evaluating the efficacy of two vectors (AAV2tYF-GRK1-RPGRco and AAV2tYF-GRK1-RPGRstb) containing the AAV2tYF capsid, human GRK1 promoter and a codon-optimized or stabilized version of the human RPGR gene administered subretinally in an animal model of mid-stage XLRP resulting from mutations in the RPGR gene. In this model, mid-stage disease occurs when animals are approximately 12 weeks of age and is associated with an approximate 40% loss of photoreceptors. Two animals per group received RPGRco in the right eye and RPGRstb in the left eye at each of three dose levels. Rescue of photoreceptor structure was assessed by clinical examination and histology and/or immunohistochemistry on retinal cryosections eight weeks post injection. No abnormal ophthalmic findings were noted in any eyes at the middle- or low-dose levels. Fundoscopic examination at 8 weeks post-dosage showed signs of retinal detachment and inflammation in the eyes injected with the high dose of either RPGRco or RPGRstb. Dose-dependent RPGR transgene expression was observed with both vectors, with greater RPGR expression noted in eyes injected with RPGRco compared with contralateral eyes injected with RPGRstb at the same dose levels. Correction of rod opsin and middle/long wavelength cone opsin mislocalization was demonstrated in all AAV-RPGR treated eyes. Researchers conclude that the results demonstrate greater RPGR expression with RPGRco compared with RPGRstb, and that the middle doses of both vectors resulted in optimal correction at mid-stage disease with limited inflammation in this animal model of XLRP.

Hospital Cancer Diagnostics Market | Analysis & Trends 2024
Press release from: Transparency Market Research - Medical Devices
Hospital Cancer Diagnostics MarketHospital Cancer Diagnostics Market: Overview 

Cancer is an acute disease caused by genetic malfunctions. Early diagnosis of cancer is very critical for providing accurate and effective treatment. A patient is subjected to variety of tests and exams in hospital as well as in the laboratories. Pap test was the first screening test used for detection of cancer which was promoted in the 1960s by the American Cancer Society. Significance of this test was that it helped in early diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer leading to decline in death rate of cervical cancer patients by about 70%.

In recent years, cancer diagnostics have evolved rapidly with introduction of new technologies and applications. Today several types of cancers are diagnosed using wide array of methods. The global market for hospital cancer diagnostics is expanding at exponential rate due to rising prevalence of cancer across the globe. Additionally, the advancement in understanding and treating cancer coupled with high awareness about the disease has heightened the demand for cancer diagnosis worldwide.

Hospital Cancer Diagnostics Market: Segmentation

The global hospital diagnostics market is segmented on the basis of type of cancer, such as breast cancer, bladder cancer, lung cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, oral cancer, skin cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, colon and rectal cancer, prostate cancer, stomach cancer, and other cancers.

The most common methods utilized for cancer diagnosis in hospital include laboratory tests (blood & urine tests), biopsy, endoscopy, diagnostic imaging, genetic tests, nuclear medicine scans (bone scans, etc.), and hematology tests. Diagnostic imaging for cancer diagnosis used several techniques like x-rays, CT (computerized tomography) and CAT (computerized axial tomography) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, mammography and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning.

Next generation cancer diagnostics include lab-on-a-chip, microarrays, multiplexed assays, next generation sequencing (NGS), pyro-sequencing, RT-PCR, Spectral Karyotyping (SKY), and cellular capture and identification. These technological advancements are creating favorable conditions for market growth.

Hospital Cancer Diagnostics Market: Regional Overview

Geographically, the global market for hospital cancer diagnostics is segmented into four major regions, namely, North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and Rest of the World. The World Health Organization has highlighted the disparity in policies on early cancer detection among several countries in the world. In developed countries such as the U.S., Canada, and some major countries in European Union, cancer screening programs for detecting cancer are common and more encouraged in comparison to least developed countries. Therefore, the present market for hospital diagnostic testing is dominated in North America and Europe while the future market lied in the potential markets of Asia-Pacific region.

According to WHO report, more than 60% of world’s total new annual cases occur in Africa, Asia and Central and South America. Lack of early diagnosis caused patients to die and these regions account for approximately 70% of the global cancer deaths. Such high prevalence of cancer disease in these regions will compel governments in these nations to implement cancer screening programs.

Hospital Cancer Diagnostics Market: Key Players

Some of the major companies which provide technology platforms and diagnostic technology for cancer diagnosis include Abbott, AdnaGen AG, Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation, Beckman Coulter/Danaher Corporation, Becton Dickinson and Company, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., bioMerieux SA, Dako (a Agilent Technologies company), Cepheid, Inc., diaDexus, Inc., Myriad Genetics, Inc., QIAGEN N.V., Hologic Corporation, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics (a Johnson & Johnson company), F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Thermo Fisher Scientific Corporation, Sequenom, Inc. and GE Healthcare.

	AGTC is a clinical-stage biotechnology company that uses its proprietary gene therapy platform to develop products designed to transform the lives of patients with severe diseases, with an initial focus in ophthalmology. AGTC's lead product candidates focus on inherited orphan diseases of the eye, caused by mutations in single genes that significantly affect visual function and currently lack effective medical treatments.


	AGTC's product pipeline includes six named ophthalmology development programs across five targets (X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS), X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP), achromatopsia, wet age-related macular degeneration and blue cone monochromacy), one non-ophthalmology program (alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency) and proof-of-concept data in multiple additional indications. AGTC employs a highly targeted approach to selecting and designing its product candidates, choosing to develop therapies for indications having high unmet medical need, clinical feasibility and commercial potential. AGTC has a significant intellectual property portfolio and expertise in the design of gene therapy products including capsids, promoters and expression cassettes, as well as, expertise in the formulation, manufacture and physical delivery of gene therapy products.

	AGTC is a clinical-stage biotechnology company that uses its proprietary gene therapy platform to develop products designed to transform the lives of patients with severe diseases, with an initial focus in ophthalmology. AGTC's lead product candidates focus on inherited orphan diseases of the eye, caused by mutations in single genes that significantly affect visual function and currently lack effective medical treatments.


	AGTC's product pipeline includes six named ophthalmology development programs across five targets (X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS), X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP), achromatopsia, wet age-related macular degeneration and blue cone monochromacy), one non-ophthalmology program (alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency) and proof-of-concept data in multiple additional indications. AGTC employs a highly targeted approach to selecting and designing its product candidates, choosing to develop therapies for indications having high unmet medical need, clinical feasibility and commercial potential. AGTC has a significant intellectual property portfolio and expertise in the design of gene therapy products including capsids, promoters and expression cassettes, as well as, expertise in the formulation, manufacture and physical delivery of gene therapy products.

Technology
New treatments, new hope





At AGTC, we use gene therapy to develop long-lasting treatments for patients with genetic disorders.
Gene therapy replaces broken genes with normal functional genes, allowing a patient’s own body to produce proteins to treat their illness. A single treatment provides long-lasting benefit – sometimes even for a lifetime - leading to a better quality of life for patients worldwide.
Our technology
The innovative delivery method AGTC uses is the non-toxic adeno-associated virus (AAV), a safe virus that delivers healthy copies of the gene, replacing defective copies.
AAV is an ideal delivery method because:

It is safe, having never been shown to cause disease.
It is effective and provides long-lasting benefit.
Its production is fully scalable and does not require animal-derived products.
It has been approved for use in human clinical trials by U.S. and European regulatory agencies.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Ask away.  We have answers.



Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
