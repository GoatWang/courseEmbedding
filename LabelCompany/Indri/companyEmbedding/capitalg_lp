Capital Lumber to Distribute LP Products
 By LBM Journal  / 2 months ago

Capital Lumber Company has announced a partnership with Louisiana Pacific Building Products (LP) to distribute their product lines throughout Northern California. The LP product lines, which include LP SmartSide Siding & Trim and LP FlameBlock Panels, are an ideal fit for the dramatic climate variation throughout Northern California, Capital Lumber said in an announcement of the partnership. Because the products meet key performance criteria, Capital sees significant growth potential for LP Smart products within this specific market.
Capital will service Central California to the northern border and Western Nevada through both their Healdsburg and Sacramento distribution centers.

Company Overview



	Capital Product Partners L.P. (Nasdaq: CPLP) is an international, diversified shipping company and leader in the seaborne transportation of a wide range of cargoes, including crude oil, refined oil products, such as gasoline, diesel, fuel oil, jet fuel and edible oils, as well as dry cargo and containerized goods. As a publicly traded master limited partnership, CPLP has elected to be treated as a C-Corp. for tax purposes which is most beneficial for U.S. investors (as they receive the standard 1099 form). The Partnership is well-positioned to benefit from the long-term growth dynamics of the global shipping industry and to capitalize on potential acquisition opportunities in the fragmented shipping market. CPLP benefits from the commercial and technical management agreement with its Sponsor, Capital Maritime & Trading Corp. ("Capital Maritime"), an established and reputable diversified shipping company. For more information on Capital Product Partners L.P. please see our Annual Report 2016.
