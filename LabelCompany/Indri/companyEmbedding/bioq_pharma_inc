Our Product Portfolio
BioQ Pharma has a robust portfolio of ready-to-use infusible pharmaceuticals that includes our lead products and product candidates for post-surgical pain and anesthesia, as well as our development stage assets in sedation, antibiotics and oncology.
 






Platform
BioQ Pharma has a proprietary platform intended to address the >$75 billion global infusible drug market. Our unique infusion pharmaceuticals include a unit-dose of the drug, delivery system and administration line in one self-contained and ready-to-use presentation.

 






Post-Operative Pain
BioQ Pharma’s Ropivacaine infusion pharmaceutical is prefilled with 0.2% ropivacaine and is intended to provide a safer, more efficient solution (at a lower total cost) than fillable pain pumps. It is designed to provide non-narcotic pain relief for at least 48 hours. Our Ropivacaine infusible pharmaceutical is applicable to surgical procedures conducted in hospitals and surgery centers. We estimate that there are at least 11 million US and 22 million EU applicable surgical procedures for our Ropivacaine infusion pharmaceutical.
BioQ Pharma will market the Ropivacaine infusion pharmaceutical through our commercial collaborators Sandoz (for U.S.), Cipla (for EU and India), Lee’s Pharm (for China and Taiwan) and Lunatus (for certain Gulf countries).



 






Anesthesia & Sedation
Propofol is one of the world’s most commonly used procedural anesthetic agents. It is often the anesthetic of choice in outpatient surgery and endoscopy centers, given the significant patient benefits of faster sedation and rapid recovery. BioQ Pharma’s Propofol infusion pharmaceutical features programmable flow and bolus capabilities. Our ready-to-use Propofol pharmaceutical presentation has been designed to help providers increase patient throughput, while improving safety and sterility for patients. We believe there are approximately 40 million applicable procedures in both the US and Europe annually.
BioQ Pharma will market the Propofol infusion pharmaceutical through our commercial collaborators Sandoz (for U.S.), Lee’s Pharm (for China and Taiwan), and Lunatus (for certain Gulf countries).



 






Pipeline
BioQ Pharma’s pipeline is also comprised of development stage infusion pharmaceutical candidates targeting significant global markets. Our pipeline spans antibiotics, sedation, and oncology pharmaceuticals, with worldwide market opportunities that we believe exceed $1 billion in each therapeutic segment.

 





The proprietary infusion pharmaceuticals shown constitute investigational product candidates that require FDA approval before they can be marketed in the United States of America.

Addressing the most pressing unmet needs in infusion today
BioQ Pharma is a late stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing a portfolio of large volume ready-to-use infusible pharmaceuticals. Our vision is to set a new standard of care in the presentation and administration of infusible pharmaceuticals via our proprietary unit-dose infusion systems that can be deployed quickly and conveniently at the point of care with one touch. Our infusion platform is intended to address some of the most pressing unmet needs in infusion today: cost, medication error, sterility, efficiency, and patient quality of life.
BioQ Pharma’s pre-filled infusion systems are applicable to the majority of infusible drugs, spanning post-operative pain management, anesthesia/sedation, chemotherapy, anti-infectives, and biologics. We are focused on the untapped opportunity in unit-dose large volume parenteral drugs. Our ready-to-use infusion pharmaceuticals are intended to provide safety, sterility, value, and convenience. Our value proposition to providers, payors, and patients includes reducing the potential for medication errors, increasing efficiencies by streamlining logistics, and reducing the number of hands that touch the drug en route, thereby enhancing safety and reducing the total cost of drug delivery.
We utilize a de-risked commercialization strategy in which BioQ Pharma is the innovator and manager of its network of manufacturing partners to supply finished product to leading pharmaceutical companies for sale under their private label.

Our Focus 






BioQ Pharma intends to set a new standard of care in the presentation and administration of infusible pharmaceuticals
Our focus is developing and commercializing small and large-volume parenteral infusion products that are pre-filled and ready-to-use.  BioQ Pharma’s unit-dose infusion pharmaceuticals are intended to enhance safety, sterility, value and convenience. 






Safety
BioQ Pharma’s product designs are pre-filled and ready-to-use at the point of care. The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists has stated that medication should be provided in the most ready-to-use form to the person responsible for administration.
Our ready-to-use infusion pharmaceuticals are:

Pre-filled to minimize medication errors
Designed for the specific dosing regimen of each drug
Single patient & single use
Disposable following use

Our ready-to-use infusion pharmaceuticals are intended to minimize medication errors because they are pre-filled by the manufacturer and the dispensing systems dosing capability is uniquely designed around each drug.

 






Sterility
BioQ Pharma’s infusion pharmaceuticals are presented in self-contained, ready-to-use, unit-dose dispensing systems with sterile drugs. Because the systems are pre-filled at the site of manufacture, manual preparation steps (that often compromise the sterility of the drug) are not required.
Our infusion pharmaceuticals are:

Presented with sterile drug
Self-contained
Ready-to-use at the point of care
Pre-prepared and require no external drug transfer


 






Value
Our ready-to-use infusion pharmaceuticals are positioned to create value for patients, providers, and payers by lowering the total cost of drug delivery.
Reducing the number of hands that touch the drug en route to the patient can lower costs by:

Reducing pharmacy time
Eliminating filling and preparation steps
Limiting waste and product expiry
Enabling early ambulation and mobility
Reducing nursing time


 






Convenience
BioQ Pharma’s infusion pharmaceuticals can be immediately deployed at the point-of-care without multiple preparation steps.
The unit-dose infusion packages are:

Activated with a single touch
Unit-dose for a single patient
Drug specific
Disposable following use

BioQ Pharma Receives Australian Regulatory Approval for Ropivacaine ReadyFusOR




















March 14, 2017 08:00 ET

 | Source: BioQ Pharma






SAN FRANCISCO, March  14, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioQ Pharma Incorporated (“the Company”), a specialty pharmaceutical company, today announced that the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has approved the Company’s Ropivacaine ReadyFusOR for the treatment of post-surgical pain in adults via continuous peripheral nerve block and continuous wound infiltration.  With well over two million surgical procedures annually, the market opportunity for post-surgical pain therapies in Australia is estimated to be more than A$500 million. The Ropivacaine ReadyFusOR is a disposable ready-to-use, single use infusion product, which is pre-filled by the manufacturer with 0.2% Ropivacaine, a non-narcotic local anesthetic. It is a self-contained drug and administration system for delivery at the point of care, activated by a single touch. The Ropivacaine ReadyFusOR contains a unit-dose of the sterile drug and is hermetically sealed until time of use. Josh Kriesel, President and CEO of BioQ Pharma, commented, “We look forward to launching Ropivacaine ReadyFusOR in Australia in the near-term. There is a need for completely ready-to-use pharmaceutical products that can help avoid the filling errors and breaches in sterility commonly associated with conventional elastomeric pumps and other post-operative pain treatments.” Walter Cleymans, Chief Commercial Officer of BioQ Pharma, stated, “Ropivacaine ReadyFusOR will minimize the number of hands that touch the drug en route to the patient, while enabling the opportunity for early mobility and discharge with a well-known local anesthetic.” About BioQ Pharma BioQ Pharma Incorporated is a privately held specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing ready-to-use infusible pharmaceuticals. The Company's infusion platform is intended to address some of the most pressing unmet needs in drug infusion today: cost, medication error, sterility, efficiency, and patient quality of life. BioQ Pharma's vision is to set a new standard of care in the presentation and administration of infusible pharmaceuticals via the Company's proprietary unit-dose infusion systems that can be deployed quickly and conveniently at the point of care with one touch.

BioQuiddity Website Redesign Yields BioQ Pharma
by Merrily Chopp | October 27th, 2015 BioQuiddity is a San Francisco-based, late stage specialty pharmaceutical company. They came to PINT, Inc. to work on a redesign that included some major updates, including a new name: BioQ Pharma. PINT helped the BioQ  Pharma team redesign their site to showcase their unique products: unit-dose systems for a specialized portfolio of infusible pharmaceuticals.

While BioQ Pharma’s product may sound complicated, it is actually straightforward. They allow doctors to safely deliver medicine to patients. Their website redesign project was similarly straightforward.
Website Redesign Details
The project began on strong footing, when the client came to the project with key redesign wishes in-hand. They included concepts and specifics, such as:

Professional/conservative design geared toward medical professionals
Clean style, with large images, large text, strong messaging
Messaging and design focused on presenting the product and the company as trustworthy, consistent, and solid to businesses and doctors

Redesign Goals
With a clear list of wishes, PINT set to work setting up the goals for the project. They would include:
New Navigation
PINT’s Information Architect revised the sitemap and navigation of the site to make it easy to use, as well as accommodate future growth in content.
  
With the new website, BioQ decided to update their name as well. They officially changed from BioQuiddity to BioQ Pharma. That name change meant a new website domain name was also in order. When the new website launched, PINT updated the DNS for the old www.bioquiddity.com domain to make it an alias to www.bioqpharma.com (the new primary domain). That way anyone who still tried to access www.bioquiddity.com would still find the right site.
Additionally, individual pages within the old site need to have their paths redirect (with a 301 permanent redirect) to the proper location on the new site. For example, www.bioquiddity.com/about.html should redirect to www.bioqpharma.com/company/. This allows for any previously existing inbound links to still direct traffic to the proper content. With Google Webmaster Tools, PINT is working with the BioQ Pharma team to find any additional links to www.bioquiddity.com on the web. That way, BioQ Pharma can try and outreach to the linking site to update the URL to an appropriate page on the new site. This will help with search engine optimization (SEO) as well as user experience.
One final touch for returning visitors who may be confused about the new name is a visual “bug” that appears on the homepage.

This message appears when users visit the homepage to let them know they are in the right place if they were looking for Bioquiddity.
Updated Style and Design
PINT’s Visual Designer revamped the look and feel of the site to align with the BioQ Pharma teams wishes.
 
BioQ Pharma also came to the project with a willingness to obtain custom photographs of their products. Custom photos help to bring a professional look to a site in a way that iPhone snapshots can only come close to replicating.
  
Stock photos, when utilized, were comprehensively researched to best fit the new, doctor-oriented focus for the site.
  
Another new design feature in the redesign project is the pipeline graphic. The BioQ Pharma team wanted to make sure the pipeline was included so they could easily show how many products they are developing and the production stage for each product (separated by different regions worldwide). 

“The product pipeline is a great way for interested visitors to quickly and easily understand when BioQ Pharma’s products will be available.”
Geordie Dudley PINT Project Manager


Responsive Web Design (RWD)
PINT’s production team coded the site so that it is usable for visitors on a variety of devices. Using responsive web design helps to eliminate unnecessary scrolling and/or zooming for users on laptops, tablets, and cell phones.

A Redesign to Last for Years to Come
This redesign project was planned to meet the BioQ Pharma team’s needs and wishes. However, the new navigation, updated styling, and responsive features ensure this redesign will accommodate the company for years to come, even as they add more products, content, and other features.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.
