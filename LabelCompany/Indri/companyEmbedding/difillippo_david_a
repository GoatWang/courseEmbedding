This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Steve DiFillippo  :: It’s All About the Guest








“After 25 years I feel that I am just getting started.” says Davio’s Chef/CEO, Steve DiFillippo. At the age of 24, Steve purchased an established restaurant called Davio’s in Boston’s Back Bay. And this was the first in a succession of popular restaurants changing the concept to a Northern Italian Steakhouse. Steve is a graduate of Boston University and the Cambridge School of Culinary Arts. He is very involved in the community, serving on several non-profit boards. Steve is the honorary Chef representing the New England Patriots at the Taste of the NFL’s “Party with a Purpose” event at the SuperBowl.
Steve DiFillippo is a different kind of celebrity chef — famous among the famous more than he is among the general public.
—Kerry Byrne, Food & Sports Writer
In 2008, he was inducted into the Massachusetts Restaurant Hall of Fame. Steve lives in Wenham, MA, with his wife Pamela and their four children. He runs 4–5 miles a day, “so I can wrongfully delude myself that I can eat anything I want,” he says.
