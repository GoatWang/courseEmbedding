              Abstract




Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited, genetic condition characterized by reduced serum levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) and increased risk of developing emphysema and liver disease, which affects up to 100,000 individuals in the United States. The only currently approved therapy for this orphan disease is weekly intravenous infusions of AAT protein that has been purified from normal plasma donors. The current therapy is in short supply, resulting in low physician motivation to accurately diagnose the vast majority of patients, since not all of the minority of patients who are currently diagnosed are able to receive treatment. The long-term objective of the research proposed in this application is to develop and bring to market a novel, gene therapy product for the treatment of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, using a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) serotype 1 vector expressing the human AAT gene (rAAV1-CB-hAAT). rAAV vectors are uniquely suitable for in vivo gene therapy because they are non-toxic, highly efficient at transducing a wide variety of non-dividing cell types, and persist for long periods, primarily in episomal form, resulting in long-term expression of the transgene. 
The specific aim  of this research proposal is to perform a Phase 2 clinical trial of rAAV1-CB-hAAT. The study is a non-randomized, open-label, multi-center, sequential, three-arm, Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of administration of a rAAV1-CB-hAAT vector administered by intramuscular (IM) injection. Each participant will receive rAAV1-CB-hAAT on a single occasion. Three groups of three subjects each will receive rAAV1-CB-hAAT at dosage levels of 6 x 1011 vector genome (vg)/kg, 1.9 x 1012 vg/kg or 6 x 1012 vg/kg by IM injection. Subjects in group 1 will receive a total of 10 IM injections distributed across a single muscle site, subjects in group 2 will receive a total of 32 IM injections distributed across three muscle sites, and subjects in group 3 will receive 100 IM injections distributed across10 muscle sites. Each injection will be given in a volume of 1.35 mL, at the appropriate vector concentration to achieve the desired total vector dose, and the injection density at each administration site (nine IM injections per 4 cm2 skin surface area) will be the same as the injection density that was well tolerated in a previous Phase 1 clinical trial with rAAV1-CB-hAAT. Safety will be monitored by evaluation of adverse events, hematology and clinical chemistry parameters, histological examination of muscle biopsies, and measurement of serum antibodies to AAT. Efficacy will be measured by evaluation of serum concentrations of M-specific AAT and total AAT and serum AAT phenotype determined on isoelectric focusing gels. Additional information to be collected will include presence of the vector in blood or semen, changes in serum anti-AAV antibody titers, and changes in T cell responses to AAV and AAT. Results from this Phase 2 trial will be used to develop a Phase 3 study designed to satisfy the requirements for licensure of a gene therapy treatment for this orphan disease.
Public Health Relevance
Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is an important public health issue that affects up to 100,000 Americans, but the vast majority of patients are not treated due to extremely limited supplies of the only therapy currently available. This project will evaluate a novel, gene therapy product for the treatment of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate safety and the ability to achieve serum levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin protein that are adequate to reduce the risk of lung disease caused by alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

              Abstract




The applicant's objective is to develop an alphavirus replicon particle (VRP) vaccine based on HIV subtype C clinical isolates from South Africa. The applicant has developed an initial product design incorporating the gag gene for an initial phase I trial via the HVTN, and has initiated preclinical evaluation of alternative multi-gene vaccines for a second phase 1 trial. In addition, different VRP glycoprotein coats offer possible advantages in immunogenicity, dose, and production. The applicant's proposal addresses three objectives: Objective 1: efforts related to GMP production of subtype C HIV gag VRP vaccine. This objective aims to complete development work and GMP manufacture in response to clinical hold questions received from the FDA under an IND submitted in December, 2001: a) establish new Vero cell banks and conduct cell bank adventitious agent and tumorigenicity testing, b) manufacture pilot and GMP lots and conduct release testing (adventitious agent tests) of GMP lot, c) conduct stability and immunogenicity testing of pilot and GMP lots, d) prepare and submit IND amendment. Objective 2: efforts related to GMP production and IND submission of a multi-gene subtype C HIV VRP vaccine, This objective builds on the applicant's efforts to date in the design and construction of multiple alternative multi-gene VRP constructs employing the gag, pol, env, and nef genes in various single and combined replicons, and in process improvements needed to advance the manufacturing process beyond phase I trials: a) evaluate and incorporate alternative process improvements to the manufacturing process: 1) decrease or eliminate serum from the culture media, 2) evaluate alternative formulations to improve stability, 3) evaluate alternatives to heparin affinity chromatography to increase purity, 4) evaluate process modifications that increase VRP yield and scaleability, 5) qualify new analytical test methods and initiate assay validation work; b) produce 2-3 pilot lots and transfer new manufacturing process and test methods to GMP subcontractor; manufacture, test, and release 2-3 GMP lots; implement stability program; conduct preclinical GLP toxicology and immunogenicity testing; develop clinical protocol with HVTN and prepare IND. Objective 3: efforts related to study of alternative glycoprotein coats. Produce lab-scale multi-gene VRP with existing and new glycoprotein coats, compare mouse immunogenicity leading to primate studies in a DoD collaboration.

Abstract   Purpose :
     To select the preferred adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid and promoter, and to construct a stable full-length retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR) cDNA for AAV-based gene therapy of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) caused by mutations in the RPGR gene    Methods :
     GRK1 and IRBP are two small photoreceptor specific promoters able to drive RPGR transgene expression in dogs with XLRP disease (Beltran et al, 2012). The ability of IRBP and GRK1 promotors, and AAV2tYF and AAV5 capsids, to target photoreceptors was evaluated in non-human primates (NHPs) by subretinal injection of AAV vectors containing a GFP expression cassette. Cynomolgus macaques receiving bilateral subretinal injection of 0.1 mL of AAV vector at a concentration of 5 x 1011 vg/mL or 2 x1012 vg/mL were followed for up to 12 weeks. GFP expression was evaluated by observation of fluorescence (in-life), and by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (post-mortem). hRPGR cDNA was codon modified based on the cDNA sequence published by Alan Wright (variant C; NM_001034853). The codon modified hRPGR cDNA encodes a full length hRPGR protein whose amino acid sequence is 100% identical to the published sequence. Synthesized hRPGR cDNA was first cloned in pUC57 cloning vector and then in AAV plasmid for AAV production. Stability of hRPGR cDNA sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing at each step of cloning and also in the AAV preparations    Results :
     In NHPs, direct comparison between AAV2tYF-GRK1-GFP and AAV5-GRK1-GFP revealed that AAV2tYF-GRK1-GFP achieved an overall better GFP-reporter gene expression in photoreceptors than AAV5-GRK1-GFP at both dose levels. In contrast to the observation from published studies in dogs, minimal or no GFP expression was present in the eyes receiving the AAV5-IRBP-GFP vector. The redesigned full-length RPGR cDNA, cloned in either a conventional cloning vector or in an AAV plasmid, was stable during large scale plasmid production and AAV vector manufacturing.    Conclusions :
     The GRK1 promoter was significantly more efficient than IRBP promoter at directing expression in primate photoreceptors and AAV2tYF is a preferred capsid. A stable RPGR cDNA that encode full-length, native RPGR protein was obtained. These results should inform the design of an AAV vector for treatment of patients with XLRP.  This is an abstract that was submitted for the 2016 ARVO Annual Meeting, held in Seattle, Wash., May 1-5, 2016.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
