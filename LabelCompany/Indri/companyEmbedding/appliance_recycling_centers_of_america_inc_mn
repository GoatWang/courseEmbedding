(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results.  Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements  This quarterly report contains statements that are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and  The forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report, and other written and oral forward-looking statements made by us from time to time, are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking information regarding our operations will be affected primarily by individual retail stores' profitability, the volume of appliance sales, the strength of energy conservation recycling programs and general economic conditions affecting consumer demand for appliances. Any forward-looking information will also be affected by our continued ability to purchase product from our suppliers at acceptable prices, the ability of individual retail stores to meet planned revenue levels, the number of retail stores, costs and expenses being realized at higher than expected levels, our ability to secure an adequate supply of special-buy appliances for resale, the ability to secure appliance recycling and replacement contracts with sponsors of energy efficiency programs, the ability of customers to supply units under their recycling contracts with us, the performance of our consolidated variable interest entity, the continued availability of our current line of credit and the outcome of the pending sales and use tax examination in California. Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 (including the information presented therein under Risk Factors), as well as our reports on Forms 10-Q and other publicly available information. All amounts herein are unaudited.  Overview  Appliance Recycling Centers of America, Inc. and Subsidiaries ("we," the "Company" or "ARCA") are in the business of being the bridge between utilities or manufacturers to their customers by recycling, replacing, and selling major household appliances in North America. We are committed to energy efficiency and have been a pioneer in appliance recycling programs.  We operate two reportable segments:  � Retail: Our retail segment offers the latest in innovative appliance from major manufactures. We generate income from the sale of appliances and related services through 18 ApplianceSmart(R) stores in four geographic areas. We have an online presence and also include a portion of our revenue from byproducts from collected appliances. We have two product lines, new and out-of-the-box that give the large manufacturers a channel to move their product without disrupting their normal distribution channels.  � Recycling: Our recycling segment is a turnkey appliance recycling program. We receive fees charged for recycling, replacement and additional services for utility energy efficiency programs and have established 17 Regional Processing Centers ("RPCs") for this segment throughout the United States and Canada. Our recycling segment also includes all income generated from our agreement with GE Appliances, a Haier Group Company ("GE"). GE sells us recyclable appliances in certain regions of the United States and we collect, process, and recycle the appliances. These appliances include units manufactured by GE and by other manufacturers. The agreement requires that we will only recycle, and will not sell for re-use or resale, the recyclable appliances. We have established Regional Processing Centers ("RPCs") in Philadelphia and Louisville to support our agreement with GE. The RPC in Philadelphia is operated by ARCA Advanced Processing, LLC ("AAP") through a joint venture agreement between ARCA and 4301 Operations, LLC ("4301"). AAP employs advanced technology to refine traditional appliance recycling techniques to achieve optimal revenue-generating and environmental benefits. We are also the exclusive North American distributor for UNTHA Recycling Technology ("URT"), one of the world's leading manufacturers of technologically advanced refrigerator recycling systems and recycling facilities for electrical household appliances and electronic scrap.  With more than 850 million major household appliances currently used in the United States and Canada, ARCA's business segments are positioned to work together to provide a full array of appliance-related services. ARCA's recycling centers maximize materials recycling while protecting natural resources from the environmentally-damaging substances found in old appliances. We believe we are the future of appliance sales and recycling to manage a full life cycle that will maximize the economic, environmental and societal benefits that recycling provides for the next generation.
