Closing out a great week at AquaRefinery 1



April 21, 2017 

Had a great day hosting a group of strategic visitors today at the AquaRefinery. Also had a chance to film some more of the recycling process from battery feedstock arrival through breaking and separation. (We’ll be posting that video very soon.). I could not be more impressed and honored to keep company with the entire team.

Aqua Metals acquired Ebonex to help create the future advanced lead acid battery



April 18, 2017 

Part of the reason we co-founded AquaMetals was from a deep-seated belief that we haven’t seen the best of lead acid batteries (LABs) yet and that there could be a market for advanced materials, equipment and processes to support a new wave of LABs.

Time-lapse of AquaRefinery BuildWe broke ground in mid-August 2015 and completed the base building and enclosure in mid-March. This is a time-lapse of getting the 138,000 square foot building built in 7 months.











Battery recycling without the issuesOur Mission is to eliminate the inefficiency, costs and toxic waste associated with conventional smelter based recycling of Lead Acid Batteries. Our breakthrough, AquaRefining, delivers a better product, at a higher yield, eliminates toxic waste, reduces permitting and is less expensive to build than smelting.








96% of all rechargeable batteries produced are lead acid batteries (LAB)

LAB production continues to grow at 18-30% per year
Still the most cost effective battery for many high growth applications












Lead is the World’s most recycled material

Almost 100% of new LABs contain some recycled “Secondary Lead”
Modern LABs require high purity “Primary lead”












Currently all LAB recycling uses Lead Smelting – an old, inefficient and polluting technology.

Smelting produces low grade “Secondary Lead”
Production of  Primary Lead from smelting, requires further refining









Lead Recycling Reinvented

AquaMetals’ mission is to transform the Lead Acid Battery recycling industry to be better for today’s world. Our revolutionary modular AquaRefining recycling technology is cleaner, more cost effective and energy efficient, and produces ultra-pure lead to modernize an important global recycling activity in a socially responsible manner. 
Lead is the most recycled material in the world. All lead acid battery recycling currently utilizes lead smelting, a high temperature thermal reduction process which generates toxic liquid, gases and particulate waste which it is difficult and expensive to manage.  In the US many lead smelters have failed to meet environmental standards.  In less regulated countries smelters operate with limited environmental safeguards.  As such lead smelting is often listed in the World’s top 5 most polluting industries. 
Our world deserves better. AquaMetals makes the highest purity lead cost effectively - without pollution.

Closing out a great week at AquaRefinery 1



April 21, 2017 

Had a great day hosting a group of strategic visitors today at the AquaRefinery.

Company Reports Milestone of First Commercial Revenues

ALAMEDA, Calif., July  25, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aqua Metals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AQMS) ("Aqua Metals" or the "Company"), which is commercializing a non-polluting electrochemical lead recycling technology called AquaRefining™, has provided preliminary revenue results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2017. The Company expects total revenues for the second quarter of 2017 to be $603,000, which represents the commencement of commercial revenues.
"Moving into revenue generation is another significant milestone in the growth of Aqua Metals" said Dr. Stephen Clarke, Chairman and CEO of Aqua Metals. "What we have accomplished to-date is truly unprecedented and represents a level of progress not generally seen in advanced materials technologies. Having founded AquaMetals in 2014, we secured funding for and broke ground at our first AquaRefinery in 2015, obtained supply agreements, key permits, completed construction and started commissioning in 2016; and in the first half of 2017 we secured a commercial and licensing relationship with Johnson Controls, made our first acquisition, had our first patent issue and began revenue producing operations from the sale of lead compounds and plastics.  I am excited about our progress and proud of our team and its achievements.  We have worked hard to bring the front-end of our process into consistent operation and are now working to install the balance of our AquaRefining modules as we work towards our goal of achieving 120 metric tonnes per day of capacity by year end."
Clarke, continued: "We are working to expand the reach and scope of our technology with additional facilities of our own, the commencement of equipment licensing and the expansion of our product offerings to include advanced materials and methods to advance the capabilities of lead acid batteries. We look forward to delivering sustainable, long-term results for our shareholders."
About Aqua MetalsAqua Metals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AQMS) is reinventing lead recycling with its patented and patent-pending AquaRefiningTM technology. Unlike smelting, AquaRefining is a room temperature, water-based process that is fundamentally non-polluting. These modular systems allow the Company to vastly reduce environmental impact and scale lead acid recycling production capacity both by building its own AquaRefineries and licensing the AquaRefining technology to partners. This meets growing demand for lead to power new applications including stop/start automobile batteries which complement the vehicle's main battery, Internet data centers, alternative energy applications including solar, wind, and grid scale storage. Aqua Metals is based in Alameda, California, and has built its first recycling facility in Nevada's Tahoe Reno Industrial Complex. To learn more, please visit www.aquametals.com.
Safe Harbor This press release contains forward-looking statements concerning Aqua Metals, Inc., the lead acid battery recycling industry, the future of lead acid battery recycling via traditional smelters, the Company's development of its commercial lead acid battery recycling facilities and the quality, efficiency and profitability of the Company's proposed lead acid battery recycling operations. Those forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Among those factors are: (1) the fact that the Company only recently commenced revenue producing operations, thus subjecting the Company to all of the risks inherent in a pre-revenue start-up; (2) risks related to Aqua Metals' ability to raise sufficient capital, as and when needed, to develop and operate its recycling facilities; (3) changes in the federal, state and foreign laws regulating the recycling of lead acid batteries; (4) the Company's ability to protect its proprietary technology, trade secrets and know-how and (5) those other risks disclosed in the section "Risk Factors" included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 2, 2017. Aqua Metals cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. The Company does not undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligation, to update or revise such statements to reflect new circumstances or unanticipated events as they occur.

Time-lapse of AquaRefinery BuildWe broke ground in mid-August 2015 and completed the base building and enclosure in mid-March. This is a time-lapse of getting the 138,000 square foot building built in 7 months.











Battery recycling without the issuesOur Mission is to eliminate the inefficiency, costs and toxic waste associated with conventional smelter based recycling of Lead Acid Batteries. Our breakthrough, AquaRefining, delivers a better product, at a higher yield, eliminates toxic waste, reduces permitting and is less expensive to build than smelting.








96% of all rechargeable batteries produced are lead acid batteries (LAB)

LAB production continues to grow at 18-30% per year
Still the most cost effective battery for many high growth applications












Lead is the World’s most recycled material

Almost 100% of new LABs contain some recycled “Secondary Lead”
Modern LABs require high purity “Primary lead”












Currently all LAB recycling uses Lead Smelting – an old, inefficient and polluting technology.

Smelting produces low grade “Secondary Lead”
Production of  Primary Lead from smelting, requires further refining









Lead Recycling Reinvented
