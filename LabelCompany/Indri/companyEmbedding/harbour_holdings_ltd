WHY CHOOSE RESEARCH AND MARKETS?



WORLD'S LARGEST SELECTION




TRUSTED BY THE BEST




CUSTOMER FOCUSED




SAFE & SECURE







When I was placing my order I was unsure if my Visa card was authorised for the transaction and was unsure

                         if my payment would be successful.
One minute after I inserted the VISA for payment I had a call from Claire from Research and Markets outlining there was a problem with my card and offering me different solutions to overcome that issue.

It was a great customer experience that clearly surprised me in a very positive way. I shared the experience with some of my colleagues at the office. thanks for your quick and efficient service!

The Cross-Harbour (Holdings) Limited Provides Earnings Guidance for the Six Months Ended 30 June 2017
Jul 11 17
The Cross-Harbour (Holdings) Limited provided earnings guidance for the six months ended 30 June 2017. For the period, the Group's profit attributable to the equity holders of the company for the period is expected to increase significantly by over 300% as compared with that of the corresponding period in 2016. The expected increase in profit is primarily attributable to an estimated significant unrealised fair value gain of over HKD 200 million on the revaluation of the Group's trading securities investment due to improved equity market performance during the first half year as well as at the end of the period. The Group recorded a substantial fair value loss of HKD 138.2 million on trading securities investment in the corresponding period in 2016.
