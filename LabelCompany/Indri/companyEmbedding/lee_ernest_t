Tyler Ryan finds the Chicken Man (02:19)
Columbia (WACH)—You have likely seen them all around town, in houses, businesses, and restaurants. A Chicken Man painting is a must-have item for many in the Midlands. It's distinctive oblong rectangle, depicting a chicken that looks a touch surprised, is a recognizable image around Columbia.The Chicken Man, as he is known to many, is Ernest Lee, a native of Edgefield, South Carolina.  Ernest Lee has been painting since he was about twelve years old, but the chickens didn't come along until an afternoon with a friend over coffee in Augusta.  He and a friend were talking about chickens, and Ernest said the faithful words, "Ain't no one going to buy a chicke. I really didn't want to paint a chicken." So what did the future star of foul want to paint? "Anything but chickens," he said. "Now that it's working, it's the best thing I done."And with an estimated 15,000 chickens now around the Midlands it seems he made a good decision.Ernest spends his days in an empty lot near Harden Street and Lady Street, in his "Den," outfitted with lights and an air conditioner, painting his chickens, landscapes, pop artists, and taking requests for custom art. "I'll paint whatever.  A Gamecock chicken, a Clemson chicken, I'll do whatever," he says. Some of his non-bird works include Michael Jackson, family members, and even the President.The Chicken Man studied art at the Gertrude Herbert Institute of Art in Alexandria, VA., and the Rose Hill Art Center in Aiken, and since arriving in Columbia around eleven years ago, he has become something of a celebrity. "I love the fact that he is so famous," says Scotty Lee, the future heir to the chicken empire. During the summer months, Scotty joins his father in the Den, creating his own brand of chickens.Chicken Man paintings have been seen in the State Museum in Columbia, and as far away as the Martin Luther King Jr. Library in Washington, DC. He has also appeared in Southern Living, and the subject of many newspaper articles and feature stories.You can stop by and the Ernest "The Chicken Man" Lee most days on Harden Street, where you will be invited in, and given a tour of the various magazines and newspapers he has appeared in, his special crab series of paintings, and he will, in front of your eyes autograph your very own Chicken Man original.(Story courtesy of Good Day Columbia contributor, Tyler Ryan.)www.tylerryantalent.com

    Ernest scared stupid.  
“No I don't know what you mean.”~ Oscar Wilde on Ernest
“Let me make this clear to everyone who is wondering....I dont like Ernest!! he's a pain in the ass!! and he does not leave me alone for one minute!!.”~ Vern on Ernest
“eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!!”~ Ernest on janitorial engineering at kids' summer camps
“eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!!”~ Ernest on seeing your mom
Ernest P. Worrell (June 15, 1889 - February 10, 2000) is/was an overly friendly and dimwitted yokel, who somehow managed to become a popular movie character in a popular movie franchise.


edit Early life
    Ernest at age six with his mom.  
Golly Bob Howdy, Vern! Ernest was born the only son of Ernest T. Bass and Nancy Worrell, and later stepfather R. Lee Ermey. This was unbeknownst to young Ernest (who went by the name "John" until it was settled that he was indeed named "Ernest"), who was found after being accidentally abandoned as a baby on a railway terminus. Ernest never quite fit in at school; it may have been because of his appearance or perhaps it was his tendency to be overly annoying. Ernest had an uncontrollable habit of getting too close to an individual and violating their personal space.
Ernest frequently got in trouble at school for his antics, and was temporarily placed in a special education program until he was dismissed from school -- completely -- two weeks later. Ernest was home-schooled by the family's tutor Celia from then on, until he was expelled for cheating on a first-grade spelling test during his sixth-grade French test. Fed up with his inability to fit in, Ernest Worrell moved out at age 18 and met a hooker named Roxanne.
After Roxanne was busted for prostitution, it was time for Ernest to find a new home. And fast.

edit Career

 
For those obsessed with so-called-experts, Wikipedia has an article about:Ernest P. Worrell.

    "Cherry" John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt a.k.a. "John Cherry."  
At age 19, Ernest P. Worrell moved next door to an invisible man named Vern. Vern had no known last name, but appeared to be 45, married, and listed as a registered sex offender. Vern tried his best to retain anonymity, but Ernest kept popping in and out to constantly annoy him. This caught the eye of John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt -- better known by his porn star name, "John Cherry" -- a closeted gay who owned an advertising agency in Tennessee.
Cherry pitched Ernest and Vern the idea of shooting a series of commercials in which Ernest came to Vern's house to advertise a product. Vern flat out refused, but Ernest agreed. Cherry decided to play Vern in the commercials; the real Vern sued for $4,000 for unauthorized use of his likeness, but lost because he was invisible and therefore had no likeness. 


edit Commercials
The first commercial, a Sprite commercial in which Ernest walks into the bathroom while Vern is taking a bath, become an instant smash hit, and Ernest became a regional superstar. Said commercial can be seen at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKZodyFLm0w&feature=related
Several more commercials followed, laced with plenty of euphemisms, double entendres, and sexual innuendo. Products ranged from Sprite, The New Coke, McDonald's, Wal-Mart, Crimestoppers, anti-smoking Public Service Announcements, beer, cars, Liquid Plumber, Chia Pets, Good Burger, Barbie products, Enzyte, and sex toys. By 1984, Ernest was a national superstar, but the best was yet to come.

edit Movies
    Ernest Meets Judge Judy.  
Main Article: List of Ernest movies

In 1985, Disney, under their Touchstone Pictures moniker, bought the film rights to the Ernest property. All they needed was a good plot that would best suit a two-hour motion picture. The success of Paramount's Friday the 13th franchise inspired screenwriters John Cherry and Coke White to cast Ernest as a camp counselor. Because the film was to be rated PG and involve children, Ernest would not be allowed to use his middle name of Pedophile. Instead he would refer to himself as Ernest P. Worrell.
Released in 1988 as Ernest Goes to Camp... and Gets Slaughtered by Jason, the film was a #1 box office hit, despite harsh reviews from film critics such as Roger Ebert and Larry King. This success would lead to even more Ernest movies -- including but not limited to Ernest Saves Christmas, Ernest Goes to Jail, Ernest Goes to School, Ernest Goes to a Chinese Reeducation Camp, and Ernest Gets a Speeding Ticket and Has to Face Judge Judy. 

    Ernest under the guise of Jim Varney.  
The most successful -- not to mention most popular-- of the Ernest movies is 1990's Ernest Goes to Jail. The movies have never been critical favorites, nor have they ever won any Academy Awards, but they have been mighty profitable.
The last Ernest movie to be released was the 1998 straight-to-video film, Ernest in the Army. At the time of the film's release, audiences and Ernest himself had grown tired of Ernest's antics, and the redneck movie star moved on to other projects, using the pseudonym Jim Varney. Films such as The Beverly Hillbillies, Toy Story, Toy Story 2, and Three Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain won Varney praise. However, he continued to be typecast as Ernest, and he wasn't going to take it anymore. In 1999, he hatched a plan to put an end to Ernest -- and in effect, Jim Varney -- once and for all.
The plan was for Ernest to become a gangsta rapper, but that experiment failed miserably. The album, Ernest 'N Da Hizz-ouse! peaked at #666 on the Billboard 200 Chart, and the lone single "I Ain't Ernest Anymore, Bitch!" failed to chart. In fact, the video was banned by MTV -- not for its content, but for its absurdity and cringe-inducing vocals. Ernest's shot at rap superstardom had backfired greatly, but proved to be a huge influence on Kevin Federline.

edit "Death"
    Screenshot from "I Ain't Ernest Anymore, Bitch!"  
Ernest Pedophile Worrell decided to end his "Ernest" persona by faking his own death and making a snuff film out of it. This next movie would be his highest budget production ever.  It would be his last.

    Vern, as played by Tommy Lee Jones.  
After the disaster that was 2000's Ernest Has a Gruesome Death in his Home, Ernest -- the man and his franchise -- was officially dead. In the film, Ernest buys 12 cartons of cigarettes and begins to smoke them one by one in a single day. While playing the title character in a production of King Lear under his Jim Varney pseudonym, Ernest receives news that he has been diagnosed with lung cancer. The film goes from a big, bombastic comedy to a serious art-house drama halfway through the film.
However, Ernest dies not of lung cancer, but by murder at the hands of Vern (Played by Tommy Lee Jones), finally fed up with Ernest breathing down his neck every 24/7 to advertise the latest issue of Playboy. Vern used violent and eloborate killing techniques on par with the standard slasher film. This caused the film to receive an R rating.
The film received mediocre reviews, as usual. Opening to a wide theatrical release, the film was viewed by only five people, but managed to sweep the Academy Awards in 2000. It is for this reason that the film is not considered to be an official Ernest movie. 
Ernest P. Worrell's actual death occurred on February 10, 2000, when he died of lung cancer. The real death was the final nail in the coffin for the Ernest franchise for a number of years. However, Ernest has reappeared throughout the years in CGI form and also in live action commercials (as played by R. Lee Ermey).
The animated commercial can be seen at:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7RvGlpTmQE
The live action commercial can be seen at:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pO26Qnct5A
(Note: R. Lee Ermey had to be tranquilized as to not appear bossy or drill sergeant-like):
These commercials ceased production in 2005 and the Ernest property was once again retired.

edit Remake
    Ernest goes to Trejo.  
Main article: UnNews:Ernest goes back to jail for remake




This article documents a future movie. If you want to see it right now, tough cookies! You're gonna have to wait like the rest of us. This film opens when Hollywood officially runs out of ideas.


On March 31, 2008, Touchstone Pictures, The Weinstein Comapany, and Michael Bay's Platinum Dunes announced plans to remake Ernest Goes to Jail with Danny Trejo in the role of Ernest. It is uncertain whether or not Vern will be involved in the film, and no cast or crew has been hired, but Trejo will star and Michael Bay will executive produce.
The studios were toying around with remake ideas back in 2005 when the "new Ernest" commercials began airing, but they had trouble clearing the rights with Worrell's estate. Finally, the estate relented and greenlighted the project, seeing as it wouldn't be a half-assed attempt to cash in on the franchise. And besides, they liked Trejo better than the two-bit actor hired to play Ernest in the blasphemous commercials.
The film will be darker and will be released in either 2009 or 2010.

Folk & OutsiderErnest Lee


Ernest Lee

When I opened the gallery and needed to come up with a logo, I pulled 
out a favorite I had been keeping for some time but never had the 
opportunity to use. I just liked the image of a chicken man. So, 
naturally when it came time to name the web site- Chickenman came to 
mind. Flash forward a little, and people kept coming in and asking to 
see my Chicken Man art. So, I had to tell the story...and they left.


Turns out they were referring to Ernest Lee, known to many as the 
Funky Chicken Man. Well, I finally got to meet him, and he is a delight.
 We visit a couple times a year, and I bring back a selection for the 
gallery so I am never in a position to say I don't have any Chicken Man 
art.


Ernest Lee began painting around age five. Currently he sets up his 
portable studio by the side of a road in Columbia, SC. When he's not 
there, he is attending one of the many art festivals he participates in 
throughout the year. He says he's painted 11,000 pieces in the last 8 
years. He paints more than chickens, but they are the subject that 
people see and instantly recognize "Chicken Man" art.

Ernest Lee 12x29 Panels OP90 GH


	I've just returned from a visit with Ernest Lee with a bunch of new pieces. Due to the number, it is most prudent for me - time wise - to photograph in groups. If you require additional photos before making a decision, please "Contact Us"

	Those of you who know the work will understand measurements vary from panel to panel, as does the quality of the board used. Sometimes you'll find small blades of grass as part of the piece - not a purposeful addition - that's what happens as Ernest Lee paints and tosses his work to dry on the ground.

If you expect a pristine, perfectly straight and smoothly cut piece of wood, you may want to consider another artist. Just say'n.

	On this visit there were not any "standard" sizes, so I have tried to group the pieces. The average size in this group is 12" wide and 29" to 30" long. If the exact size is important to you, please contact us and we will measure the piece that interests you. Both on thick wood.

	OP90H is SOLD

Elmer T. Lee was born in 1919 on a tobacco farm near Peaks Mill in Franklin County, Kentucky. Elmer's father, Ernest T., died of typhoid fever in 1931. His mother relocated Elmer and his brother, Harrison, to Frankfort, where she worked to support the family and educate the boys.Elmer graduated from Frankfort High School in 1936 and worked for Jarman Shoe Company until December 1941. He then served with the U. S. Army Air Force during World War II as a radar bombardier on a B-29. After flying missions against Japan through 1945, Elmer was honorably discharged in January 1946. He returned home and studied engineering at the University of Kentucky, where he graduated with honors in 1949.In September 1949 Elmer began working in the engineering department of the George T. Stagg Distillery in Frankfort. In 1966, Elmer was promoted to plant superintendent, responsible for all plant operations and reporting to the plant manager. 1n 1969, he became plant manager. Elmer retired in 1985 but continues to serve as ambassador for Buffalo Trace, educating the world on the unique qualities of Kentucky's bourbon whiskey.It was in 1984 that Elmer introduced the single-barrel bourbon concept to the world with Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon, named in honor of Col. Albert B. Blanton. Elmer is known throughout the industry for his expertise and knowledge of bourbon whiskey and has received numerous awards and recognition. Among these was his induction into the Kentucky Bourbon Hall of Fame in 2001 and his receipt of the Lifetime Achievement Award from Malt Advocate Magazine in 2002. He is also one of only three living master distillers who have a bourbon named after them.Cabernet Sauvignon  Chardonnay Champagne & Sparkling WinesZinfandelPinot NoirMeritages/ BlendsMerlotMagnumsPetit SirahSyrah/ShirazHalf BottlesOther White WinesTOP 100 WINES Aussie/Kiwi WinesPortsItalian VarietalsAccessoriesGift Certificates Sauvignon Blanc Other ImportsFrench Varietals Fine Spirits & Beer home | about us | privacy policy | send email | site map | view cartCopyright 2006 Your store name here.
