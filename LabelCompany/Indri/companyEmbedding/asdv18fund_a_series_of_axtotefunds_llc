Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market vola tility, the Fund’s current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value (NAV) with all distributions reinvested. Returns for other classes of share s offered by the Fund are different. Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative. Max Sales Charge: 1.25%.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.

About Risk: 
Investment in mutual funds involves risk, including possible loss of principal invested. You could lose money on your investment in the Fund or the Fund could underperform because of the following risks: the market prices of bonds held by the Fund may fa ll; individual investments of the Fund may not perform as expected; and/or the Fund's portfolio management practices may not achieve the desired result. Bond funds are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk. When interest rates rise, the value of  fixed-income securities will generally fall. In addition, the credit quality of the securities may deteriorate, which could lead to default or bankruptcy of the issuer where the issuer becomes unable to pay its obligations when due. Because a significant  portion of securities held by the Fund may have variable or floating interest rates, the amount of the Fund's monthly distributions to shareholders are expected to vary. Generally when market interest rates fall, the amount of the distributions will dec rease. Investments in high-yield, high risk bonds can involve a substantial risk of loss. An active trading style can result in higher turnover (exceeding 100%), may translate to higher transaction costs, may increase your tax liability, and may affect F und performance. Investing primarily in responsible investments carries the risk that, under certain market conditions, the Fund may underperform funds that do not utilize a responsible investment strategy. In evaluating a company, the Advisor is depende nt upon information and data that may be incomplete, inaccurate or unavailable, which could cause the Advisor to incorrectly assess a company’s ESG performance.



1. Bloomberg Barclays 9-12 Months Short Treasury Index measures the performance of U.S Treasury bills, notes, and bonds with a maturity between nine and twelve months. Unless otherwise stated, index returns do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales  charges, commissions, expenses, taxes or leverage, as applicable. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Historical performance of the index illustrates market trends and does not represent the past or future performance of the fund.

3. Net expense ratio reflects a contractual expense reimbursement that continues through 1/31/18. Without the reimbursement, if applicable, performance would have been lower.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market vola tility, the Fund’s current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value (NAV) with all distributions reinvested. Returns for other classes of share s offered by the Fund are different. Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative. Max Sales Charge: 1.25%.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.

3. Net expense ratio reflects a contractual expense reimbursement that continues through 1/31/18. Without the reimbursement, if applicable, performance would have been lower.
6. The Morningstar Ultrashort Bond Category includes funds that invest primarily in investment-grade U.S. fixed income and have durations typically less than one year.
7. SEC 30-day yield is a standardized measure based on the estimated yield to maturity of a fund's investments over a 30-day period and is based on the maximum offer price at the date specified. The SEC 30-day yield is not based on the distributions made by  the fund, which may differ. Subsidized yield reflects the effect of fee waivers and expense reimbursements. Distribution Rate at NAV is calculated by dividing the last distribution paid per share (annualized) by NAV. The Fund's monthly distribution may  be comprised of ordinary income, net realized capital gains and returns of capital.
8. A portion of the Fund's returns may be comprised of return of capital or short term capital gains. The Fund will determine the tax characteristics of all Fund distributions after the end of the calendar year and will provide shareholders such information  at that time. Please consult your tax advisor for further information.

Ratings are based on Moody's, S&P or Fitch, as applicable. If securities are rated differently by the ratings agencies, the higher rating is applied. Ratings, which are subject to change, apply to the creditworthiness of the issuers of the underlying sec urities and not to the Fund or its shares. Credit ratings measure the quality of a bond based on the issuer's creditworthiness, with ratings ranging from AAA, being the highest, to D, being the lowest based on S&P's measures. Ratings of BBB or higher by  S&P or Fitch (Baa or higher by Moody's) are considered to be investment-grade quality. Credit ratings are based largely on the ratings agency's analysis at the time of rating. The rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection  of the issuer's current financial condition and does not necessarily reflect its assessment of the volatility of a security's market value or of the liquidity of an investment in the security. Holdings designated as "Not Rated" are not rated by the nati onal ratings agencies stated above.

			Objective & Strategy
		

			
				The fund seeks total return, comprised of current income and capital appreciation by investing at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in senior secured floating rate loans made by banks and other financial institutions and in senior secured floating rate debt instruments.

			
			
				
			
		



Helping enhance income
Today's fixed income investors are facing new and unique challenges as traditional fixed income investments are providing historically low income and are increasingly vulnerable to the threat of rising interest rates. The characteristics of the Invesco Floating Rate Fund, such as attractive current income and  short duration, provide the potential to defend against rising rates and inflation and overall fixed income diversification within a portfolio.

Potentially higher yields in a rising rate environment
The floating rates and diversification potential of senior secured loans may help you enhance income during times when traditional bonds may come under pressure. The floating rate coupons may provide a potential hedge against inflation and rising interest rates.
Since inception, Floating Rate Fund has historically provided positive returns during the majority of rising rate periods



Performance quoted is past performance and cannot guarantee comparable future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Click the performance tab for the most recent month end performance. Performance figures reflect reinvested distributions and changes in net asset value (NAV). Performance shown at NAV does not include maximum applicable front-end sales charge (2.50%). If sales charges had been reflected, performance would be lower. Investment return and principal value will vary so that you may have a gain or a loss when you sell shares. Fund performance reflects any applicable fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements. Had the adviser not waived fees and/or reimbursed expenses in the past, returns would have been lower.
 Source: Bloomberg L.P. as of June 30, 2017. Fund inception May 1, 1997. Bonds represented by the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index; US Government Credit represented by the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Government Credit Index. Fund performance shown is Class A shares at NAV. If sales charge had been included, performance would be lower. The fund may have experienced periods of underperformance during periods of declining rates. Performance during all periods is cumulative. Past performance cannot guarantee future results. An investment cannot be made directly in an index. Rising rates are defined as any period where interest rates, as represented by the 10-year Treasury rate, increased at least 1%, or 100 basis points. A basis point (bps) is the smallest measure used for quoting yields on bonds and notes. One basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage point, or 0.01%. 
Index Definitions: Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index represents securities that are SEC-registered, taxable, and dollar denominated. The index covers the US investment grade fixed rate bond market, with index components for government and corporate securities, mortgage pass-through securities, and asset-backed securities. Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Government Credit Index is a component of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index and includes treasuries, agencies, publicly issued US corporate and foreign debentures and secured notes. 
Duration is the measure of a debt security's price sensitivity to interest rate changes, expressed in terms of years. Securities with longer durations usually are more sensitive to interest rate movements than those with shorter durations. Should interest rates change, the value of a fund that invests in securities with longer durations will fluctuate more than the value of a fund that invests in securities with shorter durations. 





Potentially low correlation
Incorporating senior loan funds in a portfolio may complement other traditional fixed income holdings and serve as a portfolio diversifier, which may help mitigate overall volatility.

Past performance cannot guarantee future results. An investment cannot be made directly in an index. Diversification does not guarantee a profit or eliminate the risk of loss.
Stocks are more volatile than bonds. High-yield bonds are subject to a higher level of credit risk than investment-grade bonds. The principal interest payments of Treasury bonds are guaranteed. Senior secured loan securities tend to be less liquid than the other asset classes listed. Correlation is a statistical measure of how two securities move in relation to each other.

Senior and secured, helping mitigate principal erosion
Senior secured loans are at the top of the capital structure, enabling its issuers to get paid first in the event of default or bankruptcy. Additionally, senior secured loans generate current income as companies pay their contractual interest on at least a quarterly basis. 
Senior secured loans are a priority of repayment in the event of default
      Senior secured loans rank highest in the capital structure.

High priority
Senior secured loans
Bonds

Low priority

Senior secured loans are secured by companies' collateral such as:

There is a risk that the value of the collateral required on investments in senior secured floating rate loans and debt securities may not be sufficient to cover the amount owed, may be found invalid, may be used to pay other outstanding obligations of the borrower or may be difficult to liquidate. 
Current income
Senior secured loans, like traditional bonds, generate current income as companies pay their contractual interest on — at least — a quarterly basis. Senior secured loans potentially  have  the added diversification  benefits of high  income  with short  duration.
Loans continued to offer investors a high level of current income with short duration

		Performance quoted is past performance and cannot guarantee comparable future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Investment return and principal value will vary so that you may have a gain or a loss when you sell shares. 


Performance shown at NAV does not include applicable front-end or CDSC sales charges, which would have reduced the performance.

 About risk
			 


Bank Loan Risk. There are a number of risks associated with an investment in bank loans including credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and prepayment risk. Lack of an active trading market, restrictions on resale, irregular trading activity, wide bid/ask spreads and extended trade settlement periods may impair the Fund's ability to sell bank loans within its desired time frame or at an acceptable price and its ability to accurately value existing and prospective investments. Extended trade settlement periods may result in cash not being immediately available to the Fund. As a result, the Fund may have to sell other investments or engage in borrowing transactions to raise cash to meet its obligations. The risk of holding bank loans is also directly tied to the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the issuing banks. These risks could cause the Fund to lose income or principal on a particular investment, which in turn could affect the Fund's returns. The value of bank loans can be affected by and sensitive to changes in government regulation and to economic downturns in the United States and abroad. Bank loans generally are floating rate loans, which are subject to interest rate risk as the interest paid on the floating rate loans adjusts periodically based on changes in widely accepted reference rates.
Borrowing Risk. Borrowing money to buy securities exposes the Fund to leverage and will cause the Fund's share price to be more volatile because leverage will exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of the Fund's portfolio securities. Borrowing money may also require the Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so. In addition, the Fund will incur interest expenses and other fees on borrowed money. There can be no assurance that the Fund's borrowing strategy will enhance and not reduce the Fund's returns.
Changing Fixed Income Market Conditions Risk. The current historically low interest rate environment was created in part by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) and certain foreign central banks keeping the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates at or near zero. There is a risk that interest rates will rise when the FRB and central banks raise these rates. This risk is heightened due to the completion of the FRB's quantitative easing program and the "tapering" of other similar foreign central bank actions. This eventual increase in the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates may expose fixed income markets to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity for certain fixed income investments, particularly those with longer maturities. In addition, decreases in fixed income dealer market-making capacity may also potentially lead to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity in the fixed income markets. As a result, the value of the Fund's investments and share price may decline. Changes in central bank policies could also result in higher than normal shareholder redemptions, which could potentially increase portfolio turnover and the Fund's transaction costs.
Collateralized Loan Obligations Risk. CLOs are subject to the risks of substantial losses due to actual defaults by underlying borrowers, which will be greater during periods of economic or financial stress. CLOs may also lose value due to collateral defaults and disappearance of subordinate tranches, market anticipation of defaults, and investor aversion to CLO securities as a class. The risks of CLOs will be greater if the Fund invests in CLOs that hold loans of uncreditworthy borrowers or if the Fund holds subordinate tranches of the CLO that absorbs losses from the defaults before senior tranches. In addition, CLOs are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk.
Credit Linked Notes Risk. Risks of credit linked notes include those risks associated with the underlying reference obligation including but not limited to market risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, default risk and, in some cases, foreign currency risk. An investor in a credit linked note bears counterparty risk or the risk that the issuer of the credit linked note will default or become bankrupt and not make timely payment of principal and interest of the structured security. Credit linked notes may be less liquid than other investments and therefore harder to dispose of at the desired time and price. In addition, credit linked notes may be leveraged and, as a result, small changes in the value of the underlying reference obligation may produce disproportionate losses to the Fund.
Debt Securities Risk. The prices of debt securities held by the Fund will be affected by changes in interest rates, the creditworthiness of the issuer and other factors. An increase in prevailing interest rates typically causes the value of existing debt securities to fall and often has a greater impact on longer-duration debt securities and higher quality debt securities. Falling interest rates will cause the Fund to reinvest the proceeds of debt securities that have been repaid by the issuer at lower interest rates. Falling interest rates may also reduce the Fund's distributable income because interest payments on floating rate debt instruments held by the Fund will decline. The Fund could lose money on investments in debt securities if the issuer or borrower fails to meet its obligations to make interest payments and/or to repay principal in a timely manner. Changes in an issuer's financial strength, the market's perception of such strength or in the credit rating of the issuer or the security may affect the value of debt securities. The Adviser's credit analysis may fail to anticipate such changes, which could result in buying a debt security at an inopportune time or failing to sell a debt security in advance of a price decline or other credit event.
Defaulted Securities Risk. Defaulted securities pose a greater risk that principal will not be repaid than non-defaulted securities. Defaulted securities and any securities received in an exchange for such securities may be subject to restrictions on resale.
Derivatives Risk. The value of a derivative instrument depends largely on (and is derived from) the value of an underlying security, currency, commodity, interest rate, index or other asset (each referred to as an underlying asset). In addition to risks relating to the underlying assets, the use of derivatives may include other, possibly greater, risks, including counterparty, leverage and liquidity risks. Counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay the Fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative contract. Derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative. As a result, an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the Fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative, which may make the Fund's returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss. Derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the Fund may be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or price. This risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions, during which the Fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions. Derivatives may also be harder to value, less tax efficient and subject to changing government regulation that could impact the Fund's ability to use certain derivatives or their cost. Also, derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected benefits, particularly during adverse market conditions.
Financial Services Sector Risk. The Fund may be susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting the financial services sector. Financial services companies are subject to extensive government regulation and are disproportionately affected by unstable interest rates, each of which could adversely affect the profitability of such companies. Financial services companies may also have concentrated portfolios, which makes them especially vulnerable to unstable economic conditions.
Foreign Securities Risk. The Fund's foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability, changes in economic or taxation policies, difficulty in enforcing obligations, decreased liquidity or increased volatility. Foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure, nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits (in which the Fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market) and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls. Unless the Fund has hedged its foreign securities risk, foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations, which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency (or other instruments through which the Fund has exposure to foreign currencies) to decline in value. Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. Currency hedging strategies, if used, are not always successful.
High Yield Debt Securities (Junk Bond) Risk. Investments in high yield debt securities ("junk bonds") and other lower-rated securities will subject the Fund to substantial risk of loss. These securities are considered to be speculative with respect to the issuer's ability to pay interest and principal when due, are more susceptible to default or decline in market value and are less liquid than investment grade debt securities. Prices of high yield debt securities tend to be very volatile.
Liquidity Risk. The Fund may be unable to sell illiquid investments at the time or price it desires and, as a result, could lose its entire investment in such investments. Liquid securities can become illiquid during periods of market stress. If a significant amount of the Fund's securities become illiquid, the Fund may not be able to timely pay redemption proceeds and may need to sell securities at significantly reduced prices.
Management Risk. The Fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the Adviser's judgment about markets, interest rates or the attractiveness, relative values, liquidity, or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the Fund's portfolio. The Fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect. Additionally, legislative, regulatory, or tax developments may adversely affect management of the Fund and, therefore, the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment objective.
Market Risk. The market values of the Fund's investments, and therefore the value of the Fund's shares, will go up and down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry or section of the economy, or it may affect the market as a whole. Individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments, such as bonds. During a general downturn in the financial markets, multiple asset classes may decline in value. When markets perform well, there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the Fund will rise in value.
Risk of Subordinated Debt. Perpetual subordinated debt is a type of hybrid instrument that has no maturity date for the return of principal and does not need to be redeemed by the issuer. These investments typically have lower credit ratings and lower priority than other obligations of an issuer during bankruptcy, presenting a greater risk for nonpayment. This risk increases as the priority of the obligation becomes lower. Payments on these securities may be subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of subsidiaries and associated companies of an issuer. Additionally, some perpetual subordinated debt does not restrict the ability of an issuer’s subsidiaries to incur further unsecured indebtedness.

                Whether you're a logger cutting wood in the forest or a homeowner doing landscaping in your yard, working with outdoor power equipment can be dangerous. Make a plan to prevent it from happening and reduce the severity should an accident occur by wearing the proper safety gear. We have designed a complete series of protective clothing and equipment to make your tasks safer and more productive.

            Chainsaw Protective Chaps, Pants & Jackets
        

            Chainsaw protective clothing should always be worn when using a chainsaw. Chainsaw chaps, pants and jackets can protect you by stopping the chain or preventing the chain from cutting yourself, giving you enough time to move away from the saw. Our safety clothing is made from high quality material, giving you the protection you need.

        Best axe for splitting wood
        



        An axe is a key tool that any homeowner should own for splitting wood. However, not just any axe can be used for splitting wood. We help you find the right wood splitting axe or maul to make your job easier.
    


















Axes are made for cutting, splitting, felling, and shaping wood. If you need to split some firewood, then you'll need a wood splitting axe to make your job easier. Splitting axes are designed to split the wood into smaller chunks and manageable pieces by splitting the wood fibers apart, as opposed to a felling axe, which cut the wood fibers. You'll be super frustrated if you use a felling axe for wood splitting purposes. Trust us- having the right tool makes all the difference in the world. The best axes for splitting wood is a either a wood splitting axe or a splitting maul. What are the differences between these two types of tools?
Splitting Axe
As we touched upon earlier, a splitting axe is designed to split along the grain of wood to break the fibers apart, not cut them. It has a tapered head, generally weighing about 3-6 lbs. When you swing the axe down, the force of the wedge causes the wood to split. Generally lighter than a splitting maul, the splitting axe is multi-purposed and can be used for a longer period of time. You can chose between a wooden handle or composite handle. The composite splitting axe is lighter than the wooden handle and more durable, but both are great options as many people still love the feel of an old wood handle axe. 
Don't take our word for it. Watch the YouTube user review on our highly recommend large splitting axe.

Splitting Maul
A splitting maul is like a huge sledge hammer with a pointed axe head. The maul head generally weights around 6-8 lbs. With a longer handle and duller blade edge, it bluntly splits the wood based on more pure force. However, the disadvantage of using the splitting maul over a splitting axe is its total weight. Requiring more energy to swing the maul, you will get tired more quickly.
Which one is right for me?
Ultimately, personal preference, the size of the wood piece and how much wood you plan to split will determine which axe to use. For very large chunks of wood, the splitting maul is a great tool because of its axe weight giving you more power. You'll spend less time getting the job done. However, the disadvantage of its heavier weight means you will get tired faster. Also, if you're a smaller person, you'll find the maul harder to swing. For smaller pieces of wood or splitting around the edges, the splitting axe is a better choice. It's lighter, easier to swing and essentially does the same damage as a splitting maul. We recommend that you have both- together they form a nice 1-2 punch for all of your wood splitting needs.

                                It's a warm, dry, remote location high in the mountains. Big trees are felled here at a rapid rate on the steep slopes. It's a tough environment that makes great demands on both the loggers and their machines. Jaime Wagenfuhr and his son Graham are enjoying every minute. Using chainsaws with the self-adjusting carburettor AutoTune allows them to work unhindered and efficiently – at all altitudes and at all temperatures.
