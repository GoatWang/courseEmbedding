Axsome Therapeutics  Overview & Pipeline























































 


Overview
 

We aim to become a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes differentiated medicines that expand the treatment options available to caregivers and improve the lives of patients living with CNS disorders. 
Axsome Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel medicines for the management of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. By focusing on this therapeutic area, we are addressing significant and growing markets where current treatment options are limited or inadequate. Our pipeline includes two late-stage product candidates, AXS-02 and AXS-05, which we are developing for multiple indications. 








Pipeline


Axsome Therapeutics is building a portfolio of differentiated product candidates that address unmet medical needs. Some of our product candidates combine multiple mechanisms of action to produce novel medicines that address deficiencies of current approaches. The company’s current pipeline includes two late-stage product candidates and one preclinical candidate. 


 


AXS-05
AXS-05 is a novel, oral, investigational drug product under development for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. AXS-05 utilizes Axsome’s technology of combining bupropion and dextromethorphan. Dextromethorphan is an NMDA receptor antagonist, sigma-1 receptor agonist, and inhibitor of the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters. Bupropion serves to increase the bioavailability of dextromethorphan, and is a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, and a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. We are initially developing AXS-05 for the treatment of the following conditions: treatment resistant depression (TRD), and agitation in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). AXS-05 is an investigational drug product not approved by the FDA.Learn more about AXS-05 and our target indications. 



AXS-02
AXS-02 (disodium zoledronate tetrahydrate), is a potentially first in class, oral, targeted, non opioid therapeutic for chronic pain. We are initially developing AXS-02 for the treatment of pain in the following three conditions: complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), knee osteoarthritis (OA) associated with bone marrow lesions (BMLs) and chronic low back pain (CLBP) associated with Modic changes (MCs). AXS-02 has been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA for the treatment of pain associated with CRPS as well as for the treatment of knee OA associated with BMLs. AXS-02 has also been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA and Orphan Medicinal Product Designation by the EMA for the treatment of CRPS. AXS-02 is an investigational product candidate not approved by the FDA.Learn more about AXS-02 and our target indications.

Axsome Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXSM), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for the management of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, today announced positive topline clinical trial results from a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic study of AXS-06, a novel, oral, non-opioid, fixed-dose combination of meloxicam and esomeprazole being developed for the treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Axsome has received, from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Pre-Investigational New Drug Application (Pre-IND) written guidance on a proposed clinical developmental plan for AXS-06. Based on this guidance, Axsome believes that AXS-06 is Phase 3-ready. AXS-06 is now Axsomes third product candidate in clinical development and its second differentiated oral, non-opioid product candidate for the management of chronic pain.
The clinical trial results demonstrated, for the first time, rapid achievement of peak plasma levels of meloxicam after oral administration. Meloxicam is a long-acting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with COX-2 preferential inhibition and potent pain relieving efficacy. However standard meloxicam has an extended time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) which delays its onset of action. AXS-06 utilizes Axsomes proprietary MoSEIC (Molecular Solubility Enhanced Inclusion Complex) technology to substantially increase the solubility and speed the absorption of meloxicam while maintaining durability of action. AXS-06 also incorporates esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, to reduce the risk of NSAID-associated gastrointestinal ulcers which can occur with chronic NSAID use.
AXS-06 provides the benefits of oral administration and demonstrates a more rapid meloxicam Tmax than that reported with intramuscular administration, highlighting the potential for faster pain relief. In addition, AXS-06 maintains the long half-life of meloxicam which enables once-daily dosing and sustained effect, said Herriot Tabuteau, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Axsome. These results indicate that AXS-06 has a potentially best-in-class NSAID profile based on the differentiated pharmacokinetic profile of MoSEIC meloxicam and the potentially enhanced gastrointestinal safety from the esomeprazole component. The potential efficacy and safety advantages of AXS-06 as compared to currently available NSAIDs could provide significant benefit to patients.
The study compared the pharmacokinetics of meloxicam and esomeprazole after oral administration of AXS-06 tablets (meloxicam 15 mg, esomeprazole 40 mg), and commercially available Mobic tablets (15 mg meloxicam) and Nexium capsules (40 mg esomeprazole) in healthy volunteers. The median Tmax for meloxicam, the trials primary endpoint, was 9 times faster for AXS-06 as compared to Mobic (0.5 hour versus 4.5 hours for AXS-06 and Mobic, respectively, p(c) 2017 TBREAK MEDIA.

Axsome Therapeutics Announces AXS-06 (MoSEIC™ Meloxicam and Esomeprazole) Meets Primary Endpoint in Phase 1 Clinical Trial




















July 25, 2017 07:00 ET

 | Source: Axsome Therapeutics, Inc.






AXS-06 is an oral, rapidly-absorbed, once-daily, non-opioid, COX-2 preferential pain therapeutic with a gastroprotectant Primary endpoint met with 9 times faster time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of meloxicam versus Mobic® (p<0.0001) Therapeutic plasma levels of meloxicam achieved within 15 minutes of oral dosing of AXS-06 Gastroprotective concentrations of esomeprazole achieved   Phase 3-ready based on FDA Pre-IND guidance AXS-06 utilizes Axsome’s MoSEIC™ delivery technology AXS-06 to complement commercialization of AXS-02 in development for complex regional pain syndrome NEW YORK, July  25, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Axsome Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXSM), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for the management of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, today announced positive topline clinical trial results from a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic study of AXS-06, a novel, oral, non-opioid, fixed-dose combination of meloxicam and esomeprazole being developed for the treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Axsome has received, from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Pre-Investigational New Drug Application (Pre-IND) written guidance on a proposed clinical developmental plan for AXS-06. Based on this guidance, Axsome believes that AXS-06 is Phase 3-ready. AXS-06 is now Axsome’s third product candidate in clinical development and its second differentiated oral, non-opioid product candidate for the management of chronic pain. The clinical trial results demonstrated, for the first time, rapid achievement of peak plasma levels of meloxicam after oral administration. Meloxicam is a long-acting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with COX-2 preferential inhibition and potent pain relieving efficacy. However standard meloxicam has an extended time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) which delays its onset of action. AXS-06 utilizes Axsome’s proprietary MoSEIC™ (Molecular Solubility Enhanced Inclusion Complex) technology to substantially increase the solubility and speed the absorption of meloxicam while maintaining durability of action. AXS-06 also incorporates esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, to reduce the risk of NSAID-associated gastrointestinal ulcers which can occur with chronic NSAID use. “AXS-06 provides the benefits of oral administration and demonstrates a more rapid meloxicam Tmax than that reported with intramuscular administration, highlighting the potential for faster pain relief. In addition, AXS-06 maintains the long half-life of meloxicam which enables once-daily dosing and sustained effect,” said Herriot Tabuteau, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Axsome. “These results indicate that AXS-06 has a potentially best-in-class NSAID profile based on the differentiated pharmacokinetic profile of MoSEIC™ meloxicam and the potentially enhanced gastrointestinal safety from the esomeprazole component. The potential efficacy and safety advantages of AXS-06 as compared to currently available NSAIDs could provide significant benefit to patients.” The study compared the pharmacokinetics of meloxicam and esomeprazole after oral administration of AXS-06 tablets (meloxicam 15 mg, esomeprazole 40 mg), and commercially available Mobic® tablets (15 mg meloxicam) and Nexium® capsules (40 mg esomeprazole) in healthy volunteers. The median Tmax for meloxicam, the trial’s primary endpoint, was 9 times faster for AXS-06 as compared to Mobic® (0.5 hour versus 4.5 hours for AXS-06 and Mobic, respectively, p<0.0001). AXS-06 also demonstrated higher mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) (p=0.0018), faster time to therapeutic plasma concentration (p<0.0001), and time to half-maximal plasma concentration (p<0.0001) as compared to Mobic®. Terminal half-lives for meloxicam were similar for AXS-06 and Mobic® at approximately 20 and 22 hours, respectively. Plasma concentrations and terminal half-lives of esomeprazole after AXS-06 and Nexium® administration were comparable. AXS-06 was well tolerated with reported adverse events being similar across the three treatment arms. There were no serious adverse events in the study. “With its differentiated profile and Phase 3-ready status, AXS-06 complements AXS-02 which is currently in Phase 3 trials in complex regional pain syndrome and knee osteoarthritis,” continued Dr. Tabuteau. “The overlapping patient and physician audiences for AXS-02 and AXS-06 should allow Axsome to leverage our commercialization efforts. We look forward to the further development of AXS-06 and to a data readout for AXS-02 in complex regional pain syndrome anticipated in the fourth quarter.” Phase 1 Trial Design The study was a randomized, parallel group trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of meloxicam and esomeprazole after single and multiple dose administration of AXS-06 in healthy volunteers. A total of 30 subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to treatment with AXS-06 tablets (15 mg meloxicam, 40 mg esomeprazole), Mobic® tablets (15 mg meloxicam), or Nexium® capsules (40 mg esomeprazole), once daily for 6 days under fasting conditions. The primary endpoint was the Tmax of meloxicam. Secondary endpoints included Cmax, time to half maximum concentration, and time to therapeutic concentration. About the NSAID Market Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used for the treatment of pain and arthritis. Approximately 120 million prescriptions were written for NSAIDs overall in the U.S. in 2016, of which approximately 25% were written for meloxicam. Chronic use of NSAIDs has been reported to be associated with the development of gastrointestinal ulcers in as many as 25% of patients. About AXS-06 AXS-06 is an oral, non-opioid, fixed-dose combination of MoSEIC™ meloxicam and esomeprazole which is being developed for the treatment of chronic pain. Meloxicam is a long-acting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with COX-2 preferential inhibition and potent pain-relieving efficacy. AXS-06 utilizes Axsome’s proprietary MoSEIC™ (Molecular Solubility Enhanced Inclusion Complex) technology to substantially increase the solubility and speed the absorption of meloxicam while maintaining durability of action. Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor which lowers stomach acidity and which has been shown to reduce the occurrence of NSAID-induced gastrointestinal ulcers. AXS-06 is designed to provide rapid, effective pain relief, and to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers, with convenient once-daily dosing. About Axsome Therapeutics, Inc. Axsome Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for the management of central nervous system (CNS) disorders for which there are limited treatment options. Axsome’s product candidate portfolio includes three clinical-stage candidates, AXS-02, AXS-05, and AXS-06. AXS-05 is currently in a Phase 3 trial in treatment resistant depression (TRD) and a Phase 2/3 trial in agitation in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). AXS-02 is currently in Phase 3 trials in complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and knee osteoarthritis (OA) associated with bone marrow lesions (BMLs) with an additional Phase 3 trial planned in chronic low back pain (CLBP) associated with Modic changes (MCs). A Phase 1 trial of AXS-06 has been completed. AXS-02, AXS-05, and AXS-06 are investigational drug products not approved by the FDA.

Axsome Therapeutics  Overview & Pipeline























































 


Overview
 

We aim to become a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes differentiated medicines that expand the treatment options available to caregivers and improve the lives of patients living with CNS disorders. 
Axsome Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel medicines for the management of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. By focusing on this therapeutic area, we are addressing significant and growing markets where current treatment options are limited or inadequate. Our pipeline includes two late-stage product candidates, AXS-02 and AXS-05, which we are developing for multiple indications. 








Pipeline


Axsome Therapeutics is building a portfolio of differentiated product candidates that address unmet medical needs. Some of our product candidates combine multiple mechanisms of action to produce novel medicines that address deficiencies of current approaches. The company’s current pipeline includes two late-stage product candidates and one preclinical candidate. 


 


AXS-05
AXS-05 is a novel, oral, investigational drug product under development for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. AXS-05 utilizes Axsome’s technology of combining bupropion and dextromethorphan. Dextromethorphan is an NMDA receptor antagonist, sigma-1 receptor agonist, and inhibitor of the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters. Bupropion serves to increase the bioavailability of dextromethorphan, and is a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, and a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. We are initially developing AXS-05 for the treatment of the following conditions: treatment resistant depression (TRD), and agitation in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). AXS-05 is an investigational drug product not approved by the FDA.Learn more about AXS-05 and our target indications. 



AXS-02
AXS-02 (disodium zoledronate tetrahydrate), is a potentially first in class, oral, targeted, non opioid therapeutic for chronic pain. We are initially developing AXS-02 for the treatment of pain in the following three conditions: complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), knee osteoarthritis (OA) associated with bone marrow lesions (BMLs) and chronic low back pain (CLBP) associated with Modic changes (MCs). AXS-02 has been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA for the treatment of pain associated with CRPS as well as for the treatment of knee OA associated with BMLs. AXS-02 has also been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA and Orphan Medicinal Product Designation by the EMA for the treatment of CRPS. AXS-02 is an investigational product candidate not approved by the FDA.Learn more about AXS-02 and our target indications.

Axsome Therapeutics Initiates Phase 2/3 Trial of AXS-05 for Alzheimer's Disease AgitationBack to AXSM News

Share Story7:00AM ET 7/17/2017 Globe NewswireFirst patient enrolled in the ADVANCE-1 study
Agitation reported in nearly 50% of patients with Alzheimer's disease 
FDA Fast Track designation previously received for AXS-05 for Alzheimer's disease agitation
Second indication for AXS-05 in late-stage clinical trials
NEW YORK, July  17, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Axsome Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXSM), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for the management of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, enrolled the first patient in the ADVANCE-1 (Addressing Dementia Via Agitation-Centered Evaluation 1) study, a Phase 2/3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of AXS-05 for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) agitation. AXS-05 is a combination of dextromethorphan (an NMDA receptor antagonist, sigma-1 receptor agonist, and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) and bupropion (a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, which also increases the bioavailability of dextromethorphan).
"Agitation is one of the most distressing and difficult-to-treat behavioral symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease," said Jeffrey Cummings, M.D., Sc.D., Professor of Neurology, and Director of the Center for Neurodegeneration and Translational Neuroscience, at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine. "It is common, being reported in about half of patients, is one of the primary reasons for early nursing home placement, and is associated with increased mortality. NMDA receptor antagonism, sigma-1 receptor agonism, and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition may be relevant mechanisms in this condition. New treatments are needed for agitation and progress in this area is a welcome advance."
"Agitation places a heavy burden on patients with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers," said Marc Agronin, M.D., Vice President of Behavioral Health and Clinical Research at Miami Jewish Health, and Affiliate Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Neurology at University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. "Unfortunately there is currently no FDA-approved medication for this condition. The mechanisms of action of AXS-05 may hold promise in treating Alzheimer's agitation. We look forward to learning more about AXS-05 and its potential to relieve the symptoms of agitation through the ADVANCE-1 trial."
"The initiation of the ADVANCE-1 trial reflects Axsome's continued commitment to developing treatments for serious CNS disorders for which there are limited treatment options," said Herriot Tabuteau, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Axsome. "The unique pharmacology of AXS-05 lends itself to the potential treatment of a variety of CNS disorders. With the STRIDE-1 trial in treatment resistant depression also underway, AXS-05 is now being evaluated in late-stage clinical trials in two separate CNS indications."
About the ADVANCE-1 Study
ADVANCE-1 (Addressing Dementia Via Agitation-Centered Evaluation 1) is a Phase 2/3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AXS-05 in patients with agitation associated with Alzheimer's disease.  Approximately 435 patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive AXS-05, bupropion, or placebo for 5 weeks. The primary efficacy measure is the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). This trial incorporates a planned interim analysis by an independent data monitoring committee to assess the assumptions used to determine the sample size of the trial.
About Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Agitation
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that manifests initially as forgetfulness advancing to severe cognitive impairment and memory loss. It afflicts an estimated 5 million individuals in the United States, a number that is anticipated to increase to approximately 14 million by 2050. In addition to cognitive decline, individuals diagnosed with AD typically experience behavioral and psychological symptoms including agitation which is reported in approximately 45% of patients. Agitation is characterized by emotional distress, aggressive behaviors, disruptive irritability, and disinhibition. Agitation in patients with AD has been associated with increased caregiver burden, decreased functioning, earlier nursing home placement, and increased mortality. There are currently no therapies approved by the FDA for the treatment of agitation in patients with AD.
About AXS-05
AXS-05 is a novel, oral, investigational drug product under development for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. AXS-05 utilizes Axsome's technology of combining bupropion and dextromethorphan. Dextromethorphan is an NMDA receptor antagonist, sigma-1 receptor agonist, and inhibitor of the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters. Bupropion serves to increase the bioavailability of dextromethorphan, and is a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, and a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. AXS-05 is an investigational drug product not approved by the FDA.
About Axsome Therapeutics, Inc.
Axsome Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for the management of central nervous system (CNS) disorders for which there are limited treatment options. Axsome's product candidate portfolio includes two late-stage candidates, AXS-05 and AXS-02. AXS-05 is currently in a Phase 3 trial in treatment resistant depression (TRD) and a Phase 2/3 trial in agitation in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). AXS-02 is currently in Phase 3 trials in complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and knee osteoarthritis (OA) associated with bone marrow lesions (BMLs) with an additional Phase 3 trial planned in chronic low back pain (CLBP) associated with Modic changes (MCs). AXS-05 and AXS-02 are investigational drug products not approved by the FDA. For more information, please visit the company website at www.axsome.com.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

	Item 8.01. Other Events





	 




	On March 31, 2017, Axsome Therapeutics, Inc. (the Company) updated its presentation slide deck in preparation for a presentation by Herriot Tabuteau, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of the Company, at the 16th Annual Needham Healthcare Conference (the Conference) on April 5, 2017. Dr. Tabuteau will be presenting at the Conference to provide an overview of the Companys business and late-stage clinical product candidates, AXS-05 and AXS-02.




	 




	Included in the new corporate slide deck is updated financial guidance from the Company in connection with its previously disclosed March 2017 public offering of common stock (the Offering). The Company now believes that with the net proceeds from the Offering, together with previously existing cash, it will have sufficient funds to meet its anticipated operating cash requirements into the first quarter of 2019. The Company has based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and it could spend its available financial resources faster than it currently expects.




	 




	Attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K is a copy of the presentation slide deck to be used in connection with the planned presentation.

Axsome Therapeutics, Inc. Key Developments

Axsome Therapeutics, Inc. Initiates Phase 2/3 Trial of AXS-05 for Alzheimer’s Disease Agitation
Jul 17 17
Axsome Therapeutics, Inc. enrolled the first patient in the ADVANCE-1 (Addressing Dementia Via Agitation-Centered Evaluation 1) study, a Phase 2/3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of AXS-05 for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) agitation. AXS-05 is a combination of dextromethorphan (an NMDA receptor antagonist, sigma-1 receptor agonist, and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) and bupropion (a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, which also increases the bioavailability of dextromethorphan). ADVANCE-1 (Addressing Dementia Via Agitation-Centered Evaluation 1) is a Phase 2/3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AXS-05 in patients with agitation associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Approximately 435 patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive AXS-05, bupropion, or placebo for 5 weeks. The primary efficacy measure is the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). This trial incorporates a planned interim analysis by an independent data monitoring committee to assess the assumptions used to determine the sample size of the trial.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price.
