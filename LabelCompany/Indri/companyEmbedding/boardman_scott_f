Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

iQ Credit Union


                                            IQ has really friendly staff. Their call center staff are great. But walk through the front doors and the IQ drops significantly!

Suncoast Credit Union


                                            Once again Suncoast has shown itself to be a preschooler in the land of credit unions. They don't understand beneficiary designations for CDs, they make getting a credit card - one of the money makers for them - nearly impossible, and now they don't want newcomers to...show more

The Business Gold Rewards Card from American Express OPEN


                                            Approached at airport to sign up for this card. Already had a few. Signed up anyway as some pressure applied.

Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card


                                            The Bed Bath & Beyond Mastercard was purchased from US Bank in October 2016. My advice: If you have been with US Bank and made the transition to Comenity - check your credit report. Comenity reports twice and never reports the old account closed, so it looks like you have 2...show more

Woodforest National Bank


                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

                                            It's not the worst, but it's certainly deceptive. I can't trust a company that lies to me for two bucks. When you sign up it claims no annual fee, no monthly fees, etc. However now there is a minimum monthly payment even if you you have a zero balance. So I'm...show more

Veridian Credit Union


                                            i love banking with veridian, but the new updated online banking is garbage.10x harder to navigate than before staring from the log in page. Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

Lowe's Store Card


                                            You will never get a credit line increase. I have good credit and zero late payments and get turned down every time. I don't have this problem with any of my other credit accounts. Had my account over a year in good standing. Paid it down to zero twice. What a joke!

Boardman Team FS (2016) review

The 2016 Team FS bike feels much more balanced than the previous version

Boardman Team FS (2016) review

Manufacturer:									

Boardman 



Price as reviewed:
£999.99 





 


			This product is featured in: The best cheap mountain bikes.
		



The last time we tested the Team FS we complained that our knees knocked on the upper shock linkage and that the 130mm travel suspension felt too comfort focused, lacking the support needed to push the bike to the limit.
Our criticisms didn’t go unnoticed, and Boardman has now fitted a narrower upper linkage with much improved clearance, and it has also change the angle of it relative to the shock to make the suspension more progressive and supportive.

>>> The best cheap mountain bikes
And Boardman hasn’t stopped there. The frame geometry has also been tweaked. Yes, the head angle has actually got steeper, but the frame has also increased in length, so the bike feels much more balanced than the previous version. Also, with the extra reach, Boardman can fit a 50mm stem as standard without the cockpit feeling too cramped. All that’s needed now is a size XL frame for riders over 6ft.
Just like all of the other bikes in this test, cost dictates that the Boardman gets a 135mm quick-release rear end, not the stiffer 142x12mm thru-axle design on the Pro FS. And due to the pivot placement on the chainstay, the back end is not quite as stiff, or direct, as the Calibre Bossnut.

>>> Will this £130 supermarket bike survive a DH course?
All of the pivots use sealed cartridge bearings to reduce friction and make servicing easier, and the overall frame finish — smooth welds and fluid-formed tubes — is first rate. The end result being that the Team FS looks like a bike costing double.
Suspension
With slightly more air pressure than recommended for our weight, we easily achieved the front-end support we wanted from the 140mm Sektor fork, even if it meant that we couldn’t quite reach bottom out. With a tapered steerer tube, 32mm upper legs and 15mm Maxle lowers, the Team FS takes hits big and small without complaint. It also puts Boardman on a level playing field with Calibre and VooDoo.



No more knee-knocking thanks to Boardman’s new slimline upper link
Even though the Boardman is rocking 10mm less travel at the rear, the bike felt really well balanced from the off. But, just like most of the other bikes in this test, we had to run the rebound damping on the Monarch R shock wide-open. So, again, we get the feeling that all of the brands wrongly assume that it will be heavier riders buying these bikes.

Components
The Team FS is the only bike in this test not to use a Shimano drivetrain. Instead, Boardman has opted for a SRAM GX 2×10 set-up. Shifting is both crisp and precise, but we had noticeably more dropped chains on the Boardman than any other bike. We’ve had no such problems with the chain stabilising Type II rear mechs on SRAM’s single-ring GX drivetrains, so we suspect that the frame flex we mentioned earlier — or more likely, the FSA Comet chainset — could be the real issue here.
Maxle thru-axle and tapered steerer tie up solid front end
And, if we’re being really picky about the components on the Boardman, we’d like to see an inline seat post to help offset the slack seat tube angle. As it stands, when you raise the saddle height, it ends up being too far behind the bottom bracket, which makes it more difficult to keep the front wheel comfortably loaded on steep climbs.
And while it’s great that the Team FS comes with lock-on grips, they are too skinny for size large hands on a size large bike.
Greater reach this year means a stubby stem doesn’t feel cramped

Performance
Sometimes you need to take a step backwards to move forwards, and that’s exactly what Boardman has done with the Team FS. And even though we’re big fans of slacker head angles, the handling of the Boardman is so much more balanced with the steeper steering geometry and extra length in the front end of the frame.
>>> Best mountain bike tyres
So, when the hard compound Continental tyres break traction — which they regularly do — you still feel in control of the bike. If you can survive the sketchy drifts from one corner to the next, the Conti tyres reward you with reduced rolling resistance. Less experienced riders, however, will be rolling the dice every time they ride.

Verdict
All of changes that Boardman has made to the Team FS for 2016 are positive ones. You still get one of the best-dressed bikes for under a grand, but the frame now possesses a ride quality that’s every bit as fitting as the finishing kit adorning it. In the end, it was a very close call between the Boardman Team FS and the Calibre Bossnut. If the Team FS came with the stiffer, 142x12mm rear end, and better tyres, Boardman could easily be looking at a double-digit rating.

Product Overview


Overall rating:

Score 10 



Pros:Lightest on test at just under 16lbSRAM Force groupsetRitchey WCS finishing kitStiff and fast-ridingCons:170mm cranks are a strange choice 




Product:
Boardman Pro Carbon

Manufacturer:									

Boardman 



Price as reviewed:
£1,499.00 







 


			This product is featured in: 10 best road bikes under £1500 for 2017.
		



The Boardman Pro Carbon at a whisker under 16lb is the lightest on test by a long chalk.
With its T800 unidirectional carbon monocoque it was no surprise that the Boardman had a ‘racy’ feel. Its handling was likened by more than one rider to Scott’s CR1, which is certainly a compliment given the success of the CR1, which was a benchmark carbon frame.

The Boardman Pro Carbon gets top marks when it comes to the ups. Its sub-16lb weight is over 2lb lighter than anything else in the test, and when the difference is that marked, combined with a quality carbon frame, you’ve got a winning combination. Like the Wilier, the Boardman frame is a monocoque construction and it’s difficult to separate their climbing prowess. They’re both stiff, light and responsive, but the Ritchey WCS wheels on the Boardman are top notch and give it a competitive edge.



Boardman bikes: the range explained 
The Boardman was more of a handful once you were going full flight. Both it and the Wilier picked up speed well, and it was becoming apparent that these two bikes’ frames shared a number of similar traits, except the Boardman’s combination of low weight, stiff wheels and stiff frame gave it a tendency to skip around if you weren’t careful.

 

The equipment on all four bikes isl pretty good stuff, but what stood out was the big gap between the kit on the Wilier Mortirolo Mirage and that on the Boardman Pro Carbon. OK, so the Wilier is a couple of hundred pounds cheaper, but even so. Its Campagnolo Mirage spec, while a solid choice, is somewhat belittled by the SRAM Force and Ritchey WCS kit on the Boardman. The only small spec-related gripe was the 170mm Truvativ GXP carbon cranks that we felt were too small for the bike. Nice kit’s one thing, but it’s no good if it doesn’t fit the rider.


Verdict
The Boardman Pro Carbon is a lot of bike for your cash, and stands head and shoulders above the rest. It’s the lightest by a mile, thanks in part to its top-end spec, and we struggled to find much to complain about with its performance. If we were to nit-pick then it could do with a smidgin more comfort. The 170mm crank issue was a quick fix, so not a real problem.
