For Instructors


For Students




Description
Introducing a NEW addition to our growing library of computer science titles, Algorithm Design and Applications, by Michael T. Goodrich & Roberto Tamassia! Algorithms is a course required for all computer science majors, with a strong focus on theoretical topics. Students enter the course after gaining hands-on experience with computers, and are expected to learn how algorithms can be applied to a variety of contexts. This new book integrates application with theory.
Goodrich & Tamassia believe that the best way to teach algorithmic topics is to present them in a context that is motivated from applications to uses in society, computer games, computing industry, science, engineering, and the internet. The text teaches students about designing and using algorithms, illustrating connections between topics being taught and their potential applications, increasing engagement.

The Wiley Advantage

Extensive collection of topics provide coverage of both classic and emerging algorithmic methods such as:

mathematics for asymptotic analysis, including amortization and randomization,
general algorithm design techniques, including the greedy method, divide and-conquer, and dynamic programming,
data structures, including lists, trees, heaps, search trees, B-trees, hash tables, skip lists, union-find structures, and multi-dimensional trees,
algorithmic frameworks, such as NP-completeness, approximation algorithms, and external-memory algorithms, and
fundamental algorithms, including sorting, graph algorithms, computational geometry, numerical algorithms, cryptography, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and linear programming.


Each chapter is relatively independent of other chapters, providing instructors and readers with greater flexibility with respect to which chapters to explore
Emphasizing practical applications, each chapter is written to begin with a brief discussion of an application that motivates the topic of the chapter, highlighting real-world uses and how the topic of the chapter could be used in practice
Included are detailed pseudo-code descriptions and complete mathematical analysis
The chapters are designed so that they can be covered in 1-3 lectures, depending on the depth of the coverage
The text can be used for a core algorithms course, classically known as CS7, as well as upper-division/graduate data structures or algorithms, or a two-course sequence of the two topics
Contains over 800 exercises which are divided between the following categories:

Reinforcement exercises, which test comprehension of chapter topics
Creativity exercises, which test creative utilization of techniques from the chapter
Application exercises, which test uses of the topics of the chapter for real-world or contrived applications

The exercises are distributed so that roughly 35% are reinforcement exercises, 40% are creativity exercises, and 25% are application exercises.

Data Structures and Algorithms in Java 6/e

Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, Michael H. Goldwasser 
January 2014, ©2014


















For Instructors


For Students




Description
The design and analysis of efficient data structures has long been recognized as a key component of the Computer Science curriculum. Goodrich, Tomassia and Goldwasser's approach to this classic topic is based on the object-oriented paradigm as the framework of choice for the design of data structures. For each ADT presented in the text, the authors provide an associated Java interface. Concrete data structures realizing the ADTs are provided as Java classes implementing the interfaces. The Java code implementing fundamental data structures in this book is organized in a single Java package, net.datastructures. This package forms a coherent library of data structures and algorithms in Java specifically designed for educational purposes in a way that is complimentary with the Java Collections Framework.

New To This Edition

The authors redesigned the entire code base to increase clarity of presentation and consistency in style and convention, including reliance on type inference, as introduced in Java 7, to reduce clutter when instantiating generic types. 
A new chapter, dedicated to the topic of recursion, provides comprehensive coverage of material that was previously divided within multiple chapters, while newly introducing the use of recursion when processing file systems.
The authors have added 38 new figures, and redesigned 144 existing figures.
New co-author Michael Goldwasser, Professor and Director of Computer Science at St. Louis University, has been added to the author team.

The Wiley Advantage

Known for its clarity of presentation, DSA Java presents
even the most difficult mathematical concepts in terms students can
understand. 
A robust set of end-of-chapter problems are arranged
by purpose – reinforcement problems assess understanding;
creativity problems require students to apply concepts to writing
“classes” (portions of a program); projects require
students to write entire programs.
Java code examples are used extensively, with source
code provided on the student companion site . Students learn to
build data structures using a simple API which is consistent with
the Java Collections Framework.  The authors describe the Java
Collections Framework and point out how the API in use may differ
from the Java Collections Framework.
An effective in-text art program illustrate data
structures and algorithms in a clear, visual manner.  Visual
proofs help students develop a better understanding of mathematical
topics.
Coverage of Internet-related topics including hashing
and text processing.
Discussion of object-oriented design and the Java
programming language, including the Collections Framework and
Design Patterns help students grasp both data structures and
object-oriented design issues.  The book presents several
object-oriented design patterns and important Java language
constructs, like iterators and generic types, as well as all the
traditional data structures topics.

T. Michael GoodrichGroundbreaking Leadership in ConstructionInducted in 2004Mike Goodrich has been with BE&K throughout his professional career. During his thirty-plus years with the company, Mr. Goodrich has left his imprint on the company employees, its projects, and the communities where BE&K has worked. In each instance, Mr. Goodrich has left them the better for his involvement. Starting with BE&K in 1972 as the company’s legal counsel and assistant secretary, Mr. Goodrich became president in 1989, CEO in 1995, and chairman in 2003.
Thanks to Mr. Goodrich’s vision, BE&K has grown into an international design and construction powerhouse. In an effort to diversify BE&K Engineering and BE&K Construction, subsidiary companies were added to the BE&K family of companies over the past several years. BE&K’s family of companies now includes Suitt Construction Company, headquartered in Greenville, South Carolina; NorthStar Communications Group in Birmingham, Alabama; SW&B Construction Corporation in Auburn, Maine; F. N. Thompson in Charlotte, North Carolina; and Terranext in Denver, Colorado. These companies have built such diverse projects as Fulton County Stadium, Ericsson Stadium, Discovery Cove for Sea World, and numerous pharmaceutical and telecommunications projects. In addition to work in the United States, BE&K operates a major industrial construction company in Poland and a biotech-engineering firm in Helsinki, Finland.
Also a leader in the engineering and construction industry, Mr. Goodrich has made many contributions including his efforts to develop the Associated Builders and Contractors, and his services as a member of the Construction Industry Institute Board of Advisors, a director of the Construction Industry Round Table, and a trustee of the National Building Museum.
Mr. Goodrich has not limited his talents and efforts to industry. Echoing a guiding principle of BE&K, Mr. Goodrich has been dedicated to his community. Mr. Goodrich has served as a member of the City Council of Mountain Brook, and as a director of the UAB Health System and the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute. The Boy Scouts of America recognized Mr. Goodrich’s multitude of contributions by awarding him the Silver Antelope Award in 2003.
Mr. Goodrich’s firm belief in the importance of education led him to dedicate his talents to the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships, the Board of Governors for Indian Springs School, the President’s Council for The University of Alabama at Birmingham, and the President’s Cabinet for The University of Alabama.
Under Mr. Goodrich’s leadership, BE&K has developed pathways for minorities and women in all aspects of the engineering and construction industry—ranging from BE&K’s own minority-student internships to its construction camp for young women and the BE&K School of Industrial Construction, designed to teach high-school students construction skills; from the “If I Had a Hammer” program co-sponsored with the YWCA to its award-winning child care facility, BEKare. Because of these programs and others, BE&K has been recognized as one of the best places to work by Fortune and Working Mother magazines.
Following high school at Indian Springs School, Mr. Goodrich earned a degree in civil engineering from Tulane University and a law degree from The University of Alabama in 1971. Upon graduation from law school, he entered the U.S. Army and was discharged with the rank of captain.
Mr. Goodrich and his wife, Gillian, have four children and one grandchild.
