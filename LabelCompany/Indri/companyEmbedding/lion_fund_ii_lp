The firm did not hold shares at the end of the latest quarter ending September 30, 2014.From the filing:The Reporting Persons filing this Schedule 13D acquired the Shares of the Issuer which they own for investment purposes. The Reporting Persons may decide to acquire or sell additional Shares in the open market or otherwise, depending upon price, market conditions, availability of funds, evaluation of alternative investments, and other requisite factors.The Reporting Persons believe that the Issuer’s surplus cash should be distributed to its shareholders through a one-time special dividend.

The Lion Fund













 


 The Lion Fund is an activist San Antonio hedge fund managed by Sardar Biglari. The fund was started by Biglari in 2000 after he profited greatly from the "dot-com" boom. Membership in the fund is limited to accredited investors who are willing to place an initial investment of at least $250,000. Biglari manages the fund based on the Ben Graham and David Dodd method of investing - that is to buy undervalued stocks of companies in order to achieve long-term growth as the value of the stocks appreciate.

Investment Strategy[edit]
Lion Capital seeks to invest in mid and large-sized companies selling branded products, including apparel, accessories and luxury goods, food distribution and specialty retail.[4] Lion Capital’s directors have resisted diversification into other sectors, claiming that their strategy is to know more about less.[1]
Lion Capital’s team draws on its investing and operating expertise to identify consumer brands with growth potential and implement value creating strategies within these businesses, often through geographic expansion, category extension, product innovation or operating improvements.[5] While investments are first and foremost sector driven, Lion Capital focuses on companies in Europe and North America.[4]
History[edit]
Lion Capital was founded in 2004 by Lyndon Lea, Robert Darwent and Neil Richardson with the goal of creating the leading investment firm focused on the consumer sector.[3]
The firm’s predecessor, also run by Lea and Darwent, was launched in 1998 as the European affiliate of American private equity firm Hicks Muse Tate & Furst (now HM Capital).[6] Lea and Darwent separated the European affiliate from its ailing American parent, launching Lion Capital as an independent private equity firm.[7]
In 2004, Lion Capital completed fundraising for its first private equity fund, Lion Capital Fund I, with commitments from institutional investors of €820 million.[8] Over thirty institutions committed capital to Fund I.[3]
In April 2007, Lion Capital established a North American presence, opening an office in New York.[3] That same year Lion Capital raised its second private equity fund, Lion Capital Fund II, with approximately €2.0 billion of investor commitments.[9][10]
In 2010, Lion Capital formed its third private equity fund, Lion Capital Fund III, which ultimately included capital commitments of €1.5 billion.[3][11]
In October 2012, the North American office was relocated from New York to Los Angeles.[12]
Investments[edit]
Lion Capital's portfolio has included some of the world's best known consumer brands.[1] Among the firm's most notable investments are:

Bought Weetabix in 2004 for £640 million and sold 60% to Bright Food in 2012 in a deal valuing the company at £1.2 billion[13]
Acquired Jimmy Choo in 2004 for £100 million and sold the company in 2007 for £225 million[14]
Acquired wagamama in 2005 for £102 million[15] and later sold the company for £215 million in 2011[16]
Acquired Orangina Schweppes in 2006 in partnership with the Blackstone Group and later sold the company for €2.6 billion in 2009[17]
Acquired Kettle Foods in 2006 for $270 million and sold the company in 2010 for $615 million[18]
Acquired HEMA in 2007 in a deal estimated to be worth €1.3 billion[19]
Acquired the Findus and Young's brands in 2008 for £1.1 billion[20]
Acquired AS Adventure Group in 2008 for €263 million[21]
Invested $80 million in American Apparel in 2009[22]
Acquired Bumble Bee Foods for $980 million in 2010[23]
Purchased Picard in 2010 for €1.5 billion[24]
Acquired AllSaints in 2011[25]
Acquired Alain Afflelou in 2012 for €740 million[26]
Acquired John Varvatos Enterprises, Inc. in 2012[27]

Investment Strategy[edit]
Lion Capital seeks to invest in mid and large-sized companies selling branded products, including apparel, accessories and luxury goods, food distribution and specialty retail.[4] Lion Capital’s directors have resisted diversification into other sectors, claiming that their strategy is to know more about less.[1]
Lion Capital’s team draws on its investing and operating expertise to identify consumer brands with growth potential and implement value creating strategies within these businesses, often through geographic expansion, category extension, product innovation or operating improvements.[5] While investments are first and foremost sector driven, Lion Capital focuses on companies in Europe and North America.[4]
History[edit]
Lion Capital was founded in 2004 by Lyndon Lea, Robert Darwent and Neil Richardson with the goal of creating the leading investment firm focused on the consumer sector.[3]
The firm’s predecessor, also run by Lea and Darwent, was launched in 1998 as the European affiliate of American private equity firm Hicks Muse Tate & Furst (now HM Capital).[6] Lea and Darwent separated the European affiliate from its ailing American parent, launching Lion Capital as an independent private equity firm.[7]
In 2004, Lion Capital completed fundraising for its first private equity fund, Lion Capital Fund I, with commitments from institutional investors of €820 million.[8] Over thirty institutions committed capital to Fund I.[3]
In April 2007, Lion Capital established a North American presence, opening an office in New York.[3] That same year Lion Capital raised its second private equity fund, Lion Capital Fund II, with approximately €2.0 billion of investor commitments.[9][10]
In 2010, Lion Capital formed its third private equity fund, Lion Capital Fund III, which ultimately included capital commitments of €1.5 billion.[3][11]
In October 2012, the North American office was relocated from New York to Los Angeles.[12]
Investments[edit]
Lion Capital's portfolio has included some of the world's best known consumer brands.[1] Among the firm's most notable investments are:

Bought Weetabix in 2004 for £640 million and sold 60% to Bright Food in 2012 in a deal valuing the company at £1.2 billion[13]
Acquired Jimmy Choo in 2004 for £100 million and sold the company in 2007 for £225 million[14]
Acquired wagamama in 2005 for £102 million[15] and later sold the company for £215 million in 2011[16]
Acquired Orangina Schweppes in 2006 in partnership with the Blackstone Group and later sold the company for €2.6 billion in 2009[17]
Acquired Kettle Foods in 2006 for $270 million and sold the company in 2010 for $615 million[18]
Acquired HEMA in 2007 in a deal estimated to be worth €1.3 billion[19]
Acquired the Findus and Young's brands in 2008 for £1.1 billion[20]
Acquired AS Adventure Group in 2008 for €263 million[21]
Invested $80 million in American Apparel in 2009[22]
Acquired Bumble Bee Foods for $980 million in 2010[23]
Purchased Picard in 2010 for €1.5 billion[24]
Acquired AllSaints in 2011[25]
Acquired Alain Afflelou in 2012 for €740 million[26]
Acquired John Varvatos Enterprises, Inc. in 2012[27]
