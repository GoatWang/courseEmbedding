It is not our intention to make money by buying and selling stock. Rather, we want to invest in a great company that will increase its value in the market place over time and share its profits with us through the dividends it pays out. We want to be long term owners of high quality, growing businesses.    Lincoln Capital LLC is a Registered Investment Adviser.

HomeClient Centered FocusInvestment PhilosophyProfessional ResourcesYour Expert PartnersClient Log InContact        Because stocks represent partial ownership of a company, we treat our purchases as if we were buying the entire company.We want to have a high degree of confidence the company will be in business 10 to 20 years from now. Do they have a balance sheet that can survive difficult periods in the economy? Do they have a sustainable competitive advantage? Are they susceptible to changes in technology?After we are comfortable with the quality of a company we are considering, we then want to know how the current price of its stock compares to the value we would place on it. Can the stock be purchased at a discount from our perceived value of the company?  Stocks  We believe that fixed income investments such as CDs, Treasury Bonds, and tax-free municipal bonds are intended to be the safe, stable, and dependable parts of your portfolio.While many in our business are often tempted to “reach for yield” by investing in lower rated bonds or complex financial instruments, we place a high value on quality and simplicity. Obtaining a high interest rate is always welcome, but not at the risk of losing principal.  Fixed Income Investments  Our Approach  Lincoln Capital’s reputation as a true partner is built on the understanding of diverse client needs, creating solutions that fit their current situation, while keeping the future in mind.

BBB Reason for Ratings


        BBB rating is based on 13 factors: Get the details about the factors considered.










BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.
