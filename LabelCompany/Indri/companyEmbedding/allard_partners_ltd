Company Description


Allard Partners follows a long-only absolute return strategy. The firm invests in equity across the Asia Pacific region and focus economies with both domestic political stability and an institutional framework supporting a solid macro outlook. They are conviction-based, prudent investors who favor well-managed businesses with superior returns on capital in industries with long-term growth potential. They invest in businesses, independently of any index or benchmark.The research and portfolio management functions are integrated. Allard Partners aims to identify long term investment themes and secular trends for each economy. Their investment approach starts with top-down selection of sectors with attractive structures and growth prospects. Then they proceed with bottom-up in-house research which includes company visits. Valuation is based on discounted cash flow analysis and scenario stress testing. The company only invests in companies with a share price at a discount compared to their long-term valuation. The resulting high conviction portfolio is concentrated and continuously reviewed. Allard Partners selectively use options to enhance their funds' returns.
