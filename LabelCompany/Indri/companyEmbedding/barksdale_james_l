Early life[edit]
James Barksdale was born in Jackson, Mississippi. He received a B.A. in Business Administration from the University of Mississippi in 1965. While there, Barksdale became a member of the Eta Chapter of the Sigma Chi fraternity.[3]
Career[edit]
Barksdale was called before Congress several times during hearings about Microsoft and its alleged abuse of its operating system monopoly to dominate the web browser market (see also: Browser wars). At one point he addressed the entire room: "How many of you use Intel-based PCs in this audience, not Macintoshes?" Most people in the room raised their hands. "Of that group who use PCs? How many of you use a PC without Microsoft's operating system?" All of the hands went down. He said to the Senate panel, "Gentlemen, that is a monopoly."[4]
Before Netscape, Barksdale had worked as CEO of McCaw Cellular/AT&T Wireless and, before that, as Vice President and COO of FedEx.[5][6] After departing Netscape, he founded The Barksdale Group, an investment and advisory group created for the purpose of helping Internet service companies. He also sits on the Board of Directors of several companies including Time Warner, FedEx, and Sun Microsystems. President George W. Bush appointed him to the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.
Barksdale served on the board of myCFO.
Between March and July 2009, construction crews working for Barksdale's Spread Networks completed a nearly straight fiber-optic link between Chicago and New York City. By shaving 3 milliseconds off the previously fastest connection between these two trading centers, Barksdale, according to some industry insiders, can charge 8 to 10 times the going rate because any algorithmic trading algorithm not operating on his network is at a significant speed disadvantage. The line was built almost entirely with his personal funds and in secret lest a competitor attempt to build another line before he was able to finish it.[citation needed]
Personal life and philanthropy[edit]
He and his late wife, Sally, gave a US$5.4 million endowment to the University of Mississippi to help form the McDonnell-Barksdale Honors College.[7] In January 2000, they gave US$100 million to the State of Mississippi to create The Barksdale Reading Institute, a joint venture with the Mississippi Department of Education and the state's public universities.[8]
His wife, Sally Barksdale, died of cancer in 2003. He has three children and five grandchildren.[9] To honor his deceased wife, Barksdale asked that the Honors College be renamed the Sally McDonnell Barksdale Honors College.
In 2005, he married Donna Kennedy Sones of Jackson, Mississippi. Between them they have six children and five grandchildren. Barksdale's latest gift, given in conjunction with his wife Donna, created the Mississippi Principal Corps at the University of Mississippi that will change the way the state's school principals are trained.
His brother, Rhesa H. Barksdale, is a federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

Early life[edit]
James Barksdale was born in Jackson, Mississippi. He received a B.A. in Business Administration from the University of Mississippi in 1965. While there, Barksdale became a member of the Eta Chapter of the Sigma Chi fraternity.[3]
Career[edit]
Barksdale was called before Congress several times during hearings about Microsoft and its alleged abuse of its operating system monopoly to dominate the web browser market (see also: Browser wars). At one point he addressed the entire room: "How many of you use Intel-based PCs in this audience, not Macintoshes?" Most people in the room raised their hands. "Of that group who use PCs? How many of you use a PC without Microsoft's operating system?" All of the hands went down. He said to the Senate panel, "Gentlemen, that is a monopoly."[4]
Before Netscape, Barksdale had worked as CEO of McCaw Cellular/AT&T Wireless and, before that, as Vice President and COO of FedEx.[5][6] After departing Netscape, he founded The Barksdale Group, an investment and advisory group created for the purpose of helping Internet service companies. He also sits on the Board of Directors of several companies including Time Warner, FedEx, and Sun Microsystems. President George W. Bush appointed him to the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.
Barksdale served on the board of myCFO.
Between March and July 2009, construction crews working for Barksdale's Spread Networks completed a nearly straight fiber-optic link between Chicago and New York City. By shaving 3 milliseconds off the previously fastest connection between these two trading centers, Barksdale, according to some industry insiders, can charge 8 to 10 times the going rate because any algorithmic trading algorithm not operating on his network is at a significant speed disadvantage. The line was built almost entirely with his personal funds and in secret lest a competitor attempt to build another line before he was able to finish it.[citation needed]
Personal life and philanthropy[edit]
He and his late wife, Sally, gave a US$5.4 million endowment to the University of Mississippi to help form the McDonnell-Barksdale Honors College.[7] In January 2000, they gave US$100 million to the State of Mississippi to create The Barksdale Reading Institute, a joint venture with the Mississippi Department of Education and the state's public universities.[8]
His wife, Sally Barksdale, died of cancer in 2003. He has three children and five grandchildren.[9] To honor his deceased wife, Barksdale asked that the Honors College be renamed the Sally McDonnell Barksdale Honors College.
In 2005, he married Donna Kennedy Sones of Jackson, Mississippi. Between them they have six children and five grandchildren. Barksdale's latest gift, given in conjunction with his wife Donna, created the Mississippi Principal Corps at the University of Mississippi that will change the way the state's school principals are trained.
His brother, Rhesa H. Barksdale, is a federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

Donna and James L. BarksdaleBringing vision, experience and passion to The Campaign for Mayo ClinicBy Mayo Clinic Staff



















Take a moment to count all of the times you've used a cellphone or browsed the Internet over the past week, or maybe even the past day — it's likely a challenge to tally them all. Now consider overnight package delivery. Quickly shipping items where they need to go is another convenience of modern life that is easy to take for granted.
Playing a pivotal role in any of these innovations would mark a highly successful career, and that makes James L. Barksdale's achievements even more extraordinary: He was deeply involved in all three.
When FedEx Corp. created the business of overnight mail delivery, he oversaw the development of the first computer system capable of tracking millions of packages worldwide.
Years before everyone had cellphones, he was the president of McCaw Cellular Communications, Inc., the company that became AT&T Wireless, where he was CEO.
And as the general public first learned to use the Internet, he oversaw the meteoric rise of Web-browsing pioneer Netscape.
Fortune magazine has noted his "genius at motivating people," and PC Magazine recognized him as Person of the Year. When he was president and CEO of Netscape, the company received the Entrepreneurial Company of the Year award from both the Stanford University and Harvard University alumni associations.
Now Mr. Barksdale, whom his friends call Jim, is stepping forward in a major leadership role as chair of The Campaign for Mayo Clinic, an effort to raise $3 billion by the end of 2017 to fund Mayo's strategic priorities in practice, research and education.
"I think now is the time to take Mayo's work even further, and that's why I'm excited about the mission that we're on," he says.'Faith in Mayo'


Donna and Jim Barksdale

Jim has a long-standing connection to Mayo Clinic and is grateful for the care that friends and loved ones have received dating back to the 1970s. From 2001 to 2014, he served as a member of the Mayo Clinic Board of Trustees. He chaired the board from 2006 to 2010.
"I have family members who went there in a couple of cases when they were in pretty desperate shape and nobody else could help them, but Mayo did," Jim says.
Jim's wife, Donna, herself a successful businesswoman and civic leader, also has a connection to Mayo Clinic that spans generations.
"My mother has been a Mayo Clinic patient, I have been a patient, and my daughter was a patient at a very critical time in her life. My granddaughter is also a Mayo patient," Donna says. "So that gives you an indication of what we feel about our trust and faith in Mayo."
The Barksdales' commitment to Mayo inspired them to make one of the most significant gifts during the previous Campaign for Mayo Clinic, an effort that exceeded its goal by raising $1.35 billion between 2005 and 2009.
That gift in 2007 played a major role in launching the Center for Individualized Medicine, enabling a clinic that brings genomic discoveries directly to patient care and launching clinical trials aimed at finding new treatments for breast cancer, prostate cancer and heart disease.
"A large part of it can be traced back to the real jump-start we got from that transformational support from the Barksdales," says Eric D. Wieben, Ph.D., director of Mayo Clinic's Medical Genome Facility. "That gift, at that time, let us scale up and gain the expertise we needed to become really competitive."'The science is there'Bringing deep experience in driving innovation, Jim sees tremendous opportunity in the new campaign and its ability to advance discoveries that promise to revolutionize health care.
"I think it's very important at this time to make it happen because the science is there if we'll just push it," he says. "I think if we can get the investments, the dollars to come in, we can move the science much further, much faster."
Just as he helped create entire industries as a business leader, Jim's investment in individualized medicine came at a time when Mayo Clinic was starting to develop its capabilities in a rapidly developing field of medicine. When talking about the impact individualized medicine is already making, he stresses the results Mayo is seeing with patients.
"We can see that they're doing not just research, but they're actually saving individual people's lives," he says. "It's been one of the most exciting things in my life as we've gotten involved with individualized medicine at Mayo Clinic."
Donna agrees that individualized medicine will have an impact on patients for years to come. "I think it is completely the future of medicine," she says.
Commitment and contributionAs a philanthropist, Jim has led efforts ranging from early childhood literacy to honors education at the University of Mississippi. Also in Mississippi, he served as chair of the Governor's Commission on Recovery, Rebuilding and Renewal following Hurricane Katrina.
"Jim has made tremendous contributions to society and to making people's lives better," says Mayo Clinic President and CEO John H. Noseworthy, M.D. "We are very fortunate at Mayo Clinic to have him in a leadership role."
Jim looks at his time on the board of trustees, as well as serving on various committees to support Mayo Clinic, as valuable experience that will help as chair of The Campaign for Mayo Clinic. One person who knows him well from her service on the board of trustees is Marilyn Carlson Nelson, a former board chair.
"Jim is brilliant," she says. "He's a very deep person with a deep commitment to Mayo Clinic, and he's the perfect leader for our campaign because he walks the talk. He believes in what we're doing, and he believes in Mayo's future."
As Jim steps forward as campaign chair, Marilyn also points to his credibility as a leader in advancing philanthropy to support Mayo Clinic. "He's given of himself — of his time, his talent and his treasure — and he can therefore inspire and motivate others to do it, as well," she says.
Dr. Noseworthy, who counts Jim as a trusted mentor, agrees that Jim's leadership will help the campaign succeed. "I've worked with him, and it's wonderful," Dr. Noseworthy says. "It's fun, it's quick, but you better be focused. Working together with him in this campaign, I know that we'll keep Mayo strong for our patients."

Jim BarksdaleBornJames Love Barksdale(1943-01-24) January 24, 1943 (age 74)Jackson, Mississippi, United StatesAlma materUniversity of MississippiKnown forCEO of NetscapeCOO of FedExBoard Member of Time WarnerNet worth US$ 700 Million (est. 2000)[1]Spouse(s)Donna Kennedy Sones (m. 2005)James Love Barksdale (born January 24, 1943) is an American executive who served as the president and CEO of Netscape Communications Corporation from January 1995 until the company merged with AOL in March 1999.[2]Contents1 Early life2 Career3 Personal life and philanthropy4 References5 External linksEarly lifeJames Barksdale was born in Jackson, Mississippi. He received a B.A. in Business Administration from the University of Mississippi in 1965. While there, Barksdale became a member of the Eta Chapter of the Sigma Chi fraternity.[3]CareerBarksdale was called before Congress several times during hearings about Microsoft and its alleged abuse of its operating system monopoly to dominate the web browser market (see also: Browser wars). At one point he addressed the entire room: "How many of you use Intel-based PCs in this audience, not Macintoshes?" Most people in the room raised their hands. "Of that group who use PCs? How many of you use a PC without Microsoft's operating system?" All of the hands went down. He said to the Senate panel, "Gentlemen, that is a monopoly."[4]Before Netscape, Barksdale had worked as CEO of McCaw Cellular/AT&T Wireless and, before that, as Vice President and COO of FedEx.[5][6] After departing Netscape, he founded The Barksdale Group, an investment and advisory group created for the purpose of helping Internet service companies. He also sits on the Board of Directors of several companies including Time Warner, FedEx, and Sun Microsystems. President George W. Bush appointed him to the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.Barksdale served on the board of myCFO.Between March and July 2009, construction crews working for Barksdale's Spread Networks completed a nearly straight fiber-optic link between Chicago and New York City. By shaving 3 milliseconds off the previously fastest connection between these two trading centers, Barksdale, according to some industry insiders, can charge 8 to 10 times the going rate because any algorithmic trading algorithm not operating on his network is at a significant speed disadvantage. The line was built almost entirely with his personal funds and in secret lest a competitor attempt to build another line before he was able to finish it.[citation needed]Personal life and philanthropyHe and his late wife, Sally, gave a US$5.4 million endowment to the University of Mississippi to help form the McDonnell-Barksdale Honors College.[7] In January 2000, they gave US$100 million to the State of Mississippi to create The Barksdale Reading Institute, a joint venture with the Mississippi Department of Education and the state's public universities.[8]His wife, Sally Barksdale, died of cancer in 2003. He has three children and five grandchildren.[9] To honor his deceased wife, Barksdale asked that the Honors College be renamed the Sally McDonnell Barksdale Honors College.In 2005, he married Donna Kennedy Sones of Jackson, Mississippi. Between them they have six children and five grandchildren. Barksdale's latest gift, given in conjunction with his wife Donna, created the Mississippi Principal Corps at the University of Mississippi that will change the way the state's school principals are trained.His brother, Rhesa H. Barksdale, is a federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.References^ Features, List (2000-12-31). "CBS". CBS. ^ "James Barksdale". Forbes.
