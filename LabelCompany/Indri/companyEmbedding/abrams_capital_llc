The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Prior to forming Abrams Capital Management in 1999, Abrams worked at Seth Klarman’s Baupost Group for 10 years. In the nearly 12 years since Abrams started his fund he has achieved an annualized return of around 20 percent (net of fees). David Abrams is a value investor just like Seth Klarman. He invests only a small percentage of his assets in equities. You can check out his latest and previous portfolios below. In June 2014 WSJ published an article focusing on Abrams Capital. The article stated that David Abrams is a billionaire who earned $400 million in 2013. The article also revealed that Boston-based Abrams Capital has nearly $8 billion in AUM and returned 15% since its inception.
