Variable Annuities with FlexChoice


.







Lifetime Income with Fewer Compromises
Market volatility and today’s long retirements make income you can’t outlive an essential part of your portfolio.
A variable annuity with the optional FlexChoice rider lets you turn a portion of your savings into guaranteed income that lasts for life. You’ll also benefit from market gains while being protected if the market drops. All that plus real-life flexibility to adapt however life unfolds — especially if you’re married. 






At-A-Glance:
 Variable Annuities 



One of the only investments that offer income for life — no matter how long you live.
Have the potential to grow tax-deferred with the market.
Optional living and death benefits offer added protection.


















Income Built for Two
			See why FlexChoice is a lifetime income option married couples may love.

Benefits
           Make your portfolio more balanced and durable with guaranteed lifetime income that can grow.
        



Income


Flexibility


On Your Terms













Income You Can Count On








Earn 5% Growth Per Year
During the first decade, your future income goes up by compounding 5% each year, even if the market goes down or stays flat (as long as you don’t withdraw anything).
Lock in Market Gains
Each year until age 91, if your account value is higher than your Benefit Base due to market performance, you get an Automatic Step-Up that increases future payments.
5% or 6% Withdrawals at Age 65
You can start taking 5% or 6% withdrawals at age 65 depending on your choice of two options.






 

















 

















Unique Flexibility for Married Couples








For However Life Unfolds
Many guaranteed income products make married couples lock in big decisions up front. But with FlexChoice, you don’t have to decide if you want income for one or two lives unless your account value runs out.
More Income Sooner
Unlike many retirement income products, with FlexChoice the amount of income you can withdraw is based on the age of the older owner. That can mean getting a higher withdrawal rate years sooner than if you had to wait for a younger spouse to “catch up.”
Income Built for Two
If a spouse passes away, the surviving spouse continues to receive the same income payments they’ve come to rely on with no interruption.






More about 
 Spousal Flexibility 


Wondering about the cost to cover two people? There’s no extra charge to cover a spouse, and married couples even enjoy the same initial withdrawal rate as single account holders.

Make Decisions When It is Right for You








Turn Withdrawals On and Off
You can start and stop withdrawals at any time after 59½. Waiting to take withdrawals can increase the amount you’re able to withdraw later.
Choose How Much You Get
The income you receive is based on factors you control. They include the age at which you start taking withdrawals, whether you want a steady amount of income or more early on, and if you decide to cover one or two people (only after your account value runs out).
Cancel if You Change Your Mind
In some cases, you may no longer need lifetime income. That’s ok — you have alternatives if your needs change.

Prospectuses for the investment portfolios offered by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company are available from your financial professional. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract’s features, risks, charges, and expenses. Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the investment company carefully before investing. The investment objectives, risks, and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.
Variable annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial variable annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions, and terms for keeping them in force. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in this product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value, even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. All contract and rider guarantees, including optional benefits and annuity payout rates, are subject to the claims paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Please contact your financial professional for complete details.
Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution tax that is generally imposed on interest, dividends, and annuity income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges.
Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. Clients should confer with their qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Life Insurance




There’s more to life insurance than taking care of loved ones if you pass away. 

Life insurance can also be an essential part of a financial plan. In addition to helping to protect loved ones financially with a death benefit, some products can grow money on a tax-advantaged basis that can be used during one’s lifetime. The ability to meet more than one need makes life insurance a product that adds valuable flexibility to any portfolio.

Talk to your financial professional if you think life insurance might be right for you.















                                Our easy-to-use tool can help guide you to start the conversation around life insurance with your financial professional. 
 

















Types of Life Insurance





Permanent Life Insurance
Provides coverage that lasts a lifetime and can build cash value that can be used while living. 



Term Life Insurance
Provides coverage for a specific length of time and provides the most payout for the money, but does not build cash value.

















Permanent Life Insurance
Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for life. Many permanent life insurance products also have a feature called cash value. This cash value can grow over time through interest credits, market returns, or dividends, providing money that can be used for a variety of needs.  

Permanent life insurance products include: Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life, Whole Life, and Variable Universal Life.







Premier Accumulator Universal Life
Can grow cash value quickly and allows faster access to your money when you need it.
Learn More 
.


















Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a fixed number of years, such as 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 and pays a death benefit if you pass away during the covered time period. Most term insurance policies offer a level premium, death benefit, and the ability to convert to a permanent policy if your needs change. You can also choose coverage for current needs and add optional riders for future needs.







Guaranteed Level Term
Available in coverage amounts of $1 million or more, with premiums guaranteed to stay the same throughout the level premium period.

More Information about Annuities





What exactly is an Annuity?

                        An annuity is an investment product that provides safe, tax-deferred growth of your
                        retirement nest egg. Annuities are considered low-risk, and can provide guaranteed, monthly
                        income when
                        you retire. There are many types of annuities with varying features & benefits. These include:
                        fixed,
                        variable, immediate, deferred & hybrid. We strongly suggest you consult with a financial
                        professional to
                        help you understand the various types of annuities before you purchase.
                    








Is an Annuity Right for You?

                        Annuities are NOT a good fit for everyone. Annuities are designed for people looking for
                        guaranteed, monthly income when they retire - they are NOT a high-risk / high-return investment.
                        They are considered to be in the mainstream of conservative retirement planning - over $225
                        billion in annuities have been purchased in the past 12 months alone!
                    








What are your Next Steps?

                        The first thing to do is to see if an annuity fits your specific profile and financial
                        situation. This "fit" is based on the amount of retirement savings you currently have, how old
                        you are, and the State you live in. Simply fill in the information above and our system will
                        generate a free, tailor-made Annuity Report that will include annuity rate quotes from A+ rated
                        companies in your area.

11 Annuity Tips You Should Know









































11 Tips You Absolutely Must Know About Annuities  




Tip #11: There are different types of annuities.  Some are designed for accumulation and growth; while others are designed to maximize retirement income. Fixed annuities provide a safe alternative to bank CD’s. It’s very important to select the right type of annuity for your situation. 





Get My Annuity Report Now!


2017's Best Annuities - Find the annuities with the highest rates, lowest fees and highest guaranteed returns in our free report




Tip #10: If you purchase a traditional fixed annuity, find a company that has a history of providing competitive renewal rates. This is important because the interest rate you earn is only guaranteed for a portion of the term. Some companies have a history of paying better renewal rates than others. The rates for CD-type annuities remain the same for the term. 







Tip #8: If you purchase an immediate annuity with a “life with cash refund or life with installment refund”, the listed beneficiaries will receive 100% of the remaining dollars.  Annuities avoid probate, so select the right beneficiary!




Tip #9:
  Rates that look too good to be true, usually are. Make sure to check the companies rating before purchasing and look for stable, highly rated companies. You also want to diversify. Don't invest all of your savings with 1 company. 







Tip #5: Income annuities (SPIA’s) usually provide the highest contractually guaranteed payout of any type of annuity if you need “income now”. SPIA's also have no fees.  




Looking for retirement income? Our free report shops 150+ annuities and highlights the companies with the highest guaranteed returns




Our Free Report compares 1,420 annuities from America's two largest annuity databases








Tip #7: Insurance agents usually get paid more the longer the money is locked up.  Many states have banned annuities with terms over 10 years.  You should do the same. 




Tip #6: You might have seen annuity ads where an annuity earned 12-15% with no risk. These come from "uncapped" index annuities. These returns are possible when market indexes go up considerably. Keep in mind these returns are not normal. 




Bonus Tip :  Let us help you. Request our free annuity report and we will send you what we feel are the best annuities available on the market today. Our free report compares 1,420 annuities from America's two largest annuity databases to find the highest guaranteed returns.

Tip #4:  Be careful of the fees on variable annuities.  Variable annuities have many different layers of fees. Get an itemized breakdown of all of the fees.  If your variable annuity earns 7-9% gross and you pay 3-4% in fees, you may be better off in fixed products.




Tip #3: Shop around. Don't buy any annuity until you compare the rates, benefits and fees of all of the products available.   Rates vary considerably! The top 5 year fixed annuity is now paying 220% more interest than the bottom in our database. 




Tip #2:  Index annuities - 1. Does it have a cap?  2. In plain english, how is the gain calculated?  If you are looking at index annuities with an income rider, we can compare 150+ products and show you which products guarantee the most income in our free report. 











Tip #1:
 Longevity annuities (DIA's) allow you to take a lump sum and turn it into "income later". The US treasury department and IRS have endorsed this type of annuity in recent years and made them more accessible in 401(k) plans.

 Annuities

	Enjoy your retirement





A good retirement income plan should generate two to three decades of sustainable income. It can help protect your assets from inflation, market volatility and savings withdrawal rates.
What is an annuity?
An annuity is an insurance product designed for retirement to help protect your financial future and guard against outliving your savings. An annuity pays you periodic income payments for as long as you live in exchange for a premium and it’s designed to be part of an overall retirement strategy. Annuity types offer different features and payment options to help meet your needs and priorities. Compare your options.
Annuities offer many additional benefits to help you prepare for the future, such as:  

No annual contribution limit
Ability to diversify and potentially grow your investments
Tax-deferred investment income until it’s withdrawn
Death benefit protection for beneficiaries
Optional riders (for an additional cost). Review our rider options.

To decide if a variable annuity is right for you, consider that its value will fluctuate; it’s subject to investment risk and possible loss of principal; and there are costs associated.
If you have questions or for more information on annuities, contact an advisor. 
Tax considerations
Annuities allow money to grow tax-deferred until clients begin taking payments. While consumers can’t control state and federal tax rates or policies they can take steps to help protect savings and income from tax erosion, and improve spending power in retirement. 

Find out why tax planning for retirement is so important.

	In the third quarter of 2006, DALBAR ranked the Lincoln Financial Group Web site #2 in its quarterly ranking of customer-friendly Web sites. In 2005, the company ranked among the 100 best companies for working mothers for the 19th time in the previous 20 years, according to Working Mother magazine.

	History

	The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company began operations on June 11, 1905, in Fort Wayne, IN. Its 33 founding investors chose the name “Lincoln” in honor of President Abraham Lincoln, to denote dependability and honesty. Robert Todd Lincoln, the President’s only surviving son, gave permission for his father’s name and likeness to be used by the company. In 1931, the company started the Lincoln Historical Research Foundation. The Foundation opened a museum containing Lincoln artifacts, documents and memorabilia in Fort Wayne in 1931. The museum still exists.

	The company grew rapidly. By 1911, it had $6.5 million in life insurance in force. Between 1914 and 1940, it added an additional $250 million. Its growth rate between 1905 and 1955 was the largest of any American life-insurance company; by 1955, it was the 9th-largest insurance company in the country. In 1968, Lincoln National Corporation became the first U.S. insurance holding company. In 1973, the company began offering mutual funds and investment-advisory services.

	After 1990, Lincoln Financial Group dropped its property and casualty insurance lines and reinsurance operations. In 1995, it acquired the prestigious Delaware Investments to beef up its investment operation. As the century dawned, the holding company purchased the life insurance and annuity operations of CIGNA and Aetna. IN 2006, it merged with Jefferson National Pilot to produce the financial powerhouse of today.

	Lincoln Annuities

	Lincoln annuities include fixed, indexed, immediate and variable annuities. Its fixed-annuity product is a single-premium deferred annuity. Its three indexed fixed annuities include both single-premium and flexible-premium products. Its two immediate annuities, both single-premium products, include an inflation-indexed annuity. Lincoln Financial Group produces two suites of variable annuities, each containing 10 distinct variable-annuity products. (The company’s New York affiliate offers annuity products modeled on the foregoing, but with terms modified in accordance with New York law.)

	In 2008, the Morningstar Annuity Research Center ranked the company #1 in non-captive sales of variable annuities for the first half of the year. (Non-captive sales are executed by independent agents who are not bound exclusively to the products of one insurance company.)

	Financial-Strength Ratings of Companies Issuing Lincoln AnnuitiesThe four major ratings services rate the financial strength of Lincoln National Life Insurance Company and the Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York. According to the company Web site, those ratings are as follows:


		A.M. Best: A+ (2nd-highest of 16 categories)

		Standard & Poor’s: AA- (4th-highest of 21)

		Moody’s: A2 (6th-highest of 21)

		Fitch: A+ (5th-highest of 21)


	News

	On July 10, 2009, Lincoln Financial Group announced the successful completion of its $2.1 billion capital-acquisition program. The money was raised by issuing common and preferred stock and taking on debt. The group contributed $1 billion to the capital base of the Lincoln National Life Insurance Company. $950 million was obtained by issuing preferred stock to the federal government as part of the U.S. Treasury’s Capital Purchase program, which is designed to promote economic growth.

	On June 25, 2009, the Federal District Court upheld a jury verdict on favor of Lincoln Financial Group in its patent-infringement suit against Transamerica Life Insurance Company. The suit involved the use of a computerized system for administering variable annuity accounts - specifically, those accounts containing products that offered guaranteed minimum payments combined with systematic withdrawal programs.

 Lincoln Life & Annuity Variable Annuity Account H
 American Legacy III

Supplement dated September 1, 2005
 to the Prospectus dated May 1, 2005

Please keep this Supplement with your current American Legacy III Prospectus and
retain it for reference. This Supplement replaces the discussion currently in   
your prospectus regarding the death benefits available under i4LIFE(R)          
Advantage. No action is required on your part unless you wish to elect the      
i4LIFE(R) Advantage.                                                            

Effective on or about September 1, 2005 (depending on state availability), the  
i4LIFE(R) Advantage Guarantee of Principal death benefit will be available to   
owners of both qualified (IRA and Roth IRA) and non-qualified contracts who     
elect i4LIFE(R) Advantage. The i4LIFE(R) Advantage Guarantee of Principal death 
benefit option is not available to existing contractowners if the Account Value 
death benefit was in force prior to electing i4LIFE(R) Advantage. The i4LIFE(R) 
Advantage Enhanced Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit (EGMDB) is available to     
existing contractowners only if the EGMDB (or more expensive death benefit '    
option) was in force prior to electing i4LIFE(R) Advantage.                     

Once i4LIFE(R) Advantage begins, any prior death benefit election will          
terminate. The death benefit proceeds under the new death benefit may be less   
than the amount that would have been paid under the death benefit in effect     
before i4LIFE(R) Advantage began. The death benefit options described in this   
supplement are only available during the Access Period.                         

Effective Date                                                                  

If the benefit is elected after the contract is issued (by sending a            
written request to our home office), the benefit will be effective on the next  
valuation date following approval by us.                                        

Charges

percentage of average daily net assets in the subaccounts) will be:

For a complete listing of charges, see Expense tables in the prospectus.        

i4LIFE(R) Advantage Account Value death benefit. The i4LIFE(R)Advantage Account 
Value death benefit is available for both qualified and non-qualified annuity   
contracts. This benefit is equal to the Account Value as of the valuation date  
on which we approve the payment of the death claim. The charge under this death 
benefit is equal to an annual rate of 1.65% (or 2.15% if the Guaranteed Income  
Benefit is elected) of the net asset value of the Account Value in the VAA. You 
may not change this death benefit once it is elected.                           

i4LIFE(R) Advantage Guarantee of Principal death benefit. The i4LIFE(R)         
Advantage Guarantee of Principal death benefit is available for both qualified  
and non-qualified contracts. This benefit will be equal to the greater of:      

o the Account Value as of the valuation date we approve the payment of the      
claim; or                                                                   
o the sum of all purchase payments, minus all death benefit reductions          
where:                                                                      
   o   each death benefit reduction of purchase payments for a regular
          income payment will be for the dollar amount of the regular income
payment; and                                            
   o   each death benefit reduction of purchase payments for all other
            withdrawals will be deducted in the same proportion that withdrawals
reduce the contract or Account value.                   

In a declining market, withdrawals deducted in the same proportion that         
withdrawals reduce the contract or Account Value may have a magnified effect on 
the reduction of the death benefit payable. All references to withdrawals       
include deductions for applicable charges and premium taxes, if any.            

The charge under this death benefit is equal to an annual rate of 1.70% (or     
2.20% if the Guaranteed Income Benefit is elected) of the net asset value of the
Account Value in the VAA.                                                       

During the Access Period, contracts with the i4LIFE(R)Advantage Guarantee of    
Principal death benefit may elect to change to the i4LIFE(R) Advantage Account  
Value death benefit. We will effect the change in death benefit on the valuation
date we receive a completed election form at our Home office, and we will begin 
deducting the lower i4LIFE(R) Advantage charge at that time. Once the change is 
effective, you may not elect to return to the i4LIFE(R) Advantage Guarantee of  
Principal death benefit.                                                        

i4LIFE(R) Advantage EGMDB. If you own a non-qualified annuity contract, you may 
also elect the i4LIFE(R) Advantage EGMDB. (This benefit is not available with   
qualified contracts.) The benefit is the greatest of:                           
o        the Account Value as of the valuation date on which we approve the     
payment of the claim; or                                      
o        the sum of all purchase payments, minus all death benefit reductions   
where                                                   
   o   each death benefit reduction of purchase payments for a regular
          income payment will be for the dollar amount of the regular income
payment; and                                            
   o   each death benefit reduction of purchase payments for all other
withdrawals will be deducted in the same proportion that
withdrawals reduce the contract or Account value; or    
o        the highest Account Value or contract value which the contract attains 
 on any contract anniversary date (including the inception date)
    (determined before the allocation of any purchase payments on that
       contract anniversary) prior to the 81st birthday of the deceased. The
  highest Account Value or contract value is increased by purchase
      payments and is decreased by regular income payments and withdrawals
       subsequent to the anniversary date on which the highest Account Value
        or contract value is obtained. Regular income payments and withdrawals
      are deducted in the same proportion that regular income payments and
withdrawals reduce the Account Value.                         

In a declining market, withdrawals deducted in the same proportion that         
withdrawals reduce the Account Value may have a magnified effect on the         
reduction of the death benefit payable. All references to withdrawals include   
deductions for applicable charges and premium taxes, if any.                    

Upon the death of any contractowner or joint owner who was not a contractowner  
on the effective date of the i4LIFE(R) Advantage EGMDB death benefit, the death 
benefit will be equal to the Account Value as of the date we approve the death  
claim for payment (unless the change occurred because of the death of a         
contractowner or joint owner). If any contractowner or joint owner is changed   
due to a death and the new contractowner or joint owner is age 81 or older when 
added to the contract, then the death benefit for this new contractowner or     
joint owner will be equal to the Account Value as of the date we approve the    
death claim subsequent to the new contractowner's death.                        

The charge under this death benefit is equal to an annual rate of 1.95% (or     
2.45% if the Guaranteed Income Benefit is elected) of the net asset value of the
Account Value in the VAA.                                                       

During the Access Period, contracts with the i4LIFE(R)Advantage EGMDB may elect 
to change to the i4LIFE(R) Advantage Guarantee of Principal death benefit or    
Account Value death benefit. We will effect the change in death benefit on the  
valuation date we receive a completed election form at our Home office, and we  
will begin deducting the lower i4LIFE(R) Advantage charge at that time. Once the
change is effective, you may not elect to return to the i4LIFE(R) Advantage     
EGMDB.                                                                          

General Provisions                                                              

For non-qualified contracts, upon the death of the contractowner, joint owner or
annuitant, the contractowner (or beneficiary) may elect to terminate the        
contract and receive full payment of the death benefit or may elect to continue 
the contract and receive regular income payments. Upon the death of the         
secondary life, no death benefit is paid.                                       

If you are the owner of an IRA annuity contract, and you die during the Access  
Period, the i4LIFE(R) Advantage will terminate. A spouse beneficiary may start a
new i4LIFE(R) Advantage program.                                                

The value of the death benefit will be determined as of the valuation date we   
approve the payment of the claim. Approval of payment will occur upon our       
receipt of all the following:                                                   

     1. proof (e.g. an original certified death certificate), or any other
proof of death satisfactory to us; and                    
2. written authorization for payment; and                       
      3. all required claim forms, fully completed (including selection of a
settlement option).                                       

Notwithstanding any provision of this contract to the contrary, the             
payment of death benefits provided under this contract must be made in          
compliance with Code Section 74(s) or 401(a)(9) as applicable, as amended from  
time to time. Death benefits may be taxable. See Federal tax matters in the     
prospectus.                                                                     

If the contract is continued, upon notification to Lincoln Life of the death,   
regular income payments may be suspended until the death claim is approved. Upon
approval, a lump sum payment for the value of any suspended payments will be    
made as of the date the death claim is approved, and regular income payments    
will continue. The excess, if any, of the death benefit over the Account Value  
will be credited into the contract at that time.                                

If a lump sum settlement is elected, the proceeds will be mailed within seven   
days of approval by us of the claim subject to the laws, regulations and tax    
code governing payment of death benefits. This payment may be postponed as      
permitted by the Investment Company Act of 1940.                                

For both qualified and non-qualified contracts, following the Access Period,    
there is no death benefit.

Supplement to the Prospectus Dated May 1, 2005

This supplement describes two new features that are applicable to your variable 
annuity. No action is required on your part. Please refer to your product       
prospectus if you need further information on additional features of your       
annuity.                                                                        

The contracts - Surrenders and withdrawals. Beginning October 15, 2005, all     
surrender requests must be submitted on the Lincoln Life Surrender Form         
available from the Home Office. This form can be obtained by calling the        
toll-free customer service number listed in your prospectus, or by logging into 
your account at www.lfg.com.                                                    

The contracts - SecureLine(R) Account                                           

The SecureLine(R) account is a special service that we offer in which your death
benefit or surrender proceeds are placed into an interest-bearing account.      
Instead of mailing you (or the recipient of the death proceeds) a check, we will
send a checkbook so that you (or the death proceeds recipient) will have access 
to the account simply by writing a check for all or any part of the proceeds.   
The SecureLine(R) account is part of our general account. It is not a bank      
account and it is not insured by the FDIC or any other government agency. As    
part of our general account, it is subject to the claims of our creditors. We   
receive a benefit from all amounts left in the SecureLine(R) account.           

If you request a lump sum surrender and your surrender value is over $10,000,   
your money will be placed into the account in your name. You are the owner of   
the account, and are the only one authorized to transfer proceeds from the      
account. You may choose to leave the proceeds in this account, or you may begin 
writing checks immediately.                                                     

In the case of a death of one of the parties to the annuity contract, if the    
recipient of the death benefit has elected a lump sum settlement and the        
contract value is over $10,000, the proceeds will be placed into the            
interest-bearing account in the recipient's name as the owner of the account.   
The SecureLine(R) account allows the recipient additional time to decide how    
to manage death benefit proceeds with the balance earning interest from the day 
the account is opened.

Item 28. Indemnification                                                        

(a) Brief description of indemnification provisions.                  

  In general, Article VII of the By-Laws of Lincoln Life & Annuity Company
   of New York provides that Lincoln New York will indemnify certain persons
   against expenses, judgments and certain other specified costs incurred by
 any such person if he/she is made a party or is threatened to be made a
  party to a suit or proceeding because he/she was a director, officer, or
    employee of Lincoln New York, as long as he/she acted in good faith and in
    a manner he/she reasonably believed to be in the best interests of, or act
opposed to the best interests of, Lincoln New York. Certain additional
conditions apply to indemnification in criminal proceedings.          

 In particular, separate conditions govern indemnification of directors,
  officers, and employees of Lincoln New York in connection with suits by,
or in the right of, Lincoln New York.                                 

 Please refer to Article VII of the By-Laws of Lincoln New York (Exhibit
no. 6 hereto) for the full text of the indemnification provisions.    
 Indemnification is permitted by, and is subject to the requirements of,
New York law.                                                         

   (b) Undertaking pursuant to Rule 484 of Regulation C under the Securities
Act of 1933:                                                        

 Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities
Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling   
persons of the Registrant pursuant to the provisions described in Item
28(a) above or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the 
   opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is
against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore,      
   unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such
    liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred
    or paid by a director, officer, or controlling person of the Registrant in
    the successful defense of any such action, suit or proceeding) is asserted
by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the
    securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of
  its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit
to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such      
    indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and
will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.             

Item 29. Principal Underwriter

You’ll also benefit from market gains while being protected if the market drops. All that plus real-life flexibility to adapt however life unfolds — especially if you’re married. 






At-A-Glance:
 Variable Annuities 



One of the only investments that offer income for life — no matter how long you live.
Have the potential to grow tax-deferred with the market.
Optional living and death benefits offer added protection.


















Income Built for Two

Benefits
           Make your portfolio more balanced and durable with guaranteed lifetime income that can grow.
        



Income


Flexibility


On Your Terms













Income You Can Count On








Earn 5% Growth Per Year
During the first decade, your future income goes up by compounding 5% each year, even if the market goes down or stays flat (as long as you don’t withdraw anything).
Lock in Market Gains
Each year until age 91, if your account value is higher than your Benefit Base due to market performance, you get an Automatic Step-Up that increases future payments.
5% or 6% Withdrawals at Age 65
You can start taking 5% or 6% withdrawals at age 65 depending on your choice of two options.






 

















 

















Unique Flexibility for Married Couples








For However Life Unfolds
Many guaranteed income products make married couples lock in big decisions up front. But with FlexChoice, you don’t have to decide if you want income for one or two lives unless your account value runs out.
More Income Sooner
Unlike many retirement income products, with FlexChoice the amount of income you can withdraw is based on the age of the older owner. That can mean getting a higher withdrawal rate years sooner than if you had to wait for a younger spouse to “catch up.”
Income Built for Two
If a spouse passes away, the surviving spouse continues to receive the same income payments they’ve come to rely on with no interruption.






More about 
 Spousal Flexibility 


Wondering about the cost to cover two people? There’s no extra charge to cover a spouse, and married couples even enjoy the same initial withdrawal rate as single account holders.

Make Decisions When It is Right for You








Turn Withdrawals On and Off
You can start and stop withdrawals at any time after 59½. Waiting to take withdrawals can increase the amount you’re able to withdraw later.
Choose How Much You Get
The income you receive is based on factors you control. They include the age at which you start taking withdrawals, whether you want a steady amount of income or more early on, and if you decide to cover one or two people (only after your account value runs out).
Cancel if You Change Your Mind
In some cases, you may no longer need lifetime income. That’s ok — you have alternatives if your needs change.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Life Insurance




There’s more to life insurance than taking care of loved ones if you pass away. 

Life insurance can also be an essential part of a financial plan. In addition to helping to protect loved ones financially with a death benefit, some products can grow money on a tax-advantaged basis that can be used during one’s lifetime. The ability to meet more than one need makes life insurance a product that adds valuable flexibility to any portfolio.

Talk to your financial professional if you think life insurance might be right for you.















                                Our easy-to-use tool can help guide you to start the conversation around life insurance with your financial professional. 
 

















Types of Life Insurance





Permanent Life Insurance
Provides coverage that lasts a lifetime and can build cash value that can be used while living. 



Term Life Insurance
Provides coverage for a specific length of time and provides the most payout for the money, but does not build cash value.

















Permanent Life Insurance
Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for life. Many permanent life insurance products also have a feature called cash value. This cash value can grow over time through interest credits, market returns, or dividends, providing money that can be used for a variety of needs.  

Permanent life insurance products include: Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life, Whole Life, and Variable Universal Life.







Premier Accumulator Universal Life
Can grow cash value quickly and allows faster access to your money when you need it.

.


















Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a fixed number of years, such as 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 and pays a death benefit if you pass away during the covered time period. Most term insurance policies offer a level premium, death benefit, and the ability to convert to a permanent policy if your needs change. You can also choose coverage for current needs and add optional riders for future needs.







Guaranteed Level Term
Available in coverage amounts of $1 million or more, with premiums guaranteed to stay the same throughout the level premium period.

More Information about Annuities





What exactly is an Annuity?

                        An annuity is an investment product that provides safe, tax-deferred growth of your
                        retirement nest egg. Annuities are considered low-risk, and can provide guaranteed, monthly
                        income when
                        you retire. There are many types of annuities with varying features & benefits. These include:
                        fixed,
                        variable, immediate, deferred & hybrid. We strongly suggest you consult with a financial
                        professional to
                        help you understand the various types of annuities before you purchase.
                    








Is an Annuity Right for You?

                        Annuities are NOT a good fit for everyone. Annuities are designed for people looking for
                        guaranteed, monthly income when they retire - they are NOT a high-risk / high-return investment.
                        They are considered to be in the mainstream of conservative retirement planning - over $225
                        billion in annuities have been purchased in the past 12 months alone!
                    








What are your Next Steps?

                        The first thing to do is to see if an annuity fits your specific profile and financial
                        situation. This "fit" is based on the amount of retirement savings you currently have, how old
                        you are, and the State you live in. Simply fill in the information above and our system will
                        generate a free, tailor-made Annuity Report that will include annuity rate quotes from A+ rated
                        companies in your area.

The Lowest Rates and Best Coverage

LifePlans.com is dedicated to helping you find the best life insurance policy, while saving you as much money as possible! How do we do that? Simply put, our technology and relationships are what enable us to pass the savings onto you.
Life insurance companies are constantly calculating and updating rates based on the changing demographics of the US population. LifePlans.com is connected to the databases of the leading carriers to help you find the best deal while using the most up-to-date rates.
What’s better is that our service is 100% free, and super-fast! All you have to do is:


1. Confirm your zip code.
2. Tell us about yourself and your coverage needs.
3. See your custom-results and start comparing multiple quotes.


As you are shopping around, there are certain questions that you should ask yourself. The best one to start with is: “How much coverage do I need?”  To give you an idea, most people opt for a Term Policy with about $250,000 in coverage. Why this amount or any amount for that matter? The answer is that it all depends on how much debt you would need to payoff and how much income you would need to replace in the event you are no longer around to provide for your loved ones.
Another good question to ask yourself, or one of the several qualified agents LifePlans.com can connect you with, is how long do want to be covered and whether an investment component in your policy is right for you. Unlike a term policy, which as its name suggests has rates and coverage based on a set term or number of years, a Permanent Policy does not expire. Typically, Whole Life, the most common type of permanent insurance, not only serves to pay-out your beneficiaries upon your passing, but also has a current cash value that can be borrowed against or cashed-out anytime. Essentially,               permanent policies are investments and can grow in value whereas term policies do not.  The catch is that they often have higher premiums. You can learn more about life insurance and policy types by clicking on the icons below.
So with flexible policy options plus the best rates and coverage, don’t wait any longer. Secure your coverage now with LifePlans.com and get back to living your life with those who matter most!

          1.
	
	
	       
					
Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss - investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.



          2.
	
	
	       
					If you are buying a variable annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit.


          3.
	
	
	       
					
Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims paying ability and financial strength.

Investing in Annuities for Your Retirement
 
Retirement in your golden years goes much more smoothly when you've planned ahead with savings and investments. Annuities are a great way to secure your future and live life to the fullest. When you get life insurance, you invest in the future of your family, with annuities you can invest in your own future, as well as your families. You are responsible for yourself and your future, so make sure it's enjoyable by preparing ahead of time.
Annuities are customized by the individual or individuals involved. There are many different options and many providers. Before jumping into it, a lot of thought must be given such as planning what you will need for retirement and what you can afford now. You can discuss these with licensed agents by filling out our quick form so we can connect you with the right licensed agents for your needs. You can then compare annuity quotes with a strong foundation of knowledge.
Who Needs Annuities When I Have Social Security?
Many people are not expecting Social Security to provide all of their retirement needs. For many, it is insufficient, and others are concerned about the long-term stability of the Social Security system and want to have a back-up plan.
Online Insurance Quotes for Your Retirement
Just like obtaining homeowners insurance, planning for your retirement is an important part of ensuring you are financially secure for the rest of your life. Annuity policies are a great way of setting up a fixed or guaranteed income for your retirement. When you shop for online insurance quotes, you can find the right option for your financial needs. There are many benefits to choosing this as part of your retirement plan. Before you can make the right choice, you may want to find out more about this valuable retirement tool.
The simplest explanation of an annuity is a scheduled set of payments that exist for a predetermined period of time. The schedule for and amount of the annuity payments will rely largely on your retirement goals and the period of time until you retire.  Once you have made your scheduled payments, or investments, you will be able to begin receiving payments.  These disbursements will serve as your retirement income. 
Many people prefer annuities for retirement because they come in many flexible options and they provide a guaranteed income upon retirement. The main types are:

Immediate -      Allow you to be paid a set amount of money on a predetermined schedule.
Fixed Period Annuities - Are a more conservative option and come with a minimum interest      rate guaranteed.
Equity-Indexed - Give you the opportunity to earn a higher rate of return.
Variable Annuities - The most      flexible annuity and are subject to rises similar to stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
