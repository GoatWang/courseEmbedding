Easily installed on 5hp Honda (I did dremel it a bit for better fit) and amazing difference.  With just a 10' Jon boat it is very stern heavy and I used to have to move myself far forward to even make plane.  Then I'd have cavitation issues on plane.  Now I make plane in 1/4 the time and no cavitation!  Even noticed that it's significantly more stable and easier to drive.The product advertises less drag than other hydrofoils.  I've found that true and the packaging explains how it uses "gull wings" which angle up slightly and mostly stick above the water when on plane, thereby reducing drag at higher speeds.  I verified that today and about 2/3 of wings were above water.Also, this "jr" is one of the few foils specifically made for smaller outboards.  It's not a one size fits all like many.As advertised if not better.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsBought as a temproary fix, and now can't see a reason NOT to have one.ByBill O'Connoron August 29, 2015Verified PurchaseI bouth this to help with cavitation that was occuring due to the shaft on the 15 HP Honda motor I bought for a 13' Whaler being too long for the notched stern of the whaler.  I put this pair together in July thinking I would eliminate the nocch in the stern of the whaler by building it up with fiberglass (and in raising the engine/stern height 5") this Fall.  Without modification the boat took FOREVER to plane, and even when it did, the cavitation created tons of backsplash over the stern.I bought Hydrostabilizer Jr. hoping to achieve plane easier and reduce the cavitation, but did not expect the results I got from this purchase! The first one I recieved was clearly used and repackaged, so I sent it back and got another.  The replacement had some slight defect in the plastic molding that required a little sanding in the gap that fits over theoutboard's fins to make them seat properly on the engine.  Once I overcame those issues, this product worked better than advertised for my situation.The boat planes very quickly, and while there is still backsplash over the stern, it is minimal compared to before.  I chose not to wait until fall to raise the engine and purchased an adjustable stern plate that raises the engine to meet my required height at the stern, and am now extremely happy with the way the Hydrostabilizer Jr has improved my boat's performance.Read more0Comment|

Increased acceleration and easily planes a 12' AB Rib with 4 adults. I ran this boat with and without the stabilizer and it definitely was an improvement. I'm satisfied. Oh, the turning radius was tightened also.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsAwesomeByKevin A. Bennetton June 15, 2015Verified PurchaseWorks amazingly, only took me about 30 mins to get it installed.  Once I got out on the water it took me no time to get on plane and could stay on plane at lower speeds.  I would definately recommend this for anyone with a motor less than 50hp.Read more0Comment|

It took me about 1 hour for getting them adapted for no interference with the lower transmission drain hole and one of the cathodes of the motor. They look now very good but have not jet tested them on the water.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsBig value on a Jr. hydrostabilizarByDad who reviewson August 26, 2016Verified PurchaseGreat value for the buck. In reality it does what its meant to without pilling up the weeds. Easy install, almost anybody can do it with a drill and a couple bolts and nuts.  Will get another one for the next boat team purchases.Read more

These are a good design because they angle up, so they are out of water while on plane.

Get your purchases fast with our free two-day shipping programThere's so much convenience when it comes to online shopping. It's easy to find exactly what you're looking for all in one place when you shop with Walmart online. Plus, you can see all the items that you want to purchase and know immediately whether they're in stock or not. However, two issues that arise   that you don't deal with when you're shopping in store   is that you sometimes have to wait several days to get your purchases or pay a higher additional fee to get your purchases shipped faster. However, thanks to Walmart, you don t have to deal with either problem. We offer free two-day shipping on millions of the items that we sell, and it's all available to you without joining a membership club or paying extra fees for the privilege. Combine this with our low prices, every day, on everything, and you can get the things you want quickly at prices that fit your budget.How Walmart's free two-day shipping worksWhen you're looking at our website to find the types of items that you're interested in purchasing, the first step is to look for the logo that says 2-Day Shipping on the product page. Many of these items will also state Free store pickup or Free store pickup today below the free shipping information. If you see these words on the product page for your item, you have the additional option to pick the item up for free at your chosen Walmart location or receive it at your designated location for free as long as you spend $35 or more. If your purchase is less than $35, you can upgrade to free shipping for $5.99.On the left-hand side of all the pages on our website, you'll see a section that section labeled Shipping & Pickup. Beneath that, you'll find the option for 2-Day Shipping. Click the radio button next to 2-Day Shipping and the page will reload, displaying only items that are available for free two-day shipping. As long as you place your order by 2 p.m., you can expect delivery in two business days. This means that, if you order your item after 2 p.m. on a Friday, you won't receive it until the following Wednesday. However, if you order it on Tuesday before 2 p.m., you can expect to get it by the following Friday. Keep in mind that weekends and holidays don't count as business days for shipping. Also, be sure to note that the 2 p.m. cutoff time is relative to the time zone where we're shipping your item from, not the time zone from where you're ordering it.Other shipping optionsRemember that any item that's marked with 2-Day Shipping on its page is also eligible for free shipping on qualifying purchase amounts. Most of these items are also eligible for in-store pickup   many of them that same day   even if you order after 2 p.m. If you select an item that's not eligible for our free two-day shipping program, there are many others that are eligible for free three- to five-day shipping. Again, this free shipping is only for purchases of $35 or more. Items that are part of this shipping promotion include Marketplace and freight items, but shipping costs are based on location on a case-by case basis for these products.If you're ordering an item that we're not shipping to you   but one of our trusted partners is   it's possible that they might offer free shipping too. However, it might not be for a specific time frame. To verify, check the shipping information found on the product page, located below the item's price.What you should know about the free two-day shipping programHere's some additional information about Walmart's free two-day shipping program:Residents of Hawaii and Alaska aren't eligible for the free 2-Day Shipping program; it's only available in the contiguous United StatesRecipients who have their packages sent to these locations   AA, AE, AK, AP, AS, FM, GU, HI, MP, PK, PW and VI or any APO or FPO in the continental U.S.   will receive free three- to five-day shipping for their items on purchases of more than $35. There may be additional surcharges to ship to one of these areas, and this information will appear when you check out with your purchase.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147332917, DC-prod-dal1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.15.0, SHA-06ca1a9068b558bd33bd1add57a0b13a52090f9f, CID-
