Fundraising For The Church Building Fund



















































Fund Raising for the Church Building Fund
The single most effective church fund raising program, to raise money for a building fund, is a capital campaign.
Encourage Cheerful Giving!
Churches develop building funds for a variety of reasons including building new facilities or repair and renovation of existing building(s). Traditional church fund-raising programs for things like children’s and youth programs or local ministries include things like bake sales and selling cookbooks, candy bars, pies or maybe the infamous chicken or BBQ dinner fundraiser.
However, if you are trying to raise funds for new construction or renovations, you would have to sell a LOT of candy bars or BBQ dinners to make even a small dent in a church building fund budget! If your church needs to raise money for its building fund, the most effective fund raising program will be a church capital campaign.  Make no mistake, no other method is as effective, either financially or spiritually.

If you are looking to raise money to build, repair or renovate your church, no other method that will raise as much money as that of a properly run church capital fundraising campaign, and it’s biblical too!

Capital Fund Raising – Growing the Church Building Fund
A church building fund for capital projects such as construction, renovation, church planting, or relocation require a great deal of fundraising, something that is all but impossible for the church to accomplish by selling candy bars or chicken dinners.  After all,  it takes a lot of candy bars or chicken dinners to build or even repair a church building!  
When the church is selling a fundraiser product, it is essentially trading a product for cash.  Not only would the church have to move a lot of “product” to raise any significant amount of money, there is no spiritual component to fundraising in this manner; it’s just a business transaction that people can feel good about.  A truly successful capital fundraising campaign will produce spiritual as well as financial fruit.
If you are looking to raise money for your church’s building fund or other capital expense, you need to look beyond the bake sale and chicken dinners.  You need to look for a church fundraising solution that will provide the maximum spiritual and financial benefit! The money you need to build to build or renovate is sitting right in front of you each Sunday!  Follow this link for more information on biblical fundraising.
What is a Church Capital Campaign?
A church capital campaign is a carefully choreographed, spiritual endeavor that produces spiritual and financial fruit through a dedicated offering above and beyond the current tithes and offerings. A professionally facilitated church capital campaign will typically raise between one and three times the church’s current annual income over a traditional 3-year giving period, all of what can be applied to your building fund.
A capital campaign is an important part of every church’s financial strategy to raise money for construction or to retire debt. A biblically based capital campaign will honor God and respect your congregation. A proper church capital campaign will first bear spiritual fruit that leads to increased giving of the members’ time, treasure, and talents in supporting the church’s vision and mission.

In summary, if you are looking to raise significant money to purchase land, build a church, renovate, or even retire debt, the best church fundraising program is a church capital campaign.

1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks a high level of current income.




Strategy



The investment seeks a high level of current income. The fund invests at least 80% of net assets in church mortgage bonds and church mortgage loans. Church mortgage bonds are corporate debt securities issued by non-profit organizations that have a stated Christian mission, including local churches, denominations and associations, educational institutions, para-church and other Christian mission-related organizations for purposes including construction, purchase or refinancing of existing real property. It may invest up to 20% of net assets in short-term money market instruments and other non-church mortgage bond & loan investments. The fund is non-diversified.


Risk



In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. Please consult the prospectus for additional risk information specific to this fund.

You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
3. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

The Importance of Instructing & Inspiring

LESSON #1 - Provide Biblical Teaching Most churches found
            that their people were in need of practical and inspirational
            instruction and encouragement in the areas of Christian
            generosity.  Churches found it helpful and very important that
these areas be taught from the
            pulpit by the Sr. Pastor and/or an experienced financial speaker so
            that a proper spiritual tone and Biblical basis was in place for the
            drive. 
             
Many churches have found that 
			using the "40 Day 
			Spiritual Journey to a More Generous Life" Bible devotional 
			(www.GenerousLife.info) 
			has greatly inspired people spiritually to become more generous and 
			to increase their giving commitments.
 
LESSON #2 - Aim To Make The Fund Drive A Rich Spiritual
            Experience Many churches indicated that their expansion drives
            helped deepen people's faith and spiritual commitment (i.e. -
            especially through the increased vision people received, the
            interaction people had with others during the drive, and/or their
            increased or sacrificial giving to the Lord's work at the church).  
	To add positive humor to your encouragement for people to be generous, use 
	"Financial Funnies" cartoons from:
	www.kluth.org/cartoons.htm.
              
LESSON #3 - Include Personal Testimonies A number of
            churches actively included personal testimonies during worship times
            from people who have experienced the grace of giving in their lives
            and/or who were specifically led by the Lord to become supportive of
            the expansion project. Written testimonies, handouts, and articles
            were also used to help encourage people in the spiritual aspects of
            their giving decisions.  Weekly questions from the
			www.GenerousLife.info 
			devotional can help people determine how to share their generosity 
			story/testimony in a positive way.

The Importance of Identifying & Informing

LESSON #4 - Have A Comprehensive Plan Every successful
            funding effort had a specific plan on how they were going to
            instruct, inspire, inform and appropriately involve people within
            the following groups:




LEADERSHIP:
                    Church leadership, pastor(s), staff, heads and key leaders
                    of church ministries/committees.
ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP:
                    People regularly involved in serving and small group
                    ministries.
POTENTIAL MAJOR
                    GIVERS: People
                    who exhibited the gift of giving in the past or who may have
                    the potential to be a major financial help in the drive.
REGULAR ATTENDERS:
                    People who attend church at least twice a month.
FRINGE PEOPLE:
                    Occasional or sporadic attenders.



LESSON #5 - Get Experienced Counsel And/Or Help In
              addition to the active involvement of many lay leaders and present
              staff, nearly all the churches that raised major dollars for
              expansion efforts used some level of experienced help and
              professional guidance (usually from external sources) to lead them
              through the funding process.
LESSON #6 - Develop Helpful Collateral Materials Each
              church developed materials that effectively informed their
              congregation what the plans were and what level of help and
              support would be needed. Items often developed included multimedia
              presentations, case-statement brochures, question and answer
              flyers, personal presentation packets, commitment cards, mailings,
              and update sections in church publications.

The Importance of Inviting & Involving

LESSON #7 - Have Specific Commitment Time(s) Following a
            period of advance instruction, inspiration, and information,
            churches would invite their people to carefully and prayerfully
            indicate how the Lord has led them to be involved in the church
            expansion plans. In a number of cases this was done in two stages,
            the first stage would be receiving the commitments from the families
            that make up the church's main leadership and lead givers and the
            second phase (2-4 weeks later) would be receiving the commitments
            from the rest of the congregation on a specific target date or
            event.



    
                





NOTE:
            This information was gathered through interviews Brian Kluth
            conducted with churches of various sizes. Churches that followed
            these principles successfully raised several hundred thousand to
            millions of dollars. The author has seen churches whose leadership
            ignored, disregarded or violated these principles fall seriously
            short of their funding goals.

Money Matters in Church: A Practical Guide for Leaders
Aubrey Malphurs, Steve Stroope Aubrey Malphurs, Steve Stroope Baker Books / 2007 / Trade Paperback 
$16.49
 5 Stars Out Of 5 1 Reviews 


Publisher's Description▼▲
God is blessing many churches today with exponential growth and great opportunity for ministry in their community. However, many churches have inadequate facilities or feel the crunch of overcrowding and are without the immediate resources for expansion. This book, written from someone with the heart for the church and who had the joy of seeing his own congregation give in excess of $250 million over 30 years, will equip a church of any size with the knowledge to conduct—from beginning to end—a full capital campaign.


Author Bio▼▲
John R. Bisagno is pastor emeritus of the 22,000-member Houston's First Baptist Church where he preached for thirty years. He has also authored twenty-five books and now serves on the adjunct faculty of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. Bisagno and his wife, Uldine, have three children and eight grandchildren. They live in Houston, Texas.
