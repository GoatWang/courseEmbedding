Perhaps no other Great Lakes shoreline in Michigan is more awe-inspiring than Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore. Stretching for 15 miles, its sculpted stonewalls, towering spires and elevated archways stand majestically above Lake Superior's beautiful, yet temperamental waters. This book captures with inviting detail, the raw artistry and spiritual energy of one of Michigan's most beloved natural treasures, from the lake's perspective. Dynamic photography & inspirational haiku poetry celebrate one of the Great Lakes' most aesthetic achievements. "time passages" was created during the centennial year of operation of the National Parks Service and pays perfect tribute to what they've preserved. “time passages” is 8.75 X 11.25” - 72 pages and printed with quality archival paper.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
