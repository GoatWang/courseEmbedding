At a glanceBusiness structureOur strategyInnovationWhere we operateBoard of directorsManagementOur history













We embrace fresh thinking and our lean organisational structure enables us to develop new ideas quickly.
Our two most significant innovations have been:

The world’s first FSRU conversion, the Golar Spirit – which went into operation in 2008
The world’s first FLNG conversion, the Golar Hilli – which will go into operation in 2017

In both cases we converted an existing ship on a speculative basis. Conversion of an existing asset has enabled Golar to offer a quick-delivering and cheap solution to an industry problem, which might be:

A need to rapidly open up new markets for excess LNG or to meet urgent requirements for new gas fired power 
A need to enable owners of stranded gas reserves to monetise their asset

Our willingness to initiate the speculative conversion of a ship into an FSRU or FLNG demonstrated our belief in the soundness of our offering. This in turn gave our first customers the confidence to transact with us.




"We are definitely not pack animals. We have demonstrated with our work with FLNG and FSRUs that we are prepared to take leadership."






To date, none of our competitors has successfully emulated this business model. Although the approach with FLNG is similar to an FSRU conversion, the cost and scale of FLNG represent a significant step up. We therefore believe that it will be some time before we face serious competition in the FLNG business.



                          	Golar’s FLNG business model
                          

The rate of offshore natural gas discoveries has soared in recent years. There are estimated to be at least 300,000 billion cubic feet of natural gas lying in offshore fields – of which 40% is estimated to be stranded. “Stranded gas” means gas that would not be viable to extract using established methods in use before Golar’s FLNG solution existed. Locating the liquefaction process offshore on a vessel can dramatically reduce the cost per MMBTU of liquefying gas. Converting a vessel in a specialised shipyard, where the skills and resources are already at hand and don’t need to be brought in, is much quicker and cheaper than building a facility in remote parts of the world that lack the essential infrastructure necessary to get started.
With our FLNG model, a mega-gasfield is no longer a prerequisite to monetisation. It is now easier to sell small parcels of gas without flooding the market. It is no longer necessary to find a large number of buyers at once.
Golar’s FLNG solution is based on the conversion of a Moss type LNG carrier fitted with tried-and-tested Black & Veatch (B&V) liquefaction technology and connected to a client-specified mooring system. The B&V PRICO® process uses a single mixed refrigerant technology that is simple, reliable and efficient. Black & Veatch has developed more than 30 operating LNG production facilities globally and most of them use this process. The PRICO® process also has a small enough footprint that it can be mounted on a vessel. The first marine-mounted B&V PRICO® process was successfully commissioned in 2016.

FLNG Hilli Episeyo

14-15 million man-hours to completion
1,200 km of cabling
250 MW of power on board
4,300 people on board to complete conversion





                          	FSRU
                          

The practice of converting LNG carriers into floating storage and regasification units (FSRUs) is now well accepted – thanks to innovation by Golar. We pioneered the FSRU conversion concept with the Golar Spirit, which went into operation in Brazil in 2008. We then successfully replicated the process three more times.
Newbuild FSRUs have since established themselves as a cost-effective alternative to conversions, for us at Golar and for other market participants.

An FSRU is an LNG carrier with onboard regasification equipment. It receives liquefied LNG, stores it, and converts it into natural gas for pipelines or onshore processing and power generation. FSRUs have a number of advantages over land-based LNG facilities. They are quicker to build and less expensive. They can be moved from one location to another as the business case demands. They remain largely unseen by the public and are not an unsightly, permanent feature of the landscape.
We put the first FSRU into operation in each of the four areas in which we operate: the Americas, the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. Golar Power, the Golar-Stonepeak joint venture, now plans to convert more of the latest generation of carriers into FSRUs.

Should Value Investors Consider Golar LNG (GMLP) Stock Now?


July 10, 2017, 09:35:00 AM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

 Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn't want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?    One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let's put Golar LNG Partners LP GMLP  stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:   PE Ratio    A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock's current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.    On this front, Golar LNG has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 7.34, as you can see in the chart below:       This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.19. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Golar LNG's current PE level puts it slightly above its midpoint over the past three years, with the number having risen over the past few months.       Further, the stock's PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing - Master Limited Partnerships industry's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 50.42. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is significantly undervalued right now, compared to its peers.       However, we should point out that Golar LNG has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year's earnings) of 10.49, so on the ground of the forward earnings estimates, we might say that the company's share price is likely to appreciate in the near future.   P/S Ratio    Another key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock's price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.    Right now, Golar LNG has a P/S ratio of about 3.11. This is marginally lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.13 right now. As we can see in the chart below, this is below the highs for this stock, but above its median in particular over the past few years.       If anything, Golar LNG is towards the higher end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, which suggests that the company's stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.   Broad Value Outlook    In aggregate, Golar LNG currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of 'A', putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Golar LNG a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.    For example, the PEG ratio for Golar LNG is 1.31, a level that is lower than the industry average of 2.47. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock's earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 3.14, which is far better than the industry average of 8.55. Clearly, GMLP is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.   What About the Stock Overall?    Though Golar LNG might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of 'C' and a Momentum score of 'F'. This gives GMLP a Zacks VGM score-or its overarching fundamental grade-of 'B'. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>  )    Meanwhile, the company's recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower, while the full year estimate has seen zero upward and four downward revisions in the same time period.    As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 1.7% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has decreased 11.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:    Golar LNG Partners LP Price and Consensus         Golar LNG Partners LP Price and Consensus    |      Golar LNG Partners LP Quote  This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.   Bottom Line    Golar LNG is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among the bottom 20%) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past three years, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing - Master Limited Partnerships industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:       So, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.   Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?    Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.    With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.    It's not the one you think.

For information about Golar LNG Limited please visit www.golar.com


 
 



	Welcome to Golar LNG Partners LP
We are a growth-oriented limited partnership formed by Golar LNG Limited (NasdaqGS: GLNG; OSE: GOL) to own and operate floating storage and regasification units (or FSRUs) and LNG carriers under long-term charters, which we define as charters of five years or more. We intend to leverage the relationships, expertise and reputation of Golar, a leading independent owner and operator of FSRUs and LNG carriers, to pursue growth opportunities in these areas. While we intend to operate our assets under long-term charters with stable cash flows, Golar intends to focus primarily on FSRU and LNG project development, LNG trading and LNG transportation, storage and regasification activities with contract terms and associated cash flows that are more short-term and/or variable in nature.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Golar LNG is a liquefied natural gas shipping company registered in Bermuda. The company operates 26 LNG carriers and is listed on NASDAQ.
History[edit]
The company was founded in 1946 as Gotaas-Larsen Shipping Company. In 1970 the company entered the LNG segment.
In 1973 the Gotaas-Larsen oil tanker SS Golar Patricia exploded and sank off the Canary Islands.[2] Her Gross Register Tonnage was 98,894 long tons (110,761 short tons; 100,481 t) and her deadweight tonnage was 216,326 long tons (242,285 short tons; 219,797 t), which at the time made was the largest ship ever lost at sea.[2]
The Singapore-based Osprey Maritime bought the company in 1997. In 2000 the Fredriksen-controlled World Shipholding started a take-over of Osprey, completed in 2001 when the LNG segments of Osprey were transferred to Golar LNG. It was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange in 2001 and NASDAQ in 2002, 30 August 2012 it was delisted from Oslo Stock Exchange.[3]
In June 2015, Golar LNG announced a joint venture with Stolt-Nielsen to pursue production and distribution opportunities. The latter also made a strategic investment in the former, acquiring a 2.3 percent stake.[4]
Golar LNG Partners LP operates the world's first regasification vessel Golar Spirit converted from an LNG carrier.[5]
