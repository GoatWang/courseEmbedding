Should Value Investors Consider CNO Financial (CNO) Stock?

 Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn't want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?    One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let's put CNO Financial Group, Inc. CNO  stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:   PE Ratio    A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock's current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.    On this front, CNO Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.15, as you can see in the chart below:       This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.50. While CNO Financial's current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 13.42 over the past five years, the current level is about a notch lower than the highs for the stock, signaling some scope for entry.       Further, the stock's PE stands a bit lower than the Zacks classified Finance sector's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 15.85. This indicates that the stock is slightly undervalued right now, compared to its peers.       We should also point out that CNO Financial has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year's earnings) of just 13.89, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for CNO Financial stock in the near term too.   P/S Ratio    Another key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock's price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.    Right now, CNO Financial has a P/S ratio of about 0.91. This is way lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.18 right now, making the stock undervalued from this aspect too.      Broad Value Outlook    In aggregate, CNO Financial currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of 'A', putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes CNO Financial a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.    For example, the P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) for CNO Financial comes in at 5.12, which is better than the industry average of 7.21. Clearly, CNO is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.   What About the Stock Overall?    Though CNO Financial might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of 'D' and a Momentum score of 'A'. This gives CNO a Zacks VGM score-or its overarching fundamental grade-of 'A'. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>  )    Meanwhile, the company's recent earnings estimates have been quite encouraging. Both, the current quarter and full year have seen one upward estimate revision, each in the past sixty days, compared to no downward revisions.    This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 2.8% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched higher by 0.7%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:    CNO Financial Group, Inc. Price and Consensus         CNO Financial Group, Inc. Price and Consensus    |      CNO Financial Group, Inc. Quote  However, this somewhat bullish trend has likely not yet been reflected in the stock, as we have just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates expectations of in-line performance in the near term. Nonetheless, the bullish analyst sentiment indicates that the stock's prospects in the near term look good.   Bottom Line    CNO Financial is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (Bottom 20% out of over 250 Zacks industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the Zacks categorized Insurance - Multi Line industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:       So, value investors might want to wait for the broader factors and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.   5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump Policies    If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.     Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

How CNO Slices the Market for Growth







CNO Financial Group is focusing on five distinct audience segments as part of a new market segmentation plan. CMO Gerardo Monroy discusses the strategy.
 







Gerardo Monroy






 
CNO Financial Group is a $4 billion financial services company that provides health insurance, life insurance, and retirement solutions to consumers through its Bankers Life, Colonial Penn, and Washington National brands. It sells products through insurance agents and directly to consumers, and traditionally has used TV, direct mail, telemarketing, and online campaigns to reach its target audience.
“For many years, we had only one target market—middle-income Americans nearing retirement,” says Gerardo Monroy, CMO at CNO. However, as the company’s leadership team considered the path to long-term, sustainable growth as part of its strategic planning process, it began to reevaluate its targeting strategy.
“To achieve our growth objectives, we realized we needed to understand our customers better so we could use the right media mix and messaging to reach them and offer them the right products and customer experience,” Monroy says.
Last year, the company launched an initiative to identify distinct audience segments within the middle-income market. In the following interview, Monroy discusses CNO’s approach to market segmentation and how it is implementing the plan.
What challenges led CNO to pursue this market segmentation?
Monroy: First, we viewed our target market as a single market, and we were missing an understanding of the nuances of distinct segments within that large market, including the behaviors, needs, and expectations of different types of consumers. Second, most of the knowledge we obtained on how to serve the needs of the market came from our field force of agents, which on its own can sometimes create a bias. Third, we have aggressive growth goals for the organization. We needed to identify the market segments with the biggest growth opportunities in which we could excel in order to meet our goals. Finally, many executives and board members were asking questions about millennials and wealthier customers and we wanted to make a clear choice about whether to focus on those segments.
How did the company approach the development of a new market segmentation strategy?
We understood the need and wanted to expand on our internal expertise, so we partnered with Monitor Deloitte to help us with the market segmentation strategy. Together, we did intensive work that allowed us to identify distinct market segments within the middle-income market. We started with thousands of variables, then narrowed down 15 key ones such as net worth, family composition, and financial attitudes to help us define how people acquire products and why they remain customers. We identified 13 market segments that were attractive from a growth perspective and for which we had the right products and capabilities, then selected five segments on which to focus initially.
Can you talk more about the market segments?
For each market segment, we created unique profiles, including demographics, key concerns about retirement, media channels used, and so forth. We then grouped these segments into two buckets—those in which we are strong, and those in which we have opportunities to expand.
For example, CNO has been very focused on two of the five target segments—we have the right products and have served these markets well. We will continue to defend our position in these segments, but the numbers showed us these segments are insufficient to meet our corporate growth targets. We have the right capabilities to win in the remaining three markets and will focus more on these because they have strong growth potential.
How did you implement the new market segmentation strategy? 
To ensure a successful implementation, we needed to make sure everyone at the company understood the market segmentation work, and more importantly, started to incorporate it into the strategic planning process. It began at the highest level with the CNO leadership team, including the CEO, CMO, and presidents of the different business units, all of whom provided input into the strategy. All our business plans and major initiatives are now centered on these market segments. This is an important part of how we will achieve long-term, sustainable growth.
The tactical implementation is a work in progress. We are now customizing our messaging and media mix to effectively reach these market segments and training our agents on how to best communicate with each segment. As part of this process, we developed a fairly detailed persona for each segment, which helps our teams relate to customers. We’re also deciding which products to emphasize in each segment.
Another important element is providing the best customer experience for each market segment. For example, consumers in one segment may have a greater need for detailed information, so they will have more questions and require more time on the phone. We are now helping our customer support people understand the unique needs of each segment and giving them appropriate tools and training.
What are some key insights from this project?
We realized that to achieve our desired growth, we needed to make some changes in how we reach distinct market segments. For example, one of the segments has a lower average age than our overall customer base. These younger consumers are more comfortable using websites and search engines to find products rather than having face-to-face conversations, so we need to change the way we start conversations with this segment. Ultimately, developing better strategies to serve distinct market segments will translate into higher sales, better customer experience and retention, and improved profitability.

Cybersecurity: Building Consumer Trust

                          Advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, internet of things, and mobile payments create more than profit potential; they can also expose companies to cyber risk. To help build confidence in cybersecurity measures, CMOs can develop a consumer trust playbook and be transparent with customers.
                        



Insights-Driven Storytelling

                          To create emotional connections with customers, marketers can craft personalized stories based on insights gleaned from social, behavioral, and transactional data. Effective storytelling can be used to move consumers through the purchase cycle and increase brand engagement.
                        



Managing Risk in an Age of Social Media

                          Reputational risk is a top concern for many board directors, yet few say they are well-versed in social media issues. CMOs can play an important role in helping board directors better understand reputational risks posed by social media and develop risk mitigation plans in conjunction with other senior executives.

CMOs can play an important role in driving these changes throughout their organizations.
                        



Using ‘Business Chemistry’ to Sell Ideas

                          In today’s competitive business environment, selling ideas is a science as much as an art. CMOs can help the next generation of marketers learn how to tailor their pitches to different personality types by applying the principles of Business Chemistry®.
                        



Organizing for Work in the Digital Age

                          In response to digital disruption, companies are rethinking the way work gets done, shifting from traditional hierarchical structures to flatter, more flexible teams. To help their organizations become faster, more agile, and more adaptable, CMOs and other business leaders can adapt the way they approach talent, processes, and collaboration.

CNO Financial Group, Inc. (formerly Conseco, Inc. (from Consolidated National Security Corporation; NYSE: CNO) is a financial services holding company based in Carmel, Indiana.[7] CNO's insurance subsidiaries provide life insurance, annuity and supplemental health insurance products to more than four million customers in the United States. These products are distributed through independent agents, career agents and direct to customers through television advertising and direct mail.
CNO is currently ranked 608 on the Fortune 1000 with 2014 revenues of $4.1 billion.
In April 2014 CNO was ranked top 50 most trusted financial institutions by Forbes.[8]
History[edit]
CNO was incorporated in 1979 as Security National of Indiana Corp. by Stephen Hilbert.[9] SNI bought Consolidated National Life Insurance Co. in 1983. It began insurance operations in 1982 and became a public company in 1985.
In 1986 Conseco acquired Lincoln Income Life Insurance Company for $29 per share or $32.3 mil. Shearson Lehman Brothers advised Lincoln Income Life Insurance. Earlier, in mid-1985, Lincoln had agreed to be acquired by I.C.H.[10] for $31 per share in cash but the merger couldn't be consummated as the Kentucky Department of Insurance raised objections to certain expenses which Lincoln would have incurred in the merger. Lincoln also received a merger proposal from Redgate in 1985. Satisfied with its recipe for acquiring and improving insurance companies, Conseco stepped up its acquisition efforts in 1986. It purchased Bankers National Life Insurance Company for $118 million, respectively.
In 1998, Conseco purchased the former Greentree Financial, one of the largest financiers of mobile homes, in an attempt to diversify into consumer financial services. They also bought life insurance company Colonial Penn later that year, changing their name to Conseco Direct Life,[11] though changing the name back to Colonial Penn in 2001 (known as Bankers Conseco Life Insurance Company in New York state). Conseco (though not its subsidiary insurance companies) entered Chapter 11 reorganization in 2002 and emerged nine months later in 2003.[12][13] Conseco's bankruptcy was the third-largest U.S. Chapter 11 filing at the time, after the bankruptcies of WorldCom Inc. and Enron[14] In the process of reorganization, GreenTree was divested and thereafter Conseco solely focused on the insurance industry.
CNO's CEO is Edward Bonach.[9] He joined the company in May 2007 as the CFO and became CEO in October 2011. Bonach is also a member of CNO's Board of Directors.[15]
CNO is the parent company of seven insurance companies, including Bankers Life and Casualty Company and Colonial Penn Life Insurance Company.[6] CNO also owns 40/86 Advisors, an investment management company and Washington National Insurance Company.
On May 11, 2010, the board of directors officially approved changing the holding company's name to CNO Financial Group.[16]
In 2015 February, CNO sold its Hyderabad-based India operations to Cognizant.[17][18]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
