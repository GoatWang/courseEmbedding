Tide Detergent Social Content for World Emoji Day






On this project I helped with both copywriting and art direction. This particular post was picked up by PR week. http://www.prweek.com/article/1356507/14-brands-getting-emojinal-worldemojiday



 






This mock-up tweet was another direction we explored for the World Emoji Day post.  Millennials generally don't care about laundry symbols, but jokes may help pique their interest. 



 Tide #LaundryDay






Assisted in both the copywriting and art direction for what would become a series of #LaundryDay gifs. Exaggerated laundry experiences appeal to Millennials and remind them to do their laundry. https://twitter.com/tide/status/639851703097929728



 






https://twitter.com/tide/status/637704541614411776



 Tide How-To VideosWrote the copy and saw the rest of the production process for around 40 different Tide Laundry Tips videos.   Toaster Strudel: #MomSummer






Moms who love their kids, but are relieved to see them go back to school could relate to the sentiment of this campaign. #MomSummer celebrates parents the way they are and advocates buying Toaster Strudel. I helped with the writing and art direction of #momsummer. Alternate post-copy options are listed underneath. 



 







 Pampers #Betterforbaby






After Pampers released their #betterforbaby video I got to spend some time retweeting celebrities. I helped  with the copywriting and the photoshopping.



 Pampers Father's Day #Thanksbaby






Wrote the post-copy for a Pampers Father's Day video which reached over a million people. The video had already been produced, and is embedded in the link.( https://www.facebook.com/Pampers/videos/vb.89121585311/10153543366765312/?type=2&theater )



 Dreft: #Amazinghood






Helped formulate precious moments for the client's Instagram. #Amazinghood is meant to put a smiles on loyal customers faces, and remind them why Dreft detergent is a part of theI specifically helped with the copywriting, #hashtagging, and stock photography searches.



 







 







 Personal






When I'm not writing, I like to practice calligraphy. Here is a word list I made one day.



 






Sometimes I like doing things by hand, these snapshots show the process I used to make my logo. On the left is a rubbing of the letters after I  cut them into a piece of recycled blackboard. In the center are the letters after I applied imitation gold leaf. On the right is the finished product.
