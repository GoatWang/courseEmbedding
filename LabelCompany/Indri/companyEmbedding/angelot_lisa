About Environmental, Social & Governance Summary (ESG)



GMI ESG Ratings


GMI AGR® Score & Rating






GMI ESG Ratings
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Flags:  GMI Ratings publishes Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) ratings on over 6,000 companies worldwide. These ratings provide an independent assessment of the sustainable investment value of public companies.  The ESG Ratings model is based on a carefully crafted and applied list of KeyMetrics® that result in an overall ESG concern level as expressed by Red (High Concern), Yellow (Average Concern), and Green (Low Concern) flags.  Unlike traditional ESG risk models, GMI's rating methodology is designed to identify risks most likely to affect equity valuations. Specifically, these ratings reflect actual corporate behaviors rather than policies or affirmations of intent to adhere to best ESG practices. Further, unlike other models with evenly weighted metrics, we assign context-sensitive relative weightings to our key metrics, based on market, regional, ownership or sector differences.  Individual company scores are then assigned as a percentile rank, ranging from 1 (worst ranked) to 100 (best) on the basis of these KeyMetrics® and then converted to the Red, Yellow or Green flag designation.
Company Reports:  In addition to a company's overall risk rating, ESG reports also include an industry rating based on a comparison between the company's risk levels in each ESG component area relative to its industry peers.  Further, the ESG analysis serves as a summary of behavioral events that contributed to the company's overall risk level.

 More About GMI



GMI Accounting and Governance Risk (AGR) Score & Rating
The GMI Accounting and Governance Risk (AGR) Score & Rating is widely recognized as an indicator of the confidence level surrounding a company's management and reported financials.
Scores range from 0 to 100, and correspond to a risk classification for each company ranging from "Very Aggressive" to "Conservative." The AGR Score is a percentile ranking among the approximately 8,000 companies rated by GMI. Through continued back-testing, GMI has demonstrated a strong correlation between its quarterly AGR Score and the likelihood of adverse events, including securities class action litigation, financial restatements, regulatory enforcement actions, and stock price declines.
				Thus, a company's AGR Score can help investors looking to manage risk or enhance investment performance. GMI forensically analyzes the financial reporting and governance practices of over 8,000 North American-based publicly traded companies.
About GMI
GMI is an independent risk research firm which provides a statistically modeled assessment of corporate integrity. Founded in 2002 in direct response to the growing number of scandals, lawsuits and investor losses resulting from fraudulent corporate behavior, the firm identifies potential high-risk company accounting and governance activity, which in turn has been historically correlated to stock price declines, securities class-action litigation, and material financial restatements. The product of GMI's analysis is a unique risk measure - the AGR Score which can be used by investors as a way to more effectively manage corporate risk.

† The Equity Summary Score provided by Thomson Reuters StarMine is current as of the date specified.  There may be differences between the Equity Summary Score analyst count and the number of underlying analysts listed.  Due to the timing in receiving ratings changes into the Equity Summary Score model, the Equity Summary Score analyst count may lag the ratings count displayed by one or more days.  There may also be analyst count variations for symbols with multiple share classes and ADRs.  More details on Equity Summary Score calculation are included in the Understanding and Using the Equity Summary Score Methodology (PDF).As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

 Mutual funds 
You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.
Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
 
 Life insurance and variable annuities 

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

 Workplace savings plans 
Some of the funds and services described on the Fidelity Sites may not be available or appropriate in a workplace savings plan. Check with your employer for information on any investment restrictions associated with your 401(k), 401(a), 403(b), or 457 savings plan, or nonqualified deferred compensation plan at work. Or, if your workplace savings plan is already with Fidelity, call your toll-free retirement benefits line or log on to Fidelity NetBenefits® to find out more about the investment options available to you in your workplace savings plan.
If you hold Fidelity Advisor Fund assets outside of your employer-sponsored retirement plan, accounts with such assets are not included in the list of Fidelity accounts.
Company Stock Funds are not mutual funds and are unmanaged, non-diversified investment options. The value of your investment in the Company Stock Fund is affected by the performance of the company and the overall stock market, as well as the amount and performance of any short term investments held by the fund.
Managed Income Funds, Commingled Pools and individually managed options, such as Strategies, are not mutual funds. Although individual investment contracts purchased for a managed income fund are backed by the issuer of the debt, units of the fund are not guaranteed by the manager, Plan sponsor or insured by the FDIC.
A summary of the benefits provided under a workplace savings plan is contained in the Summary Plan Description for the plan. Full details are provided in the official plan document, which governs the operation of the plan. In the event that the content of a Fidelity Site or any oral representations made by any person regarding the plan conflict with or are inconsistent with the provisions of the governing plan document, the provisions of the governing plan documents are controlling. The information presented on a Fidelity Site is not intended to create, nor is it to be construed to create, a contract between (1) an employer or a Fidelity Entity and (2) any one of the employer’s employees or other plan participants. Each employer reserves the right to amend, modify, suspend, replace or terminate any of its plans, policies or programs, in whole or in part, including any level or form of coverage, by appropriate company action, without the consent or concurrence of persons affected.

Units of the College Savings Plan Portfolios are municipal securities and may be subject to market volatility and fluctuation.
Please carefully consider the Plan's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses before investing. For this and other information on any 529 College Savings Plan managed by Fidelity, contact Fidelity for a free Fact Kit, or view online. Read it carefully before you invest or send money.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
