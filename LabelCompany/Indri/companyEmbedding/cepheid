California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010
The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) is designed to increase the amount of information made available by manufacturers and retailers regarding efforts to address the issue of slavery and human trafficking.
Danaher Corporation believes that workers at supplier facilities have the right to freely choose employment. Danaher further expects that all suppliers who do business with Danaher and its subsidiaries will comply with all applicable laws, including the laws against forced or involuntary labor, and this expectation is embodied in Danaher’s Supplier Code of Conduct (located at www.danaher.com/suppliers). Danaher Corporation is not aware that any of its suppliers engage in human trafficking or slavery and has not received any information suggesting that any of its suppliers engage in human trafficking or slavery. Accordingly, Danaher Corporation does not verify its supply chains to evaluate the risks of human trafficking or slavery, audit its suppliers for compliance with or require suppliers to certify compliance with the laws regarding human trafficking and slavery, provide training relating thereto or maintain internal accountability standards relating thereto apart from the Danaher Standards of Conduct provisions that require Danaher associates to comply with all applicable laws.
This disclosure applies to all consolidated Danaher subsidiaries that are California taxpayers subject to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act.

While implementing rapid MRSA surveillance testing with the GeneXpert® System, there were 138 patient care days saved and 230 more admissions, generating additional revenue of $1,150,000 during the 2007 – 2008 period.”
- Denise Uettwiller-Geiger, Ph.D., DLM (ASCP) Director of Laboratory Services and Clinical Trials John T. Mather Memorial Hospital
We can’t think of better words than “game changing”.
Improving patient outcomes is the primary goal of any diagnostic system. But our GeneXpert® family of systems have set a new standard in workflow flexibility, 24/7 testing accuracy, and user-friendly design — delivered in an astonishingly beautiful and compact package.
But we’ve done more than just repackage a good thing — we’ve improved on the fit, form, and function of the most popular molecular diagnostic platform on the market. GeneXpert System technology is the cornerstone of our unique approach to a molecular diagnostics product suite, which allows us to offer a complete menu of tests on a single, fully scalable, consolidated workstation.
The GeneXpert System is available in a one, two, four, 16, 48, or 80-module configuration. All have our proven GeneXpert module at their analytic heart, and use the same patented cartridge technology for every Xpert® test.

			Patient		
It’s a development that the world has been waiting for — for literally decades. It’s something that has the potential of truly revolutionizing the way we deal with TB today.”
- Dr. Mario Raviglione Director, Stop TB Department, WHO, As stated in the TB diagnostics conference call hosted by Advocacy to Control TB Internationally on December 7, 2010

OVERVIEW

VIDEOS




It’s one thing to improve laboratory workflow. But it’s getting answers to patients that really changes lives. Cepheid’s tests, like Xpert® MTB/RIF, are so easy to use, caregivers on the front lines of the developing world can diagnose the most resistant cases of tuberculosis in ninety minutes instead of six weeks. In the US, that abbreviation means saving time. In villages with treatment-detouring healthcare shortages, it means saving lives. Especially for the high percentage of patients co-infected with HIV. Learn how taking diagnostics mobile is changing the lives of patients.

Home » About Us » Inside Cepheid » Sustainability » Product Stewardship






			Product Stewardship		
Cepheid has implemented programs to ensure materials selection and manufacturing processes consider environmental design in the final product.
Product design for the environment
Cepheid has established formal programs to ensure products and packaging undergo design for environment (DfE) processes to minimize the use of hazardous materials and produce less packaging waste for the consumer. Additionally, Cepheid instrument take-back programs foster product life-cycle stewardship. Sustainable packaging practices have been successfully implemented by several approaches as follows:
Elimination

Eliminated wood crates by using post-consumer recyclable cardboard for delivery of the GeneXpert-16 System. 
Eliminated the need for cold shipments of product. By shipping at ambient temperatures, cold-packs and Styrofoam are no longer disposed as waste materials. 
Eliminated the need to ship GeneXpert modules for calibration. Modules now undergo remote electronic calibration; thus, totally eliminating the environmental impact of using shipping materials and transportation. For modules previously calibrated in Sunnyvale, we estimate 215 million kg of CO2 no longer generated from module transportation.

Reduction

Reduced non-recyclable foil packaging >90%.
Consumable product packaging was reduced 67% by redesigning the container. This significantly reduced packaging materials consumption and transportation weight impact on the environment. 
The Infinity and GeneXpert module transport package weight was redesigned to reduce shipping weight 72% and allow reuse of the container. This reduces packaging materials consumption and transportation weight impact on the environment.


Product Environmental, Health and Safety Compliance
The Cepheid product stewardship program ensures that our product and packaging designs adhere to applicable regional environmental health and safety requirements. Cepheid product literature references these regulations/directives. Specific compliance information is summarized as follows:

California Prop. 65: (applies to manufactured electrical equipment) WARNING: This product may contain chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.
California Toxics in Packaging Prevention Act: Cepheid uses packaging materials that are compliant with this requirement.
EU Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste (94/62/EC): Cepheid packaging components are compliant with this directive.
RoHS: Cepheid products are compliant with the RoHS Directive.
REACH (1907/2006/EC): As an in-vitro diagnostics medical device manufacturer, Cepheid products are exempt from this Directive per Articles 60 (2) and 56 (3).
Classification, Labeling, and Packaging of Dangerous Substances (1272/2008): Cepheid has revised product safety data sheets and labels to be compliant with this directive.

Safety Data Sheets (SDS)


Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) (2012/96/EC): Cepheid is exempt from this directive as an in vitro diagnostic medical device supplier where such devices are expected to be infective prior to end of life. However, Cepheid  has implemented an electronic take-back program for global returns. Listed below are the regions accepting waste electrical and electronic equipment.

Molecular biology analyzer

                                                                    - GeneXpert® Infinity 80                                                            


















        Description    


The GeneXpert Infinity Systems are the latest advancement in Molecular Diagnostics Total Automation. The epitome of platform consolidation, they enable a comprehensive menu of tests to be run on a single system, by a single operator, in a moderately complex, real-time environment. With two sizes to choose from, Cepheid’s unique cartridge technology, and exclusive “load and go” capability, the GeneXpert Infinity provides maximum flexibility in system placement, staffing, and menu availability.
Key features:

    New adjustable Touch-Screen
    Expanded Conveyor & Loading zone
    Increased Accumulator Capacity
    Faster, Quieter, More Robust Robotic Gantry
    Expanded Test Shuttle (load and unload capabilities)
    Fully self-contained (no need for external pneumatics or fluidics)

The best things have stayed the same:

    Our Patented Cartridge
    Our Patented Module Analytical Unit
