				Fraud warning			




Please be alert to fraudsters claiming to represent the Ashmore Group, one of its subsidiaries or its officers or employees.
Financial fraud is a global issue.
Criminals have become adept at creating plausible identities to defraud prospective investors. This includes the use of similar sounding email addresses, websites and fake profiles on social networking sites.
Please be aware that Ashmore does not cold-call investors to make investment offers, nor does it send unsolicited emails or letters.
If you have received contact from an organisation purporting to be connected to Ashmore or implying that Ashmore is its agent in any way, please contact us using the link to the left.
The Financial Conduct Authority provides advice with respect to investment scams: http://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/scams
Current alerts
"Health Lottery UK" is not affiliated to the Ashmore Group.  We received reports in July and August 2016 that Ashmore Investment Limited was referenced in fraudulent letters informing recipients of a lottery win.
"Ashmore Wealth Funds" is not affiliated to the Ashmore Group.  Ashmore has worked with the relevant investigative authorities and has taken steps to stop the use of the Ashmore trade mark.
The Financial Conduct Authority has added a warning about Ashmore Wealth Funds to their website, which can be found at: http://www.fca.org.uk/news/warnings/ashmore-wealth-funds-clone
“Ashmore Property Group” is not a part of the Ashmore Group plc group of companies.  We believe that persons representing Ashmore Property Group may be falsely offering investment opportunities and claiming to be a part of the Ashmore Group.  It is our understanding that these attempts may be fraudulent and you may lose your money if you deal with these people.  Ashmore has reported this matter to the Financial Conduct Authority.

Petron Corp.'s headquarters in Makati City, Philippines.


Petron Corp. (PSE: PCOR) is the largest oil refining and marketing company in the Philippines, supplying more than a third of the country’s oil requirements.
Petron operates a refinery in Limay, Bataan, with a rated capacity of 180,000 barrels per day (29,000 m3/d). From the refinery, Petron moves their products mainly by sea to 32 depots and terminals in the country. They operate a lube oil blending plant at their Pandacan Terminal, where it manufactures lubes and greases.

History[edit]
Petron's history dates back to September 7, 1933 when the Socony Vacuum Oil Company of New York and Standard Oil of New Jersey formed the Standard Vacuum Oil Company (Stanvac). The end of the venture in the early 1960s split the marketing and refining interests of the company between Mobil (the renamed Socony Vacuum Oil Company) and Esso (the renamed of Standard Oil New Jersey, soon to be Exxon), with its Philippine branch now named Esso Philippines, with offices in Manila and later on in Makati.
In 1953, the Philippine national government, partly to promote Claro M. Recto's national industrialization program and partly to respond to increasing international oil prices, attempted to launch a national oil company that caters Filipino consumers with cheap oil. FilOil, the first Philippine oil company was established as a result, becoming the first national oil firm in Southeast Asia.
In 1973, Esso sold its business to the government which became the Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC). Subsequently, Mobil also sold its share of the refinery to PNOC.
The oil refining and marketing units in PNOC, along with FilOil, were eventually merged to form Petrophil, which was later renamed as Petron Corporation in 1988. Today the company's industrial earnings have never seen such high gains but still trade within the average global yield.
The name Petron used to be a gasoline brand of Petrophil. Launched in 1974, the name came from petroleum (PET) and research octane number (RON).[5]
As part of the government's privatization program, PNOC sought a strategic partner that would give Petron a reliable supply of oil, plus access to state-of-the-art refining technology. The result was a partnership with the world's largest oil producer, Saudi Aramco.
On February 3, 1994, PNOC and Aramco Overseas Co. BV signed a share purchase agreement that gave both a 40% stake in Petron. The remaining 20% of Petron shares were sold to the public.
On August 11, 2006, a Petron oil tanker, the Solar 1, carrying fuel oil sank, causing the Guimaras oil spill, the biggest oil spill in Philippine history.
At the beginning of 2008, the Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC) and Saudi Aramco each owned 40% of the outstanding stock, with the remaining 20% held by thousands of individual stockholders. In 2008, Saudi Aramco sold its entire stake to the Ashmore Group, a London-listed investment group. Then Ashmore added 11 percent more when it made a required tender offer to other shareholders, for a total stake of 51 percent. As of July 2008, Ashmore, through its SEA Refinery Holdings BV, had a 50.57 percent of Petron's stock.[6] Ashmore's payment was made on December 2008.[7] In December 2008, Ashmore acquired PNOC's 40-percent stake. On December 2008, San Miguel Corporation said it was in the final stages of negotiations with the Ashmore Group to buy up to 50.1 percent of Petron.[8]
On March 30, 2012, Petron acquired ExxonMobil's downstream business in Malaysia in with XCEL Petroleum. In January 2013, Petron officially opened their Malaysian operations, rebranding all Esso and Mobil stations across Peninsular Malaysia.[9]
Products and services[edit]




Petron oil station located beside the Daily Express building in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia.


The company's ISO-14001-certified refinery processes crude oil into a full range of petroleum products, including LPG, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, kerosene, industrial fuel oil, solvents, asphalts and mixed xylene.
With their ISO-9000/2000-certified lube oil blending plant, they are also able to produce mechanical lubricants and grease. These products are also sold through service stations and sales centers, and directly to industrial customers.
Through their nationwide network, they supply fuel oil, diesel, and LPG to various industrial customers. Petron's largest client is in the power sector.
They also supply jet fuel at key airports to international and domestic carriers.
Through more than 1,200 service stations, they retail gasoline, diesel and kerosene to motorists and public transport operators. They also sell their LPG brand Gasul to households and other consumers through an extensive dealership network.
Petron is expanding to non-fuels businesses which include convenience store brand "Treats". They have partnered with major fast-food chains, coffee shops, and other consumer services to give customers a one-stop full service experience. They are also putting up additional company-owned and operated service stations in strategic locations.
Petron also opened its first fuel additives blending plant in the Asia-Pacific region at the Subic Bay Freeport Zone in November 2008.
The plant has the capacity to blend 12,000 metric tons (MT) of fuel additives per year. When used in gasoline, diesel, or fuel oil, fuel additives improve efficiency, boost engine performance, and benefit the environment by reducing harmful emissions.
The facility was constructed in partnership with Innospec, a leading global fuel additives supplier, based on an agreement forged in 2006. As part of the agreement, Petron constructed and operated the plant to serve the requirements of Innospec’s customers in the region, including Petron.
Traditionally, Innospec products used in Asia have been sourced from Europe.
In April 2008, Petron also commissioned the country's first petrochemical feedstock units, namely, the Petro Fluidized Catalytic Cracking (PetroFCC) unit and a Propylene Recovery Unit (PRU) at its 180,000-barrel (29,000 m3)-per-day Bataan refinery.
The PetroFCC, the first "cracking" unit of its kind in the world, converts black products (fuel oil) into higher-value LPG, gasoline, and diesel, and yields a higher level of the petrochemical feedstock propylene than typical FCC units.
The PRU further purifies the propylene so that it can be used in making various petrochemical products that are used to manufacture everyday items such as food packaging, appliances, suitcases, furniture, DVDs and even car parts.
Headquarters[edit]
Located along Buendia Avenue in Makati, the company's headquarters, the Petron Megaplaza, is a 45-storey building with floor plate area of about 15,512 square meters (166,970 sq ft), which was the Philippines' tallest building before being topped by the PBCom Tower in Ayala Avenue.

On August 11, 2006, a Petron oil tanker, the Solar 1, carrying fuel oil sank, causing the Guimaras oil spill, the biggest oil spill in Philippine history.
At the beginning of 2008, the Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC) and Saudi Aramco each owned 40% of the outstanding stock, with the remaining 20% held by thousands of individual stockholders. In 2008, Saudi Aramco sold its entire stake to the Ashmore Group, a London-listed investment group. Then Ashmore added 11 percent more when it made a required tender offer to other shareholders, for a total stake of 51 percent. As of July 2008, Ashmore, through its SEA Refinery Holdings BV, had a 50.57 percent of Petron's stock.[6] Ashmore's payment was made on December 2008.[7] In December 2008, Ashmore acquired PNOC's 40-percent stake. On December 2008, San Miguel Corporation said it was in the final stages of negotiations with the Ashmore Group to buy up to 50.1 percent of Petron.[8]
On March 30, 2012, Petron acquired ExxonMobil's downstream business in Malaysia in with XCEL Petroleum. In January 2013, Petron officially opened their Malaysian operations, rebranding all Esso and Mobil stations across Peninsular Malaysia.[9]
Products and services[edit]

The company's ISO-14001-certified refinery processes crude oil into a full range of petroleum products, including LPG, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, kerosene, industrial fuel oil, solvents, asphalts and mixed xylene.
With their ISO-9000/2000-certified lube oil blending plant, they are also able to produce mechanical lubricants and grease. These products are also sold through service stations and sales centers, and directly to industrial customers.
Through their nationwide network, they supply fuel oil, diesel, and LPG to various industrial customers. Petron's largest client is in the power sector.
They also supply jet fuel at key airports to international and domestic carriers.
Through more than 1,200 service stations, they retail gasoline, diesel and kerosene to motorists and public transport operators. They also sell their LPG brand Gasul to households and other consumers through an extensive dealership network.
Petron is expanding to non-fuels businesses which include convenience store brand "Treats". They have partnered with major fast-food chains, coffee shops, and other consumer services to give customers a one-stop full service experience. They are also putting up additional company-owned and operated service stations in strategic locations.
Petron also opened its first fuel additives blending plant in the Asia-Pacific region at the Subic Bay Freeport Zone in November 2008.
The plant has the capacity to blend 12,000 metric tons (MT) of fuel additives per year. When used in gasoline, diesel, or fuel oil, fuel additives improve efficiency, boost engine performance, and benefit the environment by reducing harmful emissions.
The facility was constructed in partnership with Innospec, a leading global fuel additives supplier, based on an agreement forged in 2006. As part of the agreement, Petron constructed and operated the plant to serve the requirements of Innospec’s customers in the region, including Petron.
Traditionally, Innospec products used in Asia have been sourced from Europe.
In April 2008, Petron also commissioned the country's first petrochemical feedstock units, namely, the Petro Fluidized Catalytic Cracking (PetroFCC) unit and a Propylene Recovery Unit (PRU) at its 180,000-barrel (29,000 m3)-per-day Bataan refinery.
The PetroFCC, the first "cracking" unit of its kind in the world, converts black products (fuel oil) into higher-value LPG, gasoline, and diesel, and yields a higher level of the petrochemical feedstock propylene than typical FCC units.
The PRU further purifies the propylene so that it can be used in making various petrochemical products that are used to manufacture everyday items such as food packaging, appliances, suitcases, furniture, DVDs and even car parts.
Headquarters[edit]
Located along Buendia Avenue in Makati, the company's headquarters, the Petron Megaplaza, is a 45-storey building with floor plate area of about 15,512 square meters (166,970 sq ft), which was the Philippines' tallest building before being topped by the PBCom Tower in Ayala Avenue.

History[edit]
Petron's history dates back to September 7, 1933 when the Socony Vacuum Oil Company of New York and Standard Oil of New Jersey formed the Standard Vacuum Oil Company (Stanvac). The end of the venture in the early 1960s split the marketing and refining interests of the company between Mobil (the renamed Socony Vacuum Oil Company) and Esso (the renamed of Standard Oil New Jersey, soon to be Exxon), with its Philippine branch now named Esso Philippines, with offices in Manila and later on in Makati.
In 1953, the Philippine national government, partly to promote Claro M. Recto's national industrialization program and partly to respond to increasing international oil prices, attempted to launch a national oil company that caters Filipino consumers with cheap oil. FilOil, the first Philippine oil company was established as a result, becoming the first national oil firm in Southeast Asia.
In 1973, Esso sold its business to the government which became the Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC). Subsequently, Mobil also sold its share of the refinery to PNOC.
The oil refining and marketing units in PNOC, along with FilOil, were eventually merged to form Petrophil, which was later renamed as Petron Corporation in 1988. Today the company's industrial earnings have never seen such high gains but still trade within the average global yield.
The name Petron used to be a gasoline brand of Petrophil. Launched in 1974, the name came from petroleum (PET) and research octane number (RON).[5]
As part of the government's privatization program, PNOC sought a strategic partner that would give Petron a reliable supply of oil, plus access to state-of-the-art refining technology. The result was a partnership with the world's largest oil producer, Saudi Aramco.
On February 3, 1994, PNOC and Aramco Overseas Co. BV signed a share purchase agreement that gave both a 40% stake in Petron. The remaining 20% of Petron shares were sold to the public.
On August 11, 2006, a Petron oil tanker, the Solar 1, carrying fuel oil sank, causing the Guimaras oil spill, the biggest oil spill in Philippine history.
At the beginning of 2008, the Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC) and Saudi Aramco each owned 40% of the outstanding stock, with the remaining 20% held by thousands of individual stockholders. In 2008, Saudi Aramco sold its entire stake to the Ashmore Group, a London-listed investment group. Then Ashmore added 11 percent more when it made a required tender offer to other shareholders, for a total stake of 51 percent. As of July 2008, Ashmore, through its SEA Refinery Holdings BV, had a 50.57 percent of Petron's stock.[6] Ashmore's payment was made on December 2008.[7] In December 2008, Ashmore acquired PNOC's 40-percent stake. On December 2008, San Miguel Corporation said it was in the final stages of negotiations with the Ashmore Group to buy up to 50.1 percent of Petron.[8]

Multiples are way up among food and nutrition  companies -- often 10x EBITDA and more -- reflecting consumers' insatiable demand  for good-for-you foods. 
 
And because this trend is being driven by Millennials,  it's only going to get bigger in 2015.
 
There are specific niches growing in double digits,  springing from changing buying patterns that favor smaller entrepreneurial  brands. Change is coming from the bottom up, and consumers' new demands have  not been met quickly enough by the large multinationals.
 
Middle-market companies are meeting the appetite  for more protein-rich foods. For more on-the-go snacks and meals. For less fat  and fewer additives, for all-organic and zero GMOs. Many specialty brands once  targeted to athletes, bodybuilders, and other limited audiences are now finding  their way onto mainstream store shelves.
 
Combine these appealing characteristics with  today's low interest rates and relatively low compliance impacts on the middle  market, and you have an industry that presents huge opportunities in 2015. 
 
 Helping you succeed  in this changing marketplace is what The Capital Roundtable’s ENCORE conference  -- “Private Equity Investing in Food & Nutrition Companies” -- is all about. It's being held in New  York City on Thursday, April 30.
 
Here Are Four Reasons Why You Should Join Us
 

Hear  which exotic ingredients are driving innovation on grocery shelves.
Understand  which products are taking market share from traditional carbonated sodas,  carb-laden snacks, and artificially-flavored convenience foods. 
Discover  the expanding categories such as baby food, protein based snacks, and non GMO  products where disruptive technology is creating new winners and losers.
Learn  about the mainstreaming of functional foods and beverages -- how consumers are  demanding foods that not only deliver on taste but also do more nutritionally  for them -- and how growth comes when you can deliver on both.

 
Register Now to Get Expert Advice from Sarah Ashmore Bradley
 
Chairing our conference is Sarah Ashmore  Bradley, a founding partner at Kainos Capital, a middle market private  equity firm exclusively focusing on the food and consumer products. 
 
Kainos has invested over $2 billion and is one  of the most active private equity firms having completed four deals over the  past year. The firm’s strategy is to build a diversified portfolio of  strategically relevant companies that trade buyers would like to acquire. 
 
Sarah brings over 15 years of  food and consumer products investment banking and private equity experience.  She was a managing director at Investcorp  where she spent three years as head of global IR and fundraising. Previously,  she was a managing director at Deutsche Bank and a director in Citigroup’s Global Markets. 
 
Sarah earned  degrees in business administration and professional accounting the University  of Texas and is a CPA.  She is a director of Milk Specialties Global,  InterHealth Nutraceuticals, Fempro, and JTM Foods.

On Investing in Private Food & Nutrition Companies
 
This conference brings you the newest and most  rewarding developments in the food and nutrition industry, covering  opportunities in branded products, private label, nutraceuticals, sports  nutrition, and more. In addition, our panelists will answer important questions  such as --

How can private equity investors  best compete with strategics, and justify the expense of a sought-after food  and nutrition deal? 
What metrics and valuation  guidelines can help you judge a middle-market food and nutrition company deal? 
What are the ramifications of the  rise in ecommerce grocery sales, and which companies are best positioned to  exploit this channel? 
How can you take advantage of the  shift toward functional foods, where consumers substitute fortified products  for supplements and even medicine? 
What  are the most important things a firm has to get right when exiting a food and  nutrition investment? 
Will mothers of young children  continue to be the guiding force behind product innovations such as Greek  yogurt and squeezable packaging? 
How are food and nutrition  companies differentiating themselves through social media and through  nutritional-focused smart phone apps? 
What changes are ahead in the  snack bar category, and which new ingredients and food dayparts are soon to  become prominent? 
How are food and nutrition  companies adapting to expanding consumer preferences for gels, chews, bites,  shots and other on-the-go formulations? 
What are the best practices for  overseeing food and nutrition portfolio companies?

Five More Reasons Why You Should Join Us 
 

Learn  which legacy brands and categories are in free fall and which private label  categories are growing.  
Find  why so many industry experts foresee a huge boom ahead in nuts, chia, hemp, and  related ingredients.  
Realize  what lies ahead for commodity prices and how manufacturers are managing their  costs of goods sold. 
Learn  about expanding categories outside of the nutrition category -- like snack  pies.
Find  out about investing in the ingredient companies that supply the large  multinationals, when multiples are too high to invest in the brands themselves.
