Publisher's Description▼▲
As the wife of Focus on the Family founder, Dr. James Dobson, Shirley has devoted her life to the ministry and embraced many opportunities to entertain guests. From dignitaries to backdoor neighbors to the family, Shirley has opened her heart and spread the table for all. Danae, James and Shirley's daughter, remembers the gatherings and lovingly recalls what her mother taught her about being kind and extending hospitality. Now mother and daughter have gathered the stories of those celebrations and get-togethers to inspire others. They've collected time-honored family recipes and dreamed up more than a dozen seasonal parties to share with readers. Award-winning photographer Julie Johnson has artfully photographed each one with special attention to the delicious dishes and lovely table settings. This beautiful book, as much a family memoir as it is a cookbook and a lesson in blessing others through the art of hospitality, will captivate readers, cooks, and party planners alike.


Author Bio▼▲
Shirley Dobson has served as chair of the National Day of Prayer Task Force since 1991 and is on the board of directors for her husbands ministry, Dr. James Dobsons Family Talk. Mrs. Dobson holds four honorary degrees, is a nationally recognized author and speaker, and is well-known for her contributions to womens concerns, Christian organizations, and the institution of the family.
Author and featured speaker Danae Dobson began her writing career at the age of 12 and has authored 24 books to date. She is a popular speaker at church-related events, conferences, and seminars for women and teens. Danae has been a guest on television shows including The 700 Club and more than one hundred radio broadcasts. Danae lives in Southern California.
Julie Johnson built a reputation for quality and creative innovation as a photographer. Since establishing her business in 2001, her award-winning work has grown to include studio and on-site portraiture, wedding photojournalism, and four published books, Welcome to Our Table, Prayers for My Baby Girl, Prayers for My Baby Boy, and Southern Teatime Pleasures.


Editorial Reviews▼▲
"My wife Jane and I have welcomed many people to our table over the years and we always enjoy fellowship with others. Shirley and Danae have written a unique cookbook sharing not only some fabulous recipes, but assembling them around stories that have taken place around their tables. In Scripture the table represents fellowship while breaking bread' together. This is certainly something that Jesus Christ did while on earth and His presence was a sweet smelling savor.' For believers in Him, we will one day be welcomed to His heavenly table and will truly understand what it means to feast in the glory of His presence. Follow the Dobson women through Welcome to Our Table and then invite others to join you around yours to enjoy a meal, a word of testimony, and fellowship together. You never know how the Lord will use your gift of hospitality to lead others to Him."Franklin Graham, president and CEO, Samaritan's Purse, Billy Graham Evangelistic Association
"This is one of the most beautiful books I have ever read! You want to read it from cover to cover in one sittingit is so creative and inspirational, with delicious recipes and gorgeous photos of an amazing family! Our country has been so blessed by the Dobson family's true Christian leadership and teaching of God's plan for our lives! Our whole family loved the book and we are cooking the recipesdelicious!"Miriam Kincaid Justice
"This is one of the most charming additions of any book of its' kind I have held in my hand. It is beautiful in every way."Vonette Bright, author of A Woman's Walk in Truth
"You will want several copies of Welcome to Our Tableone to keep and others to giveto brides, cooks, and those desiring new traditions and celebrations. In this beautiful one-of-a-kind book Shirley and Danae open their recipe files, and their hearts, to present delightful decorating ideas and a treasury of tips, menus, and indelible inspiration. What a gift for all your gatherings!"June Hunt, founder and CEO of Hope For The Heart, author of Seeing Yourself Through God's Eyes

            I LOVE this book. The recipes are easy, yet tasty and beautiful. The stories and antidotes are heartwarming. The photographs are breathtaking. The Dobson women did a lovely job! All in all, this book is exquisite!

About Ms. Dobson
Julie Dobson is Chairman of TeleBright Corporation, a privately held telecommunications company specializing in expense management software and mobility applications.
She retired from the position of Chief Operating Officer for TeleCorp PCS, Inc. in February of 2002 upon the close of the acquisition of the business by AT&T Wireless.  She had been in the position since the start up of TeleCorp PCS in July of 1998, when the company was formed as an affiliate of AT&T Wireless, with licenses to provide wireless service to over 16 million people. At the time of the acquisition, TeleCorp had grown to over one million subscribers, with a network of more than 4000 base stations served by more than 3000 employees.
Prior to joining TeleCorp, Dobson was president of Bell Atlantic Mobile's New York/New Jersey Metro Region.  She was responsible for sales, marketing, customer service, and the continued expansion of the company's wireless communications network in the region.  She also oversaw more than 1,500 employees, and an extensive retail store network in 22 counties in New York and northern and central New Jersey.
From 1995 until 1997, Dobson was vice president of Bell Atlantic's Global Wireless portfolio, responsible for business development and strategic planning.  From March 1993 until February 1995, she was president and chief executive officer of Bell Atlantic Business Systems International, and prior to that she was vice president, planning and development and chief financial officer for Bell Atlantic Business Systems since 1991.
Dobson joined Bell Atlantic in 1980, when she began her career as an account executive in sales at Bell of Pennsylvania.  She served in a variety of positions in sales, sales management, and marketing and strategic planning over the last two decades.
Ms. Dobson currently serves as a corporate director for four public companies; PNM Resources Company, an energy related and utility holding company; for Safeguard Scientifics, a holding company of information systems and bio pharmaceutical companies;  The American Water Works Company, the largest investor owned water utility; and RadioShack Corporation, a leading national provider of mobility and consumer electronics solutions.

Item description for Welcome To Our Table by Shirley Dobson, Danae Dobson & Julie Johnson...
OverviewAs the wife of Focus on the Family founder, Dr. James Dobson, Shirley has devoted her life to the ministry and embraced many opportunities to entertain guests. From dignitaries to backdoor neighbors to the family, Shirley has opened her heart and spread the table for all. Danae, James and Shirleys daughter, remembers the gatherings and lovingly recalls what her mother taught her about being kind and extending hospitality.  Now mother and daughter have gathered the stories of those celebrations and get-togethers to inspire others. They've collected time-honored family recipes and dreamed up more than a dozen seasonal parties to share with readers. Award-winning photographer Julie Johnson has artfully photographed each one with special attention to the delicious dishes and lovely table settings.      This beautiful book, as much a family memoir as it is a cookbook and a lesson in blessing others through the art of hospitality, will captivate readers, cooks, and party planners alike.Publishers DescriptionAs the wife of Focus on the Family founder, Dr. James Dobson, Shirley has devoted her life to the ministry and embraced many opportunities to entertain guests.
