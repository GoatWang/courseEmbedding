Form 10-K
A 10-K is a comprehensive summary report of a company's performance that must be submitted annually to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Typically, the 10-K contains much more detail than the annual report. It includes information such as company history, organizational structure, equity, holdings, earnings per share, subsidiaries, etc. 

The 10-K must be filed within 60 days (it used to be 90 days) after the end of the fiscal year.
Form 10-K/A
Amended Form 10-K
Form 10-Q
The SEC form 10-Q is a comprehensive report of a company's performance that must be submitted quarterly by all public companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the 10-Q, firms are required to disclose relevant information regarding their financial position. The form must be submitted on time, and the information should be available to all interested parties. 

The 10-Q is due 35 days (it used to be 45 days) after each of the first three fiscal quarters. There is no filing after the fourth quarter because that is when the 10-K is filed.
Form 10-Q/A
Amended Form 10-Q
Form 3
A document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by an insider affiliated with a public company's operation or by any investor owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding shares

This document must be filed with the SEC no later than 10 days after an insider becomes affiliated with a company, and it must be filed for each company in which a person is an insider, regardless of whether or not the insider has an equity position in the company at that time.
Form 3/A
Amended Form 3
Form 4
A Form 4 is a document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) whenever there is a material change in the holdings of company insiders. Insiders required to submit a Form 4 include directors and officers of the company as well as any shareholders owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding stock.

This two-page document covers any buy-and-sell orders on the open market as well as the exercise of company stock options. A Form 4 is mandatory within two business days starting from the end of the day the material transaction occurred. This filing is related to Form 3 and the Form 5, which also cover changes to the company insider holdings.
Form 4/A
Amended Form 4
Form 5
The annual statement of beneficial ownership of securities.
Form 5/A
Amended Form 5
Form 8-K
An 8-K is a report of unscheduled material events or corporate changes at a company that could be of importance to the shareholders or the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Examples of events reported on an 8-K include acquisition, bankruptcy, resignation of directors, or a change in the fiscal year. Also known as Form 8k.
Form D
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required for companies that are selling securities in reliance on a Regulation D exemption or Section 4(6) exemption provisions. 

Form D is a brief notice of a company's executive officers and stock promoters, in lieu of the regular reports required when no exemption under Regulation D exists. 

Form D must be filed no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities.

Form D is also known as the Notice of Sale of Securities and is a requirement under Regulation D, Section 4(6) and/or the Uniform Limited Offering Exemption of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. 

This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, providing essential facts, are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act - requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered and prohibiting fraud in the sale of the offered securities.
Form D/A
Amended Form D
Form DEF 14A
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that must be filed by or on behalf of a registrant when a shareholder vote is required. SEC Form DEF 14A is most commonly used in conjunction with an annual meeting proxy. The form should provide security holders with sufficient information to allow them to make an informed vote at an upcoming security holders' meeting or to authorize a proxy to vote on their behalf. It includes information about the date, time and place of the meeting of security holders; revocability of proxy; dissenter's right of appraisal; persons making the solicitation; direct or indirect interest of certain persons in matters to be acted upon; modification or exchange of securities; financial statements; voting procedures; and other details. 

All other filed by non-management definitive proxy statements - typically an annual meeting proxy.

Form DEF 14A, which is also known as "definitive proxy statement", is required under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This form is filed with the SEC when a definitive proxy statement is given to shareholders and helps the SEC ensure that shareholders' rights are upheld.
Form S-1
The SEC form S-1 is the initial registration form for new securities required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for public companies. Any security that meets the criteria must have an S-1 filing before shares can be listed on a national exchange. 

Form S-1 requires companies to provide information on the planned use of capital proceeds, detail the current business model and competition, as well provide a a brief prospectus of the planned security itself, offering price methodology, and any dilution that will occur to other listed securities. The SEC also requires the disclosure of any material business dealings between the company and its directors and outside counsel. 

Form S-1 is also known as the "Registration Statement Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933". 

Investors can view S-1 filings online to perform due diligence on new offerings prior to their issue. The form is sometimes amended as material information changes or general market conditions cause a delay in the offering. 

The Securities Exchange Act of 1933, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act, which is requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered, and to prohibit fraud in the sale of the offered securities. 

A less rigid registration form is the S-3, which is for companies that don't have the same ongoing reporting requirements.

Residences Rising at 8 East Huron
 
 






Written By Editor on June 27, 2016
• 8 East Huron• CA Ventures• Valerio Dewalt Train

This past winter we were the first to tell you that a new residential tower was coming to 8 East Huron Street in Chicago’s Gold Coast.  And now it’s officially under construction.
4 and 8 East Huron before demolition.
Eight East Huron is a project by CA Ventures, designed by Valero Dewalt Train Associates (the “build or die” people). It should max out around 300 feet (290 to the roof + mechanical), which is pretty good considering the tiny footprint it has to work with. It’s a footprint so small that some of the caissons actually intrude ever-so-slightly upon the dirt underneath the public sidewalk. You bet your Aunt Rosie’s bunions, they’re paying the city rent for that.
Earlier this year we showed you the vintage 1800’s stone townhouses next door to the Ukrainian Consulate being torn down to make way for this new glass skyscraper.  Now that the land is clear, it’s time to start looking up.

CA Ventures Announces Start of Construction on 26-Story Luxury Rental Tower in Chicago’s Gold Coast
102-unit high-rise at 8 E. Huron slated to deliver in October 2017
CA Residential LLC, the multifamily investment and development division of Chicago-based CA Ventures, announced it has commenced construction on a 26-story, 102-unit luxury apartment tower at 8 E. Huron in Chicago’s Gold Coast neighborhood. Located at the northeast corner of State and Huron streets, delivery is scheduled for October 2017, with pre-leasing slated to begin in spring 2017.
“It’s exciting to see this project progressing so quickly,” said Tom Scott, CEO of CA Ventures. “The building will undoubtedly maximize the potential of this highly visible site and, due to its size, exude an air of intimacy and exclusivity for residents while delivering all of the luxury amenities for which CA communities are known.”
Designed by Valerio Dewalt Train Associates, the tower will include a mix of studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments, with ultra-luxury three-bedroom, 3½ bath suites located on the 22nd and 23rd floors. Residences will showcase city views through floor-to-ceiling windows and be outfitted with high-end finishes, including wood plank flooring throughout living areas, as well as quartz countertops, custom Snaidero cabinetry, and Grohe and Kohler plumbing fixtures. In addition, apartments will include KitchenAid™ or Gaggenau™ stainless steel appliances and in-unit washer/dryer. Select units will also feature private balconies.
“This development is poised to join the ranks of the most sought-after luxury rental buildings in the Gold Coast,” said Scott. “We took great care in working with the architecture and design teams to ensure the fixtures and finishes would underscore the upscale design sensibility of the building.”
In addition to luxury residences, the tower will feature 8,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor amenity space, located on the 24th floor of the building. Amenities include an outdoor infinity-edge stainless steel pool adjacent to a sundeck and outdoor grilling stations. Additionally, residents will have access to a demonstration kitchen with professional-grade appliances; resident lounge; media room; fitness center with yoga room and on-site pet spa with dog run. The robust amenity offerings will be complemented by an extensive service staff that includes a 24-hour doorman and concierge attendant.
“The entire building – from the residences to the common areas – is designed to give residents a five-star, resort-style experience without stepping foot off the property,” said Scott. “Of course, the surrounding neighborhood has plenty to offer in the way of shopping and dining with the country’s premier retail corridor just a few blocks away.”
The location offers residents a highly walkable urban lifestyle with its proximity to the world-class retail of State Street and Chicago’s famed Magnificent Mile. The tower is one block east of a 30,000-square-foot Whole Foods Market and two blocks south of the CTA Red Line station at Chicago Avenue and State Street. Also within walking distance are Navy Pier and the Lake Michigan shoreline, as well as several nearby green spaces, including Washington Square Park, Chicago’s oldest public park and a registered historic landmark.
The development team includes Clark Construction, the project’s general contractor, and Gettys Group, which will oversee the interior design and finishes of the lobby area, amenity spaces and the apartments.
