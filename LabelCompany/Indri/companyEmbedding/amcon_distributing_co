Do not bother with Amcon if you have a small business. We didn't place an order for 3 months and our account was cancelled. They do not care about the little guy, if you don't order at least once a month, you are a waste of time. Instead of wasting our time setting up another account with them, we've elected to go with a better distributor who cares about their customers.

      2017.
    


      “Both of the industries in which we operate are undergoing 
      transformative changes based on a number of factors including increased 
      competition, shifts in consumer shopping habits, and new technologies. 
      These developments have resulted in consolidation across all segments of 
      the food and convenience store supply chains including manufacturers, 
      distributors, and retailers. Given this operating environment, we remain 
      committed to our focused strategic plan which calls for ongoing 
      investments in new programs, services, and technologies to enhance and 
      support our leadership position in the convenience distribution 
      industry,” said Christopher H. Atayan, AMCON’s Chairman and Chief 
      Executive Officer. He further noted, “We are actively seeking 
      acquisitions that can benefit from our extensive platform of customer 
      service. We are also looking carefully at a number of geographic growth 
      opportunities as our customer base expands.”
    

      For the third fiscal quarter of 2017, our Wholesale Distribution Segment 
      reported revenues of $326.5 million and operating income of $3.1 
      million. Our Retail Health Food Segment reported revenues of $6.4 
      million and an operating loss of $0.6 million for the same period.
    

      “Convenience store operators are increasingly looking to AMCON for easy 
      to use technology solutions that assist them in areas such as category 
      and profitability management and to enhance efficiency. Additionally, 
      interest in building new non-tobacco revenue streams continues to 
      accelerate amongst our customer base,” said Kathleen M. Evans, President 
      of AMCON’s Wholesale Distribution segment. She further noted, “We are 
      implementing the investments we’ve made in our trucking fleet and 
      technology to further support our customers’ geographic growth.”
    

      “We are pleased with the recent extensive renovations and update to our 
      store in Oviedo, Florida. Our management team is developing market 
      driven enhancements to our core business model in order for us to 
      compete in this highly challenging retail environment,” said Clifford 
      Ginn, President of AMCON’s Retail Health Food Segment. He further noted, 
      “We are working diligently on building our next generation store in the 
      Lakeland, Florida market.”
    

      “We actively manage our working capital and liquidity which provides 
      AMCON the ability to respond quickly to the dynamic environments in 
      which both of our business segments operate. This conservative approach 
      provides us significant flexibility to act in the long term best 
      interest of the many constituencies we serve. Both of our business 
      segments are utilizing financial resources in the course of making the 
      capital and operational investments necessary for long term competitive 
      success,” said Andrew C. Plummer, AMCON’s Chief Financial Officer. “We 
      were pleased to close the June 30, 2017 quarter with shareholders’ 
      equity of $67.3 million and consolidated debt of $13.4 million.”

      transformative changes based on a number of factors including increased 
      competition, shifts in consumer shopping habits, and new technologies. 
      These developments have resulted in consolidation across all segments of 
      the food and convenience store supply chains including manufacturers, 
      distributors, and retailers. Given this operating environment, we remain 
      committed to our focused strategic plan which calls for ongoing 
      investments in new programs, services, and technologies to enhance and 
      support our leadership position in the convenience distribution 
      industry,” said Christopher H. Atayan, AMCON’s Chairman and Chief 
      Executive Officer. He further noted, “We are actively seeking 
      acquisitions that can benefit from our extensive platform of customer 
      service. We are also looking carefully at a number of geographic growth 
      opportunities as our customer base expands.”
    

      For the third fiscal quarter of 2017, our Wholesale Distribution Segment 
      reported revenues of $326.5 million and operating income of $3.1 
      million. Our Retail Health Food Segment reported revenues of $6.4 
      million and an operating loss of $0.6 million for the same period.
    

      “Convenience store operators are increasingly looking to AMCON for easy 
      to use technology solutions that assist them in areas such as category 
      and profitability management and to enhance efficiency. Additionally, 
      interest in building new non-tobacco revenue streams continues to 
      accelerate amongst our customer base,” said Kathleen M. Evans, President 
      of AMCON’s Wholesale Distribution segment. She further noted, “We are 
      implementing the investments we’ve made in our trucking fleet and 
      technology to further support our customers’ geographic growth.”
    

      “We are pleased with the recent extensive renovations and update to our 
      store in Oviedo, Florida. Our management team is developing market 
      driven enhancements to our core business model in order for us to 
      compete in this highly challenging retail environment,” said Clifford 
      Ginn, President of AMCON’s Retail Health Food Segment. He further noted, 
      “We are working diligently on building our next generation store in the 
      Lakeland, Florida market.”
    

      “We actively manage our working capital and liquidity which provides 
      AMCON the ability to respond quickly to the dynamic environments in 
      which both of our business segments operate. This conservative approach 
      provides us significant flexibility to act in the long term best 
      interest of the many constituencies we serve. Both of our business 
      segments are utilizing financial resources in the course of making the 
      capital and operational investments necessary for long term competitive 
      success,” said Andrew C. Plummer, AMCON’s Chief Financial Officer. “We 
      were pleased to close the June 30, 2017 quarter with shareholders’ 
      equity of $67.3 million and consolidated debt of $13.4 million.”

AMCON DISTRIBUTING CO.
Amcom Distributing Co. and its family of subsidiaries is collectively owned under the running title of AMCON. Like any other distributing company they are mainly engaged in the wholesale distribution of consumer products. Being names the 9th largest convenience store distributor in the United States in 2012, Amcom Distributing has been steadily growing in size and becoming a serious competitor within its market.
They distribute products that include, Tobacco products, candy, confectionary, beverages, foodservice, groceries, paper products, automotive and health and beauty care products. With a heavy focus on its establishment in the health food sector, Amcom Distributing also operates 15 retail health food stores locating in Florida and the Midwest.
Amcom still remains relatively small in size when compared to other Distribution companies. Amcom only supplies approximately 5,000 outlets in the central, rocky mountain and south regions of the United States. However, with over 14,000 consumer products available, there is a great amount of room for an increase in prospective clients.
Amcom is very involved in the health food sector and following is some more detailed information on the subject.
 
Health Food Distribution
Amcom is different from many other distributing companies because it takes a particular focus on the health food market.  They operate under two subsidiary names; Chamberlin’s Market & Café and Akins Natural Foods Market. Through these they control 32,000 different national and regionally based private label products.
They have the rights to products that include high-quality natural, organic and specialty foods. These all fall under a few common categories; produce, baked goods, frozen foods, nutritional supplements, personal care items and general merchandise.
Overall, Amcom is more corporate-influenced in their distribution method in comparison to the list of family owned businesses that flood the top ten list of distributors. As well, without adequate information indicating otherwise, the health food focus of Amcom is a unique niche to focus on that many other distributors have yet to go into due to their focus on timely and easily storable food products. Meaning that this store may not have the variety you are wanting out of a distributor to provide on-sight stands and customer support programs, but that is exchanged for their ability to supply health-food. Therefore, if you are in the right market, this may be the niche that you need help hitting and if so Amcom is the perfect distributor for you.

Do not bother with Amcon if you have a small business. We didn't place an order for 3 months and our account was cancelled. They do not care about the little guy, if you don't order at least once a month, you are a waste of time. Instead of wasting our time setting up another account with them, we've elected to go with a better distributor who cares about their customers.

    "Love this place! The people who own it are great and super-friendly. They'll special order anything you need that they don't carry. The kids love getting ice cream at the soda fountain."

Do not bother with Amcon if you have a small business. We didn't place an order for 3 months and our account was cancelled. They do not care about the little guy, if you don't order at least once a month, you are a waste of time. Instead of wasting our time setting up another account with them, we've elected to go with a better distributor who cares about their customers.

Do not bother with Amcon if you have a small business. We didn't place an order for 3 months and our account was cancelled. They do not care about the little guy, if you don't order at least once a month, you are a waste of time. Instead of wasting our time setting up another account with them, we've elected to go with a better distributor who cares about their customers.

Do not bother with Amcon if you have a small business. We didn't place an order for 3 months and our account was cancelled. They do not care about the little guy, if you don't order at least once a month, you are a waste of time. Instead of wasting our time setting up another account with them, we've elected to go with a better distributor who cares about their customers.

Do not bother with Amcon if you have a small business. We didn't place an order for 3 months and our account was cancelled. They do not care about the little guy, if you don't order at least once a month, you are a waste of time. Instead of wasting our time setting up another account with them, we've elected to go with a better distributor who cares about their customers.
