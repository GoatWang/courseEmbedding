TENS Units from LGMedSupply
LGMedSupply has a large selection of portable TENS units for pain relief. Whether you�re looking for pain relief from back pain or in other areas of your body, you will find that we offer the best TENS machines and warranties. TENS units are often used as a non-invasive way of electric stimulation for pain relief. A substantial amount of pain relief can be achieved by using a TENS unit properly as the electrode pads cause electric stimulation that travels along nerve fibers, thus creating a pain relieving sensation.
EMS Units from LGMedSupply
We also carry many EMS units. An EMS unit, also known as an electrical muscle stimulator, electronic muscle stimulator, electric muscle stimulator or electro muscle stimulator, can be used as a therapy tool for patients, a strength training tool for athletes and healthy individuals, and even as a testing tool for the evaluation of neural and muscular function.
Electrical muscle stimulation is the use of electric impulses to cause muscle contraction. EMS units provide electrical current that passes through the muscle and causes the muscle to contract. Electrical impulses generated by the EMS machine are delivered through electrodes placed on the skin next to the muscles that need electronic muscle stimulation.  Electrical muscle stimulation can also accelerate the muscle learning process by providing its users with repeated contractions.
A Large Selection of TENS EMS Combo Units
TENS units and EMS units work the same way. An EMS unit will stimulate muscles, whereas a TENS unit will stimulate nerve endings. Many pain sufferers use a combination of both TENS and EMS to provide a maximum amount of relief and muscle stimulation. We carry a large selection of portable Combo TENS / EMS units to combine the benefits of nerve ending stimulation and electronic muscle stimulation.
Portable Ultrasound Machines for the Home from LGMedSupply
We also carry a large selection of portable ultrasonic machines for use at home. These home ultrasound machines stimulate tissue beneath the skin surface by using very high frequency sound waves. Home ultrasound machines can make the healing process much faster by increasing blood flow. They can also diminish the amount of pain due to a decrease in swelling and edema. Portable ultrasound machines provides the user a gentle massage of tendons and/or ligaments without adding any stress, all while softening scar tissue.
Having a portable ultrasound machine at home offers long-term pain relief, cost savings, portable therapy, and can reduce healing time and chronic inflammation.


Google Trusted Store Customer RatingsHave brought many items for LG Medical since 2012 and never had an issue. Service is always great and the products are excellent quality for a great price. If you have a question and call they are knowledgeable about their products plus the LG web site has many videos and tip.

AAA+++- Written on July 17, 2016 READ MORE REVIEWS I was very happy with the service that I got from the staff at LG Med Supply. I looked all over the net for over a year to see who was the main Co. that had not only what I needed but who was the Co. that seemed to be the main Manufacturer of the Tens Unit. Then I started checking who had all of the Conductive Designed Pads That my Dr. wanted me to have and here again LG Med Supply had all of the items and were offering the best prices on all of the items that I needed. LG Med Supply was hands down the best in all of the categories as far as who had all of the items that I needed from the Back Belt Strap/Neck electrode/Shoulder and Knee Conductive Designed Pads that my Dr. wanted me to start therapy with. LG Med Supply is the only web site that had a vast selection of different shaped Electrodes which deliver a totally different stimulation that really gives you a completely different feeling then a straight square pad electrode. Thank You LG Med Supply for being there in my time of need.

Heart Disease










Heart Disease 


Overview
Cancers
Alzheimer’s
Diabetes
Heart Disease
Respiratory
Other












An experimental breath test, designed to quickly identify patients suffering from heart failure has demonstrated promise in early trials.
Study teams have so far been able to correctly diagnose heart failure among newly hospitalized patients with a 100 percent accuracy.
The breath test correctly identified all the patients with heart failure, clearly distinguishing them from those cardiac cases where heart failure was not an issue.

Scope

The leading cause of death for both men and women.
Every 60 seconds someone dies from a heart disease-related event, about 610,000 Americans (2009). Every 7 minutes in Canada at over 69,500 (2011).
US and Canadian economic losses exceed $121 billion every year in physician services, hospital costs,
lost wages and decreased productivity






“Looking at one particular breath sample can be compared with a snapshot. Looking at the dynamics of the concentrations of specific compounds during a full night or during a challenge might be even more interesting. The challenge may be an exogenous ingested compound, such as fructose in the hydrogen breath test (for carbohydrate malabsorption), 13 C-urea in the breath test for infection with Helicobacter pylori or 13 C-uracil in the breath test for dihydropyrimidine-dehydrogenase deficiency.
The vision for exhaled breath analysis is a broad use in clinical applications: for ‘personalized’ screening, diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Over the next decade, we will see the appearance of miniaturized equipment. Sensitivity will greatly increase, and breath tests based on isotopically labeled compounds (e.g., using 13 C as in urea or uracil) will provide fast, inexpensive and easy-to-use clinical applications.”

Additional Areas of Research
Liver Disease

Breath testing for liver diseases provides a safe, non-invasive method of assessing liver function by continuously measuring the by-product of 13C- methacetin metabolism in the breath of test subjects.
The test also provides relatively accurate measure of fibrosis and inflammation levels.
Breath testing avoids traumatic liver biopsy and extensive blood tests.
In 2013, 29 million in EU and over 30 million in the USA have liver disease (1 in 10 Americans).

Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI)
Incidence of sport-induced concussion or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), has increased considerably during the last decade. The majority of the research into mTBI has been directed toward the neuropsychological aspect of the injury, and not until recently has focus been placed on the pathophysiology of mTBI in the sport arena. Systemic physiological effects of mTBI include altered HR variability and decreased baroreflex sensitivity, cellular metabolism, and cerebral blood flow. Current treatment guidelines for mTBI focus on neuropsychological outcomes of pre- and post-injury testing and a gradual return-to-play protocol.
The most influential vascular modulator of cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) is arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2), and the resultant reaction of changes in PaCO2 is termed cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR). CVR is impaired after a traumatic brain injury and various methods and procedures are used to assess CVR in healthy and diseased subjects. CO2 inhalation, acetazolamide, hyperventilation (HV), and breath holding (BH) are commonly used in analyzing CVR. BH and HV have been shown to be reliable and provide reproducible results in measuring CVR and have led to increased interest by breath analysis researchers.

Study:
Methods: Thirty-one athletes (16–25 years old) participated in this study. The participants were divided into two groups—healthy and mTBI. Participants in the mTBI group suffered an mTBI within 7 days.
Conclusions: The data suggests that normal CVR responses may be disrupted in the days immediately after occurrence of mTBI. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography combined with expired gas measurements provides a useful method for assessing CVR impairment after mTBI. Further research, including serial monitoring after mTBI and analysis of CVR response to exercise, is warranted.

High-Field Asymmetric Waveform Ion Mobility Spectrometry (FAIMS)
Function: Compounds (Ions) are Separated by Mobility

Function of the size, shape, charge
Direct, real-time separation
Continuous sample introduction

An Ion filter – only molecules of interest are allowed to be detected
FAIMS Receptor Gallery
















The FAIMS device is like a coin sorter, but ions are filtered via electric fields.
Once filtered they can be identified.



FAIMS Technical Overview
Breathtec Biomedical aims to assist the development of novel instrumentation and methodologies for high-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS). FAIMS can be performed on a standalone device, or, more prominently, coupled to a mass spectrometer (MS). FAIMS is a separation technique which allows continuous sample introduction, enabling direct, real-time analysis.
FAIMS (or differential mobility spectrometry, DMS) involves separation based on the inherent differences in an ion’s mobility in high and low electric fields, and can be performed at atmospheric pressure and room temperature (unlike its chromatographic counterparts). In conventional ion mobility spectrometry (IMS), ions are pulsed through a drift tube by an applied electric field in the presence of a buffer gas which opposes the ion’s motion. As the field is held constant, the velocity, and therefore the mobility, of an ion is dependent upon its mass, charge, size, and shape as it traverses the drift tube and collides with the buffer gas molecules. This is demonstrated by the following equation:

where ν is the velocity of the ion, Κ is the mobility of the ion, and Ε is the electric field strength. Therefore, the migration time through the tube is characteristic of each ion.
However in FAIMS, the applied RF voltage is alternated between a high and low field as the ions are swept through the cell by a carrier gas. As the electric field increases in intensity, the velocity does not increase proportionally with the field strength; thus mobility becomes field-dependent at higher electric fields. At such higher fields (above 10,000 V/cm, as opposed to the 200 V/cm considered low-field), the mobility may now be expressed by the following equation:

where Κh is the high-field mobility, Κ is the low-field mobility, α and ß are compound specific values which account for high-field mobility effect, N is the gas number density of carrier gas, and Ε is the electric field strength. This distinct difference in mobility between high and low fields, Κh/Κ, is the basic operational principle of FAIMS.


FAIMS is typically performed by utilizing one of two cell geometries: curved or planar. To best illustrate the separation principles of FAIMS, a planar geometry cell is discussed, however, both geometries are fundamentally similar. Separation is achieved by maintaining one electrode at (or near) ground, while applying a waveform to the other electrode, as described by the application of a dispersion voltage to create a high-field environment for a short amount of time, before applying the opposite polarity voltage to create a low-field environment for a greater amount of time (A). While subjected to a high field, an ion has a greater mobility, causing it to drift faster toward the lower plate. When the field is switched, the ion’s mobility decreases, and it drifts toward the upper plate. Due to the asymmetry of the waveform, there will be a net displacement of the ion after one period of the waveform as the ion will not cover the same vertical distance when in low-field as it did in high-field. With each continuous period, the ion will move closer and closer to one of the electrodes until it makes contact and is annihilated.
To compensate for this drift, specific ions of interest can be made to reach the detector by applying a secondary DC voltage to the electrodes, called the compensation voltage, as seen in (B).

Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) are the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in particular is a profoundly life changing condition and once diagnosis occurs, this is typically at a relatively late stage into the disease process. Therefore, a shift to early screening, which means several decades before the onset of the typical manifestation of the disease, will be an important step forward for the patient.
A promising diagnostic aid and screening tool to answer this purpose is represented by breath and exhaled volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analysis. In fact, human exhaled breath contains several thousand VOCs that vary in abundance and number in correlation with the physiological status. The exhaled VOCs reflect the metabolism, including the neuronal ones, in healthy and pathological conditions. A growing number of studies clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of VOCs analysis in identifying pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases, offering future potential as cost-effective, fast and reliable biomarkers for AD and PD.
Scope

AD affects over 26 million people worldwide today.
PD currently prevails in 1.6% of the world population.

The increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases, as the population ages, causes a growing challenge for patients, caregivers, clinicians and society.

Suite 890, 789 West Pender Street Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6C 1H2    Breathtec Biomedical Provides Corporate Overview   -- Company offers update of events and outlook for near term opportunity   VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA – October 17, 2016 – Breathtec BioMedical, Inc. (CSE: BTH.CN) (CNSX: BTH) (CSE: BTH) (XFRA: BTI) (OTCQB: BTHCF) (the “Company” or “Breathtec”), a medical diagnostics company focused on developing, in-licensing and commercializing proprietary, innovative and best-in-class breath analysis devices for the early detection of infectious and life threatening diseases wishes to address recent corporate events and to provide an update regarding its immediate outlook and future plans.   In response to recent volatility in its share price, the Company notesthat fluctuations are an example of development stage market volatility which in Management’s opinion should be viewed in the context of the Company’s underlying financial health and strength of its product portfolio. Breathtec maintains a healthy working capital position of $1.3M. Additionally, management of the Company have voluntarily escrowed a significant number of shares with no insider sales having occurred or contemplated.   Breathtec’s technology portfolio continues to move ahead with all licensing and development agreements in-place and a number of ongoing achievements and development phases underway. A brief summary of recent and ongoing activities is summarized below.    FAIMS Technology: Breathtec continues to progress its flagship FAIMS technology with the recent completion of a V2 prototype breathalyzer design. The latest design has significant advances over the previous prototype including larger dynamic range and improved efficiency in the square waveform generator, greater sensitivity achievable by the detector, improvements in the design, implementation of the novel ionization source, and is overall more than 10X smaller than the V1 prototype.The current design is well under development and includes features to allow for the addition of an onboard processor, touch screen and rechargeable battery in a handheld device configuration.   NaNose Technology: The Company anticipates receiving requisite IRB regulatory approval in order to commence clinical studies in Surrey, BC, Canada this month. The study has been designed to determine if the NaNose technology can identify differences in the breath signatures of patients with bacterial infections versus patients with viral infections. The ability to differentiate between bacterial versus viral infections at the Point of Care is anticipated to greatly assist physicians with treatment recommendations which could significantly and positively impact the excessive prescribing and resulting overuse of antibiotic-based treatments.   Regulatory Pathway: Management has engaged regulatory consultants with extensiveexperience in medical device and in vitro diagnostics strategies to evaluate potential regulatory options to propel both the FAIMS and NaNose technology platforms to market. The Company has furtherengaged experienced product development consultants to initiate the design controls, and quality systems processes to meet regulatory approval and to lead the establishment of product manufacturing protocols as a precursor to commercialization.   Professional Collaboration: Dr. Michael Costanzo, Breathtec’s CTO recently gave a well-received presentation “Developing a Point-of-Care Device for Breath Analysis Utilizing FAIMS and FAIMS/MS,” to a prestigious group of leading experts in the field of breath analysis in Zurich, Switzerland. At the event, Dr. Costanzo affirmed, “Breathtec anticipates completion of a prototype of the FAIMS device in Q4 of 2016 and will work alongside our partner to advance the technology towards the clinic.” Dr. Costanzo’s presentation can be found here: http://breathtecbiomedical.com/news/presentations/.   Company CEO, Guy LaTorre comments, “We earnestly appreciate the continued interest and support of all our stakeholders, partners, affiliates and shareholders alike. As such, I wanted to take this opportunity to recap our continued technical achievements as we continue to be motivated daily with overwhelmingly positive feedback as regards the need for a Point-of-Care device such as ours as a means to save countless healthcare dollars and untold numbers of lives in the foreseeable future. These factors compel us to move ahead as quickly as possible with this exciting endeavor and we sincerely thank our supporters for the means to do so.”   ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD "Guy LaTorre" CEO & Director   For further information, please contact:  Kal Malhi President & Director Breathtec BioMedical, Inc            BREATHTEC BIOMEDICAL INC.

Today’s announcement marks the beginning of an intensive research review into NA-NOSE, an advanced stage, nanotechnology-based breath analysis device from the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology which has been in-licensed by Breathtec. The system has been developed to detect the volatile biomarkers of diseases from exhaled breath, and Breathtec has chosen the Province of British Columbia and the City of Surrey to hold its clinical trials for selected respiratory infections at the Health & Technology District on Innovation Boulevard.  “Breathtec’s exciting technology, developed in Israel, is going through the highest quality clinic trials right here in British Columbia,” said Minister of Technology, Innovation and Citizens’ Services, Amrik Virk. “We have a vibrant tech sector attracting companies from clean tech, to information and communications systems, to life sciences – this kind of innovative work is a key part of our diversified economy.”  “The City of Surrey supports the development of health technologies and we welcome Breathtec Biomedical to our growing stable of health technology specialist firms,” said Mayor Linda Hepner. “The addition of Breathtec is another example of how the City of Surrey is committed to working together to help take innovative science and technology ideas off the drawing board and turning them into real working solutions that will improve the quality of life for all.”  Breathtec CEO Mr. Guy LaTorre states, “We are delighted to come to the City of Surrey, British Columbia and to have the opportunity to access such a world-class facility and team. The NA-NOSE device is an exciting new late stage technology that has already been clinically proven in the early detection of cancer and has the potential to change the way we diagnose respiratory diseases which will be our company’s focus.”  During the event, NA-NOSE lead researcher Professor Hossam Haick will demonstrate how the nanotechnology-based breath analysis system is used for screening of potentially life-threatening diseases. The licensed technology will be clinically evaluated as a non-invasive point of care device for early detection of community and hospital based infections such as Streptococcus; Methicillin resistant (MRSA); Staphylococcus; Enterococcus; Vancomycin resistant (VRE); Pneumococcus; Hemophilus influenza (HiB); Chickenpox; and the common cold, etc.  Press Conference – Tuesday, June 28th at 11 a.m. (PDT), 2 pm (EDT).

TENS Units from LGMedSupply
LGMedSupply has a large selection of portable TENS units for pain relief. Whether you�re looking for pain relief from back pain or in other areas of your body, you will find that we offer the best TENS machines and warranties. TENS units are often used as a non-invasive way of electric stimulation for pain relief. A substantial amount of pain relief can be achieved by using a TENS unit properly as the electrode pads cause electric stimulation that travels along nerve fibers, thus creating a pain relieving sensation.
EMS Units from LGMedSupply
We also carry many EMS units. An EMS unit, also known as an electrical muscle stimulator, electronic muscle stimulator, electric muscle stimulator or electro muscle stimulator, can be used as a therapy tool for patients, a strength training tool for athletes and healthy individuals, and even as a testing tool for the evaluation of neural and muscular function.
Electrical muscle stimulation is the use of electric impulses to cause muscle contraction. EMS units provide electrical current that passes through the muscle and causes the muscle to contract. Electrical impulses generated by the EMS machine are delivered through electrodes placed on the skin next to the muscles that need electronic muscle stimulation.  Electrical muscle stimulation can also accelerate the muscle learning process by providing its users with repeated contractions.
A Large Selection of TENS EMS Combo Units
TENS units and EMS units work the same way. An EMS unit will stimulate muscles, whereas a TENS unit will stimulate nerve endings. Many pain sufferers use a combination of both TENS and EMS to provide a maximum amount of relief and muscle stimulation. We carry a large selection of portable Combo TENS / EMS units to combine the benefits of nerve ending stimulation and electronic muscle stimulation.
Portable Ultrasound Machines for the Home from LGMedSupply
We also carry a large selection of portable ultrasonic machines for use at home. These home ultrasound machines stimulate tissue beneath the skin surface by using very high frequency sound waves. Home ultrasound machines can make the healing process much faster by increasing blood flow. They can also diminish the amount of pain due to a decrease in swelling and edema. Portable ultrasound machines provides the user a gentle massage of tendons and/or ligaments without adding any stress, all while softening scar tissue.
Having a portable ultrasound machine at home offers long-term pain relief, cost savings, portable therapy, and can reduce healing time and chronic inflammation.


Google Trusted Store Customer RatingsHave brought many items for LG Medical since 2012 and never had an issue. Service is always great and the products are excellent quality for a great price. If you have a question and call they are knowledgeable about their products plus the LG web site has many videos and tip. I will continue to buy from LG Medical as I feel the are one of the best in their field.

AAA+++- Written on July 17, 2016 READ MORE REVIEWS I was very happy with the service that I got from the staff at LG Med Supply. I looked all over the net for over a year to see who was the main Co. that had not only what I needed but who was the Co. that seemed to be the main Manufacturer of the Tens Unit. Then I started checking who had all of the Conductive Designed Pads That my Dr. wanted me to have and here again LG Med Supply had all of the items and were offering the best prices on all of the items that I needed. LG Med Supply was hands down the best in all of the categories as far as who had all of the items that I needed from the Back Belt Strap/Neck electrode/Shoulder and Knee Conductive Designed Pads that my Dr. wanted me to start therapy with. LG Med Supply is the only web site that had a vast selection of different shaped Electrodes which deliver a totally different stimulation that really gives you a completely different feeling then a straight square pad electrode. Thank You LG Med Supply for being there in my time of need.
