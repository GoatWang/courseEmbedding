Investors trust independent advisors with over $4 trillion of their money.
That’s some serious trust.


Independent advisors are accountable.


Independent advisors are here to serve, not sell.


Independent Registered Investment Advisors are professionals held to a fiduciary standard.


Independent advisor firms are one of the fastest-growing areas within the financial services industry.


Independent advisors are not tied to any particular family of funds or investment products.


Independent advisors focus on building deep, lasting relationships with clients.



































What is an independent financial advisor?
Independent Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) are professional independent advisory firms that provide personalized financial advice to their clients, many of whom have complex financial needs. Because these advisors are independent, they are not tied to any particular family of funds or investment products. As fiduciaries, they are held to the highest standard of care – and are required to act in the best interests of their clients at all times. They are registered with either the Securities and Exchange Commission or state securities regulators1.

Why does Charles Schwab support independent advisors?

Charles Schwab has provided custodial services to independent financial advisors for over 25 years. We are proud to support over 7,000 of these firms and the important work they do for their clients.






Why does it matter if your  advisor is independent?
Many independent advisory firms are owned by the individual advisors who run them, so they forge deep, personal relationships and have a strong sense of accountability to their clients.


Key Benefits:

Customized guidance based on your entire financial picture.
A relationship that’s responsive, attentive, and personal.
A fee structure that is simple and transparent.
A high level of expertise to support your complex financial needs.
Your money is held by an independent custodian, not the advisor firm.

Learn more about the key benefits






Choosing the right advisor.
Whether triggered by a life event or evolving goals, many people reach a point where they need more from their financial advisor. You may be asking yourself one of these questions:

Does the financial guidance I’m currently receiving truly reflect my goals?
Could I be getting more personalized attention from my advisor?
Is there a better way?

It can be a challenge to find an advisor that’s right for you. But there are tangible clues that can help you evaluate how responsive and accountable an advisor may be.

Educational MaterialsSelect an educational pieceA Look at YieldAbsolute ReturnsAlpha Beta SoupAlternative AssetsAmnesia EffectAsset Class HistoryAsset Class SeasonalityBetas On The CuspBroken IncomeCommoditiesCommodity TurnsCorrelationDuration DilemmaEndowment AllocationFlood InsuranceInflationInvestor BehaviorInvestor ReturnsManaged FuturesMarket TurnsPanic P/EsPortfolio ChemistryRelative StrengthRelative Strength EnvironmentsRelative Strength TurnsRisk ManagementScare MarketsTactical BetaTactical DiversificationThe New 60/40 Three Legged StoolValue and MomentumVolatility & DiversificationTitleDescriptionPDFA Look at YieldThis piece provides an introduction to yield and how the low-rate environment has led investors to search globally for new sources of income. It illustrates the importance of dividends as part of an investment's total return. It also discusses common methods of calculating yield, points out the differences in the calculations, and stresses the importance of making an "apples-to-apples" comparison.Absolute ReturnsIllustrates how employing absolute return strategies may provide investors with an inflationary hedge and reduce or avoid the negative compounding effect.Alpha Beta SoupSmart beta is the bridge between the active and passive management. Active managers try to improve performance attributes (alpha) and passive strategies try to deliver performance consistent with a specific category or asset class (beta). This piece discusses both approaches, and highlights the middle ground that may be found by using a factor-based smart beta approach.Alternative AssetsDiscusses why integrating alternatives into a traditional portfolio should help reduce portfolio volatility and improve the odds of preserving capital over the long term.Amnesia EffectDiscusses the failed behavior of fear-based market timing and performance chasing, instead of remembering the potential value of diversification, including constant exposure to noncorrelated investments such as managed futures.Asset Class HistoryA look at the calendar year performance history of various asset classes during the past two decades. In its entirety, this colorful table provides a clear view that asset classes go in and out of favor from year to year, making a powerful case for the potential benefits of diversification.Asset Class SeasonalityStudying asset class seasonality helps to address the old adage of “Sell in May and go away.” The piece examines if there is statistical truth to the yearly superstition with regard to the stock market and if it also applies to other asset classes. Hopefully, as case is made for the potential value of diversification and long-term investment horizons in an attempt to overcome short-term swings and anecdotal observations.Betas On The CuspStudies the increasing beta of various asset classes relative to the stock market on the cusp of a credit crisis. And considers taking a Minsky Approach to Modern Portfolio Theory through the use of alternative investments.Broken IncomeOwning a bond fund is not the same as owning a bond. This piece explains the inherent structural problem with many bond funds and makes a case for using absolute return funds as a possible alternative for portfolio diversification.CommoditiesA basic introduction to commodity investing. Analyzes some of the indexes commonly used as benchmarks for mutual funds, including a comparison of holdings, investment methodology and performance.Commodity TurnsLike any investment, commodities have historically gone in and out of favor. When they are in a prolonged period of delivering negative returns, at some point investors begin to wonder when they may begin to make a new upward turn. This piece looks at the historical returns of multiple asset classes and identifies previous times when commodities rebounded from low points and turned sharply upward.  Contango and CashThis article discusses commodity investing and some technical terms such as contango, backwardation and the use of futures contracts. It also addresses the idea of using a strategy that is more aligned with the objectives of long-term investors.CorrelationThis piece explains correlation and why it is such an important element for diversification. It also provides some perspective on historical correlations, specifically the difference between long-term and short-term averages.Duration DilemmaWhen interest rates rise, bond values generally fall. In order to address interest rate sensitivity in a low rate environment, many investors will reducing the average duration of their bond portfolios by moving to shorter maturities. However, reducing the duration of a bond portfolio in such a low rate environment often results in an lower portfolio yield. One potential solution is to consider using other sources of yield outside of traditional bonds where duration and maturity are not factors.Endowment AllocationThis educational piece discusses the asset allocation strategy of sophisticated endowment funds like Harvard and Yale.Flood InsuranceManaged futures strategies can go in and out of favor, but generally tend to attract the most assets after there is a sharp decline in the stock market. There is an argument to be made for using a strategy that work in both bull and bear markets. This piece examines the similarity between assets flowing into managed futures after a market correction versus people buying insurance after a flood.InflationThis piece explains the history of inflation, a commonly used statistical measurement for rising prices. It also provides some perspective on the way inflation affects an investor's portfolio, and how adding commodities may act as a hedge.Investor BehaviorShows how asset allocation strategies can be used to help limit losses caused by fear-based selling.Investor ReturnsThis piece explains the performance gap between an investor's actual returns from published total returns due to poor attempts at market timing. By measuring asset flows, it is possible to estimate how investors, on average, faired with their sales and purchasing decisions. Investor returns illustrates in real terms how greed and fear can influence decision making.Managed FuturesAn introduction to managed futures, including a history of the global futures markets and the potential diversification benefits of adding managed futures strategies to a portfolio of traditional assets.Market TurnsA historical look at how markets have acted during dramatic market upturns and downturns, and the resulting performance in the years that followed.Panic P/EsLooks at P/E ratios of stocks during market panic periods as a possible way of analyzing historical market turning points. By studying history, perhaps we can learn how the market adjusts prices during times of crisis and prepares for potential rebounds.Portable SigmaWhen seeking diversification, investors often favor using low risk investments to offset the higher volatility of stock-centric portfolios. Because of the lower volatility, the low risk investments require a greater allocation percentage in order to achieve the desired level of diversification for a portfolio. The idea of Portable Alpha is to use a lower percentage of higher volatility diversifiers, provided they have low correlation, in order to free up some capital for additional investments.Portfolio ChemistryCommodities have a historically been viewed as a fairly risky asset class, not unlike equities. Some investors avoid the asset class because of the historical volatility. Similar to high school chemistry, this piece discusses the concept of combining two risky asset classes, commodities and equities, to actually reduce overall portfolio volatility.Relative StrengthAn introduction to relative strength investing which includes information about the basic premise supporting the theory, as well as the actual practice of portfolio construction.Relative Strength EnvironmentsAn analysis of the sectors within the S&P 500 from a correlation perspective. The piece discusses the pre- and post-financial crisis periods and illustrates a timeline of events that may have created a challenging environment for trend-following strategies.Relative Strength TurnsExplains the cyclical nature of relative strength investment models by illustrating the historical performance compared to the overall equity market (S&P 500). Discusses the potential for relative strength to outperform (known as “RS Alpha”), but often does so with upward and downward trend periods.Risk ManagementThis piece explains standard deviation, a commonly used statistical measurement for risk. It also provides some perspective on the historical price movements of stocks and bonds relative to investors' risk tolerance.Scare MarketsMany investors have difficulty identifying the difference between a temporary market correction and a long-term bear market. This piece breaks down the basic differences to help investors make their own determination if a market decline seems like a long-term problem or just part of a normal market cycle.  Tactical BetaDiscusses the potential benefits of tactical investment strategies by increasing and reducing exposure to various asset classes at different times in an attempt to enhance potential returns and reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations.Tactical DiversificationTactical investment strategies and diversification are two terms that often seem contradictory, but may actually complement one another when added to a portfolio.The New 60/40In order to account for ever-changing risk environments, portfolio modeling should include a tactical element, which can add an extra level of diversification. Rather than relying on a static 60%/40% allocation to stocks and bonds, "The New 60/40" asks investors to consider blending a 60/40 mix of traditional assets with tactical and alternative strategies.Three Legged StoolThis Dorsey Wright Insights illustrates a portfolio management strategy known as The Three Legged Stool which combines a core portfolio of tactical and alternative mutual funds with three active management strategies.Value and MomentumMany investors believe that the way to diversify a value-based strategy is to add a growth strategy. However, growth can contradict value. Adding growth has the risk of reducing the effectiveness of a value strategy in the first place. This piece makes the case for using a momentum strategy, such as relative strength, to complement value.Volatility & DiversificationThe purpose of diversification is generally to improve the risk and return characteristics of a portfolio. Many investors believe the only way to reduce a portfolio’s risk is to add investments with less volatility, often at the cost of less return. But according to Modern Portfolio Theory, it may be possible to combine higher volatility investments to reduce a portfolio’s overall risk without sacrificing the potential for greater returns.

Zacks Investment Research lowered shares of CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) from a buy rating to a hold rating in a research report released on Monday morning. 
According to Zacks, “CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period.”

Arrow Investment Advisors Experiences Significant Growth During First Five YearsHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0Arrow Investment Advisors Experiences Significant Growth During First Five YearsMarketwire•March 8, 2011OLNEY, MD--(Marketwire - 03/08/11) - Arrow Investment Advisors, the advisor to Arrow Funds, has experienced rapid growth since its inception five years ago, announcing today that it has surpassed $1.5 billion in assets under management (AUM). With more than $500 million in mutual fund AUM and $1 billion in subadvised AUM, Arrow has quickly garnered interest from investors seeking alternative investment and tactical portfolio solutions. Internally, the firm has grown from an initial four employees to more than 20 professionals responsible for investment management, marketing and distribution."From the beginning, our goal has been to deliver out-of-the-box solutions that can help advisors meet their clients' goals despite unpredictable market conditions," says Joseph Barrato, CEO of Arrow Funds. "We credit much of our early success to our strategic partnership with Dorsey Wright & Associates (DWA), the subadvisor to the Arrow DWA Balanced Fund and the Arrow DWA Tactical Fund. Leveraging DWA's expertise in technical analysis, we have been able to offer dynamic funds designed to enhance diversification while adapting to changing market conditions."Since the launch of its flagship fund in 2006, Arrow has expanded its product lineup to include a total of five mutual funds providing exposure to managed futures, commodities and other alternative investment strategies. In addition, the firm serves as subadvisor to five ETFs, including the popular Jefferies TR/J CRB Global Commodity Equity Index Fund (NASDAQ:CRBQ - News) and the Alerian MLP ETF (NASDAQ:AMLP - News)."Over the past decade, we have seen an increasing appetite for investment exposures that do not correlate to the equity and fixed income markets," states Barrato. "We believe that Arrow is uniquely positioned to fulfill this portion of an investment advisor's asset allocation model."The team at Arrow offers broad industry experience, including a deep background in the creation, management, marketing and distribution of alternative and tactical investment products. The firm's asset management expertise spans mutual funds, variable trust funds, ETFs and wrap programs."Having the right people is critical to building a successful company," says Barrato. "We are so very fortunate that we have been able to attract quality talent -- from research and portfolio management to sales and marketing. In addition to their breadth of experience and in-depth industry knowledge, Arrow professionals possess a passion for helping our clients succeed."About Arrow Investment Advisors and Arrow Funds Arrow Investment Advisors, LLC, the advisor to Arrow Funds, is an investment management firm dedicated to providing investment solutions, education and research to financial intermediaries. Arrow Funds identifies and develops investment products that seek to enhance returns and mitigate risk. The firm is committed to delivering superior performance while providing the highest level of customer service. To learn more about Arrow Funds, visit www.ArrowFunds.com.An investor should consider the fund's investment objective, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing or sending money. This and other information about Arrow Funds is contained in the funds' prospectus, which can be obtained by calling 1-877-277-6933. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing. Arrow Investment Advisors serves as investment advisor to Arrow Funds, distributed through Northern Lights Distributors, LLC (member FINRA). Northern Lights Distributors, LLC and Arrow Investment Advisors are not affiliated entities.The Arrow DWA Balanced Fund and Arrow DWA Tactical Fund may invest in commodity-related securities, which may be subject to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities. The funds may invest in international and emerging market securities, which may be subject to special risks, including fluctuations in currency, government regulation, differences in accounting standards and liquidity. The funds may invest in small-cap securities, which may have special risks, including wider variations in earnings and business prospects than larger, more established companies. The funds may invest in real estate-related securities, which may be subject to mortgage-related risks and real estate market fluctuations. The funds may invest in fixed income securities, which are subject to risks, including interest rate, credit and inflation risk. The funds are nondiversified as there are a limited number of underlying funds available and each holding has the potential for a greater impact on the fund's return.

What is an independent financial advisor?
Independent Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) are professional independent advisory firms that provide personalized financial advice to their clients, many of whom have complex financial needs. Because these advisors are independent, they are not tied to any particular family of funds or investment products. As fiduciaries, they are held to the highest standard of care – and are required to act in the best interests of their clients at all times. They are registered with either the Securities and Exchange Commission or state securities regulators1.

Why does Charles Schwab support independent advisors?

Charles Schwab has provided custodial services to independent financial advisors for over 25 years. We are proud to support over 7,000 of these firms and the important work they do for their clients.






Why does it matter if your  advisor is independent?
Many independent advisory firms are owned by the individual advisors who run them, so they forge deep, personal relationships and have a strong sense of accountability to their clients.


Key Benefits:

Customized guidance based on your entire financial picture.
A relationship that’s responsive, attentive, and personal.
A fee structure that is simple and transparent.
A high level of expertise to support your complex financial needs.
Your money is held by an independent custodian, not the advisor firm.

Choosing the right advisor.

Does the financial guidance I’m currently receiving truly reflect my goals?
Could I be getting more personalized attention from my advisor?
Is there a better way?

It can be a challenge to find an advisor that’s right for you. But there are tangible clues that can help you evaluate how responsive and accountable an advisor may be.
