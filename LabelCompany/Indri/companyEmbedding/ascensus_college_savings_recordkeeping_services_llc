Ascensus College Savings has developed a complete suite of capabilities to make sure that each state's plan is run efficiently and effectively. We view our relationship with our state partners as a collaboration dedicated to help families save for college.


Program Management: Providing a single source of administration and marketing

                   We offer a single source for implementation, recordkeeping, administration, client service, marketing, and investment services. Having a one-stop provider significantly reduces the amount of time and effort needed to administer a state's 529 plan, and ensures a consistent, seamless delivery of award winning services. Our unique platform allows each client the flexibility to choose all or any of the components offered, based on their specific needs.


The Unite Recordkeeping Platform: Optimized for 529 plans

                   Combining innovative technology and results-oriented business practices, Ascensus College Savings developed the first 529-specific platform, Unite. In one easy-to-use online interface, Unite integrates eight modules that facilitate customer relationship management, phone and email technology, mail imaging, workflow, transaction processing, compliance, automated backup, and more. Customers have complete flexibility to choose from a suite of platform modules in a way that best meets the needs of their business.


Investment Services: Developing customized investment lineups

                   Since 2002, Ascensus Investment Advisors, LLC partners with some of the most prominent investment firms in the country to provide investment advisory services to state clients, and works with them to create investment strategies and asset allocation portfolios that are specifically designed for college savers of all levels. We work closely with state partners to help determine which investment options will meet their plans' needs. In addition, our platform's open architecture allows the flexibility to partner with multiple leading investment managers. This lets us recommend a range of options that can be tailored to the plan's objectives and channels. We also work closely with states on the creation of investment policies and guidelines, investment-related reporting, and periodic investment reviews.


Client Service: Quick, accurate responsiveness to clients and participants


Relationship Management - A single point of contact for clients: Every plan serviced by Ascensus College Savings has the benefit of a Relationship Manager as a single point of contact for the plan. A Relationship Manager handles all client requests and, in turn, is in constant contact with internal resources at Ascensus College Savings to ensure that any requests are met in an efficient and effective manner.


Client Service - Dedicated support: The Client Service team provides full-service telephone and email client service support to 529 plan participants. This dedicated team of professionals is available to field client questions, requests, and to help guide them through the details of each plan. Client Service Representatives view the same screen as the participant for a more personal, error-free, and faster service experience for the participant.


Quality results - Transaction processing and back-office service: Ascensus College Savings achieves industry leading quality results, across all transaction types. Quality and timeliness of transaction processing is measured by National Quality Review (NQR), an independent and nationally recognized quality review organization that provides objective evaluations of customer service for both call center and data processing accuracy and timeliness. We have consistently achieved NQR's 5-Star quality rating.

We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the 529 plan web sites and other web sites that we maintain, to track users' movements around the web sites and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
    

    We employ cookies and/or small pieces of code known as "web beacons" or "clear gifs" that, on an anonymous basis, count users that have visited a page that contains these web beacons.

If you would like to opt-out of these marketing emails, please see the instructions in the email regarding how to opt-out.
    

    If you have not opted-out of receiving marketing messages, we may use information from our log files, cookies or web beacons to help us make those communications more useful or interesting to you.
    

    As a result of your accessing the 529 plan web sites and other web sites that we maintain, we may collect information about your web site usage. We utilize this data in conjunction with data from the rest of our online visitor population to determine how to provide better products or services. The reports which are created from web site usage information contain aggregate visitor statistics and will not personally identify you.
    

Choices Regarding the Receipt of Marketing Messages
    

 You may choose whether and to what extent you receive marketing messages from us related to a 529 plan.

Leading the future in college savings

When our children are born, we spend a lot of time choosing the right car seats, the right strollers and the right cribs. But what about the right college savings plan?

But CollegeBound 529, recognized by Morningstar® as a highly rated advisor-sold 529 plan1, makes it easy to save. It's never too early  — or too late — to create a legacy for the next generation.


For many investors, saving for their children's college education is a goal that's both important and intimidating.  CollegeBound 529, recognized by Morningstar® as a highly rated advisor-sold 529 plan1, offers an easy way for your clients to save for college — and for you to enhance your practice.

CollegeBound 529 was awarded the Bronze Rating. The Morningstar Analyst RatingTM is a subjective evaluation performed by Morningstar’s manager research group based on five key pillars: process, performance, people, parent and price. The Analyst Rating scale is Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, Negative. The top three ratings indicate the corresponding level of analyst conviction in the ability of a 529 plan’s investment options to collectively outperform their respective benchmarks and peers through time, within the context of the level of risk taken. Gold plans are the highest-conviction recommen­dations and stand out as best of breed for their investment mandate. Silver plans are high conviction and have notable advantages across several, but not all, five pillars. Bronze plans have advantages that clearly outweigh any disadvantages across the pillars. Ratings are continuously monitored and reevaluated at least every 14 months.
