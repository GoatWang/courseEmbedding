                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

      Fitch to Rate Citigroup Commercial Mtg Trust 2016-P5, Commercial Mtg P-T 
      Certificates, Ser 2016-P5
    





September 26, 2016 02:26 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report for Citigroup Commercial 
      Mortgage Trust 2016-P5, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, 
      Series 2016-P5.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$35,196,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$96,088,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$220,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$246,197,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$44,722,000 class A-AB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$720,185,000a class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$82,569,000a class X-B 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$77,982,000 class A-S 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$41,284,000 class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$41,285,000 class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$45,871,000b class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$45,871,000ab class X-D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$21,789,000b class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (a) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      (b) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Sept. 24, 2016. Fitch does not expect to rate the $14,909,000 class F 
      and $32,110,420 class G.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 49 loans secured by 73 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $917.4 
      million as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Citigroup Global Markets Realty Corp., Starwood Mortgage Capital LLC, 
      Barclays Bank PLC and Macquarie US Trading LLC d/b/a Principal 
      Commercial Capital.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 78.4% of the properties by balance and 
      cash flow analysis of 82.1% of the pool.
    

      The transaction has a Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
      of 1.21x, a Fitch stressed loan-to-value (LTV) of 105.8%, and a Fitch 
      debt yield of 9.12%. Fitch's aggregated net cash flow represents a 
      variance of 11.72% to issuer cash flows.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Lower Fitch Leverage: The pool's leverage statistics are lower than 
      those of other recent Fitch-rated, fixed-rate multiborrower 
      transactions. The pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV of 1.21x and 105.8%, 
      respectively, are better than the YTD 2016 average Fitch DSCR and LTV of 
      1.18x and 106.5%. Excluding credit-opinion loans, the pool's Fitch DSCR 
      and LTV are 1.18x and 110.4%, respectively. Comparatively, the YTD 2016 
      average DSCR and LTV of Fitch-rated deals, excluding credit-opinion and 
      co-op loans, are 1.14x and 110.2%, respectively.
    

      Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loans: Two loans representing 8.99% of 
      the pool are credit opinion loans. Easton Town Center (4.90%) has an 
      investment-grade credit opinion of 'A+sf*' on a stand-alone basis. The 
      loan is a 1.3 million-sf shopping complex that is 96.6% occupied by 212 
      tenants. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (4.09%) has an investment-grade credit 
      opinion of 'BBB-sf*' on a stand-alone basis. The Vertex loan is secured 
      by a 1.1 million-sf office building that is 95.5% occupied by Vertex 
      Pharmaceuticals, a global biotechnology and pharmaceutical company.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 9.3% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans, and could result in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to CGCMT 2016-P5 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity 
      to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a 
      further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the senior 'AAAsf' 
      certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, in which 
      NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the senior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 12.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG 
      LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on Form ABS 
      Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and re-computation of 
      certain characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. 
      Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the findings did 
      not have an impact on the analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence 
      Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be 
      obtained through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating 
      action commentary.

      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch

      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of

      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not

      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute

Fitch Rates Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2016-P6; Outlook Stable
























NEW YORK, Dec 15, 2016 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
Fitch rates Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2016-P6, Commercial 
      Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2016-P6. Fitch has assigned 
      ratings and Rating Outlooks. A full list of rating actions follows at 
      the end of this ratings action commentary.


                                        








KEY RATING DRIVERS


                                        








Fitch Leverage: The pool's leverage statistics are slightly worse than 
      those of other recent Fitch-rated, fixed-rate multiborrower 
      transactions. The pool's Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and 
      Fitch loan to value (LTV) of 1.17x and 108.9%, respectively, are 
      slightly worse than the year-to-date (YTD) 2016 averages of 1.20x and 
      105.5%. The Fitch stressed DSCR and LTV for the conduit portion of the 
      pool (net of investment-grade credit-opinion loans) are 1.14x and 
      112.2%, respectively.


                                        








Diverse Pool: The 10 largest loans comprise 44.9% of the pool, which is 
      better than the YTD average of 54.5% for other Fitch-rated multiborrower 
      deals. The largest loan in the pool is 8 Times Square & 1460 Broadway at 
      8.21% of the pool. The respective loan concentration index (LCI) and 
      sponsor concentration index (SCI) scores of 319 and 375 are better than 
      the YTD averages of 421 and 494 for other Fitch-rated multiborrower 
      deals.


                                        








Below-Average Amortization: Eleven loans comprising 42.3% of the pool 
      are full interest-only. This is worse than the average when compared to 
      other Fitch-rated U.S. multiborrower deals of 23.3% for 2015 and 32.1% 
      for YTD 2016. Additionally, there are 19 loans comprising 28.4% of the 
      pool which are partial interest-only, which is better than the 2015 and 
      YTD 2016 averages of 43.1% and 34.7%. Overall, the pool is scheduled to 
      pay down by 8.8% which is worse than average when compared with the 
      averages of 11.7% for 2015 and 10.5% YTD 2016 for other Fitch-rated U.S. 
      deals.


                                        








RATING SENSITIVITIES


                                        








For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 9.32% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI), for properties for which 
      a full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period. Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF 
      could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans 
      and in potential rating actions on the certificates.


                                        








Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to CGCMT 2016-P6 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivities to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBBsf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 12.


                                        








DUE DILIGENCE USAGE


                                        








Fitch was provided with due diligence information from KPMG LLP. The due 
      diligence focused on a comparison and re-computation of certain 
      characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. Fitch 
      considered this information in its analysis and the findings did not 
      have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E 
      received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained 
      through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating action 
      commentary.


                                        








Fitch assigns ratings and Ratings Outlooks to the transaction as follows:

      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.


                                        








For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning 
      of the Corporations Act 2001.

You will need to pay a deposit of up to $1,000 when accepting the terms of any loan or line of credit. The deposit is nonrefundable, unless the loan closes; in that case, the unused portion of the deposit (if any) will be returned or credited after closing in the same form as your original deposit.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
