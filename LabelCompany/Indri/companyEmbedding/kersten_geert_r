Geert R Kersten's Experience
Title: Managing Director
               Company: Cel-Sci Corporation
Job Details
               CEL-SCI's work is focused on finding the best way to activate the immune system to fight cancer and infectious diseases. Its lead investigational immunotherapy, Multikine (Leukocyte Interleukin, Injection), is currently being studied in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial as a potential neoadjuvant treatment for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Subject to the partial clinical hold, the study was designed with the objective that, if the study endpoint, which is an improvement in overall survival of the subjects treated with the Multikine treatment regimen plus the current standard of care (SOC) as compared to subjects treated with the current SOC only, is satisfied, the study results will be used to support applications that the Company plans to submit to regulatory agencies in order to seek commercial marketing approvals for Multikine in major markets around the world. Additional clinical indications for Multikine that are being investigated include the treatment of cervical dysplasia in HIV/HPV co-infected women, and the treatment of peri-anal warts in HIV/HPV co-infected men and women. A Phase 1 trial of the former indication (treatment of cervical dysplasia in HIV/HPV co-infected women) has been completed at the University of Maryland. The latter indication (treatment of peri-anal warts in HIV/HPV co-infected men and women) is being studied in a Phase 1 trial at the University of California, San Francisco. CEL-SCI has patents on Multikine from the US, Europe, China, and Japan. CEL-SCI is also developing its pre-clinical L.E.A.P.S. (Ligand Epitope Antigen Presentation System) technology for the potential treatment of pandemic influenza in hospitalized patients and as a potential vaccine for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The Company has operations in Vienna, Virginia, and in/near Baltimore, Maryland.
