Publisher's Description▼▲
The cult of independence has broken down society into factions that focus on rights and creates battling self-interest groups. The post-modern society does not recognise that there can be such a thing as right or wrong, just convenient or inconvenient.Kendall takes 1st Corinthians chapter 13 and shows how it should permeate every aspect of our life. He explains to us what is meant by love, a word stolen from its true meaning by our society, and how to practice it in our church, home and workplace.The central thesis of the book is that we have to show a unity of spirit in the church in order to be effective in the world, but one that is not based on compromising God's word.Kendall has been the subject of attack by various sections of the church and he tells how he has coped with this without losing a Christian love for his brothers in Christ.


Author Bio▼▲
R.T. Kendall, former minister of Westminster Chapel, London, is a prolific author and much-loved conference speaker who has a great gift in helping people understand that Biblical passages are relevant for today.


Editorial Reviews▼▲

Product Description▼▲
R.T. Kendall believes that all Christians are called to tithe. What is more, he is convinced that the church would be revitalized and the world transformed if all Christians did begin to tithe. Dr. Kendall combines this bold claim with the biblical, theological, and practical implications of tithing.  Tithing is sometimes regarded as threatening, but it emerges in this book as both challenging and inspiring. Numerous exciting testimonies are told, all demonstrating in individual lives the principle that underlies tithing. "You cannot outgive the Lord."

            Those who don't believe tithing is for today don't even come close to giving 10% of their income back to God and/or God's work. The average in North America is 2% among Bible-believing Christians, according to Barna Research and others. R.T. Kendall's book offers a solid Scriptural and altogether reasonable approach to the subject. If those living under the Old Covenant gave 10%, not simply out of covenant obligation but because they followed the pre-covenant example of their father Abraham "the man of faith," why would those living under the New Covenant (who claim to be spiritual offspring of Abraham) start with anything less? It's because we act like greedy, half-hearted Pharisees, looking for legal loopholes biblically and theologically to justify our selfish behavior. Even today, faithful Jews tithe to their local synagogues, even though there is no Scriptural requirement to do so (i.e., because there is no temple, no "storehouse," and no sacrificial system presently in place). Yet NT believers, who practically brag about their being under "grace giving" in the NT, are content to toss a few dollars here and there whenever they jolly-well feel like it. Such individuals may feel justified using the letter of the law, but what about the Spirit of the law under which Abraham operated? One simply can't ignore the fruit of obedience that tithing brings, part of which is seeing church families with more than enough to do the work of the ministry with excellence, as opposed to having to scramble and beg and plead for finances from tight-fisted, worldly-minded saints who couldn't entertain the thought that God would have them to give joyfully and systematically at the same time. Tithing is a spiritual discipline, and if one remains uncertain perhaps this little gem of a book by R.T. Kendall will help. One can actually test God to see if it is true (Malachi 3:10), or simply put "grace giving" into practice by giving regularly beyond the 10% tithe to their local church family, and teaching others to do the same.

            R.T. Kendall (I believe) is a sincere man of faith and his heart and desire to honor the Lord are evident in this book.  Kendall's approach to tithing is (what I would consider) strictly traditional, in that his support of tithing as being a principle and mandate that applies to Christians is the common view among many "mainline" denominational churches today.  While I appreciated the attitude of love presented in this book, I felt it was lacking in Word (Scripture) detail.  The book predominantly presents the author's opinions about tithing rather than clear evidence of Scripture.  In fact, there are some points that the author states as being biblical fact but then proves his claim by offering mere speculation.  Often the Scripture references that are used are used more as traditional "proof texts" rather than presented in complete context (siting whole passages of Scripture to illustrate the complete point).  The Bible certainly teaches principles of grace giving for Christians; that all gifts bestowed should be wrought of love and faith and obedience to the Spirit of God and in recognition of the ultimate gift He freely gave in sending Christ to die for mankind (Romans 1:3-5; 7:6; Galatians 5:1; 2 Corinthians 8:8, 9:7; 1 Peter 4:10; etc.).  New Testament Scripture is not silent about the fact that the legal ordinances of the Mosaic Law have been nailed to the cross of Jesus and are not to govern Christian practice (e.g. Hebrews 9:8-10; Ephesians 2:13-16; Colossians 2:14; Galatians 3:23-26; Hebrews 7:18; 8:8-13; etc).  I respect this brother as a man of God with a sincere heart for the church of Jesus Christ.  Unfortunately, this book seems (in my opinion) to be more of a product of traditional opinion rather than clear Scriptural truth.  Personally a more indepth study of tithing may be found in a book like "Beyond Tithes and Offerings" by Michael and Mitchell Webb or "Should The Church Teach Tithing" by Dr. Russell Earl Kelly, Ph.D.

Overview

Understanding Theology (3 vols.) finds its origins in Westminster Chapel, London's extremely successful School of Theology. R. T. Kendall's notes from lectures given on those Friday evening classes form the basis for this three-volume collection. The Understanding Theology (3 vols.) has been so popular, in fact, that volume 1 has been re-printed every year since it was first published in 1996. Kendall's conviction that all Christians should have an understanding of basic doctrine is represented in this collection. In keeping with the motto of Westminster Chapel's School of Theology, "theology put simply," Understanding Theology (3 vols.) is written in outline form, condensing what should be a many-volume work into three important works of theology.
Every chapter of Understanding Theology (3 vols.) is designed to lay the groundwork for a well-rounded understanding of important biblical doctrines. Whether you use these volumes as an impetus for personal study and edification, for sermon or Bible study preparation, or to bolster an already growing theology collection, Understanding Theology (3 vols.) is destined to become a much used reference in your digital library.
With the Logos Bible Software edition of the Understanding Theology (3 vols.), all Scripture passages are tagged to original language texts and English Bible translations. With the advanced search features of Logos Bible Software, you can perform powerful searches by topic or Scripture reference. That makes your theology books easier to access than ever before for scholarly work or personal study.


Key Features


A practical and extensive outline layout
Thorough indexes covering all subjects, persons, and Bible characters discussed
A sweeping examination of important biblical doctrines, attributes, Christian practices, and behavior
All Scripture references linked to the Bibles in your library

Title: Understanding Theology (3 Vols.)
Publisher: Christian Focus Publications
Author: R. T. Kendall
Volumes: 3
Pages: 1,484

 
Back to Top









Understanding Theology Volume 1

Publisher: Christian Focus Publications
Publication Date: 1996
Pages: 432





This first volume of R. T. Kendall's Understanding Theology has been re-printed every year since it was first published in 1996. The content and the format of the book are its strengths, making it searching, clear, profound, and fair minded. Rather than avoid a contentious issue, Kendall explains both sides of an argument—showing its history and logical development. This format enables you to see clearly the source and development of a doctrine while accessing the information as succinctly as possible.


Dr. Kendall is convinced of the importance of all Christians being able to understand basic doctrine. Hundreds gather on Friday evenings to learn about "theology made simple" at his Westminster Chapel School of Theology. His lecture notes have now been brought together to give a well-rounded and accessible understanding of the major Christian doctrines. This book is for pastors, church leaders, students and all Christians who feel that the time is overdue to come to terms with theology but who have found it boring and hard. R. T. strives not only for simplicity but balance: matching the practical with the cerebral, the Spirit with the Word.
—Renewal Magazine







Understanding Theology Volume 2

Publisher: Christian Focus Publications
Publication Date: 2000
Pages: 548





The much anticipated second volume from the Westminster School of Theology is full of the probing theology that made the first volume so popular. In these collected notes from Kendall's lectures to his students at Westminster you will find analysis of biblical inerrancy, the attributes of God, the Holy Spirit, predestination vs. free will, gender roles, baptism, experiencing God, faith and works, prayer, spiritual warfare, temptation, and Heaven. As is the case with the rest of the Understanding Theology (3 Vols.) collection, the outline format of the Understanding Theology Volume 2 offers many volumes worth of material in its 548 pages.


A wonderful opportunity to come to grips with the essential truths of the Bible. Suitable for church leaders, students, and all those who believe that Scripture and the Holy Spirit can change lives today.
—Clive Calver


A changing world needs a changeless Word. R. T.'s inspiring teaching introduces us again to the eternal truths of Scripture.
—Lyndon Bowring







Understanding Theology Volume 3

Publisher: Christian Focus Publications
Publication Date: 2001
Pages: 504





					With the overwhelming response to volumes 1 and 2 of Understanding Theology, R. T. Kendall and Christian Focus Publications published the last of Kendall's outlines from classes taught at the Westminster School of Theology. One could argue the the Understanding Theology collection represents a new genre of theological literature due to its unique means of communicating truths from the Scriptures. Like the volumes before it, Understanding Theology Volume 3 is not a textbook, but a handbook of practical theology.
					 
Sections include Who is Jesus, Faith, and the practical issues of Faith in Action.


R. T. Kendall is a man of deep commitment to the Bible and wants others to know it, love it and understand it.
—Billy Graham

From the creators of God's Not Dead! When a local pastor is shaken to the core by the visible faith of an elderly street-corner preacher, he's reminded that true belief always requires action. His response ignites a faith-fueled journey that powerfully impacts everybody it touches in ways that only God can orchestrate.  Rated PG-13. Dove approved (12+). Approx. 120 minutes.

 From the studio that brought you War Room and Miracles from Heaven comes a captivating new film!  All Saints is based on the inspiring true story of salesman-turned-pastor Michael Spurlock (John Corbett, My Big Fat Greek Weeding), the tiny church he was ordered to shut down, and a group of refugees from Southeast Asia. Together, they risked everything to plant seeds for a future that might just save them all. Look for it in theaters nationwide August 25!
