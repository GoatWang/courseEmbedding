whom my heart loves–
I will rise then and go about the city;
in the streets and crossings I will seek
Him whom my heart loves.
I sought him but I did not find him.
The watchmen came upon me,
as they made their rounds of the city:
Have you seen him whom my heart loves?
I had hardly left them
when I found him whom my heart loves....

Richest 
          Man in Equipment Leasing
 
Dave Harmon was the 
          single largest owner of a leasing company until he sold off the majority 
          of his portfolio of El Camino Leasing in Woodland Hills, California, 
          �in 2001.� The 
          mantle then went to San Francisco�s ATEL Capital Group President A.J. 
          Batt, who then shortly retired to give the title of� world's richest leasing owner to Dean Cash, 
          his "partner for twenty years," who now owns almost 75%.. 
          Perhaps this has now passed to Patrick Byrne, president of Balboa Capital, 
          Irvine, California who recently bought out his partner Shawn Giffin.� 
 
Nevertheless, officially, 
          the title of richest single person in leasing should go to 56 year old 
          Steven Ferencz Udvar-Hazy who is listed �in 
          Forbes magazine with a net worth of $2.6 billion. He currently resides 
          in Beverly Hills, California.� He 
          started the company with his father.

�Udavar-Hazy founded International 
          Lease Finance Corporation which was sold to the �insurance company AIG, American International Group.

�ILFC was the nation's largest 
          lessor and financier of jet aircraft.

World 
          Leasing Yearbook 2004
 
This the most definite 
          publication of leasing in the world, naming companies with
names, addresses, 
          telephone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses and at least� once contact name and title along with a summary of their activities.
 
 

 
This is their 25th 
          edition, 488 pages long� The 
          Yearbook features profiles on leasing in over 50 countries, including 
          a directory of 4,400 companies
 
 

 
 
106 pounds in England, 
          $250 in the U.S. with discounts when ordered 2-4, 128 bpounds or $200 
          US,
and five or more at 112 
          pounds and $175 US.
e-mail: hotline@euromoney.com
phone: +44(o) 20 7779 
          8999 or toll free in the US� + 
          1-800-437-9997
It can also be ordered 
          securely online at www.euromeony-yearbooks.com
 
While the Yearbook is 
          new, it is printed and distributed and therefore all the companies listed, 
          particularly in the United States, may have some inaccuricies, such 
          as Robert J. Fisher at Fisher-Anderson in Des Moines, Iowa.� 
          Bob is now at Nassau Assets and Fisher-Anderson became Firerock 
          Capital.� There are some minor spelling errors such as 
          El Camino Resources president is not �David 
          E. Harman but Harmon.� Perhaps 
          not that important, unless you are Mr. Harmon.�� 
          In addition,listing Peter S. Hemar of Hemar & Associates, 
          Attorneys at Law ( an excellent attorney with an excellent reputation, 
          and other law firms also listed,) but including them in �Leasing Services� 
          is a stretch.
 
 
The section is 33 pages 
          in various sizes of type, with much other information, and appears to 
          be quite thorough for a publication in print.
 
Those seeking to do business 
          in another country will find very good information on the countries 
          covered, plus a list of leasing companies to contact.� There is no other publication that offers as much information. Leasing 
          companies are not listed by paying for their advertisement or placement.� The lists appear quite complete.� Perhaps with this information, the current 
          information may be found on the internet as most of these companies 
          also have web sites. Many of the web sites do not list contacts, by 
          the way,surprisingly many of the ones I found not only did not have 
          their physical address, or
telephone number.� Many had applications on line or a form for 
          a customer or log in for a present customer, but not for another leasing 
          company, particularly one overseas.
 
Overall, Leasing 
          News recommends this book as a �bargain� for the information it conveys.
 
It will join our 
          on line our Leasing Books section:

Manifest Newsletter�Spectrum 
          Messenger
 
From our archives on 
          May 20th, we reprinted the Manifest Insurance policy:
 
��������������� Manifest Issues 
          "Insurance Policy" to all its brokers. 
 
Here is the essence of 
          The Manifest Insurance Policy: 
 
" Your lessee and 
          vendor lists will remain confidential to The Manifest Group. At no time 
          will this information be shared with anyone outside The Manifest Group. 
          This policy holds true even if your company is no longer doing business 
          with the Manifest Group" 
 
Manifest was perhaps 
          the first to declare its policy in writing
and guaranteed. In their 
          change to be part of US Bancorp
that policy is still 
          in effect.� If you read the Leasing 
          News list,
others may come and go, 
          sell their portfolio�s, but Manifest
guarantees protection 
          to its brokers.
 

 
The new general manager 
          and senior vice president, Brad Peterson
continues to policy, 
          and in his first newsletter, dated April 2004,
he says, �To everyone 
          I say...�I accept.�
 
I accept the responsibility 
          of insuring Manifest �stays the course� in terms of being Focused on 
          Your Success.� Our bhusiness 
          model and success are directly tired to our relationship with our customers.� we will strive every day to reinforce and enhance 
          those relationships.�
 
To read his entire statement, 
          please learn about their Commercial
credit Division, plus 
          changes in their company, and about
their employees, please 
          view this excellent magainze, which
also has a farewell from 
          Brian Bjella, perhaps another first
to show the passing of 
          the baton.

Stalled 
          Conduits Yearning for Borrowers
 
� ABSnet
 
The commercial-paper 
          conduit market remains mired in its two-year slump, defying predictions 
          that the booming economy would cause outstandings to start growing again. 
          
 
As a whole, conduits 
          based in the U.S. aren't experiencing even the modest growth that their 
          operators forecast at the beginning of this year. Such vehicles had 
          $715 billion of their paper in the hands of investors on May 12, which 
          is roughly the same as their Jan. 1 outstandings, according to the Federal 
          Reserve Board. 
 
In January, industry 
          players predicted that the conduit market would finish 2004 with $725 
          billion to $750 billion of outstandings. That looks unlikely now, and 
          only the most-conservative estimates may prove accurate. During one 
          week in mid-March, outstandings even dipped below $700 billion for the 
          first time in a year. 
 
Oddly enough, the 
          standstill is occurring at a time when demand for conduit paper is as 
          strong as ever. Part of the problem is that companies are holding back 
          on the sums they borrow from conduits, choosing instead to tap other 
          funding sources. "We're seeing a reasonably normal volume in terms 
          of transactions and conduit work. It's just that people aren't drawing 
          on the facilities," said Everett Rutan, a senior vice president 
          at Moody's. 
 
That could change 
          if inflationary pressure leads the Federal Reserve to boost short-term 
          interest rates. Such a move would cause other sources of cheap funding 
          to dry up, prompting companies to return to the conduit market. 
 
Bankers say that 
          new accounting rules and pending regulatory requirements have presented 
          the greatest barriers to growth for their conduits, according to S&P. 
          
 
The lack of growth 
          is particularly pronounced at the market's largest shops. The top 15 
          conduit operators had $423 billion of outstanding paper at yearend 2003, 
          down $2.2 billion from a year earlier, according to Moody's. 
 
GE Capital's conduits 
          shrank the most, as the Stamford, Conn., lending giant continued to 
          diversify its funding sources. Its conduits had $24 billion of outstandings 
          at yearend, down $10.2 billion from a year earlier. That caused GE to 
          slip four notches, to eighth place among conduit administrators. 
 
Citibank remained 
          at the top of the heap, even though its yearend conduit outstandings 
          fell by $2.1 billion, to $55.2 billion. The perennial market leader 
          lost ground to its closest rival, ABN Amro, which boosted outstandings 
          by $1.2 billion, to $50.9 billion. 
 
Citibank also faces 
          a substantial challenge this year from J.P. Morgan Chase, which is scheduled 
          to take over Bank One at the end of June. Bank One is currently the 
          market's number-three administrator. J.P. Morgan slid to 10th place, 
          from 13th. The combined banks would control more than $52 billion of 
          conduit issues - putting J.P. Morgan roughly on par with Citi and ABN. 
          
 
It's not clear yet 
          whether J.P. Morgan plans to maintain such a large presence following 
          the merger. Both banks supply substantial liquidity support to their 
          conduits, which likely purchase assets from many of the same clients 
          - and J.P. Morgan may take steps to avoid too much exposure to certain 
          assets. 
 
Despite GE's pullback, 
          its mammoth Edison Asset Securitization was still the market's largest 
          conduit. The multiseller vehicle's outstandings totaled $22 billion 
          at yearend, down almost $9 billion from a year earlier. ABN's Amstel 
          Funding conduit followed with $21 billion of outstandings.

This 
          Day in American History
 
    1649-A 
          ban on Jesuits was enacted by the Puritan Massachusetts colony. Contrary
to what is taught 
          in elementary and middle schools, the puritans were quite 
prejudiced to other 
          religions and did not escape England for persecution, but
wanted for the opposite 
          reason, to ensure their own religion above any others.
The ban provided 
          that �No Jesuit or ecclesiastical person obayned by the authoritie of 
          the pope shall henceforth come within our jurisdiction� except ting 
          survivors of shipwrecks and trades who � behave themselves inoffensively 
          during their abode here.�� A second offense was punishable by death.
    1771 
          - A famous Virginia flood occurred as heavy rains in the mountains brought 
          all rivers in the state to record high levels.
    1836-The 
          power of the Southern pro-slavery Congress voted the first gag rule 
          when they
voted 117 to 68 to 
          ban any consideration of the contentious subject of slavery. The resolution 
          red: �Whereas it is extremely important and desirable that the agitation 
          of this subject should be finally arrest, for the purpose of restoring 
          tranquility to the public mind, your committee respectfully recommend 
          the adoption of the following additional resolution;� 
          Resolved that all petitions, memorials, resolutions, propositions, 
          or papers relating in any way, or to any extent whatever, to the subject 
          of slavery, or the abolition of slavery, shall without being either 
          printed or referred, be laid upon the table and that n further action 
          whatever shall be had thereon.�
    1864-The 
          Territory of Montana was formed by Congress from the Territory of Idaho.
    1868- 
          President Andrew Johnson avoids impeachment by 1 vote. When Johnson 
          removed his Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton over plans for Reconstruction, 
          the opposing party, Republicans, voted to impeach him on February 24 
          at the House of Representatives.� A 
          trial
then was brought 
          against him by the US Senate.� Both 
          times the vote was 35 for conviction and 19 for acquittal.� Because a two-thirds vote was needed to convict, Johnson was judged 
          not guilty.� As a side note, 
          on May 21, the Republican National Convention nominated Gen. Ulysses 
          S. Grant for the presidency, and at the same meeting, the convention 
          adopted the name National Republican Party.

    1917 
          - A tornado touched down near Louisiana MO about noon and remained on 
          the ground for a distance of 293 miles, finally lifting seven hours 
          and twenty minutes later in eastern Jennings County, IN. The twister 
          cut a swath of destruction two and a half miles wide through Mattoon, 
          IL. There were 101 persons killed in the tornado, including 53 at Mattoon, 
          and 38 at Charleston IL. Damage from the storm totaled 2.5 million dollars.

          soon hired by Benny Goodman to sing with his band. Known for her simple, 
          jazzy style as well as her sex appeal, her biggest hits were 1958�s 
          �Fever� and 1969�s �Is That All There Is?_---both of which are now considered 
          standards. She is perhaps best remembered for the songs that she co-wrote 
          and performed in Disney�s Land and the Tramp.� She continued to perform 
          until the 1990�s, when poor health forced her to retire.� 
          She died January 21, 2002 at Los Angeles, Ca.

Baseball 
          Poem
 
"MIRACLE 
          MAN": An Original Poem
��� by� Holly Russcher
 
I started thinking 
          up this poem the day after Robin's first game back after his injury. 
          By styling it after "Casey at the Bat" I acknowledged not 
          only one of baseball's best literary works but also the high expectations 
          that Sox-fans had for Robin that night, much like those the Mudville 
          crowd had for their great slugger, Casey.
 
Casey failed to come 
          through for his team. What you are about to read is a different story....
 
 
The 
          night of July 24, at Comiskey Park, some said
A 
          flame would be rekindled that had long lain cold and dead.
Fans 
          hoped to shout when all was done "The White Sox are on track!"--
But 
          so far, they simply whispered "Robin Ventura's coming back."
 
That 
          left-handed home run hitter with warm smile and matchless heart
Four 
          Gold Gloves he'd won at third base with defense that looked like art
Nearly 
          crippled in a freak mishap on March the twenty-first,
Now 
          back eight days before schedule, flouting all talk of the Worst.
 
The 
          Texas Rangers would oppose the Sox as Chitown twilight fell;
When 
          the home team's lineup was announced there came a joyous yell.
Behind 
          the plate the ump cried "Play ball!"; the game duly began
With 
          disconcerting fashion: a hit for Texas' leadoff man.
 
Doug 
          Drabek was a-pitching, gold of hair and steel of eye,
A 
          no-hitter was beyond his scope, but for shutout he would try.
He'd 
          also pitched the night when Robin had been stricken down--
Did 
          that memory now haunt him as he stood upon the mound?
 
Nothing-nothing 
          was the score when Robin first came to the plate
And 
          received a standing ovation which for a full minute did not abate.
He 
          acknowledged it with a smile and wave, which made the fans go wild;
So 
          glad was he to play again that his face shone like a child's.
 
"We 
          love you, Robin Ventura! We know you'll make us proud!"
Cried 
          the matriarchs and lasses present in that evening's crowd.
Men, 
          rarely so demonstrative, rose on their feet to say
"Come 
          on, Robin!" But he grounded out, and walked--not limped--away.
 
In 
          the still-scoreless seventh inning, Rangers hurler Ken Hill tired.
With 
          Frank Thomas on, he walked Albert Belle, and then his luck expired
For 
          Harold Baines, the quiet DH, drove Frank home without a word.
The 
          Sox led, but Robin had grounded out a second time...and third.
 
Matt 
          Karchner came in next to pitch and gave up a home run.
A 
          worried hush fell on the fans who knew the score'd been tied at one.
Already 
          the eighth inning: did the Sox not have a chance?
Would 
          this night of joy instead be one where Texas got to dance?
 
Dave 
          Martinez ignored Hill's pitches, and at last he drew a walk.
Ozzie 
          Guillen bunted him to second; announcer Ed Farmer began to talk.
"Durham 
          next, then Ventura, who so far is oh-for-three."
Ray 
          Durham hit into a groundout. What now would the Sox-fans see?
 
Robin 
          sauntered to his rightful place; this was his last at-bat.
Facing 
          a dreadful situation, in his comeback game at that!
With 
          one swing he could put the Sox ahead if things went well,
But 
          if he was the last out? Such a disgraceful tale to tell!
 
Hill 
          stood on the mound in silence, wound up and pitched the ball.
What 
          occurred in the next instant was a shock to one and all.
Ed 
          Farmer's voice broke in wonder as these words his lips did yield:
"Hill 
          with the pitch...Ventura lines it, deep left center-field!"
 
"It's 
          gonna get down, and go to the warning track! Picked on a hop by Rusty 
          Greer--
VENTURA 
          DOUBLES IN MARTINEZ!!!!" And the crowd took up the cheer;
Praise 
          for a valiant hero who'd won hearts across the land.
As 
          Robin left the field in the ninth, he tossed his cap into the stands.
 
That 
          night in other ballparks spoiled superstars had played,
Ignoring 
          fans and only caring for how much they're paid.
And 
          on the cheeks of their heartbroken fans, tears of loathing burned...
But 
          happy tears flow at Comiskey, for Robin Ventura has returned.
