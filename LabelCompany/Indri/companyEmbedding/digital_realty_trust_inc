Digital Realty To Merge With DuPont Fabros


June 09, 2017

Download this Press Release (PDF 342 KB)

Transaction to Enhance Digital Realty's Ability to Serve Top U.S. Data Center Metro AreasExpands Hyper-Scale Product Offering and Solidifies Blue-Chip Customer BaseImmediately Accretive to Financial Metrics and Improves Balance Sheet Strength

SAN FRANCISCO and WASHINGTON, June 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Digital Realty (NYSE: DLR), a leading global provider of data center, colocation and interconnection solutions, and DuPont Fabros (NYSE: DFT), a leading owner, developer, operator and manager of enterprise-class, carrier-neutral, large scale multi-tenant data centers, announced today they have entered into a definitive agreement under which DuPont Fabros will merge with Digital Realty in an all-stock transaction.  The consummation of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by the shareholders of Digital Realty and DuPont Fabros.  Under the terms of the agreement, DuPont Fabros shareholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 0.545 Digital Realty shares per DuPont Fabros share, for a transaction valued at approximately $7.6 billion in enterprise value.
Transaction Delivers Key Strategic and Financial Benefits

Enhances Ability to Serve Top U.S. Metro Areas:  DuPont Fabros' portfolio is concentrated in top U.S. data center metro areas across Northern Virginia, Chicago and Silicon Valley.  The transaction will help grow Digital Realty's presence in strategic, high-demand metro areas with strong growth prospects, while achieving significant diversification benefits for DuPont Fabros' shareholders from the combination with Digital Realty's existing footprint of 145 properties across 33 global metropolitan areas.
Expands Hyper-Scale Product Offering:  DuPont Fabros' 12 purpose-built, in-service data centers will significantly expand Digital Realty's hyper-scale product offering and improve its ability to meet the rapidly growing needs of cloud and cloud-like customers, in addition to enterprise customers undertaking the shift to a hybrid cloud architecture.  Conversely, the transaction enables DuPont Fabros to address a broader set of customers' data center requirements, with the addition of Digital Realty's colocation and interconnection product offerings.
Solidifies Blue-Chip Customer Base:  DuPont Fabros' impressive roster of blue-chip customers will further enhance the credit quality of Digital Realty's existing customer base.  On a combined basis, investment grade or equivalent customers will represent more than 50% of total revenue.  The transaction also significantly reduces DuPont Fabros' customer concentration.  The combined company's top three customers will account for approximately 18% of revenue compared to 57% for the top three customers of DuPont Fabros on a standalone basis.
Development Pipeline Provides External Growth Potential:  DuPont Fabros' six data center development projects currently under construction are 48% pre-leased and represent a total expected investment of approximately $750 million, and amount to roughly a 26% expansion of its standalone critical load capacity.  These projects are located in Ashburn, Chicago, Santa Clara and Toronto, all metro areas where Digital Realty has an existing presence.  These six projects are expected to be delivered over the next 12 months, representing a solid pipeline of future growth potential.  In addition, DuPont Fabros owns strategic land holdings in Ashburn and Oregon, which will support the future delivery of up to 163 megawatts of incremental capacity, along with 56 acres of land recently acquired in Phoenix.
Size and Scale Generate Incremental Benefits:  The two companies' operating models are highly complementary, and the combined organization is expected to provide the most comprehensive product offering in the data center sector.  Given the enhanced size and scale, the combined company is also expected to have the most efficient cost structure and the highest EBITDA margin of any U.S.-based publicly-traded data center REIT. 
Creates Substantial Anticipated Cost Efficiencies and Financial Benefits:  The combination of the two companies is expected to create an opportunity to realize up to $18 million of annualized overhead savings, resulting from both companies' complementary business operations.  Upon closing, the transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to financial metrics, and is expected to further improve balance sheet strength.  
"This strategic and complementary transaction significantly enhances Digital Realty's ability to support the growth of hyper-scale users in the top U.S. data center metro areas, while providing meaningful customer and geographic diversification for DuPont Fabros," said A. William Stein, Digital Realty's Chief Executive Officer.  "The combination is expected to generate both operating and financial benefits, and I'd like to congratulate Scott Peterson, Mark Walker and their team on successfully negotiating the largest transaction in our company's history, a combination that we believe will enhance our ability to create significant long-term value for both sets of shareholders."  
"We are excited to deliver this compelling transaction to our shareholders and execute upon two of the strategic objectives embodied in our corporate vision – diversifying our customer base and expanding our geographic presence," said Christopher P. Eldredge, DuPont Fabros' President & Chief Executive Officer.  "As part of Digital Realty, our shareholders will continue to realize the benefits of our high-quality portfolio, with the added benefits of belonging to an even greater data center network with a truly global footprint and a well-diversified customer base.  We also believe our shareholders will greatly benefit from Digital Realty's investment grade balance sheet and more attractive cost of capital.  We look forward to working closely with the Digital Realty team over the coming months to close the transaction and bring our two companies together."  
Transaction Details
The fixed exchange ratio represents a total enterprise value of approximately $7.6 billion, including $1.6 billion of assumed debt and excluding transaction costs.  Digital Realty has obtained a fully committed bridge loan facility from BofA Merrill Lynch and Citigroup which will be available, if needed, to finance the transaction.  The debt assumed in the transaction is expected to be permanently refinanced with a combination of investment grade corporate bonds and other financings.  The transaction has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both Digital Realty and DuPont Fabros.  
The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2017 and is subject to the approval of DuPont Fabros and Digital Realty shareholders and other customary closing conditions.  
BofA Merrill Lynch and Citigroup are acting as financial advisors and Latham & Watkins LLP is acting as legal advisor to Digital Realty.  Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC is acting as financial advisor and Hogan Lovells US LLP is acting as legal advisor to DuPont Fabros.  
Investor Conference Call
The company will host a conference call to discuss the transaction at 8:30 a.m. EDT / 5:30 a.m. PDT on June 9, 2017, and a presentation has been posted to the Investors section of the company's website at http://investor.digitalrealty.com.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
