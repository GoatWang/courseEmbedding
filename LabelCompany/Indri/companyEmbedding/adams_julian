About   Julian Adams
I work in what might be seen as diametrically opposed craft disciplines but one which actually use very similar techniques. On the one hand I am an armourer, focussing mainly on medieval and creating work for re-enactors, colllectors and museums, using traditional materials and techniques. On the other hand I use titanium to make very wearable contemporary jewellery, some of which is inspired by the armour aesthetic and techniques.

Miniature English Armour
Made by Julian Adams
The current project is a 1/5th scale tableau of Richard III an four of his retinue in their final charge at the battle of Bosworth Everythng has been produced from the ground up – horses, clothing, knight models, leatherwork, embroidery and armour (many thanks to my wife, Jane, and daughter Kate for doing the work I couldn’t do!) The project is now nearing completion but will have taken eighteen months.






























 






Phaelera Brooch
Made by Julian Adams
A client saw the replica phaelera and asked if I could make this into a brooch for her. The centre stone is carnelian.






























 






Horse Phaelera
Made by Julian Adams
Jewry Wal museum in Licestr asked me to make a replica of a 1st century horse decoration called a phaelera. It had been found in a dig in Leicester in 1907 but was in too fragile a condition to be exhibited.  I cast the bronze and hammered it the formed the piece and pierced the horse heads. It was a complex and somewhat eperimental process.The replica is now used in their educational program.






























 






Miniature Horse Armour
Made by Julian Adams
This was comissined as a birthday present. It is approx half sized.






























 






Saddle Steel detail
Made by Julian Adams
A detail; the spiral on the saddle steel






























 






Saddle Steels
Made by Julian Adams
I don’t make saddles but on occasion I do make the steels for them. This is a fairly complex example.






























 






‘Little Blue’ Titanium Collar
Made by Julian Adams
The design for this was inspired by a ppiece of armour called a gorgette that protected the throat and upper chest. The colours are produced by an anodizing process usig high voltage electricity to create an oxide layer on the surface of the titanium.
‘Little Blue’ is, in fact, pink but is named after a n earlier and larger piece – Big Blue – made from blued steel. The name kind of stuck!






























 






Blued Steel Bowl
Made by Julian Adams
Smetimes armour was heat blued for decorative effect or as an adjunct process to mercury gilding. I use the same processes, shaping, hammering, blueing to make bowls and vessels. Each one is unique and the process is enhaced to increase the range of colours and patterns involved.






























 






Horse Armour detail
Made by Julian Adams
A detail from the Bosworth horse armour




































 






Horse Armour. Shaffron and Crinnet
Made by Julian Adams
This piece was comissioned for the Leicestershire Museums’ Service and is in the Batte Room at Bosworth Battlefield.
The model for his was a massive and very gentle Shire cross horse, by the name of Peter, who tolerated the various measuring and fitting sessions with very good grace – until he got bored and then just walked off…

		ADAMS' BONSAI
	

		Lynchburg, VA
	

		Welcome
	

		ADAMS' BONSAI is a hobby gone berserk. Julian R. Adams, proprietor of Adams' Bonsai, has been active in bonsai since receiving a gift bonsai in 1971. Beyond improving his own bonsai skills, Julian's primary interest is to make bonsai plants and supplies conveniently available to bonsai enthusiasts and to spread the word about this great art form. Adams' Bonsai was formed in 1984 to facilitate this interest. Julian writes extensively about bonsai via articles for English language bonsai publications and the Central Virginia Bonsai Society newsletter. In addition to shipped items, he offers bonsai plants, wire, and supplies for sale at periodic bonsai gatherings. Call to arrange for delivery at these events. As scheduling permits, Julian is available for lectures, demonstrations, and workshops. Phone and e-mail messages are normally returned promptly. Visitors are welcome by appointment.

Synopses & ReviewsPublisher CommentsImmediately upon the discovery some ten years ago that inhibition of the proteasome in cultured cells, mostly of tumor origin, caused the programmed cell death machinery to ramp up, it became imperative to investigate proteasome inhibition as a possible treatment for human cancers. In Proteasome Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy, Julian Adams, the leader in developing the field, brings together a panel of highly experienced academic and pharmaceutical investigators to take stock of the remarkable work that has been accomplished to date, and examine emerging therapeutic possibilities for proteasome inhibitors in cancer. The topics range from a discussion of the chemistry and cell biology of the proteasome and the rationale for proteasome inhibitors in cancer to a review of current clinical trials underway. The discussion of the very empirical and practical development of rationales to test proteasome inhibitors in cancer models covers the role of the proteasome in NF-kB activation, the combining of conventional chemotherapy and radiation with proteasome inhibition, notably PS-341, new proteasome methods of inhibiting viral maturation, and the role of proteasome inhibition in the treatment of AIDS. The authors also document the development of bortezomib (Velcade™) through multicentered clinical trials in patients with relapsed and refractory myeloma to FDA approval, and describe how modern pharmacogenomic tools can be used to predict which patients will respond to such proteasome inhibitor therapy. Additional chapters on the proteasome's basic biochemistry review its mechanism in the cell cycle and apoptosis and suggest opportunities for using proteasome inhibitors to find additional medicinal targets. Authoritative and illuminating, Proteasome Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy makes clear that proteasome inhibition should prove a fertile area for the many future discoveries that will provide relief of suffering and extend the quality of life of patients afflicted with cancer and other debilitating diseases.Review"Authoritative and illuminating...." - TumoriSynopsisA panel of leading academic and pharmaceutical investigators takes stock of the remarkable work that has been accomplished to date with proteasome inhibitors in cancer, and examines emerging therapeutic possibilities.

Review 
Recorded five days before Julian "Cannonball" Adderley's death, the title cut of this album was retitled and dedicated to the late altoist. The powerful baritonist Pepper Adams is well showcased with a quartet comprised of pianist Walter Norris, bassist George Mraz and drummer Makaya Ntshoko on three of his originals, one by Norris and two ("Three And One" and "'Tis") by Thad Jones. Adams is in typically excellent form, playing intense solos that push but stay within the boundaries of hard bop. ~ Scott Yanow, Rovi

Percy Lavon Julian  

 















Neal B. Abraham, DePauw UniversityPercy JulianPercy L. Julian (1899–1975) was an internationally acclaimed synthetic organic chemist. Only the third African American to receive a Ph.D. in chemistry, he specialized in the field of natural products chemistry, the identification of active chemical components of extracts from plants and the synthesis of those components in the laboratory from smaller molecules. This technology is very important for medicines, food products, paper, paints, and fire-fighting foams, among other things.Percy Julian was born in Montgomery on April 11, 1899, the first child of James Sumner Julian, a U.S. Postal Service railway clerk, and Elizabeth Lena Adams Julian. His grandparents were sharecroppers after Emancipation. As did his parents, he completed the allowed eight grades of public education available to African Americans in Alabama's segregated schools and then attended two years at the Lincoln Normal School, a teacher's college in Marion from which his parents also graduated, which later became Alabama State University.In 1916, he enrolled at DePauw University, in Greencastle, Indiana, having been referred by Joan Stuart, a teacher at the Lincoln Normal School who had taught both Julian and his parents. Welcoming Julian to DePauw was a junior student, Kenneth C. Hogate, whose father was Joan Stuart's friend; Hogate arranged room and board at the Sigma Percy Julian at DePauw UniversityChi fraternity house for Julian in exchange for his waiting on tables and stoking the furnace. Hogate later became long-time editor of the Wall Street Journal. Julian later recalled that his meeting with Hogate was the first time that he had been extended and shaken the hand of a white man.Because he had the equivalent of a 10th-grade education, Julian was enrolled as a "sub-freshman" for his first two years at DePauw, taking college courses by day and pre-college courses at night in the Indiana Asbury Academy (DePauw's prep school). After completing the pre-college courses, he decided to major in chemistry, though he had not seen a chemistry lab, except through the windows of the white high school in Montgomery, until he got to DePauw. During this time, Julian's father transferred to a position on the Pennsylvania line, which ran through Greencastle, and moved his family to Indiana. All of the five other Julian children would graduate from Greencastle High School and attend DePauw University and go on to achieve graduate and professional degrees.Julian found the atmosphere at DePauw generally supportive, although he did encounter racial prejudice from some professors and fellow students. He received his A.B. degree in 1920, graduating as a member of Phi Beta Kappa and as valedictorian. Despite the best efforts of his faculty mentors and his outstanding credentials, Percy Julian StampJulian was unable to gain admission to graduate school. Instead, he accepted a teaching position at Fisk University, where he continued to study chemistry by gaining access to the whites-only library at nearby Vanderbilt University with the help of DePauw graduate and Vanderbilt professor George Clark. In 1922 he enrolled at Harvard University with support of a special scholarship (an Austin Fellowship), receiving a master's degree in 1923, but his graduate mentors refused to let him enroll for a doctoral degree.From 1926-1927, he served as professor of chemistry at West Virginia State College in Institute, West Virginia, and then was appointed head of the Department of Chemistry at Howard University in Washington, D.C. There, Julian instituted reforms aimed at creating a strong research-based curriculum. In 1929, he received a Rockefeller Foundation Grant to study for the Ph.D. at the University of Vienna, becoming in 1931 only the third African American in the world to earn a Ph.D. in chemistry. He returned to Howard University, where he continued his curriculum reforms and finalized plans for a new chemistry building.In 1932, Julian returned to DePauw University with his fellow University of Vienna chemistry graduate, Dr. Josef Pikl, to launch a new research program in the synthesis of natural products, publishing 11 articles in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, many of them with student co-authors. Their laboratory efforts resulted in the first total synthesis of a natural product completed in the United States, that of physostigmine, an anti-glaucoma drug extracted from the calabar bean.Julian married his wife, Anna, on December 24, 1935. They settled in Oak Park, Illinois, and had two children, Percy Jr. and Faith.Julian left DePauw in 1936 to accept the position of Director of Research in the Soya Products Division of the Glidden Company in Chicago. During the next 18 years, his research led to more Percy Julianthan 160 publications and more than 100 patents. Among his many accomplishments were the synthesis of steroids and sex hormones and the production of commercially viable amounts of cortisone (an early pain-relieving treatment for otherwise crippling arthritis) and of a fire-fighting foam, many based on extracts from soybeans and yams. The remarkable part of his work is that through chemical means, he and his co-workers learned to produce human hormones and steroids from plant extracts.In 1954, he established the Julian Laboratories, which specialized in creating synthetic cortisone, which he later sold for $2.3 million to be a subsidiary of Smith, Kline and French Laboratories. In 1964, he organized Julian Associates, Inc., and the Julian Research Institute, through which he continued to do chemistry experiments and to provide advice to other chemical companies.Julian died on April 19, 1975, and was buried in Elm Lawn Cemetery in Elmhurst, Illinois.Julian received many awards and citations, including election to the National Academy of Sciences and the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In 1993, a stamp was issued in his honor by the U.S. Postal Service in its Black Heritage Series. In 2007, he was honored by a joint resolution of the House of Representatives and the Senate of the U.S. Congress. On February 6, 2007, PBS broadcast a two-hour special in his honor as part of the NOVA: Lives in Science series, which also included Galileo, Sir Isaac Newton, and Albert Einstein.

Adams Qprt Julian's Experience
Title: 
               Company: Infinity Pharmaceuticals Inc
Job Details
               Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (IPI) has developed a pipeline of product candidates for multiple cancer indications. The Company’s lead product candidate, retaspimycin hydrochloride (IPI-504) is an intravenously-administered small molecule inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Hsp90 is a central component of the cellular chaperone system, which supports and stabilizes cancer-causing proteins, such as c-Kit, EGFR, and HER2, enabling multiple forms of cancer to thrive. Inhibition of the Hsp90 chaperone knocks out this critical source of support for cancer cells, leading to tumor growth inhibition and cancer cell death. In October 2008, the commenced an international Phase III registration study of IPI-504 in patients with refractory gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), based on the activity and safety data from a Phase I trial reported during the year ended December 31, 2008.(Source: 10-K)

Pepper AdamsEnjaEnja (label)Jazz (CD, LP) 




                    A great quartet date – nice and laidback, with plenty of room for Pepper Adams to open up on his deep-toned baritone sax!  The group features Walter Norris on piano – and titles include "Ad Astra", "Jirge", "Spacemaker", and "Three & One". (Out of print.)  © 1996-2017, Dusty Groove, Inc. 




Additional Marks & Notes

    If something is noteworthy, we try to note it in the comments — especially
    if it is an oddity that is the only wrong thing about the record.
    This might include, but isn't limited to, warped records, tracks that skip,
    cover damage or wear as noted above, or strictly cosmetic flaws.




Used CD Grade

    We have only one grade for non-new CDs at Dusty Groove — "Used CD".
    This grade is somewhat all-encompassing, but we choose it because we try to offer
    Used CDs in the best shape possible. All of our Used CDs are guaranteed to play
    without skipping or flaws. If you purchase a Used CD from Dusty Groove,
    you have 1 week to play it to determine that it plays correctly — and if it does not,
    then you may return it for a full refund.


    With our Used CDs, you can expect the disc to be free of all but the lightest of
    surface marks — clean, and not dirty at all.  You can also expect the case to be
    clean (we often change the cases ourselves — putting fresh cases on Used CDs we
    handle) — and you can expect the booklet to be in good shape, unless noted
    otherwise. We will list any specific details/defects underneath the item — so
    look for notes on cutout marks in the case, stamps on the barcode, or details like that.

Later live work from Dizzy Gillespie – working in London here with a very hip ensemble!
