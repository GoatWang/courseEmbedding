IRS Annual Filing Season Program Participant




This individual is a participant in the IRS's voluntary tax preparer program, which generally includes the passage of an annual testing requirement (1) and the completion of a significant number of hours of continuing education. Preparers satisfying these educational requirements and agreeing to abide by the IRS's rules are allowed to represent clients whose returns they prepared and signed, but only before revenue agents, customer service representatives, and similar IRS employees, including the Taxpayer Advocate Service. This extremely important privilege is not extended to tax preparers who are not attorneys, certified public accountants, or enrolled agents. To be eligible, tax preparers must complete the AFSP requirement every tax year.
(1) In states that have their own program; the annual testing requirement is waived.
