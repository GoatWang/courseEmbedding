JOHN R. HACKETT Jr., Ph.D.




Areas of Expertise: safety of the blood supply, infectious disease, disease surveillance, emerging pathogens and outbreaks, Zika virus, diagnostic testing, virus hunting, blood screening, blood donation, HIV testing, hepatitis testing.
John Hackett is divisional vice president of Applied Research and Technology for Abbott's diagnostics business. In this role, he manages diagnostics R&D in the areas of infectious diseases, oncology, cardiovascular, blood screening, biologics design and discovery, and clinical chemistry.
John is responsible for managing Abbott’s Global Surveillance Program, which was established two decades ago to detect and actively monitor emerging HIV and hepatitis strains around the world. The Surveillance Program houses more than 60,000 HIV and hepatitis specimens, making it one of the largest libraries in the world. If a new strain is discovered, Abbott’s scientists check that the current blood screening and diagnostic tests are able to detect it.
John also manages a multi-year collaboration between Abbott and the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), the UCSF-Abbott Viral Diagnostics and Discovery Center (VDDC). The VDDC uses deep sequencing and ultra-rapid pathogen identification technologies to identify and characterize novel human viruses – to help safeguard public health against these potential threats.
John has several product patents to his name, having spent his career helping to keep Abbott one step ahead of these evolving viruses. He joined Abbott in 1992, was inducted into Abbott's Volwiler Society as an Associate Research Fellow in 1999, promoted to Research Fellow in 2005, and Senior Research Fellow in 2012.
He received his Ph.D. in immunology from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas and completed his postdoctoral training at the University of Chicago.
John is a member of the International Society of Blood Transfusion, Industry Liaison Forum for the International AIDS Society, and serves on the Executive Council of the Autumn Immunology Conference.

Item Description: New York, 1985, Watts, first US edition, hardbound in dust jacket, Fine/Fine condition, 6x9, 276 pages, numerous illus & maps, notes, bibliog, glossary, index. Operation MARKET GARDEN, the bold Allied attempt in 1944 to seize three major river crossings including the bridge over the Rhine at Arnhem, remains one of the most controversial operations of the Twentieth Century. Thus it is no surprise that it has been extensively written up by historians and soldiers alike. Of the many published accounts none has been more widely acclaimed than The Devil's Birthday, first published in 1984, and it is no coincidence that its Author, Colonel Geoffrey Powell MC, is both a distinguished historian and a veteran of the battle.The operation may have failed but the feats of arms by the three airborne divisions involved (the US 83rd and 101st and the British 1st Airborne) were, and will forever remain, legendary. The contribution of the Dutch civilians too was, as this book describes, truly remarkable, as was the great gallantry of the Polish troops involved. The Germans also emerge with credit; there was considerable mutual respect born from the bitter fighting.As well as being a graphic and accurate account of the action, The Devil's Birthday pulls no punches in describing how over-ambitious and flawed planning, inter-allied rivalry, human error and sheer bad luck all had disastrous consequences.

Herakleides, whose name originally was Herakleon until Acta.t. P--lo changed by St. Paul, was converted to the faith at Kition Oiietm, the first visit of the two Apostles to Cyprus. Barnabas is said to have met hiin again on his second visit,2 when he consecrated him bishop of the island and placed him over the church of Actggjiict. Tamasos. In the life of Auxibios, Bishop of Soli, it is stated that Barnabas found him presiding over the diocese of Salamis on his return. Le Quien places him third on the list of Arch-i.(jtii.n, o.o., bishops of Cyprus, as well as first among the Bishops ofw. Tamasos. Lusignan calls him Heraclio and does not mentiona8 his occupation of the See of Salamis, but says that he was Bishop of Tamasos, where he was martyred.3 Kyprianos Kjjtluio., further adds that his memory was celebrated on the same day (17th Sept.), with that of another occupant of the See, Myron. According to the Synaxarion contained in the local office ofor. Excerpta the saint, in which he is called Herakleidios, he was the son of a heathen priest named Hierokleos. It was at the village of Lampatiston that the two Apostles are said to have first met him. His father seeing that they were strangers offered them hospitality, as was his wont. Though they refused his invitation, being unwilling to eat with one who ministered at an idol shrine, they requested him to furnish them with a guide to direct them on their journey. Herakleides was accordingly sent by his father to show them the way.  Bookseller Inventory # AAV9781230365282

Fii martirizato in quella citta. 5 E/j xP10 Nyvov f Spiral To nvrin Tow, Ka i) ayia aiirov Kef pa. the successor of Sosthenes in the See of Colophon in Lydia.1 The Menology commemorates him on 9th December. Herakleides, whose name originally was Herakleon until Acta.t. P--lo changed by St. Paul, was converted to the faith at Kition Oiietm, the first visit of the two Apostles to Cyprus. Barnabas is said to have met hiin again on his second visit,2 when he consecrated him bishop of the island and placed him over the church of Actggjiict. Tamasos. In the life of Auxibios, Bishop of Soli, it is stated that Barnabas found him presiding over the diocese of Salamis on his return. Le Quien places him third on the list of Arch-i.(jtii.n, o.o., bishops of Cyprus, as well as first among the Bishops ofw. Tamasos. Lusignan calls him Heraclio and does not mentiona8 his occupation of the See of Salamis, but says that he was Bishop of Tamasos, where he was martyred.3 Kyprianos Kjjtluio., further adds that his memory was celebrated on the same day (17th Sept.), with that of another occupant of the See, Myron. According to the Synaxarion contained in the local office ofor. Excerpta the saint, in which he is called Herakleidios, he was the son of a heathen priest named Hierokleos. It was at the village of Lampatiston that the two Apostles are said to have first met him. His father seeing that they were strangers offered them hospitality, as was his wont. Though they refused his invitation, being unwilling to eat with one who ministered at an idol shrine, they requested him to furnish them with a guide to direct them on their journey. Herakleides was accordingly sent by his father to show them the way.  Bookseller Inventory # AAV9781230365282
