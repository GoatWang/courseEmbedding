                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time.

                                            We wish Todd and his family all best. No one can control the markets and for 13 years he did an amazing job for us. These bloodthirsty lawyers will stop at nothing to tarnish his name for their own gain.

I get better service from 7-11. Their transactions take days and days to post, meanwhile their system tells you you have money you can use....show more

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report.

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?

Job Details
               At Norandex/Reynolds, we recognize that to be a leading manufacturer and distributor of exterior building products we can't simply rest on our reputation. So we constantly search out new and innovative ways to improve the quality of our products, and the level of service we offer our customers. Our strategic direction has not changed since we opened our doors in 1946, and it continues to drive our business. Professional builders and remodelers around the country turn to us with confidence for performance products used in residential and light commercial applications. In fact, one of every ten homes with vinyl siding on the exterior features a Norandex/Reynolds product. And we're growing stronger every day! To ensure our product quality attains the highest standards of performance and reliability we measure our manufacturing process against tough international standards. The Norandex/Reynolds production cycle has been thoroughly audited by Underwriters Laboratories, and has been registered to be in compliance with ISO 9001-2000 International Standards. To earn the impressive UL mark as an ISO 9001-2000 Registered Firm requires continuous and uninterrupted conformance to specified procedures and systems. It is the most thorough and respected quality standard in the world. Norandex/Reynolds siding products also proudly carry another symbol of quality that has been around for over a century,the GOOD HOUSEKEEPING Seal. Consumers immediately recognize it as the most trusted hallmark of quality and confidence any brand can attain. In fact, Norandex/Reynolds is the ONLY manufacturer of vinyl siding to offer both ISO 9001-2000 Quality Standards Registration through Underwriters Laboratories and the GOOD HOUSEKEEPING Seal. With upwards of 160 distribution branches nationwide, America's top builders, contractors and remodelers turn to Norandex/Reynolds because it's a brand they trust and a company they count on for support. It's a partnership built on mutual success that has been growing for more than half a century. Each of our branches stock and supply a wide range of products for new construction, remodeling and light commercial applications including windows, doors, storm products, shutters, vinyl fence, deck and rail, and a complete selection of accent products.
