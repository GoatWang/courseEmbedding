Once our system selects a partner, we pass the information about the quote request to this partner automatically. The partner will carry out a matching process to determine the most suitable contractors for your project. The matching process depends on many factors including but not limited to the request quote project description determined by the user answers to our form various questions (e.g. install or repair windows).
Your quote request usually will be matched to 1-4 contractors. In some cases, the partner will not be able to match your quote with any partner.


Communication After Quote Request Submission
Once the matching process has been carried out, the partner and/or matched contractors will attempt to call or email you. The purpose of the communication is to inform you of who you have been matched to, discuss your project and discuss their service cost. In addition, the partner may utilize such information for marketing purposes, including to contact you about your request and other services that they believe may be of interest to you. solarsystems.zone will not attempt to carry out any sort of communication with the individuals who submit quote request since our partner companies will carry out the communication including but not limited to an email confirmation after quote request submission.

Best brands of solar panels
To find the best brands of solar panels you can use America's most trusterd solar panel comparison and reviews website, SolarReviews.
However, reviews of solar panels can be a bit meaningless because most consumer owners have not had any issues and so whilst solar company reviews are very important when choosing solar installers they are of less use when choosing solar panels.
For more information to help you make an informed decision about this topic, I would recommend this article about buying solar panels.

How much electricity will solar panels produce in California
Solar panels produce different amounts of energy in different locations.
Around the Sacramento area solar panels installed on a south facing 29 degree pitch roof will typically produce:
1,550 kWh per year per 1kw of peak DC (direct current) capacity
For more information about how your location, roof direction and roof tilt affects solar power production use the solar panels calculator and enter your address below.









What rebates, solar tax credits and other solar incentives are available in California
What solar incentives and tax credits are available in California?
The main incentives to install solar in California is the 30% federal solar tax credit and the net metering law.
The upfront utility based incentives from each of the main publically owned utilities are now exhausted for residential customers and almost exhausted for commercial customers.
However, the investment case for buying solar panels for your home has never been stronger because reductions in the price of solar systems has more than compensated for the loss of some upfront rebates.
 

 
Net Metering in California
The California Public Utility Commission voted by a narrow majority of 3 to 2 to extend the ability of residential energy customers in California to be credited with full retail rates for excess solar power that they generate and feed back into the grid at times when the electrical loads in their house are less than their solar production.
Whilst this didn't affect people that had already had installed solar panels on their homes in California it was a massive win for the millions of Californian homeowners who are yet to install the solar panels.
The reason net metering law is so important is that solar systems by their nature produce most power in the middle of the day when most homeowners are at work and using little power.
This is a very generous incentive and should not be taken for granted.
It means you can now install solar panels and sign a contract with your utility (known as a net metering agreement) where the utility guarantees to pay you a retail rate for exported solar power, usually for 10 or 15 years.
Each of the major utilities may offer slightly different net metering contracts but they are similar in nature.
To see more visit www.cpuc.ca.gov/General.aspx?id=3800
 

 
Is a purchase, lease or PPA agreement best?
Generally speaking you will make the largest savings over time if you purchase your solar panels outright yourself (whether you use cash you have at hand or finance secured against your home).
 However this is not always the case.
If you are in a position where you do not have a federal income tax liability then you will not be able to take advantage of the 30% federal solar tax credit.
In this case you may be better off with a third party owned solar lease where the solar company retains the right to this tax credit.
 

 
What is the payback period from installing solar panels in California?
The payback period from installing solar panels in California is usually between 4 and 8 years depending on the size of the system, the brand of solar panels you buy, the amount you were previously paying for power and whether you lease or buy your system.
This represents an excellent low risk investment.
 

 
Why analysis of solar savings and payback periods can be difficult in California
As California has net metering then the value of a solar power system is simply the annual production multiplied by the rate for power.
However, working this out can be difficult for two reasons.
Firstly for people on time of use metering the value power value changes with the time of day that the solar power is generated.
The second issue relates to the tiered rates of power prices.
With most utilities the amount you are charged for power increases as your usage increases.

Technology[edit]
Ascent Solar's thin-film solar modules are manufactured from CIGS cells using copper indium gallium (di)selenide semiconductor (CIGS), which has shown a 10.5% NREL efficiency in real-world conditions. What makes this proprietary technology unique, however, is its relative size, weight and flexibility: Ascent's CIGS panels currently allow for 85 watts/meter, and 48 watts/kg, thereby giving them the greatest power density and weight ratio among available flexible photovoltaic products[2] by a significant margin. This allows for the efficient use of solar power in a range of new contexts, in which size or weight restrictions have previously rendered solar power impracticable: e.g., cell phones, airplanes, unmanned vehicles, consumer electronics, railways, space programs, and off-grid applications. This developing technology was selected as one of the 100 Most Innovative Technologies for 2010 by R&D Magazine,[3] and as one of the 50 Best Inventions of 2011 by Time Magazine.[4]
Market history[edit]
Ascent Solar entered the manufacturing stage for its products in 2013, in part by teaming up with a range of other companies like TFG Radiant (for integrating these materials into a range of building and construction materials), Foxconn (for a "pilot project" at the Zhengzhou Factory, which is currently manufacturing the iPhone 5),[5] and Bye Aerospace (for solar-powered unmanned aircraft).[6]
It has also launched in 2013 the Enerplex brand. EnerPlex represents the consumer side of Ascent Solar, integrating Ascent’s transformational CIGS technology into products which consumers use every day. Through EnerPlex, Ascent has pivoted into the consumer space with the aim to put solar in the hands of every consumer.
EnerPlex[edit]
EnerPlex is a brand of solar and electronic consumer products launched by Ascent Solar, Inc.[7] EnerPlex products utilizes Ascent Solar’s leading edge CIGS solar technology to bring solar charging solutions to remote and unprecedented places. Unlike traditional glass backed panels, the panels integrated into all EnerPlex products are rugged, lightweight and flexible, monolithically integrated on plastic (not glass) substrate; providing limitless possibilities for innovation.
Its product line ranges from smart phone chargers to other consumer products. Its latest product is the Kickr IV, a less than 12 ounces solar charger equipped with a standard USB port that can charge a wide variety of portable electronic devices from rechargeable batteries, to tablets, phones, GPS, digital cameras, eReaders and portable music players, charging them as fast as if they were plugged into an outlet.
Corporate history[edit]
Ascent Solar was founded in 2005 by ITN Energy Systems, a company engaged in commercializing emerging energy technologies through spin-offs and joint ventures.[8] During the first few years of operation, its primary focus was to research the CIGS thin-film technology as well as researching efficient methods for manufacturing.[9][needs update]
On July 18, 2006, Ascent completed its IPO, releasing 3,000,000 shares at 5.50 USD per share.[10] In June 2007, Norsk Hydro ASA, a Norwegian based supplier of aluminum products, entered into a deal with Ascent whereby it purchased 23% of Ascent shares with the option to increase that stake to up to 35%, which it did on October 7, 2008. On September 22, 2008, Ascent's then CEO, Matthew Foster, stepped down from his position. His reason for doing so was cited as an agreement between him and the company as the company changed from research-driven to production-driven. He will remain with Ascent as a consultant for an additional year after his retirement date.[11] On March 11, 2009, Ascent Solar commenced regular production at their facility in Colorado. The company began with a one-shift production schedule.

Technology[edit]
Ascent Solar's thin-film solar modules are manufactured from CIGS cells using copper indium gallium (di)selenide semiconductor (CIGS), which has shown a 10.5% NREL efficiency in real-world conditions. What makes this proprietary technology unique, however, is its relative size, weight and flexibility: Ascent's CIGS panels currently allow for 85 watts/meter, and 48 watts/kg, thereby giving them the greatest power density and weight ratio among available flexible photovoltaic products[2] by a significant margin. This allows for the efficient use of solar power in a range of new contexts, in which size or weight restrictions have previously rendered solar power impracticable: e.g., cell phones, airplanes, unmanned vehicles, consumer electronics, railways, space programs, and off-grid applications. This developing technology was selected as one of the 100 Most Innovative Technologies for 2010 by R&D Magazine,[3] and as one of the 50 Best Inventions of 2011 by Time Magazine.[4]
Market history[edit]
Ascent Solar entered the manufacturing stage for its products in 2013, in part by teaming up with a range of other companies like TFG Radiant (for integrating these materials into a range of building and construction materials), Foxconn (for a "pilot project" at the Zhengzhou Factory, which is currently manufacturing the iPhone 5),[5] and Bye Aerospace (for solar-powered unmanned aircraft).[6]
It has also launched in 2013 the Enerplex brand. EnerPlex represents the consumer side of Ascent Solar, integrating Ascent’s transformational CIGS technology into products which consumers use every day. Through EnerPlex, Ascent has pivoted into the consumer space with the aim to put solar in the hands of every consumer.
EnerPlex[edit]
EnerPlex is a brand of solar and electronic consumer products launched by Ascent Solar, Inc.[7] EnerPlex products utilizes Ascent Solar’s leading edge CIGS solar technology to bring solar charging solutions to remote and unprecedented places. Unlike traditional glass backed panels, the panels integrated into all EnerPlex products are rugged, lightweight and flexible, monolithically integrated on plastic (not glass) substrate; providing limitless possibilities for innovation.
Its product line ranges from smart phone chargers to other consumer products. Its latest product is the Kickr IV, a less than 12 ounces solar charger equipped with a standard USB port that can charge a wide variety of portable electronic devices from rechargeable batteries, to tablets, phones, GPS, digital cameras, eReaders and portable music players, charging them as fast as if they were plugged into an outlet.
Corporate history[edit]
Ascent Solar was founded in 2005 by ITN Energy Systems, a company engaged in commercializing emerging energy technologies through spin-offs and joint ventures.[8] During the first few years of operation, its primary focus was to research the CIGS thin-film technology as well as researching efficient methods for manufacturing.[9][needs update]
On July 18, 2006, Ascent completed its IPO, releasing 3,000,000 shares at 5.50 USD per share.[10] In June 2007, Norsk Hydro ASA, a Norwegian based supplier of aluminum products, entered into a deal with Ascent whereby it purchased 23% of Ascent shares with the option to increase that stake to up to 35%, which it did on October 7, 2008. On September 22, 2008, Ascent's then CEO, Matthew Foster, stepped down from his position. His reason for doing so was cited as an agreement between him and the company as the company changed from research-driven to production-driven. He will remain with Ascent as a consultant for an additional year after his retirement date.[11] On March 11, 2009, Ascent Solar commenced regular production at their facility in Colorado. The company began with a one-shift production schedule.

Ascent Solar Delivers First Shipment of A Major Contract to Supply High-Voltage Superlight Thin-Film Modules for High Altitude Aerospace Application 








July 25, 2017










































THORNTON, CO--(Marketwired - Jul 25, 2017) - Ascent Solar Technologies, Inc. (
  
   OTCQB
  : 
  
   ASTI
  ), a developer and manufacturer of state-of-the-art, lightweight, and flexible thin-film photovoltaic (PV) solutions, announces that the Company has successfully delivered the first shipment of the major contract on June 26, 2017 pursuant to announcement made on January 19, 2017.
The first shipment, represents approximately 21% of the total contract size, was delayed from the original scheduled shipment date at the request of our customer due to delays in their project schedule. The shipment is now completed, successfully tested and accepted by customer. We are now waiting for customer's revised shipment schedule for the remainder of the contract, which is expected to occur in first quarter of 2018.
Dr. Joseph Armstrong, Founder and Chief Technology Officer of Ascent Solar said, "We have noted previously that Ascent's thin-film CIGS PV technology produces modules with the highest power-to-weight ratio, and this characteristic is incredibly important especially for aerospace, near-space, and space applications. We were able to provide the customer with a unique modular product that is designed to reduce part count significantly over our competition, while providing the ability and flexibility to integrate the modules into different form factors for different applications as their product evolves."
"This contract is by far the single largest PV sales contract in the corporate history of Ascent Solar, and the first ever large shipment of such customized high-voltage superlight thin-film for high altitude application," said Victor Lee, CEO and President of Ascent Solar Technologies, Inc. "The contract is not only significant in value but also underscores the power of Ascent's proprietary technology to address these rapidly emerging and growing premium PV markets. We hope that this contract is only the 'tip of the iceberg' as the project, if successfully launched, is expected to be rolled out on a much larger scale in the future."
ABOUT ASCENT SOLAR TECHNOLOGIES, INC:[Native Advertisement] Ascent Solar Technologies, Inc., an ISO 9001-2015 certified company, is a developer of thin-film photovoltaic modules using flexible substrate materials that are more versatile and rugged than traditional solar panels. Ascent Solar modules were named as one of the top 100 technologies in both 2010 and 2015 by R&D Magazine, and one of TIME Magazine's 50 best inventions for 2011. The technology described above represents the cutting edge of flexible power and can be directly integrated into consumer products and off-grid applications, as well as other aerospace applications. Ascent Solar is headquartered in Thornton, Colorado. More information can be found at www.AscentSolar.com.

Ascent Solar adds renowned scientist Miguel Contreras as director of process engineeringThursday July 13, 2017   0 comments  Tags: Thornton, Ascent Solar Technologies, Miguel Contreras, Joseph Armstrong, Victor Lee 
THORNTON -- Ascent Solar Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: ASTI), a developer and manufacturer of state-of-the-art, lightweight and flexible thin-film photovoltaic (PV) solutions, announced world-renowned scientist Dr. Miguel Contreras has joined the Ascent Solar team as director of process engineering, reporting directly to Ascent’s chief technology officer.
Contreras, formerly a senior scientist at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), was a key member of the team that achieved the world-record conversion efficiency of 20% with CIGS solar cells.
Throughout his career with NREL, Contreras has produced several world-record energy conversion efficiencies and holds 7 U.S. patents in this field. He has extensive experience in all facets of solar cell and PV module fabrication, both front and back end, and has worked with nearly all types of CIGS (copper-indium-gallium-diselenide) technology, manufacturers and researchers dating back to the early 1990's.
Contreras holds an M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ph.D. in Materials Science from the Colorado School of Mines.
"We are very fortunate to bring Miguel into the Ascent family," said Dr. Joseph Armstrong, Ascent Solar’s CTO and founder. "The PV world is relatively small, and we have worked with Miguel for nearly three decades. He brings his expertise and world-record efficiency credentials in CIGS technology to Ascent, which is the first company to have brought monolithically-integrated flexible CIGS to production.
“His extensive background in deposition processes and equipment design and development further solidifies our existing team's prominence. His most recent work, on high specific power PV solutions, is aligned well with the core technologies at ASTI.
“Miguel will oversee our outstanding process engineering team, and brings his highly experienced perspective to many manufacturing challenges faced by CIGS companies. In conjunction with ongoing activities in R&D, Miguel will also implement improvements in module performance for a wide range of commercial applications, including the environments faced by military and aerospace applications.
“Ascent Solar now boasts well over 150 years of CIGS and related thin film PV expertise."
"I am excited to be joining Ascent Solar, the undisputed leader in light-weight flexible and monolithically integrated CIGS PV solutions,” said Contreras.
“I look forward to using my expertise to advance Ascent's products, processes and business. Ascent's product line already is quite remarkable and I'm encouraged that it is amenable to very large scale production. Lastly, I am looking forward to working with the team which includes colleagues from past years.
“I am very excited about the possibilities and the future with Ascent Solar."
"We are pleased and excited to have Miguel joining Ascent Solar,” said Victor Lee, Ascent’s president and CEO.
“His addition to our existing formidable technical and engineering teams comes at a perfect time as we have recently secured a significant funding commitment from a strategic investor, enabling us to renew our emphasis on process improvement and cost reduction.
"Miguel will bring his extensive experience in CIGS and related thin film processes, as well as materials science technology, to further enhance Ascent Solar's unparalleled technical expertise in the field of flexible CIGS technology.
“The addition of Miguel will enable our continued performance improvement and provide added ability for Ascent Solar to expand into various new markets. Miguel will also be a key member of our team to expand our manufacturing expertise overseas in partnership with our strategic investor."

THORNTON, CO, Jul 11, 2017 (Marketwired via COMTEX) -- THORNTON, CO--(Marketwired - Jul 11, 2017) -  Ascent Solar Technologies, Inc. (otcqb:ASTI), a developer and manufacturer of state-of-the-art, lightweight and flexible thin-film photovoltaic (PV) solutions, announced today that world-renowned scientist Dr. Miguel Contreras has joined the Ascent Solar team effective July 10, 2017 as the Director of Process Engineering reporting directly to the Chief Technology Officer (CTO).  Dr. Contreras, formerly a Senior Scientist at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), was a key member of the team that achieved the world-record conversion efficiency of 20% with CIGS solar cells. Throughout his career with NREL, Dr. Contreras has produced several world-record energy conversion efficiencies and holds 7 U.S. patents in this field. He has extensive experience in all facets of solar cell and PV module fabrication, both front and back end, and has worked with nearly all types of CIGS (copper-indium-gallium-diselenide) technology, manufacturers and researchers dating back to the early 1990's. Dr. Contreras holds a M.S. Degree in Electrical Engineering from University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ph.D. in Materials Science from the Colorado School of Mines.  "We are very fortunate to bring Miguel into the Ascent family," stated Dr. Joseph Armstrong, CTO and Founder of Ascent Solar. "The PV world is relatively small, and we have worked with Miguel for nearly three decades. He brings his expertise and world-record efficiency credentials in CIGS technology to Ascent, which is the first company to have brought monolithically-integrated flexible CIGS to production. His extensive background in deposition processes and equipment design and development further solidifies our existing team's prominence. His most recent work, on high specific power PV solutions, is aligned well with the core technologies at ASTI. Miguel will oversee our outstanding process engineering team, and brings his highly experienced perspective to many manufacturing challenges faced by CIGS companies. In conjunction with ongoing activities in R&D, Miguel will also implement improvements in module performance for a wide range of commercial applications, including the environments faced by military and aerospace applications. Ascent Solar now boasts well over 150 years of CIGS and related thin film PV expertise."  Dr. Contreras said, "I am excited to be joining Ascent Solar, the undisputed leader in light-weight flexible and monolithically integrated CIGS PV solutions. I look forward to using my expertise to advance Ascent's products, processes and business. Ascent's product line already is quite remarkable and I'm encouraged that it is amenable to very large scale production. Lastly, I am looking forward to working with the team which includes colleagues from past years. I am very excited about the possibilities and the future with Ascent Solar."  Mr. Victor Lee, President & CEO of Ascent Solar, said, "We are pleased and excited to have Miguel joining Ascent Solar. His addition to our existing formidable technical and engineering teams comes at a perfect time as we have recently secured a significant funding commitment from a strategic investor, enabling us to renew our emphasis on process improvement and cost reduction." Mr. Lee continued, "Miguel will bring his extensive experience in CIGS and related thin film processes, as well as materials science technology, to further enhance Ascent Solar's unparalleled technical expertise in the field of flexible CIGS technology. The addition of Miguel will enable our continued performance improvement and provide added ability for Ascent Solar to expand into various new markets. Miguel will also be a key member of our team to expand our manufacturing expertise overseas in partnership with our strategic investor."

The matching process depends on many factors including but not limited to the request quote project description determined by the user answers to our form various questions (e.g. install or repair windows).
Your quote request usually will be matched to 1-4 contractors. In some cases, the partner will not be able to match your quote with any partner.


Communication After Quote Request Submission
Once the matching process has been carried out, the partner and/or matched contractors will attempt to call or email you. The purpose of the communication is to inform you of who you have been matched to, discuss your project and discuss their service cost. In addition, the partner may utilize such information for marketing purposes, including to contact you about your request and other services that they believe may be of interest to you. solarsystems.zone will not attempt to carry out any sort of communication with the individuals who submit quote request since our partner companies will carry out the communication including but not limited to an email confirmation after quote request submission.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
