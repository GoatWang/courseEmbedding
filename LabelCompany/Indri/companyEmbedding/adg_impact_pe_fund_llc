What is 'Private Equity'
Private equity is capital that is not noted on a public exchange. Private equity is composed of funds and investors that directly invest in private companies, or that engage in buyouts of public companies, resulting in the delisting of public equity. Institutional and retail investors provide the capital for private equity, and the capital can be utilized to fund new technology, make acquisitions, expand working capital, and to bolster and solidify a balance sheet.

BREAKING DOWN 'Private Equity'
Private equity comes primarily from institutional investors and accredited investors, who can dedicate substantial sums of money for extended time periods. In most cases, considerably long holding periods are often required for private equity investments, in order to ensure a turnaround for distressed companies or to enable liquidity events such as an initial public offering (IPO) or a sale to a public company.
Since the 1970s, the private equity market has strengthened readily. Pools of funds are sometimes created by private equity firms in order to privatize extra-large companies. A significant number of private equity firms perform actions known as leveraged buyouts (LBOs). Through LBOs, substantial amounts of money are provided in order to finance large purchases. After this transaction, private equity firms attempt to improve the prospects, profits and overall financial health of the company, with the ultimate goal being a resale of the company to a different firm or cashing out through an IPO.
Fees and Profits
The fee structure for private equity firms typically varies, but usually includes a management fee and a performance fee. Certain firms charge a 2% management fee annually on managed assets and require 20% of the profits gained from the sale of a company.
Positions in a private equity firm are highly sought after, and for good reason. For example, consider a firm has $1 billion in assets under management (AUM). This firm, like the majority of private equity firms, is likely to have no more than two dozen investment professionals. The 20% of gross profits generates millions in firm fees, so some of the leading players in the investment industry are attracted to positions in such firms. At a mid-market level of $50 million to $500 million in deal values, associate positions are likely to bring a salary in the low six figures. A vice president at such a firm would stand to earn something close to $500,000, while a principal could earn more than $1 million.
Transparency
Beginning in 2015, a call was issued for more transparency in the private equity industry, due largely to the amount of income, earnings and sky-high salaries earned by employees at nearly all private equity firms. As of 2016, a limited number of states have pushed for bills and regulations allowing for a bigger window into the inner workings of private equity firms. However, lawmakers on Capitol Hill are pushing back, asking for limitations on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) access to information.

Hedge Funds: Conclusion













By Dan Barufaldi
Structurally, a hedge fund has some similarities to a mutual fund. For example, just like a mutual fund, a hedge fund is a pooled investment vehicle that makes investments in equities, bonds, options and a variety of other securities. It can also be run by a separate manager, much like a sub-advisor runs a mutual fund that is distributed by a large mutual fund company. That, however, is basically where the similarities end. The range of investment strategies available to hedge funds and the types of positions they can take are quite broad and in many cases, very complex. We will focus on specific strategies later in this tutorial, so for now we'll focus on how hedge funds are structured.
Organizational StructureThe typical hedge fund structure is really a two-tiered organization. Figure 1: Hedge Fund Organizational Structure Source: Investopedia, 2009. The general/limited partnership model is the most common structure for the pool of investment funds that make up a hedge fund. In this structure, the general partner assumes responsibility for the operations of the fund, while limited partners can make investments into the partnership and are liable only for their paid-in amounts. As a rule, a general/limited partnership must have at least one GP and one LP, but can have multiple GPs and many LPs. There is an SEC rule, however, that generally limits investors to 99 in order to be excluded from SEC registration. (Learn more about the SEC in Policing The Securities Market: An Overview Of The SEC.)The second component of the two-tiered structure is the structure of the general partnership. The typical structure used for the general partner is a limited liability company. An LLC is very similar to a subchapter S corporation in that it is a flow-through tax entity and investors are limited in liability to the amount of their investment. The general partner's responsibility is to market and manage the fund, and perform any functions necessary in the normal course of business, including hiring a fund manager (oftentimes a related company) and managing the administration of the fund's operations.Fee StructureHedge funds also differ quite radically from mutual funds in how they charge fees. Their fee structure is one of the main reasons why talented money managers decide to open their own hedge funds to begin with. Not only are the fees paid by investors higher than they are for mutual funds, they include some additional fees that mutual funds don't even charge.Management FeeThe management fee for a hedge fund is for the same service that the management fee covers in mutual funds. The difference is that hedge funds typically charge a management fee of 2% of assets managed – and in some cases even higher, if the manager is in high demand and has had a very good track record. This fee alone makes managing a hedge fund attractive, but it is the next fee that really makes it a profitable endeavor for good fund managers.Incentive FeeMost if not all hedge funds charge an incentive fee of anywhere between 10-20% of fund profits, and some hedge funds have even gone as high as 50%. The idea of the incentive fee is to reward the hedge fund manager for good performance, and if the fund's performance is attractive enough, investors are willing to pay this fee. For example, if a hedge fund manager generates a 20% return per year, after management fee, the hedge fund manager will collect 4% of those profits, leaving the investor with a 16% net return. In many cases, this is an attractive return despite the high incentive fee, but with more mediocre managers entering the industry in search of fortune, investors have more often than not been disappointed with net returns on many funds.There is one caveat to the incentive fee, however. A manager only collects an incentive fee for profits exceeding the fund's previous high, called a high-water mark. This means that if a fund loses 5% from its previous high, the manager will not collect an incentive fee until he or she has first made up the 5% loss. In addition, some managers must clear a hurdle rate, such as the return on U.S. Treasuries, before they collect any incentive fees.Hedge funds often follow the so-called "two and twenty" structure – where managers receive 2% of net asset value managed and 20% of profits, though as mentioned, these fees can vary among hedge funds. (For tips on paying fewer fees, see Stop Paying High Mutual Fund Fees.)Term StructureThe terms offered by a hedge fund are so unique that each fund can be completely different from another, but they usually are based on the following factors: Subscriptions and RedemptionsHedge funds do not have daily liquidity like mutual funds do. Some hedge funds can have subscriptions and redemptions monthly, while others accept them only quarterly. The terms of each hedge fund should be consistent with the underlying strategy being used by the manager. The more liquid the underlying investments, the more frequent the subscription/redemption terms should be. Each fund also specifies the number of days required for redemption, ranging from 15 days to 180 days, and this too should be consistent with the underlying strategy. Requiring redemption notices allows the hedge fund manager to efficiently raise capital to cover cash needs.Lock-UpsSome funds require up to a two-year "lock-up" commitment, but the most common lock-up is limited to one year. In some cases, it could be a hard lock, preventing the investor from withdrawing funds for the full time period, while in other cases, an investor can withdraw funds before the expiration of the lock-up period provided they pay a penalty. This second form of lock-up is called a soft lock and the penalty can range from 2-10% in some extreme cases.ConclusionThere are a variety of different combinations that can be used to structure a hedge fund and its related companies and investors. The above summary briefly describes one very common method used to structure the hedge fund and its management company. There are many others and just as hedge funds are creative with their investment strategies, they can also be very creative with their organizational structure. The takeaway of this section is to stress that each corporate structure is unique and should be evaluated along with all other factors covered in the rest of this tutorial.

“JAI, JPE, JPM and JOI keep us current on cutting edge research emanating from the academic and practitioner worlds.”
–Michael P. Hennessy
					Morgan Creek Capital Management, LLC
					



“Our II Journals site license aggregates high quality perspectives across multiple asset classes on one easy-to-navigate platform.”
–David Dickey
					Cambridge Associates
					



“JPM presents theoretically sound, practical and lucid articles on the most recent trends in institutional investment.”
–Pankaj Patel
					Credit Suisse
					



“II Journals gives us instant access through the Online Investment Library and valuable insight into the topics that matter to us.”
–Daniel Holman
					COO, QS Investors LLC 
					



“The Journal of Investing is a wonderful meeting point for finance theory and practice.”
–Robert Arnott (JOI advisory board member)
					Research Affiliates LLC 
					



“There are very few outlets for timely publication with an analytical bent. JOT stands out as one of the best.”
–Ian Domowitz (JOT advisory board member)
					Investment Technology Group
					



“JPM is literally required reading in the field of quantitative finance. If it had horoscopes and sports, I wouldn't need any other periodicals.”
–Cliff Asness (JPM advisory board member)

					AQR Capital Management, LLC
					



“JPM keeps portfolio managers up-to-date with the latest Wall Street thinking encapsulated in academically rigorous papers.”
–H. Russell Fogler (JPM advisory board member)

					Fogler Research and Management
					



“Ignorance isn't bliss. JPM is an invaluable tool for those serious practitioners who want to understand investments.”
–James P. Garland (JPM advisory board member)

					The Jeffrey Company
					


“The Journal of Retirement is very well done!  You’ve brought together experts to share valuable insights as we all work together to improve retirement security.”
–Stacey Schaus, DC Practice Leader, PIMCO




“The Journal of Retirement builds bridges between financial research and financial advice - it is a much needed publication.”
–Professor Elroy Dimson, London Business School and Cambridge Judge Business School



“I view The Journal of Portfolio Management as the main synaptic connection between the industry and leading academics. It should be mandatory reading in every business school. Arguably, no other journal has had a comparable influence on both sides of the divide over the last four decades.”
–Marcos López de Prado, Guggenheim Partners




“I have found The Journal of Trading to exemplify the best vehicle for publishing extended dialogue between academics and high-level practitioners.”
–Frederick H. deB. Harris, Wake Forest University




“I began my career in investments reading The Journal of Portfolio Management. It’s a must-read for anyone who practices the art and science of finance.”
–Mike Sebastian, Aon Center for Innovation and Analytics in Singapore
