					Some organization health care providers are made up of components that furnish different types of health care or have separate physical locations where health care is furnished. These components and physical locations are not themselves legal entities, but are part of the organization health care provider (which is a legal entity).
					A covered organization provider may decide that its subparts (if it has any) should have their own NPI numbers. If a subpart conducts any HIPAA standard transactions on its own (e.g., separately from its parent), it must obtain its own NPI number.

                                10-position all-numeric identification number assigned by the NPS to uniquely identify a health care provider.
                            



                                Entity Type
                            

                                Organization
                            

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Organization Subpart
                            

                                N
                            

                                The "Is the organization a subpart?" question must be answered. If the organization is a subpart, the Parent Organization Legal Business Name (LBN) and Parent Organization Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) fields must be completed. The Parent Organization LBN and TIN fields can only be completed if the answer to the subpart question is Yes.
Many organization health care providers who apply for NPIs are not legal entities themselves but are parts of other organization health care providers that are legal entities (the "parents"). 
Here are three examples of organization health care providers that may be considered subparts and may apply for NPIs if so directed by their "parents": 
(1) The psychiatric unit in a hospital is not a legal entity but is part of the hospital (the "parent"), which is a legal entity. The legal entity must obtain an NPI. The psychiatric unit is an example of a subpart that could have its own NPI if the hospital determines that it should. 
(2) A group practice that is not a sole proprietorship has a main location and could have other offices in different locations, but each office is not a separate legal entity; instead, each office is part of the corporation (the "parent") which is a legal entity. The offices are examples of subparts that could have their own NPIs if the main location determines that they should. 
(3) A pharmacy fills prescriptions for patients whose physicians have prescribed medications for them and may also rent or sell durable medical equipment to patients whose physicians have ordered such equipment for them. Neither the pharmacy line of business nor the DME line of business represent legal entities; instead, both lines of business are part of an organization (the "parent") that is a legal entity. Each line of business represents a different Healthcare Provider Taxonomy or area of specialization that often submits its own electronic claims to health plans. 
The "parent"-we don't know who the parent is in this example-must ensure that each subpart that submits its own claims to health plans has its own NPI.
                            



                                Provider Organization Name (Legal Business Name)

                                Provide organization name (legal business name used to file tax returns with the IRS). The Organization Name field allows the following special characters: ampersand, apostrophe, "at" sign, colon, comma, forward slash, hyphen, left and right parentheses, period, pound sign, quotation mark, and semi-colon. A field cannot contain all special characters.

Pastoral/Spiritual Care




Chaplains care for and support people of all faiths and nonreligious people as well. Many people who enter the hospital setting may be anxious about tests, treatment, surgery or their loved one. Their spirituality, which gives them meaning, hope, comfort and inner peace, may come into question during a time of uncertainty or suffering. Through compassionate listening a chaplain can recognize and identify elements of a patient’s spiritual struggle, enhancing the healing process and promoting holistic well-being.
As part of the Spiritual Services department's commitment to your well-being, a space in the south lobby of the main hospital has been designated a sanctuary for all to visit for times of quiet and prayer.
Community Howard chaplains play many roles in the healthcare environment, including:
Visit patients within twenty-four hours of admission to assess their spiritual and emotional needs.
Identify, assess and integrate patients’ cultural, spiritual and religious beliefs in the development of a plan of care and in decisions that are made concerning end-of-life care.
Provide for religious and cultural needs: prayer, contact with a faith community if requested, Muslim prayer rug, provide copies of sacred text, work with dietitian regarding kosher foods, specific end-of-life needs, etc.
For more information about Spiritual Services please call 765-453-8487.

Volunteering




We are always seeking dedicated and enthusiastic individuals to join the Community Howard Regional Health volunteer organization. Our volunteers range in age from 15 to 95 years old. They are students, homemakers, currently employed or retired administrative workers, engineers, nurses, teachers and others.
We provide our volunteers with thorough orientation and training to enable them to serve at our information desks and act as runners or transporters. These vital members of our organization supplement the professional and essential services contributing to total patient care.
Additionally, they act as ambassadors for our hospital, helping to create and promote an understanding of the hospital and its services in our community. Their reward is the satisfaction of knowing they are helping others.
Volunteer Shifts
Normally, volunteer shifts are set in 4-hour increments as follows:
Weekdays: 8 a.m. to 12 p.m., 12 p.m. to 4 p.m., and 4 p.m. to 8 p.m.
Weekends: 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., although some positions do require a different schedule.
Minimum schedule requirements (which do not include orientation or training time) are two 4-hour shifts a month for 6 months. Letters of recommendations will be written if requirements are met.
How to Apply
If you are 18 years old or above, you can fill out an application online by clicking on the link below. If you are under 18, please contact our volunteer coordinator at 765-453-8201.
All volunteers over 18 are required to pass a background check and are mandated to have a TB test and an annual flu shot by our Employee Health to volunteer. Only those with medical contraindications or religious beliefs will be exempt from receiving flu shots, with approval from Employee Health. Serious and committed applicants apply only.
Because Community Howard volunteers must meet many of the same standards as hospital staff, it generally takes approximately 4 to 6 weeks to actually begin your volunteer experience.
