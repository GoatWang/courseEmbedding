Cognex Corporation is an American manufacturer of machine vision systems, software and sensors used in automated manufacturing to inspect and identify parts, detect defects, verify product assembly, and guide assembly robots. Cognex is headquartered in Natick, Massachusetts, USA. It has offices in more than 20 countries.
Cognex was one of the first companies[citation needed] to explore commercial applications for machine vision in the early 1980s. In the 1990s, Cognex’s business grew due to the demand for machine vision tools to help automate semiconductor and electronics manufacturing. While semiconductor manufacturing remains an important market for Cognex vision, today the company receives a greater portion of its revenue from general manufacturing applications in areas such as pharmaceutical, automotive, healthcare, packaging, aerospace and consumer products manufacturing.
The company’s product portfolio includes In-Sight, a vision system that combines a camera, software and processor into one compact unit; VisionPro vision software; Checker, a single-purpose vision sensor used to provide high performance at certain common vision tasks, such as checking for the presence or absence of parts and features; DataMan, a family of fixed mount and handheld ID readers used to identify and track items by reading 1D and 2D Data Matrix codes.[1]
History[edit]
Cognex Corporation was founded in 1981 by Dr. Robert J. Shillman, a lecturer in human visual perception at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and two MIT graduate students, Bill Silver and Marilyn Matz. Cognex stands for Cognition Experts.
The company's first vision system, DataMan, was introduced in 1982. DataMan was an optical character recognition (OCR) system designed to read, verify, and assure the quality of letters, numbers, and symbols printed on products and components. The company's first customer was a typewriter manufacturer that purchased DataMan to read letters on typewriter keys and ensure that they were located in the correct position.
In 1989, Cognex went public on the NASDAQ exchange for $1.38 per share—within a year, the stock price had tripled.[2]
In 1995, Cognex made the first of many acquisitions when it purchased Acumen, a U.S. based developer of wafer identification systems. Acquisitions have played an important role in the company’s growth and enabled Cognex to enter new markets for machine vision such as surface inspection and vehicle vision.
In 2004, the company won an intellectual property victory when a federal judge ruled in Cognex's favor in a patent lawsuit brought against the estate of the inventor Jerome H. Lemelson, who had filed dozens of submarine patents, some of which purported to cover machine vision processes. The patents were held invalid.[3][4][5][6] The ruling was upheld by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.[7]
Cognex sold off its in-vehicle product in 2007, citing concerns about profitability and intellectual property issues.[1]
In 2015 Cognex sold off its Surface Vision Division and the associated range of products SmartView (web inspection), Vision Gear (slit inspection), Smart Advisor (process surveillance, web monitoring) and VisionPro Surface to Ametek Inc. for approximately 160M US$. The sold division represented about 12% of Cognex in terms of revenue and number of employees.[citation needed]
In May 2017, it was announced Cognex authorized a new stock buyback program. They authorized the purchase of up to $100 million common stock in the open market.[8]

					Full Description



Cognex Corporation (Cognex), incorporated on January 7, 1981, is a provider of machine vision products that capture and analyze visual information in order to automate tasks, primarily in manufacturing processes, where vision is required. The Company operates through the machine vision technology segment. The Company's machine vision products are used to automate the manufacture and tracking of discrete items, such as mobile phones, aspirin bottles and automobile tires, by locating, identifying, inspecting and measuring them during the manufacturing or distribution process. The Company's products include vision software, vision systems, vision sensors and identification (ID) products. Its products range from vision sensors that are integrated, to personal computer (PC)-based systems for users. Its products also have a range of physical forms, depending upon the user's need. Cognex sells its products through a direct sales force, as well as through a global network of integration and distribution partners.The Company's service offerings include maintenance and support, consulting and training services. The Company's maintenance and support programs include hardware support programs that entitle customers to have failed products repaired, as well as software support programs that provide customers with application support and software updates on the software releases. Application support is provided by technical support personnel located at Cognex regional offices, as well as by field service engineers that provide support at the customer's production site. It provides consulting services that range from a specific area of functionality to an integrated vision application or installed ID application. Training services include a range of product courses that are available at its offices across the world, at customer facilities, and on computer-based tutorials, video and the Internet.Vision SoftwareThe Company's vision software allows users to combine the general-purpose library of Cognex vision tools with the cameras, frame grabbers and peripheral equipment of their choice. The vision software runs on the customer's PC, which enables integration with PC-based data and controls. Applications based upon Cognex vision software perform a range of vision tasks, including part location, identification, measurement, assembly verification and robotic guidance. Cognex's VisionPro software offers a suite of vision tools for programing, while Cognex Designer allows customers to build vision applications with graphical, flowchart-based programing environment. Cognex also offers a series of displacement sensors.Vision SystemsThe Company's vision systems combine camera, processor and vision software into a single, rugged package with a user interface for configuring applications. These general-purpose vision systems are designed to be programed to perform a range of vision tasks, including part location, identification, measurement, assembly verification and robotic guidance. Cognex offers the In-Sight product line of vision systems in a range of models.Vision SensorsThe Company's vision sensors are designed to deliver solutions for various common vision applications, such as checking the presence and size of parts. Cognex offers the In-Sight 2000 Series, which combines the power of an In-Sight vision system with a vision sensor.ID ProductsThe Company's ID products read codes, such as one-dimensional barcodes or two-dimensional data matrix codes that have been applied to, or directly marked on, discrete items during the manufacturing process. Manufacturers of goods ranging from automotive parts, pharmaceutical items, aircraft components and medical devices use direct part mark (DPM) identification to ensure that the appropriate manufacturing processes are performed in the correct sequence and on the right parts. In addition, DPM is used in supply chain management and repair. It also offers applications in the automatic identification market outside of the manufacturing sector, such as using ID products in logistics automation for package sorting and distribution. Cognex offers the DataMan product line of barcode readers, which includes both hand-held and fixed-mount models, and barcode verifiers, as well as the MX-1000 Series of vision-enabled mobile terminals that allow customers to leverage the mobile device technology for industrial barcode reading applications.The Company competes with Keyence Corporation, Sick AG and Omron Corporation.
