Centaur Mutual Funds is dedicated to offering differentiated, value-oriented investing strategies designed to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns.
-Zeke Ashton, Portfolio Manager






About Centaur Total Return Fund
The Centaur Total Return Fund was originally launched in March 2005 as the Tilson Dividend Fund.  In October 2013, following the assignment of the investment advisory contract to Centaur Capital Partners, the fund was renamed the Centaur Total Return Fund.
The Centaur Total Return Fund has been managed since its inception by Centaur Capital Partners, led by portfolio manager Zeke Ashton.

Strategy Description
The Centaur Total Return Fund seeks to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns through a combination of capital appreciation and current income.
Mr. Ashton invests in equity securities that he believes are undervalued in the securities markets, but which also offer high dividend yields relative to the yield of the broad market averages such as the S&P 500 Total Return Index.
In addition to investing in stocks that offer high dividend yields, Mr. Ashton expects to generate income from selling covered call options on existing securities. ( Definition of covered call ) The use of covered call options, in combination with the purchase of equity securities, allows for the inclusion of undervalued, non-paying dividend stocks in the fund’s portfolio while still satisfying the fund’s goal of generating investment income. Securities so purchased will be selected based upon the attractiveness and security of the underlying stock as well as the income potential of the covered call options. The fund may also invest in non-dividend paying stocks without selling covered call options if the portfolio manager believes the stocks can produce significant appreciation.
To select equities for the Centaur Total Return Fund, the manager seeks to identify companies he understands well and that possess one or more of the following characteristics:

Positive (or projected positive) revenue or profit trends;
Healthy balance sheet, characterized by ample cash relative to debt, efficient working capital management,
                        high or increasing liquidity, or other metrics that the Advisor believes indicate the company’s ability to withstand unexpected shocks, reinvest in the business, and improve its business prospects and circumstances;
Strong free cash flow generation;
Powerful and sustainable competitive advantages;
Management team that: (i) operates the business well and has a sound strategy to build it over time; (ii)
                        allocates capital wisely to enhance shareholder value; and (iii) has high integrity; or
 Policies (e.g., compensation structures) that do not significantly dilute shareholders’ ownership.

The Centaur Total Return Fund typically invests in common stocks and other equity securities but may allocate its capital to bonds, short-term money market instruments, or other investment securities. Please review the prospectus for further details.

The Centaur Total Return Fund was originally launched in March 2005 as the Tilson Dividend Fund. The Fund seeks to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns through a combination of capital appreciation and current income.  Zeke Ashton, portfolio manager for the Centaur Total Return Fund since inception, commented, "We are pleased that we have been able to generate attractive total returns for our investors over the past 10 years while demonstrating effective risk management and capital preservation in down markets. We would like to thank the Fund's investors as well as the many people behind the scenes who have contributed to the Fund's first decade of successful operations."  For the 10-year period ending March 31, 2015, the Centaur Total Return Fund has earned a 5-star rating from Morningstar out of 168 funds in the "Mid Cap Blend" category. Morningstar has also rated the fund "Above Average" for the same 10-year return period along with a favorable risk rating of "Low."  For the same 10-year period ending March 31, 2015, Lipper Leaders assigned the Centaur Total Return Fund the highest rating of "5" for both "Total Return" (out of 176 funds) and "Preservation" (out of 5,661 funds) over the 10-year period. Lipper currently classifies the Fund as "Equity Income."  For further details, please visit our web site at http://www.centaurmutualfunds.com.

The performance information quoted above represents past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

Centaur Total Return Fund (TILDX) Declares Annual Distributions






Business Wire




Dec 8, 2016 2:30 PM EST













 




























































  Centaur Mutual Funds has announced that the Centaur Total Return Fund (NASDAQ: TILDX) will declare annual capital gains distributions for 2016. The following dates apply to today's distribution declarations:      Record Date                       December 8, 2016      Ex-Dividend Date             December 9, 2016      Payable Date             December 12, 2016                        The fund is projecting to pay approximately $0.33 per share in Short Term Capital Gains and $0.27 per share in Long Term Capital Gains, for a total distribution of approximately $0.60 per share.  Investors will receive these distributions in the form of additional Fund shares or cash, as elected by each account holder. As a result of these distributions, the reported per-share value of the fund is expected to decline by approximately $0.60 per share, or roughly 4.5%. Please note that this has no impact on the total return of the fund itself.  For further details, please visit our web site at http://www.centaurmutualfunds.com/pdf/DistributionLettertoInvestors-2016.pdf.  The distribution estimates were determined based on net capital gains realized at 10/31/2016, net income and shares outstanding at 11/30/2016. The actual net income is as of 10/31/2016 and estimated through 12/31/2016 and is subject to change (greater or lower due to additional income realized and possible adjustments, some of which are required by tax laws).
