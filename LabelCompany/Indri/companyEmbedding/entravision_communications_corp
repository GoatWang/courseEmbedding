Entravision Buys 2 NBC Affiliate TV Stations in Palm Springs, CA

 

 Editorial Staff | 07/21/2017 



What: Entravision Communications Corporation has entered into an agreement with OTA Broadcasting (PSP), LLC to acquire Stations KMIR-TV, the NBC affiliate, and KPSE-LD, the MyNetworkTV affiliate, serving Palm Springs, California, for US$21 million. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Why it matters: The Palm Springs market is ranked as the #49 in Hispanic population.
 
Entravision  has entered into an agreement with OTA Broadcasting (PSP), LLC to acquire Stations KMIR-TV, the NBC affiliate, and KPSE-LD, the MyNetworkTV affiliate, serving Palm Springs, California, for US$21 million.  Including anticipated synergies, the transaction represents an attractive purchase price multiple of less than 6.5 times expected blended 2016-2017 pro forma broadcast cash flow, is expected to be immediately free cash flow accretive and is expected to be funded on a tax efficient basis with proceeds from the FCC broadcast incentive auction and treated as a like-kind exchange pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  The transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions, including the prior consent of the Federal Communications Commission, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Walter F. Ulloa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Entravision, said, “Palm Springs is a growing and vibrant market that we know very well and have served for more than 20 years.  Our existing television and radio assets located in the market have helped us build strong relationships with the Palm Springs community and our local news programming, Noticias Ya, is highly rated.  We are excited to add KMIR’s impactful and significant local news presence to our portfolio in Palm Springs.  This is a strategic transaction that is extremely attractive on a financial basis, allowing us to broaden the services we provide the Palm Springs market and positions us to continue to build on the success of KMIR and KPSE.”
Bill Tolpegin, Chief Executive Officer of OTA Broadcasting, said, “We are grateful for the hard work and dedication of KMIR’s terrific employees during our ownership of the station.  We are confident that Entravision will be a great new home for the station and its team, and look forward to following their continued success.”
Entravision currently owns and operates the UniMas and Univision affiliated television stations (KVER-CD, KEVC-CD, and KVES-LD) and 94.7 FM Jose and 103.5 FM Tricolor radio stations (KLOB-FM and KPST-FM) serving the Palm Springs, CA market, which is ranked #146 in total population and #49 in Hispanic population.  Entravision’s Univision affiliate, KVER-TV is the leading station in the market, number one in full week ratings, Mon-Sun 3am-3am among Adults 18-34, 18-49 and 25-54 [1].

Entravision Communications Corp. Acquires Palm Springs TV Stations 
By Diane Haithman

                Entravision's Walter Ulloa.
                
            

Spanish-language broadcaster Entravision Communications Corp. has entered into an agreement with OTA Broadcasting to acquire Palm Springs stations KMIR-TV, an NBC affiliate, along with KPSE-LA, a MyNetworkTV affiliate, for $21 million.
Santa Monica-based Entravision said the acquisition, announced Friday, would be funded with proceeds from the Federal Communication Commission’s first Broadcast Incentive Auction. The auction was authorized by Congress in 2012 to allow broadcasters the opportunity to sell some of their spectrum space to fill the growing needs of wireless providers.
“Palm Springs is a growing and vibrant market that we know very well and have served for more than 20 years,” Entravision Chief Executive Walter F. Ulloa said in a statement.
The company owns and operates several TV and radio stations serving that market.
Entravision, with 58 television and 49 radio stations across the United States and Mexico, topped the Business Journal’s list last year of most profitable L.A.-area public companies based on three-year average return on equity.

However, this year’s list of most profitable companies, which will be published next week, puts Entravision at No. 20 as its net income declined slightly. The company had a market capitalization of $596 million as of June 30, and it reported 2016 revenue of $259 million and net income of $20 million.

OTA Sells KMIR, KPSE in Palm Springs for $21 Million
Entravision to add stations to its roster
July 21, 2017









 Posted by Deborah D. McAdams


























SANTA MONICA, CALIF. —
OTA Broadcasting, the entity co-created by computer magnate Michael
Dell—ostensibly to buy TV stations and sell them at auction—is selling two
stations in Palm Springs, Calif., to Entravision Communications Corp., the
latter announced today.

Entravision said entered into an agreement with
OTA Broadcasting to acquire KMIR-TV, the NBC affiliate, and KPSE-LD, the
MyNetworkTV affiliate, serving Palm Springs for $21 million.


Entravision is funding
the purchase with auction proceeds. Entravision sold four TV stations at auction, according to FCC’s April 4, 2017, winning bid list. WVUN in Hartford, Conn.; KSMS in Monterey, Calif.; WJAL and WMDO-CD in Washington, D.C., were sold for a total of $ 263,592,981. Entravision indicated it had channel-sharing agreements for each of those stations.

It will treat the transaction as a “like-kind exchange” with
regard to IRS rules. It estimated the purchase price to be less than 6.5 times
expected 2016-17 pro forma cash flow, and expects it to be “immediately free
cash-flow accretive.”


Pending customary closing
conditions, including Federal Communications Commission consent, the deal is
expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017. 

Walter F. Ulloa, chairman and CEO of
Entravision, said, “Palm Springs is a growing and vibrant market that
we know very well and have served for more than 20 years. Our existing
television and radio assets located in the market have helped us build strong
relationships with the Palm Springs community and our local news programming, Noticias
Ya, is highly rated. 

“We are excited to add KMIR’s
impactful and significant local news presence to our portfolio in Palm Springs.
This is a strategic transaction that is extremely attractive on a financial
basis, allowing us to broaden the services we provide the Palm Springs market
and positions us to continue to build on the success of KMIR and
KPSE.”

Bill Tolpegin, CEO of OTA Broadcasting, said,
“We are grateful for the hard work and dedication of KMIR’s
terrific employees during our ownership of the station. We are confident that
Entravision will be a great new home for the station and its team, and look
forward to following their continued success.”

OTA Broadcasting sold 10 stations in the incentive auction, including eight low-power TV licenses. The stations are in Boston, Charlotte, N.C., New York, Pittsburgh, Providence, R.I.; and San Francisco. OTA made $441 million on the sales and indicated each of the sold stations had channel-sharing agreements. OTA also asked the FCC if it could engage in aftermarket sales to wireless providers once the auction was completed. The commission did not respond.

Entravision currently owns and operates the
UniMas and Univision affiliated television stations—KVER-CD, KEVC-CD, and
KVES-LD—and 94.7 FM Jose and 103.5 FM Tricolor radio stations—KLOB-FM and
KPST-FM—serving the Palm Springs market, which is ranked No. 146 in total
population and No. 49 in Hispanic population. Entravision said its Univision
affiliate, KVER-TV is the leading station in the market, number one in full
week ratings, Mon-Sun 3am-3am among Adults 18-34, 18-49 and 25-54, according to
Nielsen numbers from May 2017.

Entravision Communications Corporation is a media company based in Santa Monica, California. Entravision primarily caters to the Spanish-speaking Hispanic community and owns television and radio stations and outdoor media, in several of the top Hispanic markets. They are the largest affiliate group of the Univision and UniMás television networks.[3] Entravision also owns a small number of English-language television and radio stations.
On August 4, 2006, Entravision sold five of their radio stations in the Dallas/Fort Worth area to Liberman Broadcasting.[4] On May 16, 2008, the company sold its outdoor media division, whose operations were primarily based in New York and Los Angeles, to Lamar Advertising Company.[5]
In 2007, Entravision Communications Corporation acquired Spanish-language radio station WNUE-FM serving the Orlando, Florida, market from Mega Communications for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $24 million.[6]

Entravision Communications Corporation is a media company based in Santa Monica, California. Entravision primarily caters to the Spanish-speaking Hispanic community and owns television and radio stations and outdoor media, in several of the top Hispanic markets. They are the largest affiliate group of the Univision and UniMás television networks.[3] Entravision also owns a small number of English-language television and radio stations.
On August 4, 2006, Entravision sold five of their radio stations in the Dallas/Fort Worth area to Liberman Broadcasting.[4] On May 16, 2008, the company sold its outdoor media division, whose operations were primarily based in New York and Los Angeles, to Lamar Advertising Company.[5]
In 2007, Entravision Communications Corporation acquired Spanish-language radio station WNUE-FM serving the Orlando, Florida, market from Mega Communications for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $24 million.[6]

Entravision Communications Corporation is a media company based in Santa Monica, California. Entravision primarily caters to the Spanish-speaking Hispanic community and owns television and radio stations and outdoor media, in several of the top Hispanic markets. They are the largest affiliate group of the Univision and UniMás television networks.[3] Entravision also owns a small number of English-language television and radio stations.
On August 4, 2006, Entravision sold five of their radio stations in the Dallas/Fort Worth area to Liberman Broadcasting.[4] On May 16, 2008, the company sold its outdoor media division, whose operations were primarily based in New York and Los Angeles, to Lamar Advertising Company.[5]
In 2007, Entravision Communications Corporation acquired Spanish-language radio station WNUE-FM serving the Orlando, Florida, market from Mega Communications for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $24 million.[6]

Entravision Communications Corporation is a media company based in Santa Monica, California. Entravision primarily caters to the Spanish-speaking Hispanic community and owns television and radio stations and outdoor media, in several of the top Hispanic markets. They are the largest affiliate group of the Univision and UniMás television networks.[3] Entravision also owns a small number of English-language television and radio stations.
On August 4, 2006, Entravision sold five of their radio stations in the Dallas/Fort Worth area to Liberman Broadcasting.[4] On May 16, 2008, the company sold its outdoor media division, whose operations were primarily based in New York and Los Angeles, to Lamar Advertising Company.[5]
In 2007, Entravision Communications Corporation acquired Spanish-language radio station WNUE-FM serving the Orlando, Florida, market from Mega Communications for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $24 million.[6]

Entravision Communications Corporation is a media company based in Santa Monica, California. Entravision primarily caters to the Spanish-speaking Hispanic community and owns television and radio stations and outdoor media, in several of the top Hispanic markets. They are the largest affiliate group of the Univision and UniMás television networks.[3] Entravision also owns a small number of English-language television and radio stations.
On August 4, 2006, Entravision sold five of their radio stations in the Dallas/Fort Worth area to Liberman Broadcasting.[4] On May 16, 2008, the company sold its outdoor media division, whose operations were primarily based in New York and Los Angeles, to Lamar Advertising Company.[5]
In 2007, Entravision Communications Corporation acquired Spanish-language radio station WNUE-FM serving the Orlando, Florida, market from Mega Communications for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $24 million.[6]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
