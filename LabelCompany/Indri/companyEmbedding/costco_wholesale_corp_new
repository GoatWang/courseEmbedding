You don’t have to be a gadget geek to love electronics. An HD television is a great way to bring the family together for a night of movie entertainment, while a digital camera or camcorder lets you relive those memorable moments all over again. Stay connected with family, friends or work with a smartphone or cell phone; and don’t worry about losing your way when you navigate to new destinations with a GPS system for your car. From security and surveillance that keeps your family safe, to video games that entertain, electronics add comfort, convenience and fun to daily life.

What Is Costco?
    We are a membership warehouse club, dedicated to bringing our members the best possible prices on quality, brand-name merchandise. With hundreds of locations worldwide, Costco provides a wide selection of merchandise, plus the convenience of specialty departments and exclusive member services, all designed to make your shopping experience a pleasurable one.
View Our Welcome Video Series Below






The History of Costco
    The company's first location, opened in 1976 under the Price Club name, was in a converted airplane hangar on Morena Boulevard in San Diego. The company found it could achieve far greater buying power by serving small businesses and a select audience of non-business members. With that, the growth of the warehouse club industry was off and running. In 1983, the first Costco warehouse location opened in Seattle. Costco became the first company to grow from zero to $3 billion in sales in less than six years. When Costco and Price Club merged in 1993 to become PriceCostco, it had 206 locations generating $16 billion in annual sales.
      Our operating philosophy has remained simple: Keep costs down and pass the savings on to our members. Our large membership base and tremendous buying power, combined with our never-ending quest for efficiency, result in the lowest possible prices for our members. Since resuming the Costco name in 1997, the company has grown worldwide. During the past fiscal year (ended August 28, 2016), total sales were $116.1 billion. For additional information, request a Costco Story and/or a My Costco Services guide when you visit any Costco membership counter.
Shop Confidently
    We are committed to offering the best value to our members, with a risk-free 100% satisfaction guarantee on both your membership and merchandise. If you have questions about your membership or products you've purchased at Costco, please visit the membership counter at your local Costco or contact our Member Service Center. For more information read our return policy and Member Privileges & Conditions. 
    
      Select which ​type of membership is best for you: Gold Star or Business. Costco members ​also ​can upgrade to Executive Membership and enjoy an annual 2% Reward (up to $1,000) on qualified Costco, Costco.com, and Costco Travel purchases. Executive Members also receive additional benefits and greater discounts on our suite of Costco Services, and extra benefits on select Costco Travel products. 
Terms, conditions and exclusions apply. See the membership counter for details.
How Do I Join?
    You can purchase a membership online or join at your local Costco. To join online, simply select a membership type and add it to your cart. Once you've made your purchase, your new member number(s) will be emailed to you. Just bring your email to any Costco membership counter to pick up your cards.
We Value Our Members
    You'll appreciate the quality and value of the products you find at Costco. That's our promise to you. If we fail to deliver on that promise, we'll refund your money. It's that simple.

Costco Wholesale Corporation's Most Disappointing Product in 2016
This product launch disrupted sales growth and membership renewal trends for the warehouse giant. But management thinks it will easily pay off in the long run.











                Demitrios Kalogeropoulos
            

                (TMFSigma)



            
            Dec 13, 2016 at 3:57PM
            
            






Image source: Costco.
Costco (NASDAQ:COST) shoppers may have noticed shorter lines at the warehouse retailer lately. In fact, the company just posted its weakest customer traffic growth pace in almost six years.
No one expected Costco to keep up its 4% traffic expansion rate forever. Yet in switching its co-branded store credit card from American Express (NYSE:AXP) to Visa (NYSE:V), the company likely contributed to the slump by putting its membership base through a major disruption.
Sure, it's almost certainly a long-term positive for the business. But Costco's credit card change generated major challenges this year.
Benefits all around
The move promised to deliver significant value both to Costco and to the 11 million subscribers that currently use its co-branded cards. The retailer negotiated improved rewards, including 4% cash back on gas purchases (compared to 3% in the American Express version). Other rebate categories such as travel purchases and restaurant spending saw a similar boost.

Image source: Costco.
Costco would benefit from the switchover as well, due to insanely low transaction fees. Consistent with its operating strategy, the company aims to return almost all those savings to customers in the form of lower prices. "The new card is great in terms of increased cash back rewards for our members," Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti recently told investors. "That's great for us as well in terms of driving member value and sales over the next years, and of course lowering our effective merchant fees related to the new program."
Hiccups in the switch
The credit card switch went over relatively smoothly this past summer, given the huge scale of the change. An initial surge of complaints in late June earned Costco some bad press that eventually calmed down. The company took a significant financial hit, though, as it paused new-member signups for months while it delivered the new cards to its existing user base.

Data source: Costco financial filings. Chart by author.
The more worrying impact was in renewal rates, which trended down in the leadup to the change and continued falling afterwards. Executives blamed the credit card change for the fact that renewal rates fell to 90.3% in the U.S. from 90.5%. It also likely played a minor role in Costco's dip in comps growth for fiscal 2016. 





Just a short-term problem?
Management believes the hit to its business from the card switch will be short-lived while the benefits will accrue for at least the next decade. A similar changeover in the Canada market, after all, produced the same slowdown in membership growth that quickly reversed itself after just a few quarters.
Its most recent quarterly results suggest the same type of rebound could be happening in the critical U.S. market. Renewal rates stabilized during the fiscal first quarter, executives said, and customer traffic, while still running well below 4%, ticked up slightly, too.
These improvements helped Costco offset significant price deflation on groceries and electronics to book overall sales growth. Membership income, meanwhile, grew by a healthy 6%.
Investors are also starting to see the positive benefits on Costco's bottom line. Gross profit margin ticked up last quarter due to increased revenue from new signups. At the same time, lower merchant fees drove a welcome drop in expenses.
With just one quarter's worth of data on the new card to judge by, it's too early to know how helpful it will ultimately be to Costco's profits and to growth potential. There are hopeful signs that the significant costs of the switch are now behind the company, though, and what remains is significant potential for growth over the initial 10-year term of the deal.

The Kirkland Signature Story





    It's been nearly 20 years since the first Kirkland Signature™ products appeared at Costco. Has this line of private-label products achieved its goal of offering members a unique value in their everyday purchases?


    Absolutely. The Kirkland Signature label today appears on about 20 percent of the products you find in your local warehouse - on everything from men's dress shirts to laundry detergent, pet food to toilet paper, canned foods to cookware, olive oil to beer, automotive products to health and beauty aids. The common element: These are Costco's signature products that offer the perfect combination of quality and price to members.

 

    "We will always be known for name brands such as Michelin, Sony and Crest," says Craig Jelinek, Costco president and chief executive officer, "but we will continue to augment our product offerings with our own Kirkland Signature items."
    








    With Kirkland Signature, Costco can develop new products, new categories and new products in existing categories, which allows the company to control the quality of the Kirkland Signature product and drive down prices on competing national brands. 
         
    "The working rule followed by Costco buyers is that all Kirkland Signature products must be equal to or better than the national brands, and must offer a savings to our members," adds Craig.

    Another rule is continuous improvement. "We're constantly looking at Kirkland Signature items, revisiting them with an eye to making them better," says Jeff Lyons, Costco's senior vice president of fresh foods.

    On your next trip to Costco, compare any Kirkland Signature product with its brand name counterpart, and discover a great perk of Costco.

Costco shares fall on downgrade that says Amazon fears are eclipsing fundamentals

Jul. 11, 2017 at 7:02 a.m. ET
by Ciara Linnane









Retail stocks battered by Amazon-related fears
Shares of retailers were hammered Monday, as a wave of fears about the impact of juggernaut Amazon.com Inc.  on the sector were highlighted in stories and commentary from analysts. Department store chain Macy's Inc. , currently in the midst of store closures caused by weak revenue as shoppers switch to Amazon, led the decliners with a 7% fall, making it the worst performer on the S&P 500. Gap Inc.  fell 6.5%, followed by Best Buy Inc. , down 6.3%. Best Buy has mostly escaped the pressure of the Amazon effect, but was hit Monday by a Recode report that Amazon has been hiring a team of people to offer in-home product installations, competing with Best Buy's "Geek Squad." Kohl's Corp. fell 4.6% and Nordstrom Inc.  was down 2.7%. Abercrombie & Fitch  fell 20% after it said it had ended talks on a potential deal. Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  was down 2.5% and Foot Locker Inc.  was down 2.3%. Costco Wholesale Corp.  fell 1.7% after an analyst downgrade that suggested the company's strong fundamentals are being overshadowed by Amazon fears, following its bid for Whole Foods Markets Inc. .  The SPDR S&P Retail exchange-traded fund  was down 2% and is now down 11.7% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 9%.

Costco's stock falls after analyst downgrades on concerns negative sentiment will trump strong fundamental
Shares of Costco Wholesale Corp.  fell 0.6% in premarket trade Monday, after the membership-based warehouse retailer was downgraded at BMO Capital, which cited concerns that investor sentiment has soured as a result of perceived competition from Amazon.com Inc. . Analyst Kelly Bania cut the rating to market perform after being at outperform since January 2015, and slashed the stock price target to $160, which is 3.8% above Friday's closing price of $154.11, from $185. Bania stressed that the downgraded was not a call on Costco's fundamental outlook, which remains "strong." Bania said the "weak" stock reaction to "impressive" June same-store sales data suggests "investor sentiment, driven by Amazon fears, may continue to overshadow strong fundamentals." The stock has fallen 2.5% since the June data was released to close Friday at a 7-month low. "Despite Costco's significant price gap to Amazon...we believe near-term sentiment and fear of the long-term impact of Amazon on Costco's business--whether or not justified by fundamentals--could continue to create an overhang on [Costco] shares," Bania wrote in a note to clients. Costco's stock has dropped 10.0% over the past three months, while the SPDR S&P Retail ETF  has lost 5.7%, Amazon shares have climbed 7.9% and the S&P 500  has gained 2.9%.

Costco's stock is down 1.3% for the year so far while the S&P 500 index  is up 8.7% for the period.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price.
