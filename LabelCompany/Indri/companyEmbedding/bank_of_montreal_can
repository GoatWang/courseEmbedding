† Wealth management products and services may be offered by Bank of Montreal or by one or more of its affiliates.
* Some conditions apply.
**The $1.00 service fee that may have applied when you use Interac e-Transfer has been eliminated for customers with an Everyday Bank Plan. The monthly Plan fee may still apply. Other transaction fees may apply if you have a Bank Plan that does not include unlimited everyday banking transactions. A cancellation fee may still apply when you cancel the transaction.
1 Terms and conditions apply.
2 BMO Growth GICs are issued by Bank of Montreal Mortgage Corporation and guaranteed by Bank of Montreal. The principal amount of a BMO Growth GIC is guaranteed and is repayable upon maturity, but there is no guarantee of earning any return linked to the performance of the underlying securities. The rate of return for the term payable, if any, will be the return on the portfolio of investments which are the basis for calculating the return on the BMO Growth GIC (the “Reference Portfolio”) subject to the following: the rate of return for the term will not be less than zero or more than the maximum rate of return for the four-year term, which for the BMO Growth GIC series 115 is 16%. The return on the Reference Portfolio, if any, is determined without reference to any dividends or distributions paid on the securities and is the simple average of the percentage changes in the value of each underlying security in the Reference Portfolio over the term of the BMO Growth GIC. The rate of return for the term: (i) is not compounded; (ii) as set out in this advertisement is based on the BMO Growth GIC series 115 and the maximum rate of return for the term is subject to change between series; and (iii) is not an annual rate but is the rate of return over the entire term of the BMO Growth GIC. If market disruptions or other special circumstances affect the calculation of the return, the calculation agent may adjust or delay the calculation or payment of interest, estimate the value of an underlying security, replace a security and/or determine the amount of interest, if any, that may be payable in an alternate manner. The terms and conditions for BMO Growth GICs are available at your local BMO Bank of Montreal branch.
¶ Annualized return for BMO SelectTrust® Balanced Portfolio Series A: since inception 7.65%; 1-year 4.6%; 3-year 7.61%. Series A as at October 12th, 2016. Commissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the fund facts or prospectus before investing. The indicated rates of return are the historical annual compounded total returns including changes in unit value and reinvestment of all distributions and do not take into account sales, redemptions, distribution or optional charges or income taxes payable by any unit holder that would have reduced returns. BMO Mutual Funds are offered by BMO Investments Inc., a financial services firm and separate entity from Bank of Montreal. Mutual funds are not guaranteed, their values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.

† Wealth management products and services may be offered by Bank of Montreal or by one or more of its affiliates.
* Some conditions apply.
**The $1.00 service fee that may have applied when you use Interac e-Transfer has been eliminated for customers with an Everyday Bank Plan. The monthly Plan fee may still apply. Other transaction fees may apply if you have a Bank Plan that does not include unlimited everyday banking transactions. A cancellation fee may still apply when you cancel the transaction.
1 Terms and conditions apply.
2 BMO Growth GICs are issued by Bank of Montreal Mortgage Corporation and guaranteed by Bank of Montreal. The principal amount of a BMO Growth GIC is guaranteed and is repayable upon maturity, but there is no guarantee of earning any return linked to the performance of the underlying securities. The rate of return for the term payable, if any, will be the return on the portfolio of investments which are the basis for calculating the return on the BMO Growth GIC (the “Reference Portfolio”) subject to the following: the rate of return for the term will not be less than zero or more than the maximum rate of return for the four-year term, which for the BMO Growth GIC series 115 is 16%. The return on the Reference Portfolio, if any, is determined without reference to any dividends or distributions paid on the securities and is the simple average of the percentage changes in the value of each underlying security in the Reference Portfolio over the term of the BMO Growth GIC. The rate of return for the term: (i) is not compounded; (ii) as set out in this advertisement is based on the BMO Growth GIC series 115 and the maximum rate of return for the term is subject to change between series; and (iii) is not an annual rate but is the rate of return over the entire term of the BMO Growth GIC. If market disruptions or other special circumstances affect the calculation of the return, the calculation agent may adjust or delay the calculation or payment of interest, estimate the value of an underlying security, replace a security and/or determine the amount of interest, if any, that may be payable in an alternate manner. The terms and conditions for BMO Growth GICs are available at your local BMO Bank of Montreal branch.
¶ Annualized return for BMO SelectTrust® Balanced Portfolio Series A: since inception 7.65%; 1-year 4.6%; 3-year 7.61%. Series A as at October 12th, 2016. Commissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the fund facts or prospectus before investing. The indicated rates of return are the historical annual compounded total returns including changes in unit value and reinvestment of all distributions and do not take into account sales, redemptions, distribution or optional charges or income taxes payable by any unit holder that would have reduced returns. BMO Mutual Funds are offered by BMO Investments Inc., a financial services firm and separate entity from Bank of Montreal. Mutual funds are not guaranteed, their values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.
