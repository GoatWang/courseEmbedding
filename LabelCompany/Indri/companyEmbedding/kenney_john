John Kenney’s practice involves litigation of complex business cases, primarily those involving intellectual property and other technical and scientific issues. He has tried and handled cases, arbitrations, and administrative proceedings and hearings in many state and federal courts in the United States, the Virgin Islands and several foreign countries. Over the years, this has included cases involving patents and other intellectual property, products liability, oil and gas, environmental, antitrust, securities fraud, and other contract and general business issues. He also advises clients concerning matters involving intellectual property law and products liability law.
John regularly practices before all federal district courts in Oklahoma, including the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, located in Oklahoma City; the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, located in Tulsa; and the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma, located in Muskogee. He has also tried cases in numerous federal district courts around the country and handled appeals in the U.S. Supreme Court and in the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, Tenth Circuit and Fifth Circuit.
He has previously served as leader of the firm’s Litigation Group and Intellectual Property Group. He has also served on the firm’s board of directors.
Before attending law school, John was employed as an engineer with Westinghouse Electric Corporation in Staunton, Virginia, and Norman, Oklahoma, and as a project engineer by University Associates, Inc. After law school, he worked as a litigation associate at Baker & Botts in Houston, Texas, before returning to Oklahoma and joining McAfee & Taft.
John’s interest in protecting the intellectual property rights to both industrial and artistic works is personal as well as professional. John is an inventor of eight patents issued by the United States Patent Office. He is also a country music songwriter whose copyrighted works have been recorded by singer-songwriter and collaborator Bob Fraley for the debut album, "Bootjack Romeo."
In addition to being appointed on two occasions as a temporary judge on the Oklahoma Court of Appeals (attorney-staffed panels), John has served on various appointed committees and panels for the U.S. District Court for the Western of Oklahoma, including the Civil Justice Reform Act Advisory Committee, Merit Magistrate Judge Selection Committee, Arbitration Panel, and Early Neutral Evaluation Panel. 

John is a fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers.  His achievements have earned him inclusion in Chambers USA Guide to America’s Leading Lawyers for Business, The Best Lawyers in America (bet-the-company litigation; commercial litigation; intellectual property litigation; mass tort litigation/class actions – defendants; patent litigation; product liability litigation –defendants; trade secrets law) and Oklahoma Super Lawyers, which has named him to its prestigious list of “Top 10 Oklahoma Lawyers” for several years running.

John was selected by Best Lawyers as “Oklahoma City Patent Litigation Lawyer of the Year” for 2012, “Oklahoma City Intellectual Property Litigation Lawyer of the Year” for 2014, “Oklahoma City Mass Tort Litigation/Class Action Defense Lawyer of the Year” for 2015, “Oklahoma City Product Liability Litigation Defense Lawyer of the Year” for 2016, and “Oklahoma City Trade Secrets Lawyer of the Year” for 2017, honors given to a single lawyer in each legal specialty in each market. He has been identified by Benchmark Litigation as a “Litigation Star.”

He is a frequent speaker and continuing legal education teacher on matters related to trial practice, evidence and intellectual property law.

John Kenney’s practice involves litigation of complex business cases, primarily those involving intellectual property and other technical and scientific issues. He has tried and handled cases, arbitrations, and administrative proceedings and hearings in many state and federal courts in the United States, the Virgin Islands and several foreign countries. Over the years, this has included cases involving patents and other intellectual property, products liability, oil and gas, environmental, antitrust, securities fraud, and other contract and general business issues. He also advises clients concerning matters involving intellectual property law and products liability law.
John regularly practices before all federal district courts in Oklahoma, including the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, located in Oklahoma City; the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, located in Tulsa; and the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma, located in Muskogee. He has also tried cases in numerous federal district courts around the country and handled appeals in the U.S. Supreme Court and in the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, Tenth Circuit and Fifth Circuit.
He has previously served as leader of the firm’s Litigation Group and Intellectual Property Group. He has also served on the firm’s board of directors.
Before attending law school, John was employed as an engineer with Westinghouse Electric Corporation in Staunton, Virginia, and Norman, Oklahoma, and as a project engineer by University Associates, Inc. After law school, he worked as a litigation associate at Baker & Botts in Houston, Texas, before returning to Oklahoma and joining McAfee & Taft.
John’s interest in protecting the intellectual property rights to both industrial and artistic works is personal as well as professional. John is an inventor of eight patents issued by the United States Patent Office. He is also a country music songwriter whose copyrighted works have been recorded by singer-songwriter and collaborator Bob Fraley for the debut album, "Bootjack Romeo."
In addition to being appointed on two occasions as a temporary judge on the Oklahoma Court of Appeals (attorney-staffed panels), John has served on various appointed committees and panels for the U.S. District Court for the Western of Oklahoma, including the Civil Justice Reform Act Advisory Committee, Merit Magistrate Judge Selection Committee, Arbitration Panel, and Early Neutral Evaluation Panel. 

John is a fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers.  His achievements have earned him inclusion in Chambers USA Guide to America’s Leading Lawyers for Business, The Best Lawyers in America (bet-the-company litigation; commercial litigation; intellectual property litigation; mass tort litigation/class actions – defendants; patent litigation; product liability litigation –defendants; trade secrets law) and Oklahoma Super Lawyers, which has named him to its prestigious list of “Top 10 Oklahoma Lawyers” for several years running.

John was selected by Best Lawyers as “Oklahoma City Patent Litigation Lawyer of the Year” for 2012, “Oklahoma City Intellectual Property Litigation Lawyer of the Year” for 2014, “Oklahoma City Mass Tort Litigation/Class Action Defense Lawyer of the Year” for 2015, “Oklahoma City Product Liability Litigation Defense Lawyer of the Year” for 2016, and “Oklahoma City Trade Secrets Lawyer of the Year” for 2017, honors given to a single lawyer in each legal specialty in each market. He has been identified by Benchmark Litigation as a “Litigation Star.”

He is a frequent speaker and continuing legal education teacher on matters related to trial practice, evidence and intellectual property law.

Truth in Advertising by John Kenney: ReviewWhen the product you’re selling is diapers advertising can be a pee wee league John KenneyJohn Kenney's Truth in Advertising, Touchstone, 320 pages, $28.99.By Emily DonaldsonFri., Feb. 15, 2013Years ago, when my husband and I were travelling in Costa Rica, we found ourselves sitting across from an American family at a thatched roof restaurant high in the cloud forest. As the family rose to go, the father turned to reveal, emblazoned boldly across the back of his felt-and-leather jacket, the logo of a major diaper company (hint: it rhymes with “Campers”). We wouldn’t have been more amazed had he turned out to be wearing a howler monkey-fur codpiece. This, after all, was no Queen Street ironist. The man was a true believer.Fin Dolan, the copywriter-hero of John Kenney’s witty first novel, Truth in Advertising, isn’t the kind of guy who’d hike the jungles of Central America with a diaper logo on his back, but part of him wishes he were. At 39, Fin is getting long in the tooth at the Manhattan ad agency where he works, one whose main client happens to be a major diaper company called Snugglies. New York-based Kenney, a frequent contributor to The New Yorker’s humour section, “Shouts & Murmurs,” has also been a copywriter for 17 years and thus knows of what he speaks. He is particularly brilliant at clashing Fin’s jadedness with the unglamorous products he’s forced to pitch. A scene where Fin tries to cast actors in the roles of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea for a commercial may be sophomoric, but it still had me in tears (Client memo: “While we like Nausea and Vomiting very much, we’re having a problem with Diarrhea.”) Article Continued BelowAware that boredom and cynicism have become his biggest obstacle, Fin convinces himself that a promotion would stave off their insidious creep. A promotion might also distract from his guilt over breaking off his engagement to his attractive but vanilla girlfriend Amy. Opportunity knocks when Fin’s boss asks to see him the day before the agency is to close for the Christmas break. Snugglies is launching a revolutionary new product — the first fully biodegradable, flushable diaper — and Fin has six weeks to conceive a spot for that holy grail of advertising, the Super Bowl. As Fin struggles to come up with worthy creative, his brother Eddie calls with the news that their estranged father is dying in a Cape Cod hospital. Being the only one of his siblings not to have a family (Fin notes that he spends his day in diapers but has never changed one), Fin reluctantly agrees to go down. Here, Kenney eases up on the sarcasm throttle to allow Fin’s backstory to emerge. His father, a war veteran, abused his brothers then walked out on the family when Fin was barely in his early teens. A few years later, Fin’s mother committed suicide. Fin hasn’t seen his father since her funeral. When his father dies, Fin’s instinct is to disregard his wish to have his ashes scattered in the Pacific near Pearl Harbor. But two things: a letter delivered by his father’s lawyer and a scolding from Phoebe, an assistant at the agency, convince him to reconsider. Kenney successfully feathers the edge between yucks and sincerity in what follows, not the least of which is Fin’s father’s ashes getting lost by FedEx (who promise the next package he ships will be free). Struggling to do the right thing, Fin finds an unexpected ally in Keiko, the playboy son of the billionaire Japanese shipping mogul who owns the agency. Keiko, it turns out, has father issues too. An ongoing joke about advertising creatives, made here and on shows like Mad Men, is that they’re all thwarted directors with a screenplay sitting in their drawer. That Phoebe, Fin’s best friend, is also described at the outset as heart-stoppingly beautiful leaves not a shred of doubt as to how the novel will end. It also makes us wonder if Kenney doesn’t aspire to the stereotype he mocks. This safe, romcom predictability is the only real disappointment in an otherwise delightfully caustic piece of satire.
