When an agreement is made without adjudication during an impending lawsuit, a settlement agreement lays out the terms of agreement between the parties. The parties (''Plaintiff'') and (''Defendant'') will come to an agreement on how they will cease the actions of the lawsuit.Settlement agreements enable opposing parties to bypass a lengthy court process by agreeing to specific terms and conditions which may include relief to plaintiff, method of payment (if any), attorney fees and other incurred costs.These agreements almost always contain confidentiality agreements, wherein the plaintiff of the lawsuit agrees to not disclose any details concerning the nature of the settlement to the press or other individuals.  A settlement agreement may be used in a divorce case or civil lawsuit.

This 10-piece Forstner bit set is part of a line of imported Forstner bits that Woodcraft has tested and found to cut clean and not burn even when testers intentionally subjected them to quick, repetitive drill press borings. An exceptional value for the hobbyist or occasional user. Set includes 1/4", 3/8", 1/2", 5/8", 3/4", 7/8", 1", 1-1/4", 1-3/8", and 1-1/2" bits (no 1-1/8"). Bits are 3-1/2" long with a 3/8" shank. Bits larger than 1" have saw-toothed edges to keep the larger cutting edge cool while boring.10 Forstner bits 1/4" to 1-1/2" in 1/8" increments (no 1-1/8")3-1/2" long3/8" shankLarger bits have saw-toothed edges to keep cutting edge cool while boringIncludes a wooden storage case

Excellent value
I got these and put them to use right away. The precision and finish on these is very good. There is no runout, and they cut easily and cleanly, making holes in the center and kn the edge of the wood. The added bonus is the case that is much better than I expected.  It has fitted holes for each bit and it makes them easy to access.  

Unless they don't hold up over time, which will take a few years to determine, I can't see where these would not be good for any use you have.

At the current 50% off sale price they are an excellent value.

Good Value
My first set of forstner bits. I've only used one bit so far.Based on everything I had read about it having a smooth bottom I had assumed it was entirely flat and smooth. The holes that I bored had a smaller pinpoint hole in the very center, which I predicted when I saw the actual bit construction. Not quite what I expected, but that's my own fault for not researching the item more carefully. The holes are very flat and smooth otherwise.
Great price; I saw similarly priced bit sets from other sources and their product reviews weren't as good, so I am glad I went with these.
And I love the case design!

Specifications Need Update
I just received a set and it appears to be a real bargain, especially at the sale price.  They are all marked as made in China, but today what isn't.  

The one problem I see at this point is the sheet of documentation that came with the bits.  For example, it recommends drilling into soft wood with the 1/4" bit at 3000 RPM.  However, the bit itself is engraved with the warning not to exceed 870 RPM.  The larger bits are marked not to exceed 620 RPM but the recommendation is to use them at 800 RPM in soft wood.  

I think I would go with the slower speeds for safety, but I also think the manufacturer and the packager should get together on a consistent message.

Good bits, GREAT Price!
I bought these about 6 months ago and hadn't had a chance to use them until the past few days.  I do custom woodworking and hate using "Spade" bits on oak, they tend to tear the wood more than I'd like.

I needed some Forstner Bits, but could never find a set that was in my price range for occasional use.  I came across this set at a Woodcraft Store in PA and got them while they were on sale.  It was the best money I spent while I was in PA.  I used the 1 1/4" bit to bore a countersink hole in oak and it tore thruogh it like a hot knife through butter.  I also used the 1/2" bit to bore a hole through a 4" block of oak for a lamp and on a slow speed in my Shopsmith Drill Press, it went right through without smoke or burn.

If you need a good set of bits, save your money on the expensive set and buy this one.  It's well worth the money!

For the price, I was amazed. Very nice.
A good, inexpensive set of bits, in a very nice case.  So far, I have only had the opportunity to use the 1/4" bit, but used it to drill into the end of a 1/2" diameter peg, and it worked great.

Good Value
Purchased for half off and used the 1 3/8 bit to cut 4 holes for Euro hinges in curly maple.  Used a drill guide and an 18V cordless drill.  Cut was clean, no burning and I didn't have to apply too much pressure.  For casual use this seems like a great value.

Not the best but good for the price
If you plan on using these bits on a regular basis they may dissapoint you.  They do not bore like a high end forstner bit but used on small projects they are the best bang for the dollar.  You need to be cautious and do not use hard preasure as they can burn as they go in the wood.

Great set of bits
This bit set is great for the price. I needed a 1/2 bit to drill about 60 stopped holes in some oak and the price of a single bit was half the price of this kit. That cant be beat. The bits that i have used so far have worked great and are holding there edge very well.

The cutters are sharp and the bits are more solid than other inexpensive sets I have looked at. I would recommend them to have on hand for all the odd sizes and for the one or two that get used all the time invest in a better bit. Works great fro me.

Forstner bit set in practical case
Before I bought this set, I used a similar quality set (China) in a professional woodworking shop. They cut through 2 inches of white oak quite admirably. While this set is not for the perfectionist, it cuts dog holes in my carving table without mishap. Having a graduated set is a big plus, as you never know when you have to move up to cover a goof or other error.

A gift I should have kept for myself!
I gave this Forstner set as a gift to my father, who is enjoying woodworking in his retirement.  The quality of the bits and the case were outstanding, and should provide quality service for many years.

It burns!
I'd been buying forstner bits one at a time, but when this set went on sale I thought I'd dive in. 

Two different bits in this set have been used so far, and both burn the wood badly. I thought that maybe it was my drill press, so I chucked up a chunk of maple on the lathe and tried with the 1" bit going an inch deep. Same thing there. Perhaps more forgiving woods will be ok, but maple and padauk get burned up pretty easily with these bits. My other ones don't have this problem, of course. But I paid more for each of those than I paid for this whole set.

fatastic bits
I have been looking for a cutter that could help me to cut a round hole for the connection of leg and face of chair. It is great and powerful.

Great Set For Beginners
This is a great and fairly inexpensive set of Forstner bits.  Great for amateur woodworkers looking for that first set of Forstner bits, very economically priced next to carbide tips.  They did their job much better than expected, but my only concern will be the eventual wear over time.

Smooth cutting in dense wood
Well designed case keeps bits sharp and stored.  The bits cut through dense tropical hardwoods I use for turning bowls.  Design leaves a nice bottom cut and removes the wood shavings very well.  A good bargain.
