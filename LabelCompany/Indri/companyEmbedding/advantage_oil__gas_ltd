 IT Solutions Tailored to Your Needs
Energy providers face unique challenges. Our experts can help you tackle them.
 






























You Need Security
Energy companies are a prime target for security breaches and face myriad serious threats, from individual hackers to foreign governments. The consequences of a security incident can be disastrous for both you and your customers. We can help protect your organization using industrial IT security.
First, we can help you assess your current cyberassets and vulnerabilities. Then we can work together to design an industrial cybersecurity strategy. We’ll help you draft a plan for what to do before, during and after a cyberattack, and then we’ll work with you to implement and deploy it.

$1.2 M
The estimated average financial loss caused by security incidents in the power and utilities sector

























You Need Support for a Mobile Workforce
When it comes to mobile, one device doesn’t fit all. Mobile workers in the energy industry can be traveling professionals who need to access business data on the road or field employees whose work is as diverse as drilling on a rig or delivering heating oil to customers. Consumer-grade equipment just won’t cut it — and neither will a consumer-grade mobile strategy.
Rugged devices need a ruggedized network. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) networks help you connect scattered sites and hardened equipment so you can remotely monitor and control operations. The benefits of a ruggedized approach are numerous, from greater automation to reduced environmental impact, not to mention improved collaboration between devices, people and systems.


Learn how to harness ruggedized networking and IoT to maximize business performance. Get the article.





































You Need High-Performance Computing and Analytics
As companies come under increasing pressure to make their operations as cost-efficient as possible, high-performance computing (HPC) is one area that can help you save time and money.
It’s already paying dividends across the industry. Thanks to supercomputing, digital technologies such as advanced sensors and data analytics can increase oil and gas production by up to 8 percent, reduce facility capital costs by up to 3 percent and lower operating costs by anywhere from 5 percent to 25 percent. Our high-performance offerings include InfiniBand architecture, 10 Gig-E switching, solid-state memory, high-availability/high-volume storage, high-performance servers and power management systems.
Discover more benefits of high-performance computing. Read about it.

Operations


“Industry Leading Low Costs & Capital Efficiencies”



The company is focused primarily on development and delineation of its world class Montney natural gas and liquids resource at Glacier, Alberta. Since 2008, production has grown to approximately 235 mmcfe/d (39,167 boe/d) and 2P reserves have increased to 2.2 Tcfe at December 31, 2016. Improved well results and lower costs reduced originally estimated capital requirements by over $177 million to execute our 2014 through 2016 growth plan. Upper, Middle & Lower Montney wells generate rates of return in excess of 50% at $2.50/mcf Cdn AECO prices and current liquids pricing.

Q1 2017 Production:
238 mmcfe/d (39,635 Boe/d)
97% natural gas
3% light oil & NGLs
P+P Reserves Life Index:
~27 years

The Glacier property is located adjacent to the provincial boundary between Alberta and British Columbia and is between the cities of Grande Prairie, Alberta and Dawson Creek, British Columbia.

Click to enlarge

The total thickness of the Montney at Glacier is approximately 300 metres and lends itself to multiple layers of development which contributes to an inventory of >1,100 future well locations within this resource play. This is sufficient to maintain production of 245 mmcfe/d for approximately 50 years.
Since the spud of the first horizontal well in July 2008, as of December 31, 2016, Advantage has drilled 181 horizontal wells at its Glacier property. In addition, two vertical wells drilled into the underlying Belloy Formation are used for acid gas disposal and two vertical wells and one horizontal well are used as service wells that support our water disposal system.
Advantage holds an additional 87 net sections of Montney acreage in close proximity to the producing Glacier asset that will be evaluated for prospective natural gas and liquids potential. These lands will see development in the future with the majority of production planned to be processed at the Glacier gas plant. In aggregate Advantage now holds 178 net sections of land with Montney potential for both natural gas and NGLs.

Advantage has continued with its program to delineate the Glacier land block by drilling and testing wells in the liquids rich Middle Montney formation. To date, a total of 24 horizontal wells and 3 vertical recompletions have been tested and or produced, confirming the presence of liquids across Glacier with liquid yields up to 83 bbls/mmcf in the eastern half of the land block. This development has resulted in significant delineation and de-risking of the liquid rich Middle Montney resource potential at Glacier.







Advantage owns and operates a 100% working interest gas plant located at 5-02-76-12W6. The Glacier gas plant has a current throughput capacity of 260 MMcf/d of raw  gas. A major expansion of the plant was announced in 2016 to increase the capacity to 400 MMcf/d including the 6,800 bbls/d of C3+ liquid extraction. All gas is sold through Advantage’s 100% owned sales pipeline into the TransCanada pipeline system. Combined operating costs at our Glacier field and plant are the lowest among the Montney producers at less than $0.25/mcfe.

Corporate Responsibility



Health Safety & EnvironmentCommunity WellnessCorporate Governance

Health Safety & Environment
Health
…fostering healthy employees, families and communities…
Advantage values the health of all our employees, contractors, and our neighbours in the communities where we live and work. Part of our commitment to the health of our staff is to ensure a safe, respectful and rewarding working environment.


Safety
…this is how we work…
Safety is a key part of everyone’s responsibility at Advantage and not just when it is convenient or deemed necessary. We have strong commitment and engagement from our Board of Directors, Senior Executives and all our staff including our field and contract workers. Advantage will provide the training and resources to create a safe working environment, because our goal is for everyone to return home safely at the end of every day and to extend that philosophy to their own personal activities.

Environment
…actively protecting the environment…
Advantage’s operations are located in northwest Alberta. We are aware of the impact our operations may have on all stakeholders including animal habitat, water sources, and air quality. We plan and operate in a manner that minimizes environmental impacts and meets or exceeds regulatory requirements. We are actively working with the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) on developing industry best practices in the Montney to optimize resource recovery while balancing stakeholder interests.
Examples of what we are doing to minimize our impact on the environment:

Pad drilling to reduce surface disturbance;
Bi-fuel conversion to natural gas from diesel on drilling rigs and frac pumping equipment;
Waste water re-used for operations (40% of completions water needs are sourced from recycled industry water)
Reduced GHG emissions (CO2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) are re-injected rather than flared to the atmosphere)
Drilling fluid recovery process allows better clean-up of drill cuttings
Top decile AER Licensee Liability Rating (LLR) of 25.37 demonstrates Advantage has one of the highest asset to liability coverage ratios in the industry for covering the costs of well and facility abandonment.
100% satisfactory inspection rating by the AER in 2016 demonstrates the adherence to high quality standards in all our field operations and pipelines
98% Audit score in the Alberta OH&S’s Certificate of Recognition program.

“Industry Leading Low Costs & Capital Efficiencies”



The company is focused primarily on development and delineation of its world class Montney natural gas and liquids resource at Glacier, Alberta. Since 2008, production has grown to approximately 235 mmcfe/d (39,167 boe/d) and 2P reserves have increased to 2.2 Tcfe at December 31, 2016. Improved well results and lower costs reduced originally estimated capital requirements by over $177 million to execute our 2014 through 2016 growth plan. Upper, Middle & Lower Montney wells generate rates of return in excess of 50% at $2.50/mcf Cdn AECO prices and current liquids pricing.

Q1 2017 Production:
238 mmcfe/d (39,635 Boe/d)
97% natural gas
3% light oil & NGLs
P+P Reserves Life Index:
~27 years

The Glacier property is located adjacent to the provincial boundary between Alberta and British Columbia and is between the cities of Grande Prairie, Alberta and Dawson Creek, British Columbia.

The total thickness of the Montney at Glacier is approximately 300 metres and lends itself to multiple layers of development which contributes to an inventory of >1,100 future well locations within this resource play. This is sufficient to maintain production of 245 mmcfe/d for approximately 50 years.
Since the spud of the first horizontal well in July 2008, as of December 31, 2016, Advantage has drilled 181 horizontal wells at its Glacier property. In addition, two vertical wells drilled into the underlying Belloy Formation are used for acid gas disposal and two vertical wells and one horizontal well are used as service wells that support our water disposal system.
Advantage holds an additional 87 net sections of Montney acreage in close proximity to the producing Glacier asset that will be evaluated for prospective natural gas and liquids potential. These lands will see development in the future with the majority of production planned to be processed at the Glacier gas plant. In aggregate Advantage now holds 178 net sections of land with Montney potential for both natural gas and NGLs.

Advantage has continued with its program to delineate the Glacier land block by drilling and testing wells in the liquids rich Middle Montney formation. To date, a total of 24 horizontal wells and 3 vertical recompletions have been tested and or produced, confirming the presence of liquids across Glacier with liquid yields up to 83 bbls/mmcf in the eastern half of the land block. This development has resulted in significant delineation and de-risking of the liquid rich Middle Montney resource potential at Glacier.







Advantage owns and operates a 100% working interest gas plant located at 5-02-76-12W6. The Glacier gas plant has a current throughput capacity of 260 MMcf/d of raw  gas. A major expansion of the plant was announced in 2016 to increase the capacity to 400 MMcf/d including the 6,800 bbls/d of C3+ liquid extraction. All gas is sold through Advantage’s 100% owned sales pipeline into the TransCanada pipeline system. Combined operating costs at our Glacier field and plant are the lowest among the Montney producers at less than $0.25/mcfe.

Current AAV Stock Info




 


Canada based Advantage Oil and Gas (ticker: AAV) is focused primarily on its Montney natural gas assets in Glacier, Alberta.
Source: Advantage Oil and Gas LTD
The Montney assets produce approximately 235 Mscf/day, and Advantage’s 2P reserves were increased to 2.2 Tcfe as of December 31st, 2016.
1,100 future drilling locations should provide 245 Mmcfe/day for 50 years
Advantage has inventoried over 1,100 future well locations in the approximately 300 meter thick Montney, and expects that the shale play can maintain production of 245 Mmcfe/day for approximately 50 years.
Between July, 2008 and December 31st, 2016, the company has drilled 181 horizontal wells in its Glacier asset.
Advantage currently possesses 87 net sections of acreage close to its Glacier asset, which it intends to evaluate for production potential. Including the 87 net sections, Advantage holds a total of 178 net sections in the Montney shale—equivalent to approximately 113,920 net acres.
In Q1, 2017, Advantage added 24 net sections to its Progress field —equivalent to 15,360 net acres—for $6 million.
Benefits to Advantage derivatives
Advantage owns 100% working interest of the Glacier gas plant, which has a 260 Mmcf/day raw gas capacity, with a planned 400 Mmcf/day raw gas and 6,800 BOPD NGL expansion announced in 2016. Advantage’s ownership of its gas plant, as well as the distribution lines leading to the TransCanada pipeline grants it operating costs of approximately $0.25/Mcfe.
Growth for shareholders
From December 13th, 2013 to December 31st, 2016, Advantage showed a 98% total shareholder return. This compares to a 23% return from the S&P/TSX Composite Index, a -11% total return from the S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index, and a -18% total return from the S&P/TSX Exploration & Production GICS Sub Industry.
Source: Advantage Oil and Gas LTD
In keeping with Advantage’s strong position, the company has outlined plans to grow its production by 56% from 2017 to 2019—an expansion from 221 Mmcfe/day to 325 Mmcfe/day. To accomplish this growth, Advantage reports that it will only need 83 of its 1,100 future drill locations in the Glacier area.
The future of Advantage’s gas
Advantage expects that the additional gas it will extract will find markets in North America, which Advantage believes will undergo a demand increase to approximately 9 Bcf/day between 2017 and 2021.
Advantage also believes that delays in U.S. pipeline construction in the Northeast will provide Canadian gas and gas transportation with a competitive advantage.
Advantage is presenting at EnerCom’s The Oil & Gas Conference®
Advantage Oil and Gas LTD will be a presenting company at the upcoming EnerCom conference in Denver, Colorado—The Oil & Gas Conference® 22.
The conference is EnerCom’s 22nd Denver-based oil and gas focused investor conference, bringing together publicly traded E&Ps and oilfield service and technology companies with institutional investors.  The conference will be at the Denver Downtown Westin Hotel, August 13-17, 2017.

Advantage Oil & Gas Ltd. is a Canadian oil and gas company based in Calgary, Alberta. The company owns and operates numerous properties located in Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan, producing the equivalent of 35,000 barrels (5,600 m3) of oil per day in late 2007.[2]
In May 2006, the company, then structured as a royalty trust named Advantage Energy Income Fund, merged with another Calgary-based oil and gas trust, Ketch Resources.
The company claims its reserves to have a lifetime of 11.8 years at the current production rate, although it actively seeks to acquire new properties. In 2007, 65% of its production was natural gas, and 35% light oils and NGLs.[3]

 IT Solutions Tailored to Your Needs
Energy providers face unique challenges. Our experts can help you tackle them.
 






























You Need Security
Energy companies are a prime target for security breaches and face myriad serious threats, from individual hackers to foreign governments. The consequences of a security incident can be disastrous for both you and your customers. We can help protect your organization using industrial IT security.
First, we can help you assess your current cyberassets and vulnerabilities. Then we can work together to design an industrial cybersecurity strategy. We’ll help you draft a plan for what to do before, during and after a cyberattack, and then we’ll work with you to implement and deploy it.

You Need Support for a Mobile Workforce
When it comes to mobile, one device doesn’t fit all. Mobile workers in the energy industry can be traveling professionals who need to access business data on the road or field employees whose work is as diverse as drilling on a rig or delivering heating oil to customers. Consumer-grade equipment just won’t cut it — and neither will a consumer-grade mobile strategy.
Rugged devices need a ruggedized network. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) networks help you connect scattered sites and hardened equipment so you can remotely monitor and control operations. The benefits of a ruggedized approach are numerous, from greater automation to reduced environmental impact, not to mention improved collaboration between devices, people and systems.


Learn how to harness ruggedized networking and IoT to maximize business performance. Get the article.





































You Need High-Performance Computing and Analytics
As companies come under increasing pressure to make their operations as cost-efficient as possible, high-performance computing (HPC) is one area that can help you save time and money.
It’s already paying dividends across the industry. Thanks to supercomputing, digital technologies such as advanced sensors and data analytics can increase oil and gas production by up to 8 percent, reduce facility capital costs by up to 3 percent and lower operating costs by anywhere from 5 percent to 25 percent. Our high-performance offerings include InfiniBand architecture, 10 Gig-E switching, solid-state memory, high-availability/high-volume storage, high-performance servers and power management systems.

Advantage Oil & Gas Ltd. is a Canadian oil and gas company based in Calgary, Alberta. The company owns and operates numerous properties located in Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan, producing the equivalent of 35,000 barrels (5,600 m3) of oil per day in late 2007.[2]
In May 2006, the company, then structured as a royalty trust named Advantage Energy Income Fund, merged with another Calgary-based oil and gas trust, Ketch Resources.
The company claims its reserves to have a lifetime of 11.8 years at the current production rate, although it actively seeks to acquire new properties. In 2007, 65% of its production was natural gas, and 35% light oils and NGLs.[3]
