Carolee Friedlander cites her own drive as the secret of her success

1 / 9

Carolee Friedlander turned a small Greenwich business into an international brand, but she said the secret of her success was not a difficult one to crack.
"I've been told I'm inspirational, but for me it was just working," Friedlander said. "I would always work hard but I was also so stubborn and brought such perseverance that if one more person told me it couldn't be done that way I made sure it was. I think a lot of my success is just due to the fact I would not take no for an answer and none of you should either."



Friedlander spoke Wednesday at the Greenwich Chamber of Commerce's Women Who Matter luncheon. Chamber President and CEO Marcia O'Kane called Friedlander a role model for her hard work founding Carolee Jewelry and Accessories, which sold to a billion-dollar company, and then forming another business.
Friedlander shared her story about beginning her jewelry company and about the formation of Access Circles, a by-invitation network of women which focuses financial education and health and wellness. 
Founding Carolee Jewelry and Accessories required the creativity and skill to design custom jewelry which met with international acclaim, she said, but it wasn't a simple task. Friedlander recalled going for a loan at a Greenwich bank to buy the building that would become her first store and being told her husband needed to co-sign, even though she owned the business and she owned her house.
To the sound of laughter, Friedlander revealed the bank did not get her business. With another bank, she bought the building and began to establishing herself and her brand. 
To make her business a success while also raising a family, Friedlander said she relied on her own drive to get her jewelry sold in major department stores.
"I would not go away until finally someone would see me," Friedlander said. "I was so relentless and I shouldn't put it in the past tense. I am still relentless. I think one needs to be incredibly so in order to succeed."
Friedlander also praised the team -- many of them women -- she put together for her ventures, and said she couldn't have done it without them. 
"What I learned early on was that I had certain skills but I was going to need a lot," Friedlander said. "If I could find people who were smarter than I was and had those skills, wouldn't that be fantastic?"
Her team-building experience showed her the importance of having a network of women providing answers and support, she said.
"If you ever have a chance to join a network do it, you never know what will come from it," Friedlander said, praising the work of the Chamber of Commerce and O'Kane for having the annual Women Who Matter luncheon, which is in its third year. 
"Being in a network taught me the value of being able to sit next to someone and ask, `So what do you do about this?' and `How do you handle that?'"
Friedlander said Access Circles was inspired by her realization that many women don't have financial information they should. 
She said there were three things every woman needed to know:  what their current assets are, whose names were the titles in and where they were kept. Friedlander told the crowd if they didn't know the information, they had to find it out because they were going to need it someday.
Friedlander told the crowd of 85 that she did not go to business school and was glad she hadn't. If she had followed the rigid teachings of a business school, she wouldn't be where she was, she said.
It might be a good path for some women, but it wasn't what she needed or wanted.
"If you follow the beaten path, you're going to go down a beaten path," Friedlander said. "You have to challenge things and think perhaps there's another way to do something or another way to think about something. That's a good thing." 
Friedlander admitted she could be a little "off center" at times, but said it was an asset, allowing her take needed risks.
"I think taking risks if you're convinced you can make it happen are worth taking," Friedlander said. "We had products that were totally unique and different from anyone else's. We had a level of service that was unheard of. We guaranteed our jewelry and I would get calls at 11 at night in the office from an old lady in Kansas telling me her frog had lost her eye. We would replace that frog. Think about what that said about the value of our brand."
