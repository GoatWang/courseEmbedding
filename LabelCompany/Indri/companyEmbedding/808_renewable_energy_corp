BP has the largest operated renewable energy business of any major international oil and gas company. In the United States, its renewable assets include 14 onshore wind farms located everywhere from the Hawaiian island of Maui to the green hills of northeast Pennsylvania. The company’s U.S. wind farms have a gross generating capacity of 2,259 megawatts. That’s enough electricity to power all the homes in a city the size of Philadelphia.

BP directly operates 13 wind farms — in Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Texas — while holding an interest in a separate wind facility in Hawaii. The company estimates that, in 2015, a net wind portfolio the size of BP’s helped avoid nearly 3 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions. To put that number in perspective, it is equivalent to:

the annual electricity-related emissions of around 400,000 typical homes;
the emissions produced by burning roughly 2.9 billion pounds of coal;
or the emissions produced by consuming more than 300 million gallons of gasoline. 

Every BP-operated wind farm receives round-the-clock support from on-site personnel and/or from BP’s Remote Operations Center (ROC) in downtown Houston. During normal business hours, operators at individual wind farms manage their sites. During off-hours, weekends and holidays, operators at the ROC take control.

Using advanced technology, ROC teams centrally monitor all BP sites — 24 hours a day, seven days a week — while working with colleagues in the field to enhance performance, reliability and safety. ROC monitoring systems capture turbine availability, power generation capacity, wind speed, weather and other critical factors. An embedded alarm system immediately notifies operators of potential problems, such as approaching storms or flash flood warnings.

Whether in the the High Plains of Kansas, or anywhere else the company has wind operations, BP works hard to prevent its business from affecting local wildlife and habitats. For example, it voluntarily adjusts the movement of wind turbines to reduce their impact on bat populations during peak migration season.

“We are always focused on safety and sustainability in everything we do at our wind farms,” says BP Wind Energy CEO Laura Folse. “Our staffers at the ROC provide an extra set of eyes and help our people in the field work safely and responsibly.”
The Benefits of Wind Power
Wind power is safe, clean and increasingly affordable – with the potential for production on a much larger scale.
As a low-carbon energy source, the use of wind reduces the amount of carbon produced to meet the world’s energy needs. We estimate that BP Wind Energy’s wind energy generation in 2015 alone offset nearly 3 million tons of CO2 in 2015, which is equivalent to the annual emissions from approximately 246,000 typical homes, according to the BP 2015 Sustainability Report.
As wind turbine technology has continued to evolve and improve, wind farms using new generation technology can produce more energy at an ever-decreasing cost – a cost that is becoming increasingly competitive in the overall energy marketplace.
At BP Wind Energy, we are committed to playing a central role in mapping the future of this important and exciting segment of the energy sector.

About

808 RENEWABLE ENERGY CORPORATION
A leading investor and manager of green energy  alternative investments.
Formed in 2008, 808 Renewable Energy Corporation is focused exclusively on cogeneration; combined heat and power (CHP) renewable    energy projects throughout California and the Western United States.
 808 provides public entities and commercial and industrial firms    with cost-free installation or recommissioning of on-site plants as    well as ongoing enhancements, operations and maintenance to    maximize energy efficiency, resulting in a 10% to 15% average    energy cost savings per user.
808 is distinguished by our: 
			         12 specialized professionals with over 100 years combined     experience in clean energy and related alternative investment     acquisition, business management, and operations.
 Highly scalable business model which benefits from     extensive operating margins and generates demonstrable,     sustainable and growing cogeneration investor returns.
 "Second generation' mover advantage specifically focused     on deep discount investment opportunities in distressed     and/or under-utilized real cogeneration assets with     'middle market' energy users, the largest segment of     total U.S. energy consumption.
 Our existing base of distressed CHP assets, and an     extensive network of relationships with both existing     and available distressed CHP opportunities and     strategic and regulatory partners. 







BENEFITS OF COGENERATION
A cleaner and renewable energy technology.
Combined Heat and Power is the    production of electricity by    combustion of a fuel like natural    gas, biomass, biogas or coal    and the capture of generated    thermal energy.  Nearly 84% of    COGEN units use natural gas.
 Cogeneration is the use of a heat     engine or a power plant to    simultaneously generate both    electricity and heat.  In the separate production of electricity, some energy must be rejected as waste    heat but in cogeneration this thermal energy is put to good use.      By capturing the excess heat, cogeneration uses heat that would    otherwise be wasted in a conventional power plant and converts    it to useful electricity, heat or air conditioning.
 A typical cogeneration system consists of an engine, steam    turbine or a combustion turbine that drives an electrical generator.     A waste heat exchanger recovers waste heat from the engine    and/or exhaust gas to produce hot water or steam.  
		        
As a thermodynamically efficient use of fuel, cogeneration    produces a given amount of electric power and process heat    with 10% to 30% less fuel than it takes to produce electricity    and process heat separately.  As a result, less fuel is consumed    to produce the same amount of useful energy thereby reducing    fuel consumption and dramatically reducing pollution produced    in the form of greenhouse gases.

BENEFITS OF COGENERATION
Cogeneration Industry Outlook:
U.S. Domestic cogeneration currently represents over 3,364 sites    and 85,184 megawatts (MW) of generating capacity, which is 8%    of total U.S. generating capacity.  The U.S. could generate about    20% of domestic electricity with heat that is currently wasted.
 California has more than 776 cogeneration plants operating with    capacity of about 9,130 MW; producing more COGEN power than    any other state.  The total viable market in California approaches    30,000 MW.
 808 has targeted California and the Western United States as our    initial geographic market.  The total existing and potential market for    CHP in the 200 KW to 1 MW size in those areas is 163,000 sites with    12,200 MW of generating capacity representing $12 billion of annual    electricity revenue and $7 billion of heat and hot water revenue. 
 808's existing plants and primary target markets are sites with    generation capacity from about 200 KW to 5 MW.  These systems    with capacity of less than 5MW account for 3.2% of total capacity    (about 300 MW) and are more weighted toward commercial,    institutional, lighter industrial and food facilities.  
80% of the 2,000 MW of new capacity expected to come online by    2020 will be in the smaller sized facilities that produce less than 5 MW.

THE 808 INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY
Through our experience, proprietary management and operations tech-nology, and our market positioning advantage in distressed COGEN assets, 808 has to date acquired over 50 COGEN plants secured through long term Energy Supply Contracts.  We currently own and operate over 11 megawatts (MW) of power thereby reducing their users energy bills while providing efficiencies which reduce their carbon footprint.
With $15 million in capital already invested since inception, 808 currently has well over an additional $100 million worth of cogeneration and biogas projects in our pipeline.  In addition, through our extensive network of relationships in the California energy markets, our demonstrated performance history in COGEN management and our strong reputation with utility regulators, we are being approached with new opportunities  each week.  All told, 808 Renewable Energy has over 300 MW of additional existing CHP plants targeted for future acquisitions.

Based on these current and foreseeable opportunities and with our initial build-out phase completed, 808 is focused on maximizing investor returns through our sustainable and scalable model.  We are now accepting additional accredited investor capital of up to $50 million in total expansion stage capital from our existing and potential investor partners.  
808's energy projects generate net income for our accredited investor partners through long term recurring revenue, monthly cash flow and pro-rata participation in profits from the sale of energy; as well as pass-thru of CHP specific Federal, State and utility company rebates and tax credits.

With respect to shares of our common stock that may be offered and sold from 
time to time by the selling stockholders, we will receive no proceeds from the 
sale of shares of our common stock pursuant to this offering.


We believe that the primary competition for our energy services is from existing
electric utilities. In our current market of California, we compete with 
Southern California Edison, San Diego Gas & Electric and Pacific Gas & Electric.
Those companies are much larger than we are in terms of revenues, assets and 
resources. We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of cost. We aim to 
compete with large utility companies by selling electricity to the individual 
commercial building customers at rates lower than those offered by such 
utilities. However, we typically only supply a portion of the electricity needs 
of the building. The remaining portion is supplied by the electric utility. Our 
contracts generally provide that the price of energy is a fixed percentage less 
than the price that otherwise would be charged by our customer’s utility 
company.

We do not manufacture CHP units or other related components. For example, we 
use internal combustion engines manufactured by other companies to generate the 
energy that we sell to customers. In most cases, we view the manufacturers as 
suppliers of equipment and not as competitors. However, such manufacturers may 
sell their equipment directly to end users who are sophisticated enough to 
install and operate the equipment. The primary manufacturers of such internal 
combustion engines are Hess Microgen, Caterpillar Inc., Cummins Power 
Generation Inc. and Waukesha Engine, a subsidiary of General Electric Company. 
We have installed Hess Microgen or Waukesha Engine engines at all of our 
locations.

Manufacturers such as General Electric Company, Caterpillar Inc. and Waukesha 
Engine have the infrastructure to manufacture CHP units but are not designed to 
provide the services we do on a site-by-site basis. Large energy companies like 
General Electric Company and British Petroleum are starting to add alternative 
energy technologies to their portfolios. These companies are focusing on large 
scale wind, solar and fuel cell projects, while we are able to focus on smaller 
onsite power generation projects. Some companies producing cogeneration systems 
that are potential competitors to us include Capstone Turbine Corporation, Flex 
Energy and General Electric Company.

Additionally, we compete against providers of alternative energy. The 
alternative energy market is emerging rapidly. Many companies are developing 
alternative and renewable energy sources, including solar power, wind power, 
fuel cells and micro-turbines. Some of the companies in this sector include 
General Electric Company, BP p.l.c, Royal Dutch Shell and SunEdison, a division 
of MEMC Electronic Materials, Inc.; Plug Power, Inc. and FuelCell Energy, Inc. 
(in the fuel cell space); and Capstone Turbine Corporation, Ingersoll Rand PLC 
and Elliott Turbomachinery, a division of the Elliott Group, Inc. (in the 
micro-turbine space). The effect of these developing technologies on our 
business is difficult to predict but has not had a measurable effect on our 
target market to date.

Some of our competitors are large companies that tackle energy efficiency for 
the entire building, including water usage, light bulb efficiency and other 
interior modifications. We focus on one area, which allows us to provide faster 
results and cost savings that large scale energy reduction projects cannot 
produce, as they must gather massive amounts of data and budgeting approvals. A 
few local companies are attempting to offer technologies similar to ours. 
However, we operate only CHP plants and specialize in this technology and niche 
market. Since the inception of our company, we have retained technicians who 
have experience in CHP equipment and technology, and we believe we have the 
proven experience to cover sites all over California.

There are a number of energy service companies that offer related services. 
These companies include Siemens AG, Honeywell International Inc. and Johnson 
Controls Inc. In general, these companies do not target individual buildings – 
our target market. Because we focus on smaller projects for energy supply, we 
believe that such companies do not attempt to compete directly with our 
services.

There are a few emerging cogeneration developers, such as American DG Energy, 
that offer services similar to ours. However, we have not identified any that 
focuses primarily on our market of California.


Company Description
808 Renewable Energy Corporation was formed as a Nevada corporation in May 2009 
for the purpose of acquiring, developing, owning and managing renewable and 
efficient energy projects throughout the United States. Before forming 808 R
enewable Energy Corporation, we operated 808 Energy 3, LLC, a


 Nevada limited 
liability company formed in January 2009 for the purpose of acquiring, 
re-commissioning and operating distributed generation energy facilities, also 
known as combined heat and power plants. On August 20, 2010, 808 Renewable 
acquired all of the then-outstanding units of membership interest of 808 Energy 
3, LLC not then already owned by 808 Renewable, thereby making 808 Energy 3, 
LLC a wholly-owned subsidiary of 808 Renewable. We also acquired 808 Energy 2, 
LLC, a Nevada limited liability company formed in August 2008 to acquire the 
CHP plant located at Pacific Clay Products, Inc. in Lake Elsinore, California. 
Effective as of June 30, 2011, 808 Renewable acquired all of the then-
outstanding units of membership interest of 808 Energy 2, LLC not then already 
owned by 808 Renewable, thereby making 808 Energy 2, LLC a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of 808 Renewable.

Being wholly-owned subsidiaries of 808 Renewable immediately before such event, 
both 808 Energy 3, LLC and 808 Energy 2, LLC were dissolved as of April 23, 
2012, at which time all property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of 
808 Energy 3, LLC and 808 Energy 2, LLC vested in 808 Renewable, and all debts, 
liabilities and duties of 808 Energy 3, LLC and 808 Energy 2, LLC became the 
debts, liabilities and duties of 808 Renewable.

Our principal executive offices are located at 13888 Harbor Boulevard, Suite 8A,
Garden Grove, California 92843. Our telephone number is (714) 891-8282, and our 
website address is www.808RenewableEnergy.com.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2: - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Forward-Looking Statements  This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are projections of events, revenues, income, future economic performance or management's plans and objectives for future operations. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of terminology such as "may", "should", "expects", "plans", "anticipates", "believes", "estimates", "predicts", "potential" or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Examples of forward-looking statements made in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q includes statements about:  · our marketing plan;  · our plans to hire industry experts and expand our management team;  · our beliefs regarding the future of our competitors;  · our anticipated development schedule;  · the anticipated benefits of our product;  · our expectation that the demand for our products will eventually increase; and  · our expectation that we will be able to raise capital when we need it.  These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including:  · general economic and business conditions;  · we may have product liability claims;  · we may not be successful in commercialization of our products;  · regulatory changes may hurt the market for our products;  · we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights;  · our auditors have issued a going concern opinion regarding our company;  · competition for, among other things, capital, products and skilled personnel; and  · other factors discussed under the section entitled "Risk Factors",  any of which may cause our company's or our industry's actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.  While these forward-looking statements and any assumptions upon which they are based are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions or other future performance suggested herein. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.  As used in this report, the terms "we", "us" and "our" mean 808 Renewable Energy Corporation, a Nevada corporation. In this report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to "common shares" refer to the common shares in our capital stock.  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and plan of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.  - 7 -  Corporate Overview  808 Renewable Energy Corporation (the "Company", "we", "our") was formed as a Nevada corporation in May 2009 for the purpose of acquiring, developing, owning and managing renewable and efficient energy projects throughout the United States. Before forming 808 Renewable Energy Corporation, we operated 808 Energy 3, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company formed in January 2009 for the purpose of acquiring, re-commissioning and operating distributed generation ("DG") energy facilities, also known as combined heat and power ("CHP") plants. On August 20, 2010, 808 Renewable acquired all of the then-outstanding units of membership interest of 808 Energy 3, LLC not then already owned by 808 Renewable, thereby making 808 Energy 3, LLC a wholly-owned subsidiary of 808 Renewable. We also acquired 808 Energy 2, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company formed in August 2008 to acquire the CHP plant located at Pacific Clay Products, Inc. in Lake Elsinore, California. Effective as of June 30, 2011, 808 Renewable acquired all of the then-outstanding units of membership interest of 808 Energy 2, LLC not then already owned by 808 Renewable, thereby making 808 Energy 2, LLC a wholly-owned subsidiary of 808 Renewable.  Our principal executive offices are located at 13888 Harbor Boulevard, Suite 8A, Garden Grove, California 92843. Our telephone number is (714) 891-8282, and our website address is www.808RenewableEnergy.com.  808 Renewable Energy, or the Company, distributes, owns and operates clean, on-site energy systems that produce electricity, hot water, heat and cooling. Our business model includes ownership of the equipment that we install at customers' facilities and the sale of the energy produced by these systems to the customers on a long-term contractual basis. We also provide engineering and other professional services to clients who own their own on-site energy systems, but require assistance in their operation and maintenance.  We offer natural gas powered cogeneration systems that are highly reliable and energy efficient. Our cogeneration systems produce electricity from an internal combustion engine driving a generator, while the heat from the engine and exhaust is recovered and typically used to produce heat and hot water for use at the site. We also distribute and operate water chiller systems for building cooling applications that operate in a similar manner, except that the engine's power drives a large air-conditioning compressor while recovering heat for hot water. Cogeneration systems reduce the amount of electricity that the customer must purchase from the local utility and produce valuable heat and hot water for the site to use as required. By simultaneously providing electricity, hot water and heat, cogeneration systems also have a significant, positive impact on the environment by reducing the carbon or CO 2 produced by offsetting the traditional energy supplied by the electric grid and conventional hot water boilers.  Our customers pay us for energy produced on site at a rate that is a certain percentage below the rate at which the utility companies provide them electrical and natural gas services. We measure the actual amount of electrical and thermal energy produced and charge our customers accordingly. We agree to install, operate, maintain and repair our energy systems at our sole cost and expense. We also agree to obtain any necessary permits or regulatory approvals at our sole expense. Our agreements are generally for a term of up to 15 years, with renewable provisions upon the mutual agreement of the parties  For the customers that want to own their CHP system, we offer our "turn-key" option whereby we provide equipment, systems engineering, and installation; interconnect approvals, on-site labor and startup services needed to bring the complete CHP system on-line. For some customers, we are also paid a fee to operate the systems and charge for those systems on a negotiated basis.  Revenues from operation and maintenance services are recorded when provided and verified.  - 8 -  We have experienced total net losses since inception of approximately $16,310,079. For the foreseeable future, we expect to experience continuing operating losses and negative cash flows from operations as our management executes our current business plan. The cash, cash equivalents and line of credit available from our CEO, Patrick Carter, available at June 30, 2014 will provide sufficient working capital to meet our anticipated expenditures including installations of new equipment for the next twelve months; however, as we continue to grow our business by adding more energy systems, the cash requirements will increase. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and line of credit available at June 30, 2014 and our ability to control certain costs, including those related to general and administrative expenses, will enable us to meet our anticipated cash expenditures through March 31, 2015. Beyond March 31, 2015, we may need to raise additional capital through a debt financing or equity offering to meet our operating and capital needs. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in our fundraising efforts or that additional funds will be available on acceptable terms, if at all.  In 2012, we raised $2,794,339 minus $463,350 issuance costs from the sale of common shares, through private placements; $70,000 from the sale of preferred shares, and $900,000 from the sale of a convertible note. If we are unable to raise additional capital in 2014 we may need to terminate and/or adjust our current business plan. Financial considerations may cause us to modify planned deployment of new energy systems and we may decide to suspend installations until we are able to secure additional working capital. We will evaluate possible acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, technologies and products that are complementary to our business; however, we are not currently engaged in such discussions.  The Company's operations are comprised of several business segments. The selling of energy in the form of electricity, heat, hot water and cooling to our customers under long-term sales agreements; the sale of professional services to clients that own their own distributed generating and CHP plants.  Critical Accounting Policies  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management believes the following critical accounting policies involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.  Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Amortization  Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to write off the cost of the applicable assets over their estimated useful lives. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.  Project assets consist of costs of materials, direct labor, outside contract services and project development costs incurred in connection with the construction of the small-scale renewable energy plants that the Company owns. Depreciation is, generally, recorded on a straight line basis beginning in the month that operations commence over the assets estimated useful lives ranging from 10 to 20 years. Routine maintenance costs, to the extent that they do not extend the life of the asset, are expensed in the year they are incurred.  The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. This analysis is performed by comparing the respective carrying values of the assets to the current and expected future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, to be generated from such assets. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the long-lived assets. Loss on long-lived assets to be disposed of is determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for the cost of disposal. Based on its review, the Company found no need to recognize impairment expense, for the six months ended June 30, 2014 or for the year ended December 31, 2013.  - 9 -  Revenue Recognition  The Company derives revenue from energy efficiency and renewable energy products and services, which includes the design, engineering, and construction of energy systems that produce electricity, heat or cooling from renewable sources of energy. The Company enters into long-term energy sales agreements (with a typical term of 10 to 15 years) with customers, whereby these energy systems are owned by the Company and are installed in customers' buildings. As of June 30, 2014, the Company had 6 operating energy systems.  Each month, the Company obtains readings from its energy meters to determine the amount of energy produced for each customer. The Company multiplies these readings by the appropriate published price of energy (electricity) from its customers' local energy utility, and the energy services agreement entered into with each customer, to derive the value of the monthly energy sales, less the applicable negotiated discount. The Company's revenues per customer, on a monthly basis, will vary based on the amount of energy produced by its energy systems and the published price of energy (electricity, natural gas or oil) obtained from its customers' local energy utility.  The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned, and therefore only recognizes revenue on energy systems once those systems become operational. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of equipment upon installation and recognizes revenue on professional services in accordance with the contract entered into with the customer.  The Company must meet all of the following four criteria in order to recognize revenue:  ? Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ? Delivery has occurred  ? The sales price is fixed or determinable  ? Collection is reasonably assured  Payments received in advance of satisfaction of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are recorded as advances from customers.  Impact of New Accounting Pronouncements  The Company does not expect the impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  Results of Operations  For the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared with the six months ended June 30, 2013  Revenues, from the delivery and sale of electricity and related products, including professional services, for the six months ended June 30, 2014 were $202,402 compared to $588,628 for the same period in 2013, a decrease of $386,226 or 65.6%. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to a decrease in the number of installed CHP systems operating throughout the six months compared to the same period in 2013. We generated $6,321 of energy developer revenue in 2014 compared to none for the same period in 2013.  During the first six months of 2014, the Company operated 22 CHP energy systems, representing 2,064,205 kWh of total energy sold, compared to 30CHP energy systems, representing 4,505,558 kWh of installed electricity plus thermal energy for the same period in 2013, a decrease of 54.2%. The energy production revenue per customer on a monthly basis is based on the sum of the amount of energy produced by the Company's energy systems and the prevailing price of energy (electricity, natural gas or oil) from its customers' local energy utility that month, less the discounts the Company provides its customers. The Company's Energy Production revenues commence as new energy systems become operational, and the Company typically sells energy in the form of electricity, heat, hot water and cooling.  - 10 -  Cost of Sales  Cost of sales, including depreciation, of $171,771 was $394,193 compared to $762,109 including depreciation of $171,671 for the same period in 2013, a decrease of $367,916, or 48.3%. The cost of fuel was $118,723 for the six months of 2014, compared to $309,842 for the same period in 2013, a decrease of $191,119 or 61.7% primarily due to lower run hours at our CHP plants.  During the first six months of 2014, our gross margins were (94.8%) compared to (29.5%) for the same period in 2013, primarily due to the decrease in our CHP plant revenue and the stubbornly high fuel prices during the six months ended June 30, 2014. Our CHP energy margins excluding depreciation were at (10%) for the six months of 2014, compared to (.003%) for the same period in 2013.  Operating Expenses  Our operating expenses consist of executive staff, accounting and legal expenses, office space, general insurance and other administrative expenses. Our operating expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2014 were $1,074,114, after including $375,000 of stock based compensation, paid to our directors for services provided during 2013 and 2014, plus $300,000 of stock based compensation paid to two previous employees for past services, compared to $510,445 for the same period in 2013, an decrease of $111,330 or 21.8% after removing the stock based compensation. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in internal payroll and insurance costs.  Loss from Operations  The loss from operations for the six months ended June 30, 2014 was $1,275,778, inclusive of stock based compensation amounting to $675,000, of which $375,000 was paid to our directors for services provided during 2013 and 2014, and $300,000 was paid to two previous employees for past services which had been agreed to but inadvertently not done, compared to a loss of $683,926 for the same period in 2013, an increase of $591,852 or 86% or a decrease of $83,148 or 12.2% after removing the stock based compensation. The decrease in the operating loss was due to better cost controls; greater energy developer and energy service revenue, and lower costs at our company owned CHP plants due to fewer operation hours. Our non-cash compensation expense was $0 in 2013.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Total current assets at June 30, 2014 were $243,269 a decrease of $128,827 compared to $372,096 at December 31, 2013. Included in current assets were cash and cash equivalents of $6,883 which decreased by $190,502 at June 30, 2014, compared to $197,385 at December 31, 2013. The decrease in cash at June 30, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013 was the result of the costs of bringing new plants on line and the operation of existing energy projects. The increase in prepaid expenses of $49,704 was due to the renewal of insurance premiums.  Cash used in operating activities was $625,445 during the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $125,673 for the same period in 2013, an increase of $499,772. The net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2014 was $405,136 after deducting non cash expenses of $870,642 and $465,475 after deducting non-cash expenses of $218,451 for the six months ended June 30, 2013. During those same periods increases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets used $61,675 compared with providing cash of $215,585 for the same period in 2013. Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased and required the use of cash of $158,634 during the six month period in 2014 as compared to an increase totaling $124,217 in 2013.  During the six months ended June 30, 2014, the investing activities of the company's operations were for expenditures of $30,264, to enhance the value of project assets. During the same six month period in 2013, the Company utilized $186,318 for those same investing opportunities.  The company borrowed $445,000, from its line of credit with the Company CEO, Patrick Carter, which remained unpaid on June 30, 2014.  - 11 -  Our CHP plants allow our customers to reduce both their energy costs and site carbon production by deploying combined heat and power technology on our customers' premises at no cost. Therefore, our company is capital intensive. Our company believes that its existing resources, including cash and cash equivalents, line of credit and future cash flow from operations, are sufficient to meet the working capital requirements of its existing business for the foreseeable future, including the next 9 months; however, as our company continues to grow its business by adding more CHP plants, the cash requirements will increase. Beyond June 30, 2015, we may need to raise additional capital through a debt financing or an equity offering to meet our company's operating and capital needs for future growth. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in our fundraising efforts or that additional funds will be available on acceptable terms, if at all.  We anticipate re-commissioning three additional facilities in the third quarter of 2014. The capital cost to refurbish the existing equipment, replace parts, update the controls and commence operation for all three plants is estimated to be approximately $900,000. We do not currently have sufficient capital resources or revenue from operations to accomplish the re-commissioning and will be required to raise additional capital through debt or equity offerings. The Company has been exploring various methods of raising additional capital, including the sale of common stock and the sale of partial ownership interests in one or more of its existing facilities. We will re-commission these plants only as capital is raised to pay the capital costs. However, if we undertake to re-commission one or more of the plants, but the costs are more than anticipated, we could experience a shortage of cash flow to sustain operations, in which case the need for additional capital will occur earlier than anticipated and could force us to reduce or curtail certain operations. We have, from time to time, relied upon loans from affiliates, particularly our CEO Patrick S. Carter and a director Thomas Grainger, to meet our requirements for operating capital. We do not expect such loans to be available to us in the future.  Our ability to continue to access capital could be impacted by various factors including general market conditions, interest rates, the perception of our potential future earnings and cash distributions, any unwillingness on the part of lenders to make loans to us and any deterioration in the financial position of lenders that might make them unable to meet their obligations to us. If these conditions continue and we cannot raise funds through a public or private debt financing, or an equity offering, our ability to grow our business may be negatively affected. In such case, our company may need to suspend any installation of new CHP plants and significantly reduce its operating costs until market conditions improve.  Seasonality  Our customers generally use additional energy during periods of more extreme temperatures. Accordingly, our revenue generally tends to increase during the summer. The majority of our heating systems sales are in the winter and the majority of our chilling systems sales are in the summer.  Inflation  Inflation will generally cause conventional utility suppliers to increase their rates, and since we bill our customers based on the electric utility rates, our pricing will increase in tandem and positively affect our revenue. However, inflation might cause both our investment and cost of goods sold to increase, thereby lowering our return on investment and depressing our gross margins.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  Our company has no off balance sheet arrangements.  Aug 14, 2014  (c) 1995-2014 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

BP has the largest operated renewable energy business of any major international oil and gas company. In the United States, its renewable assets include 14 onshore wind farms located everywhere from the Hawaiian island of Maui to the green hills of northeast Pennsylvania. The company’s U.S. wind farms have a gross generating capacity of 2,259 megawatts. That’s enough electricity to power all the homes in a city the size of Philadelphia.

BP directly operates 13 wind farms — in Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Texas — while holding an interest in a separate wind facility in Hawaii. The company estimates that, in 2015, a net wind portfolio the size of BP’s helped avoid nearly 3 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions. To put that number in perspective, it is equivalent to:

the annual electricity-related emissions of around 400,000 typical homes;
the emissions produced by burning roughly 2.9 billion pounds of coal;
or the emissions produced by consuming more than 300 million gallons of gasoline. 

Every BP-operated wind farm receives round-the-clock support from on-site personnel and/or from BP’s Remote Operations Center (ROC) in downtown Houston. During normal business hours, operators at individual wind farms manage their sites. During off-hours, weekends and holidays, operators at the ROC take control.

Using advanced technology, ROC teams centrally monitor all BP sites — 24 hours a day, seven days a week — while working with colleagues in the field to enhance performance, reliability and safety. ROC monitoring systems capture turbine availability, power generation capacity, wind speed, weather and other critical factors. An embedded alarm system immediately notifies operators of potential problems, such as approaching storms or flash flood warnings.

Whether in the the High Plains of Kansas, or anywhere else the company has wind operations, BP works hard to prevent its business from affecting local wildlife and habitats. For example, it voluntarily adjusts the movement of wind turbines to reduce their impact on bat populations during peak migration season.

“We are always focused on safety and sustainability in everything we do at our wind farms,” says BP Wind Energy CEO Laura Folse. “Our staffers at the ROC provide an extra set of eyes and help our people in the field work safely and responsibly.”
The Benefits of Wind Power
Wind power is safe, clean and increasingly affordable – with the potential for production on a much larger scale.
As a low-carbon energy source, the use of wind reduces the amount of carbon produced to meet the world’s energy needs. We estimate that BP Wind Energy’s wind energy generation in 2015 alone offset nearly 3 million tons of CO2 in 2015, which is equivalent to the annual emissions from approximately 246,000 typical homes, according to the BP 2015 Sustainability Report.
As wind turbine technology has continued to evolve and improve, wind farms using new generation technology can produce more energy at an ever-decreasing cost – a cost that is becoming increasingly competitive in the overall energy marketplace.
At BP Wind Energy, we are committed to playing a central role in mapping the future of this important and exciting segment of the energy sector.
