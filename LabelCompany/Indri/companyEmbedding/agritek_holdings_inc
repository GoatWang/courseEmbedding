 Agritek Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB:AGTK) www.AgritekHoldings.com, a fully integrated, active cannabis real estate investor and branding consultant in the legal cannabis sector today announced the company's first order for its licensed brand "MicroDose" Oral Strips for the medicinal market of California. Agritek Holdings will provide the licensing and packaging to produce the exclusive line of 10mg and 50 mg oral strips as a medicinal alternative for patients. The Agritek "Microdose" brand will be produced and distributed through its permitted manufacturer and collective to multiple dispensaries throughout California. AGTK will receive a flat fee per single package designed exclusively by Agritek Holdings with the first 10,000 units being delivered next month.
The discreet, dose controlled, evaporating oral strips will offer a unique and smoke-free alternative to patients in California. Sold in a single pack, doses will consist of 10mg and 50mg strips, and are manufactured through a consistent organic sun growth cannabis base. The strip is placed under the tongue or between the cheek and gum of the mouth with the strip dissolving directly into the bloodstream. The Microdose Strips will be available in Indica and Sativa strains and will eventually be launched nationally as a CBD brand through licensed manufacturers. As previously stated, Agritek will receive a flat fee for brand license and package.
Additionally, the Company is pleased to announce the launch of its new, interactive and investor intensive corporate website located on the World Wide Web at www.AgritekHoldings.com. The new corporate website lists a comprehensive overview of the company's existing real estate holdings, projects and wholly owned brands now being released in legal jurisdictions and under development. The new site also has a downloadable executive overview and power point for new investors and shareholders giving great insight into the company's holdings and business strategy within the cannabis sector.
"I am pleased to announce our newly licensed brand 'MicroDose Strips' as an alternative delivery system for patients and brand under the Agritek Holdings product umbrella. Working directly through the patent holder and California based manufacturer we have developed this brand for distribution to all California based patients and dispensaries. We have always prided ourselves on innovation and the MicroDose Strips will become an important medical brand and rising trend for safe and effective medical applications for cannabis in multiple jurisdictions," stated B.

Announces Cease and Desist to Vape Holdings Inc. and Pending Law Suit for Intellectual Property Infringement and Employment Agreement Violations Against Former CEO Justin BrauneMarketwiredApril 20, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareLOS ANGELES, CA--(Marketwired - April 20, 2016) - Agritek Holdings, Inc. (OTC PINK: AGTK) (http://www.Agritekholdings.com), a leader in Compassionate Care Technology and agricultural solutions for the recreational cannabis industry, today announced that the Company has sent a Cease and Desist Letter To Vape Holdings Inc. and its CEO Mr. Justin Braune. Agritek Holdings is preparing a law suit against Vape Holdings and Mr. Braune for intellectual property infringement and violation of Mr. Braune's employment agreement under non-compete clauses. The cease and desist contends that the present vaporizer device and cartridge being sold as Vape Holding's "Revival Vape's" product line was designed and developed during Mr. Braune's tenure as Chief Executive Officer of Agritek Holdings under the Company's wholly owned subsidiary Prohibition Products Inc. with Mr. Braune as President of Prohibition Products. The same exact device was developed and sold under the Company's www.ProhibitionLife.com website and brand.The complete product video for Agritek and Prohibition Life may be seen here:http://www.cannabisfn.com/cfnvideo/?id=nhB7NUv6The Company plans to outline in its suit for monetary damages and attachment of the Revivalvapes.com site revenues on the basis that all design, prototypes, marketing materials, eCommerce web site and roll out strategy were blatantly taken and reproduced under a different name upon Mr. Braune's unexpected resignation from Agritek Holdings. The Company will additionally show that Mr. Braune and Agritek management had previously negotiated an asset purchase of the Prohibition device through Letters of Intent and purchase agreements drafted by Vape Holdings counsel entitling Agritek to royalties and equity payments on each device sold. The company further has all correspondence from the development of the device, original prototypes and cartridges as well as a signed employment agreement clearly stating that any property designed or released during Mr. Braune's term as an officer of Agritek Holdings shall remain the property of the Company."Agritek will be seeking the complete attachment of our device from Vape Holdings and all monies due to our company with regards to the Revival Vape products being sold by Vape Holdings. We believe that the evidence is overwhelming against Mr. Braune, including signed Letters of Intent and Asset purchase agreements for the purchase of our vaporizer along with his actions of resigning from the Company and leaving Agritek nonreporting for the first time in our history without a board and moving to Vape as their new CEO with our technology. In my opinion, what we will show as evidence will prove to be damaging to himself and Vape Holdings. We plan to pursue this to the full extent of the law and seek back all monies paid to Mr. Braune and the development of the vaporizer device," stated B.
