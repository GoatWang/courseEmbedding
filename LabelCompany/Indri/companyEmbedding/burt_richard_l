keting, product innovation, and assembly excellence. By 2002, Xenia’s Asian competitor was selling
its transducers for what it cost Xenia to produce comparable units. At that time, Xenia engineers de-
signed virtually all of Xenia’s components, which then were purchased from one or more of the ﬁrm’s
4,000 suppliers. Widespread competition was used to obtain the best price. The selected supplier built
to Xenia drawings and speciﬁcations. Management at Xenia responded to the competitive threat. The corporation’s strategy shifted to a new set
of core competencies: marketing, product innovation, assembly, and supply management. The progression 30 cHAPTEII 2 Organizational Issues 31 to supply management was enhanced by the establishment of an executive position: the Chief Procurement
ofﬁcer. The CPO’s organization was retitled “Supply Management.” The CPO became a member of the
executive committee, allowing for greater input in developing corporate strategy. Equally important, sup-
ply management was able to ensure that its strategies were aligned with those of the corporation. Over a
period of three years, Xenia reduced its supply base from 4,000 to 400 suppliers. Xenia worked with those
suppliers to bring them to world-class status with long-term contracts. The suppliers became involved in the development of Xenia’s new transducers.
The results? Cost of goods sold was reduced 50 percent. Incoming quality problems virtually disap- peared. The time required to move a new product from concept to customer was reduced 45 percent.
Production lead times were reduced 65 percent. All those results were achieved in only three years! I QWWMm— 1. What was the most important shift in Xenia’s set of core competencies? 2. What impact did the appointment of a CPO at the executive level have on the supply management
function? 3. What is the impact of reducing the supply base? How is this achieved? 4. What might be some beneﬁts of getting suppliers involved in the development of Xenia’s new
transducers? 5. What is the beneﬁt of reducing cost of goods sold, time to market, production lead times, and
quality problems? ~ n any group activity, three principal factors largely determine the level of performance attained by the
group as a whole: I The capabilities of the individuals
I The motivation of the individuals
I The organizational structure within which the individuals function This chapter focuses on the last factor. The ﬁrst two factors are obvious to most businesspeople, but
to many people the impact of the third is less clear. In the case of supply management, the function’s
location in the management hierarchy of a ﬁrm is important, for this decision either facilitates or lim-
its the inﬂuence supply management policies and actions can have on the firm’s total performance.
Within the department itself, the form of organization selected inﬂuences the types and levels of
expertise developed and also, to a great extent, the effectiveness with which the talents of individuals
are utilized. ~ A ﬁrm’s organizational structure reﬂects management’s basic attitudes toward the major activities
involved in its operation. Where should the supply management function ﬁt in a ﬁmi's organizational
structure? 32 PAIIT 1 The Foundation Placement of Supply Management
Within the Organization The location of the supply management department within an entity’s organizational structure greatly inﬂu-
ences that department’s ability to function optimally and inﬂuence the decision-making process involved in
effective procurement. The lower supply management is on the organizational chart, the less likely it is that
it can inﬂuence corporate strategy signiﬁcantly. In practice, the center for advanced purchasing studies, caps,
in a study conducted in 2000 found “The supply organizational structure was forced to be congruent with the
overall corporate structure,” as opposed to selecting the most appropriate structure for large ﬁrms.1 The importance of supply management in any ﬁrm is determined largely by four factors: 1. Availability of materials and services. Are the major materials and services used by the ﬁrm readily
available in a competitive market, or are some key materials and services bought in volatile markets that
are subject to periodic shortages and price instability? If the latter condition prevails, creative performance
by analytical supply management professionals is required; this typically is a top-level group. 2. Absolute dollar volume of purchases. If a company spends a large amount of money for materials
and services, the magnitude of the expenditure means that effectiVe supply management usually can pro-
duce signiﬁcant proﬁt. Small unit savings add up quickly when thousands of units are purchased. On the
service side, a contract for IT (information technology) services can run into millions of dollars. Thus, a
10 percent saving contributes signiﬁcantly to the bottom line. 3. Percent of product cost represented by materials and services. When a ﬁrm’ s materials and Outsourced
Services costs account for 40 percent or more of' 1ts total operating budget, small reductions 1n material and
service costs increase proﬁt signiﬁcantly. Well-executed supply management usually pays handsome div-
idends in such companies. 4. Types of materials and services purchased. Perhaps even more important than the preceding consid-
erations is the amount of control purchasing and supply personnel-have over the availability, quality, and
costs of purchased materials and services. Most large. companies use a wide range of materials and services,
many of whose price and service arrangements deﬁnitely can be inﬂuenced by creative purchasing per-
forrnance. Some ﬁrms, 1n contrast, use a fairly small number of standard production and supply materials
or services from which even a top-ﬂight purchasing and supply department can produce little proﬁt
through the use of creative management, pricing, and supplier selection activities. In her article “I’m Convinced: You’ve Got Value!” Mary Siegfried Dozbaba emphasizes the need for pur-
chasing and supply management departments to demonstrate to the top executive their value and commit-
ment to improving proﬁtability. To attain commitment and respect from the top, purchasing and supply
management must shift its focus from internal processes to big-picture issues such as determining and
deﬁning the requirements, contract negotiation, supplier relations, and strategic long-term goals of the
organization. “You need to be willing to let responsibility ﬂow out of the unit. Purchasing and supply
does not need to approve every requisition . . . stop being the price pouce," she says. “You want to . . . be
called in to negotiate the multimillion dollar contracts, not just to buy pens.”2 Such activities will ensure
that a purchasing and supply department is favorably positioned to support organizational needs in today’s
highly competitive marketplace. . 1Michiel R. Leenders, P. Fraser Johnson, Anna E. Flynn and Harold E. Fear-on, “Purchasing and Supply Management: With 50

CHAPTER 2 Organizational Issues 33 Other Factors That Affect Organizational Structure Classification of Responsibilities and Activities The starting point in thinking about potential organization structures is a delineation and an analysis of the
work to be done by the unit: the responsibilities and activities. The six classiﬁcations of work in a purchas-
ing operation are as follows: ' 1. Management. Management of the purchasing and supply function involves all the tasks associated
with the management process, with an emphasis on the development of policies, procedures, controls, and
the mechanics for coordinating purchasing operations with those of other departments. On an exception -
basis, it also involves the management of unique supplier and commodity problems. 2. Buying/supply management. This includes a wide variety of activities, such as working with users to
help develop requirements and speciﬁcations, reviewing requisitions, analyzing bids, negotiating, and
selecting suppliers. Additional responsibilities involve continuing work with a supplier to improve the
supplier’s capability and performance in the areas of cost, quality, and service. 3. Contract and relationship management. This responsibility ranges from monitoring purchase orders
and working with accounts payable, to the application of project management skills, to a key procurement
such as a construction project. Relationship management is appropriate for many major procurements
in which the supplier’s motivation, cOOperation, and collaboration are essential factors in a successful
relationship and a successful procurement. 4. Strategic planning and research work. A well-developed purchasing and supply management opera-
tion has a large number of research projects and systems studies that require specialized knowledge and
analytical ability. The more an organization has progressed toward a supply management focus, the more
emphasis it places on these strategic activities. The core activities in this area include economic, industry,
and supply market studies; the development of buying strategies for material or services buying; the de-
velopment and implementation of supply base and partnering plans; product research and value analysis
work; and operating and information systems analysis. 5. Follow-up and expediting. Order follow-up activity involves various types of supplier liaison work,
such as reviewing the status of orders and occasionally visiting suppliers. 6. Clerical activities. Every department must enter orders and maintain working ﬁles, catalogs and
library material, and records for commodities, suppliers, prices, and so on. The precise manner in which purchasing work is subdivided and grouped depends on the size of the
department, which depends on the size of the company. Operational versus Strategic Responsibilities In small ﬁrms, responsibilities may be handled by a purchasing or supply manager and one or two assis-
tants; everyone wears several hats. In large organizations, the department may consist of 100 to 300
purchasing and supply professionals.3 In 1998, R. David Nelson, Vice-President of Worldwide Supply
Management at Deere & Co., hired 94 supplier development engineers to accomplish supplier activities,
resulting in $22 million in cost savings! A major activity or responsibility for any purchasing and supply 3Large multiplant ﬁrms may employ 1,000 or more buyers and/or engineers. 34 PART 1 The Foundation Placement of Purch rs Supplier Development Responsibilities Managing Contract and Blanket Order Releases Coordinating the Procurement Systems
Expediting Inbound Orders Developing Long-Tenn Contracts
Maintaining Continuity of Supply to Production Lines Developing and Integrating Supply Strategy
Managing Supplier Relationships Managing Risks in Supply Chain
Transactionally Focused Activities Strategically Focused Activities Flgura 2.1 I Operational and Strategic Characteristics and Activities management department is to provide an uninterrupted ﬂow of materials and services. The tasks required
to accomplish this goal often are referred to as tactical or operational activities. These activities are not
a great source of cost savings yet are critical in avoiding tremendous losses resulting from potential dis-
ruptions in operations. Operational activities offer minimal value-added beneﬁts yet are often pressing
and time-consuming. The focus on such tactical activities results in less time being allocated to proﬁt-
generating strategic activities. Figure 2.1 demonstrates various operational and strategic characteristics
and activities. . Supply managers have begun to see the need for two types of resources in their organizations: (1) a
team of people who manage the operational and tactical activities of purchasing and materials management
and (2) supply managers who are involved in the development of broader strategic aspects of the function.
Those organizations are in a position to separate operational and strategic responsibilities formally in their
organizational structures. This ability to focus on the strategic sourcing process promises long-term in-
creased proﬁtable sales and cost savings, improving proﬁtability, and competitive advantage. Organizational Authority The placement of supply management decision-making authority affects the structure of the supply orga-
niZation. Centralized authority exists when the decision-making process is the responsibility of a single
person. This person is held accountable by top management for the proper performance of purchasing
activities. Decentralization of purchasing authority occurs when personnel from other functional areas—
production, engineering, operations, marketing, ﬁnance, and so on—make unilateral decisions on sources
of supply or negotiate with suppliers directly for major purchases. As discussed in this book, this concept
is concerned solely with the placement of purchasing authority. It has nothing to do with the location of
buying personnel. Generally, in a single-site operation, to decentralize the purchasing function needlessly is to deny a ﬁrm
some of its potential proﬁt. Centralization of the purchasing function is essential for the attainment of both
optimum operating efﬁciency and maximum proﬁt. Most companies today view the centralization of pur-
chasing as a logical and desirable evolution of Frederick Taylor’s basic concept of the specialization of
labor. The extent to which the efficiencies of functional specialization are realized when a ﬁrm creates a
supply management department, however, depends largely on the authority delegated to that department.
When functioning properly, centralized purchasing produces the following beneﬁts: 1. Reduction of potential duplication of effort. 2. Leveraging of volume purchases: Volume discounts are possible when all cOmpany orders for the
same and similar materials are consolidated. In addition, a ﬁrm is able to project a uniﬁed policy to its sup-
pliers, gaining maximum competitive advantage from its total economic power. CHAPTER 2 Organizational Issues 35 3. Consolidation: Consolidation provides an opportunity to standardize and simplify parts. Additional
beneﬁts can be gained from value analysis and value engineering coordinated through a centralized function. 4, Transportation savings: Transportation savings can be realized through the consolidation of orders
and delivery schedules. ' 5. Allowance of specialization: Centralization develops purchasing specialists whose primary con—
cern is purchasing. With training, purchasing specialists inevitably buy more efﬁciently than less-skilled
individuals can. 6. Reduction of suppliers’ costs: Suppliers are able to offer better prices and better service because
their expenses are reduced. Their sales personnel make fewer calls, prepare fewer orders, make fewer ship—
ments, prepare fewer invoices, and do less recordkeeping. 7. Improved inventory control: More effective inventory control is possible because of company-
wide knowledge of stock levels, material usage, lead times, and prices. 8. Lower administrative costs: Fewer orders are processed for the same quantity of goods purchased,
reducing purchasing, receiving, inspection, accounts payable, and recordkeeping expenses. 9. Centralized control: Responsibility for the performance of the purchasing function is placed with
a single department head, facilitating management control. 10. Reduction in the costs of services: Warren Norquist, while Vice President of Materials Management
at Polaroid, centralized the purchase of marketing services such as advertising. As a direct result of cen-
tralization, Polaroid had savings in excess of 25 percent. Despite the general advantages of centralization, complete centralized purchasing is neither always
possible nor always desirable. Four types of situations justify some decentralization. The ﬁrst is found
in companies that process single natural raw materials. Many of those ﬁrms separate the purchase of
key raw materials from the purchase of other materials. Firms in the textile, leather, food, beverage, and
tobacco industries are good examples. In these industries, the raw materials are products of nature
that are purchased in unstable markets in which prices ﬂuctuate widely. Buying typically takes place
at auctions or through commodity exchanges conducted in small local warehouses. In such markets,
a practical knowledge of grades is as important as knowledge of prices. Buyers of these commodities
usually guard their specialized know-how with secrecy, frequently handing it down from one genera-
tion to the next. A second situation justifying some decentralization of purchasing authority exists in technically
oriented ﬁrms that are heavily involved in research. In those ﬁrms some exceptions to complete central-
ization are always desirable. Many one-time purchases in the research, design engineering, and related
departments can be handled more effectively by professional personnel in those departments. Moreover,
the dollar volume of such purchases is usually relatively small. The third situation justifying a different type of decentralization is found in the operation of multisite
institutional and manufacturing organizations. Decentralization in this circumstance can allow for a faster
response time for the requisitioner, a better understanding of the requirements unique to that plant, quicker
support in product development projects, and ownership of the process and products.4 4Robert Monczka, Robert Trent. and Robert Handﬁeld. Purchasing and Supply Chain Management, 3rd ed. (Mason, OH: South-
Westem, 2005), pp. 148—49. 36 PART 'I The Foundation Fifth, the purchase of nontechm'cal odds'and ends often calls for a partial decentralization of purchas-
ing. Credit card and petty cash fund purchases of less than several hundred dollars are a good example.
Decentralizing through the use of these approaches can be a money saver. The danger of losing purchasing control does not stem from partial decentralization of the purchas-
ing function per se. Some decentralization is necessary as a matter of common sense. The use of cross-
functional teams in the decision-making process is increasing. Organizations are changing to compete
in the global market. Companies are seeking to take advantage of both structures by forming a hybrid
structure that includes both centralized and decentralized decision making. This results in the best of
both structures, maintaining necessary control while meeting the unique needs of the other functions or divisions. e-Commerce Technology has provided a solution to the debate about centralized versus decentralized organizational
structures. As computers began to appear on desktops in the late 19808, purchasing departments were able
to reduce administrative time and costs by placing purchase orders electronically. Electronic data inter-
change (EDI) was the early stage of e-commerce. Electronic catalogs of approved supplies or services could-
be created through a centralized supply management department and disseminated to decentralized loca-
tions for purchase. Electronic billing and remittance of invoices improved cash ﬂow while reducing the cost
of doing business. e-commerce allowed corporate policy and procedure to be distributed and monitored
effectively while giving divisional supply management departments the authority to make purchases to meet
their local requirements. e-commerce has been a catalyst, enabling organizations to beneﬁt from the hybrid
supply management structure. Organizational Structures As was stated above, the position of the supply management department on a ﬁrm’s organizational chart
can vary. However, as materials gained in importance, becoming a larger proportion of the cost of goods
sold, issues such as inﬂated inventories, poor quality, material stockouts, long lead times, and miscommu-
nications provided the impetus for a movement to capture control of materials under one individual. This
gave rise to the materials management approach to structuring the material portion of an organization. The Materials Management Organization The concept of organizing the functions that affect the acquisition, movement, and storage of materials un-
der one manager evolved in the early 1960s. The term materials management was introduced to describe
an integrated systems approach to the coordination of materials activities and the control of total material
' costs.5 The purchasing, planning and scheduling, transportation, and warehousing functions were orga-
nized under the control and responsibility of one individual: the materials manager. The objective was to
optimize the performance of the materials system, as opposed to suboptimizing the performance of the
individual functions that are parts of the materials system. The results were “great improvements in inven-
tory levels, customer service, and communications, ultimately improving the bottom line?“5 5For the classic reference, see Dean S. Ammer, Materials Management and Purchasing, 4th ed. (Homewood, IL: Richard D. Irwin,
1980). 6Marilyn Gettinger, “Strategic Thinking: Movin’ on Up from Supply Management to the Supply Chain," 9lst Annual International
Supply Management Conference, ISM, Tempe AZ, May 2006, p. 2. CHAPTER 2 Organizational Issues 37 The materials management organization was popular during the 1960s and 1970s. This concept of
integrating the functions involved in the management of materials paved the way for the more sophisticated concept of supply and supply chain management. The Supply Chain Management Structure In the late 1980s Japan invaded the U.S. automobile market with cars assembled in Japan. This marked
the beginning of globalization as we know it today. The early 1990s saw the appearance of personal com-
puters on the desktops of organizations, putting data and information at the ﬁngertips of managers. With
the introduction of the Internet and the World Wide Web, the infOrmation age began. Thr0ugh these
developments, the concept of managing materials for competitive advantage ﬂourished. The materials
management structure evolved beyond the idea of managing a corporation’s inventory and the functions
responsible for supply. The broader conCept of supply chain management grew to encompass the plan-
ning and management of all activities involved in forecasting, sourcing, and procurement and all incom-
ing logistics management activities. It broke down the functional silos, creating integrated processes
throughout the organization.7 In describing the breadth of supply chain management, Marilyn Gettinger,
C.P.M., president of New Directions Consulting Group, writes: Irnpo'rtantly, it also includes coordination and collaboration with channel partners such as suppliers, intermedi-
aries, third—party service providers, and customers. In essence, supply chain management integrates supply and
demand management within and across companies. It is a total system approach to facilitate coordination inter-
nally and with supply chain partners, often using enhanced communication and information technologies.8 Organizing with Owes-Functional Teams Cross-functional teams have become a common approach to addressing many supply-management—related
activities, including new product development,9 value analySis and value engineering, standardization and
simpliﬁcation, engineering change management, the development of statements of work describing ser-
vices requirements, commodity teams, the acquisition of capital and operating equipment, make/buy and 7Ibid.

ment and problem solving, supplier development, and the development of strategic alliances.10 Since
cross—functional teams require a signiﬁcant investment in human resources, their use commonly is limited
to time-critical and high—monetary-value activities. The appendix to this chapter addresses cross-functional teams in greater detail. Concluding Remarks Foremost in developing an organizational structure is ﬁnding a structure that will allow the organization’s
supply chain to function effectively and efﬁciently. ISM Professor of Supply Chain Management Robert
M. Monczka tells us in “Finding a Structure That Works,” “Establishing appropriate organizational struc-
ture and governance processes for the supply management function is critical to effective supply chain
management. Competitive and customer pressures, globalization, outsourcing and the need for innovation
from external sources, combined with unrelenting pressure to achieve cost reduction, faster time to mar-
ket and improved customer responsiveness, all increase the importance of this decision.”11 ' Discussion Questions 1. Why is supply management’s position in the corporation's organizational structure important? 2. How do the four factors identiﬁed by the authors affect the signiﬁcance of supply management in a
ﬁrm? For example, is supply management more or less signiﬁcant when one is buying products
from a volatile market? 3. Review the tasks identiﬁed under each of the ﬁve classiﬁcations of work in a supply management
operation. Which tasks under each classiﬁcation might be considered operational and which might
be considered more strategic? 4. Why are many organizations using a hybrid approach to decision-making authority in their supply management? How has the advent of the World Wide Web inﬂuenced the growth of supply chain management? . Why is the organizational structure an important issue in managing the purchasing and supply function? 7. Identify some ways in which cross-functional teams could be useful in developing new products or
completing value analysis functions. ’ Internet Exercise

Cross-Functional Teams12 Synergy The many activities identiﬁed in this chapter have one thing in common: They all beneﬁt from a variety
of functional inputs. For example, during the new product development process, marketing has informa-
tion on customers’ wants and needs, their willingness to purchase at different prices, and present and
potential competition. Design engineering has knowledge about current and future design processes and
constraints. Manufacturing engineering has information on the ﬁrm’s and its suppliers’ manufacturing
processes and their limitations. Supply management provides a window to the supply world and its capa-
bilities and limitations and the likely cost and availability of various materials and services under consid-
eration. Customer service, quality, ﬁnance, information technology, and carefully selected suppliers all
have many additional contributions to make during the new product development process. When these
professionals come together under a capable team leader, the result is normally a synergy that results in a
far more proﬁtable new product far more quickly than would have occurred with the traditional sequential
approach to new product development. ”Many of the ideas in this appendix were introduced by one of the authors' mentors, Professor Norman Maier of the University of
Michigan, during the mid-19603. 40 PART 1 The Foundation Input from All Affected Functions . The cross-functional approach greatly increases the likelihood that all issues that should be considered will
be addressed. For example, customer support and service frequently were overlooked in the traditional se-
quential approach to new product development. Standardization efforts, which are conducted or controlled
by a single functional area such as manufacturing engineering, frequently overlook the procurement, man-
ufacturing, and marketing implications of implementing new standards. The result is surplus purchased
materials, manufacturing bottlenecks, or products that do not compete in the marketplace. ' Time Compression A hypothetical example may help in understanding the traditional sequential or functional approach to
many of the activities discussed above. Marketing at Alpha Corporation has identiﬁed a need for a new
complex transducer. Marketing describes this need to design engineering, which designs the transducer.
On completion of the design, the speciﬁcations and drawings are forwarded to manufacturing engineer-
ing, the function responsible for translating design engineering’s speciﬁcations into production plans. Manufacturing engineering determines that certain tolerances cannot be met by the ﬁrm’s production
equipment. Design engineering is asked to revise the speciﬁcations. Design engineering contacts market-
ing to determine what impact the revised tolerances (ones which the ﬁrm’s equipment can meet) will have
on sales. If the impact is signiﬁcant, manufacturing and possibly plant engineering may become involved.
They may decide that new equipment is required. This process-continues on through the quality assurance
function Quality assurance reviews the speciﬁcations and production plans to ensure that the required
level of quality will be obtainable. The customer service function then reviews the speciﬁcations and
manufacturing plans so that it can develop plans to support the transducers 1n the ﬁeld. Obviously, each
function along the sequential path leading to production of the desired transducer may question or even
challenge the design speciﬁcations and manufacturing plans. This back-and-forth process ultimately leads
to a produCt that is late to market and overpriced. I Overcoming Organizational Resistance With the cross-functional approach, all functional areas are involved up front, and this helps reduce orga-
nizational resistance to decisions that will affect speciﬁc functional areas. In contrast, decisions that affect
multiple functional areas, that'are made without the involvement of those areas are likely to meet resis—
tance. The representatives of each of the functional areas involved on the team constructively provide their
input and are involved in the resulting agreement. In turn, each representative is responsible for ensuring
acCeptance by his or her functional area of the team’s decisions. Experience indicates that once a team
makes a decision, implementation of the resulting plan is much easier and faster than is the case with the
sequential approach. ' Enhanced Problem Resolution The cross-functional team approach is far more efﬁcient and effective at solving problems than the tradi-
tional functional one is. For example, if a supplier, in spite of its best efforts, is unable to meet the contract
schedule or quality requirements, a cross-functional team representing supply management, manufacturing
engineering, and quality may be formed to work with the supplier to resolve the problem. (The solution to
a surprising number of such problems is within the customer ﬁrm’s control, not the supplier’s!) CHAPTER 2 Organizational issues 41 Negotiations Negotiations for critical or large-monetary-value materials, services, supplies, or items of equipment are
conducted much more effectively by a well-prepared and well—coordinated cross-functional team than by the ﬁnest supply professionals alone. Improved Communication and Cooperation The traditional functional approach to the activities listed in the opening paragraph of this appendix nor-
mally results in efﬁciency within each department. However, this approach inhibits communication and
cooperation among the departments involved in the activities. Some 40 years ago, one of the authors was the chief procurement ofﬁcer (CPO) of a relatively small
business unit. The organization’s plant engineering department designed speciﬁcations for construction
projects. Those speciﬁcations served as the basis of invitations for bids (IF'Bs) and the resulting contracts.
Numerous questions and problems were encountered with potential suppliers during the bidding process
and then with the successful bidder. The speciﬁcations were ambiguous and in several cases contained
inconsistencies. _ The CPO met with the plant engineer and offered to become involved in the development and review
of the speciﬁcations. The plant engineer rejected the offer, stating: “Development of speciﬁcations is my
responsibility. Butt out!" Interestingly, the plant engineer subsequently expressed his desire to become
involved in the sourcing process. Guess what happened? Challenges and Problems with the Cross-Functional Approach There are several challenges and inherent problems with a cross-functional approach. Additional Investment in Scarce Resources A single professional normally requires far fewer labor hours to accomplish a task than does a team. For
example, a single supply management professional can accomplish the many actions involved in selecting
a critical supplier in considerably fewer labor hours than can a cross-functional sourcing team. However,
a team consisting of a design engineer, a manufacturing engineer, and a quality engineer together with a
supply professional will do a far more thorough job of selecting the right source. Role Conflict Normally, cross-functional team assignments impose additional duties on many or all of the individuals in-
volved. In many cases, a team member’s functional manager expects that individual to perform his or her
normal functional responsibilities. Such responsibilities require about 40 hours per week, and the individ-
ual also is expected to satisfy his or her team responsibilities. A number of years ago, one of the authors
directed thesis research at the Graduate Logistics Division of the Air Force Institute of Technology. The
research focused on minimizing role conflict between functional and team assignments. The subjects were
assigned to cross-functional teams developing the B-1 bomber. The researchers focused on a multi-matrix
approach to project management as a means of avoiding or minimizing the inherent role conﬂict. While
promising, the research results were inconclusive. Some 25 years later, management is still attempting to
cope with the issue of role conﬂict resulting from part-time assignment of individuals to cross-ftmctional
teams. Despite these issues, the beneﬁts of teams usually outweigh the resulting problems. 42 PART 1 The Foundation Overload for Key Team Members Overload is an obvious result of the role conﬂict inherent in the additional duties assigned to key team
members. Paradoxically, the most attractive team members are those individuals who are key contributors
to their functional organizations. Management must be sensitive to the danger of such an overload to avoid burnout and the possible loss of such individuals. Gentlnulty Obviously, once team members have been trained and developed and have learned to work together in a
synergistic manner, continuity of membership becomes critical. Retirement, departure to another ﬁrm, pro-
motions, and layoffs can have a negative impact on the team’s operation. Careful selection and assignment
of team members can reduce but not eliminate such problems. Rewards By now, it should be apparent that individuals who are assigned to cross-functional teams as an additional
duty should be rewarded appropriately. The greatest reward is the satisfaction associated with “making a
difference” in the team’s success. Senior professional managers ensure that functional managers (the chief
procurement ofﬁcer, the director of R&D, the director of manufacturing, etc.) recognize all individuals’
contributions to both their functional organizations and the cross-functional team. A few enlightened organizations have had success with team incentives. These incentives range from
team dinners, to a team vacation in Hawaii, to the award of stock options. In some cases, the team receives
a bundle of rewards (such as 1,000 stock options). The team members then allocate the options according
to a consensus of the members on the relative contribution of each member. More information on this
subject may be found in Rewarding Teams: Lessons from the Trenches.13 Prerequisites to Successful Gross-Functional Teams Although there are many prerequisites, we will focus on three especially critical ones. Executive Sponsorship An absolute prerequisite for successful cross-functional teams is the support of an executive sponsor. “Top
management team support and political factors may be even more critical to the success of cross-functional
teams than the internal team processes."14 The individual sponsor should have all the functional areas
involved reporting to him or her or have the informal ability to secure the cooperation and support of
colleagues in obtaining the assignment of the appropriate human resources to the project. Additionally, the
executive sponsor must track the cross-functional team’s progress, run interference, and obtain additional
resources as appropriate.15 13Glen Parket, Jerry McAdams, and David Zielinski, Rewarding Teams: Lessons from the Trenches (New York: lossey-Bass,
2000). . 14Michael A. Hitt. “Corporate Entrepreneurship and Cross-Functional Fertilization: Activation, Process and Disintegration of a
New Product Design Team,” Entrepreneurship: Theory and Practice, Spring 1999, p. 145. ._ 15For additional insight, see David N. Burt and Richard L. Pinkerton, Strategic Pmactive Procurement (New York: AMACOM,
1996), p. 33, and James W. Dean, Jr., and Gerald I. Susman, “Organizing for Manufacturing Design,” Harvard Business Review,
January—February 1989, pp. 28—36. CHAPTER 2 Organizational Issues 43 Eﬂectlve Team Leaders Without skilled leadership, teams frequently become lost, ﬂounder, get off course, lose sight of their goal,
lose conﬁdence, become mired in interpersonal conﬂicts, stop short of their goal, and never contribute their
full potential. Surveys of highly effective teams have shown that their members rated their leaders as
highly skilled. Lower-performing teams rated their leaders as being much less effective. Ideally, a team leader has people skills, communication skills, technical knowledge, experience
working with the people who will be on the team, and enthusiasm. The new role of the team leader is to
build a team with vision, authority, accountability, information, skills, and a commitment to assuming
more and better operational control of the team’s work. The new leader expands the capabilities of the
team members and the team itself. As a result, the team can perform some of the leader’s traditional
work roles, such as budgeting, scheduling, setting performance goals, and providing training. The team
gradually assumes the day-to-day operations, allowing the leader to manage resources, ideas, technolo-
gies, and the work processes. The most challenging aspect of this new role is that the leader must give
up part of his or her former, more authoritarian role. Such a shift of roles gives the leader more time to
take on strategic roles. The result of the shift is that the team is able to contribute more and with greater
speed. . Team leaders must assume a number of roles. They must understand people so that they can inﬂu-
ence them. They should encourage and maintain open communication and help the team develop and
follow team norms. The team leader needs to step back from his or her management role of directing
employees and assume a more collaborative role as a facilitator. The leader should help guide the team
and allow the team to identify problems, develop solutions, and then implement those solutions. The
team members must be free to express themselves as long as that expression is not destructive in nature.
The team leader should support the expression of conﬂicting points of view. “Team synergy begs for a
conﬂict of ideas. Conﬂict can bring into being the creative tension where paradigm-shifting ideas are
born.”16 While the team leader may need to retain some of the final decision making in the early stages,
it should be the leader’s goal to develop the team so that it can assume responsibility for the decision
making entirely. _ The team leader helps the team focus on the task and removes obstacles that stand in the way of the
team’s performance. Helping the team focus will ensure that the team progresses through productive stages
of team development and will reduce the tendency for it to revert to one of the less productive stages.
Effective team leaders help minimize turf issues and keep the team focused on the good of the organiza-
tion. Additionally, the leader needs to make sure that the team members have all the resources they need
so that they don’t become distracted. The team leader also should remove any obstacles to the team’s
success. Additionally, team leaders help establish a vision, create change, and unleash talent. The leader helps
the team establishla mission statement and deﬁne its goals. Leaders create change within both the orga-
nization and the team. They force people to think outside the box and help develop creative solutions to
problems. Leaders need to have good people skills to identify and draw out the hidden talents of the team
members. Former American League relief pitcher David Baldwin, writing in the Harvard Business Review,
addresses the issue of “blame.” He focuses on how managers in Major League Baseball employ blame. ”Tom Schulte, quoted in “Conﬂict Resolution. A Required Skill for Engineering Team Managers," IOMA's Report on Managing
Design Engineering, January 2000, p. 2. 44 PART ‘I The Foundation Baldwin contends that blame plays an important role in shaping an organization’s culture. He proposes ﬁve
important rules of blame, which we believe apply to most or all team leaders: Know when to blame—and when not to. Blame in private and praise in public. Realize that the absence of blame can be far worse than its presence.
Manage misguided blame. Be aware that conﬁdence is the ﬁrst casualty of blame.17 mega»? Meetings: Do’s, Don’ts, and Donuts (Lighthouse Point Press, 1994) offers the following suggestions
to team leaders: I Decide whether a meeting is the best way to accomplish this. Consider circulating routine informa-
tion via e-mail. If a meeting is required, distribute an agenda at least two days in advance. State in one or two sentences what you would like your meeting to accomplish. Set ground rules to maintain focus, respect, and order during the meeting. Take responsibility for the outcome of the meeting. For example, help keep the meeting on track and help resolve conﬂicts.
I If your meeting isn’t working, try other tools, such as brainstorming techniques or computer software that help you create the agenda.18 Qualified Team Members Experience indicates that the most critical variable in one’s ability to be a “high” contributor is willingness
and desire to contribute. Baxter Health Care of Paramatta, New South Wales, Australia, ensures that team
members are “willing” participants'by announcing forthcoming team projects to all employees. Individuals
are encouraged to volunteer for the additional assignments as team members representing their functional
areas. In many cases, competition for a team position is intense. Thus, the team leader is in the enviable
position of being able to select members from a pool of volunteers. Obviously, team membership has the
potential for satisfaction and intrinsic and tangible rewards at Baxter. The Wisconsin Department of Revenue has identiﬁed the following communication skills as being
signiﬁcant to employee success. (If an individual is deﬁcient in one or more areas, he or she. can attend
training offered by the department, attend management development programs, pursue self-study, or
obtain a mentor.) Listening (the ability to understand, organize, and analyze what we hear) Actively attend to and convey understanding of the comments and questions of others.
Identify and test the inferences and assumptions we make. Overcome barriers to effective listening (semantic, psychological, physical).
Summarize and reorganize a message for recall. Keep the speaker’s intent, content, and process separate. Withhold judgment that can bias responses to the message. 17David G.

I Construct and deliver clear, concise, complete, well- organized, and convincing messages. I Keep on target—avoid digressions and irrelevancies and meet the aim of the communication. I Determine how to use persuasion effectively.
I Maintain a climate of mutual beneﬁt, trust, rapport, and a win-win outcome. Getting Unbiased Information (minimize the ﬁltering and editing that take place when information is
transmitted from person to person) I Use directiJnondirect, and reﬂective questions.
I Identify forces that may bias the information.
I Conﬁrm understanding and obtain agreement and closure. Fostering Open Communication
l Create an atmosphere in which timely, high-quality information ﬂows smoothly between self and others I Encourage open expression of ideas and opinions.19 Team Development and 'l't‘alning Each team will develop its own personality, but the key objective of all teams must be willingness to sub-
ordinate personal and functional interests to the team’s goals. Having a competent leader and having
well-qualiﬁed team members are two critical ﬁrst steps. The third step is team development and training.
This calls for investments that should pay a high return. For example, Southern California Edison (SCE)
has used team development and training to create one of the best supply management systems in the
utility industry. Under the leadership of Emiko Banﬁeld, 24 cross-functional supply management teams
have been established to manage supply issues. Each SCE team receives three days of team develop-
ment and training as a foundation for its activities. As a result, SCE has taken over $250 million out of
a spend of approximately $1 billion. Working through cross- fun-ctional teams, Banﬁeld discovered that
internal barriers could be reduced, setting the stage for successful collaboration if teams were trained
properly.20 The Supply Chain Management Institute at the University of San Diego is pioneering an alternative
approach to team development. Four-person cross-functiOnal teams from client ﬁrms undergo interactive
training on selected supply management topics. A one-hour workshop is conducted after each one-hour
training module. During the Workshop, each team conducts a gap analysis, comparing one of its processes
with the world-class processes presented in the previous training module. The team then develops a
preliminary action plan to close the gap. The plan identiﬁes key actions, a time line, and an estimate of the
bottom-line impact of the team’s proposed plan. Preliminary ﬁndings indicate that cohesive teams evolve
with this approach to training and organizational transformation. Although the ﬁndings are preliminary,
this approach to team development appears to be very cost effective. ' lgO’Shea, ”Relationship-Building Skills.” p. 7.

r 46 PART 1 The Foundation Adequate Time Unrealistic deadlines are major problems that block the success of many cross-functional teams. As Burt
and Pinkerton wrote, “Too much pressure for results too soon will almost always force a team to prema-
ture and less effective decisions.”21 The tendency for management to act now rather than allowing time for
good analysis is an old habit in the United States. Many of America’s global competitors have the patience
to take time to nurture participative management. The results of nurturing participative management are
well known. Just ask American automotive manufacturers about the cost of quick reactions without fos-
tering participation.” ' Inter-firm Teams When buying and supplying organizations recognize the interdependence and the beneﬁts to both parties
of a collaborative or alliance relationship, the development of an interfirm team should be considered. In
effect, a superordinate cross-functional team will result. Dan Mohr, Director of Supplier Relations for
GTE, observes: “Relationship teams are the building blocks upon which the relationship prospers. Team
meetings provide a forum to jointly discuss new ways to reduce process costs, improve service to our cus-
tomers, and enhance time to market, which ultimately expands market share for both organizations.”23 As
with cross-functional teams within each ﬁrm, the assignment of the “right” individuals and team training
are essential for success. One signiﬁcant difference is that two executive sponsors will be required, one at
each ﬁrm. The interﬁrm team’s ﬁrst task, after receiving appropriate training, is the development of a cus-
tomized effective and efﬁcient communication system. As we will see in the chapter on relationships, many progressive organizations are working with se-
lected collaborative suppliers to develop and manage supply alliances. One of the keys to success with such
efforts is the development and use of interfirm teams. Experience indicates that the basis of such interﬁrm
teams must be the existence of cross-functional teams at both the buying and the supplying organizations.
The development and use of interﬁrm teams is more challenging than are in-house cross-functional teams,
but the beneﬁts are even greater! Supply Management’s Roles on Gross-Functional Teams Timothy M. Laseter, vice president, Booz-Allen & Harm1ton Inc in New York, identiﬁes four principal
roles for supply management professionals who are members of cross-functional teams. I . Provide the process expertise of supply management in areas such as supply base research, supplier
cost modeling, or (more typically) negotiation. I Provide content knowledge of a speciﬁc supply market or commodity area that the supply
management individual directs. l Serve as the liaison with the supply management organization to ensure that project needs obtain
priorities among other staff in the corporate organization. I Represent the supply management point of view in considering trade-offs, setting priorities, and
making decisions affecting policy.24 21Burt and Pinkerton, Strategic Proactive Pmcurement, p. 195. ‘ 22Diane Brown. “Supplier Management Teams," NAPM Insights, August 1994, p. 33. 23Mary Crews, “Relationship Management Yields Results,” Purchasing Today, June 2000, pp. 8-9. 24Timothy M. Laseter, “Overcoming Conﬂicting Priorities." Purchasing Today 9, no. 1 (December 1998), p. 37. CHAPTER 2 Organizational Issues 47 In 210 B.C., Arbiter Petronius of the Greek Navy wrote, “We trained hard . . . but it seemed that every
time we were beginning to form up into teams we would be reorganized, and I was to learn later in life
that we tend to meet any new situation by reorganizing."25 Fortunately, great progress has been made
in the design and use of teams, especially in the areas of new product development, project management, source selection, and negotiation.

End Notes Although many variables have an impact on the success or failure of a cross-functional team, none is more critical than the team leader. Professor Robert Trent of Lehigh University has conducted extensive research on the role of cross-functional teams in purchasing and supply management. Trent deﬁnes an effective team leader as “one who is capable of satisfying a set of essential operating responsibilities and requirements while still promoting the creativity, leadership ability, and innovativeness of individual team members.”
Trent identiﬁes 10 requirements for effective team leadership: Work with the team to establish and make a commitment to performance goals.
Secure individual member involvement and commitment. Manage internal team conﬂict. Help maintain team focus and direction. Secure required organizational resources. Prevent team domination by a member or faction. Deal with internal and external obstacles confronting the team. Coordinate multiple tasks and manage the status of team assignments. Clarify and help deﬁne each member’s role. Provide performance feedback to members.” The interested reader is encouraged to read Professor Trent’s full article and the 1994 book Leading Teams: Mastering the New Role. 27
In the spring of 1999, Michael A. Hitt reported on a longitudinal case study of a cross-functional new
product development team that became dysfunctional and obtained suboptimal results. Hitt’s research supports the following important conclusions: I Top management support of the cross-functional team is essential to the success of critical projects. I Management leadership of the cross-functional team is critical. I Functional activities, suppliers, and key customers who have signiﬁcant input should be involved
throughout the project’s life. I Geographically dispersed teams are difﬁcult to manage?8 25Cited in David M. Moore and Peter B. Antill. “Integrated Project Teams: The Way Forward for UK Defence Procurement,"

management is based On embracing the power of cross-functional teams. These teams include supply man-
agement professionals, design and production engineers, and quality managers and frequently their coun-
terparts from supply chain partners. Such teams play an essential role in the required transformations. Suggested Reading Guertin, Ron, and Vince Scacchitti. “Managing Diﬂicult Teams," presented at the 90th Annual International Supply
