			M. Norman Anderson worked with Cominco, now Teck Resources, for over 34 years.  In 1978, he became President and Chief Operating Officer of Cominco, and in 1980 he assumed complete responsibility for Cominco's business as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  In an interim period during his tenure with Cominco, between 1970 and 1974, Mr. Anderson left Cominco and spent a four-year period in an executive position with Amax Lead Zinc Inc.  Mr. Anderson left Cominco in 1986 and has been a director and consultant to the mining industry since that time.  He is a current director of Barkerville Gold Mines Ltd. (since June 2012).  Mr. Anderson has also been a director of other mining companies including Cia de Minas Bonaventura SA (February 1995-March 2011), Hudbay Minerals Ltd. (December 2004-March 2009), and Anatolia Mineral Development Ltd. (January 2004-April 2008).  Mr. Anderson obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Geological Engineering from the University of Manitoba, became a Professional Mining Engineer in 1961 and became a fellow of the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining in 1989. 



Mr. Anderson's experience as a high-level executive officer in the resource sector, combined with his experience as a board member for several other resource companies, brings a key perspective to the Board's role in directing the management of the Company's projects.  Further, his degree, his registration as a Professional Mining Engineer, and his experience as a fellow of the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining bring an expertise to the Board in relation to the analysis and understanding of the Company's mineral resources.  As the Company's Bear Lodge property is an exploration stage property that the Company is moving towards future development, Mr. Anderson's experience within the resource sector and his understanding of the Company's resource position are valuable to the implementation of the Company's current business plan.  Accordingly, the Board believes that Mr. Anderson should once again serve on the Board.
