Have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify coverage.
Tell them you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit.
Inform them if you have Medicaid and find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.
Come with a list of questions to ask the doctor.
What's the difference between an HMO and a PPO?HMOs can be more affordable, but you'll usually get less coverage and more restrictions on what doctors you can see and when. Other drawbacks to HMOs include needing to obtain a referral before seeing a specialist, and annual limits on the number of office visits, tests, and certain treatments. PPOs are more flexible and provide greater coverage, but come with a higher price tag. The amount your insurance plan will pay for out of network care is likely to be less than it would pay for in-network care. There are less HMOs these days and more PPOs.What is the difference between in-network and out-of-network insurance?You need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive.

Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses.What is needed for a doctor to be board certified?Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.What does a surgeon do?Surgeons operate on patients to treat injuries, such as broken bones; diseases; and deformities.What does a OB/GYN do?For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.What does an ENT do?If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.What does a dermatologist do?Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.What does a dentist do?Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.What does a cardiologist do?Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.See more Tips & AdviceThomas J.

That's exactly why they can cure even the hardest cases--they're flexible and individualized. With premature ovarian failure, all the statistics said that I had literally zero chance of conceiving a child with my own eggs, even with the best fertility treatments. Most clinics said they could only help me if I were willing to use donor eggs. But Dr. Tur-Kaspa was willing to try with my own eggs. After I failed to respond to even the most aggressive standard protocol, he devised an experimental treatment for me based on some recent studies. The result: we're currently pregnant with fraternal twins! With a third perfect embryo frozen for future use. Even he seemed a little amazed at the results. Tur-Kaspa Ilan Mdmaureen ratedDr. Tur-Kaspa is the best in h...Dr. Tur-Kaspa is the best in his field. I went to him after 2 failed ivfs from a previous doctor. He took the time with me to answer all my questions and concerns. His staff is also courteous and kind and was always there to answer any questions or concerns.  At my second appointment he found polyps in my uterine lining that were missed by the previous doctor. We then did ivf with icsi and assisted hatching and I am now in my 6th week of pregnancy. I'm over the moon and so grateful to Dr. Tur-Kaspa and his staff for helping me make my dreams come true. Pregnant at 40. I couldn't ask for anything more. I'm so thankful to them and would reccomend him to anyone struggling with infertility.Tur-Kaspa Ilan Mdannask ratedI went through 3 failed IVF cycles, and also we had very few embryos (1-2) ready for transfer. I was recommended to meet Dr. Tur-Kaspa.He went through all the medical documentation that I brought with me and suggested a different protocol. I went through 2 cycles but the first was without a transfer (intentionally). We had 14 (!!!) embryos and bottom line - I AM 6 MONTHS PREGNANT. I am aware of that sometimes Dr. Tur-Kaspa has a cynical and non graceful attitude, but all in all I feel that he's SUPER professional and the best doctor that ever treated me. He's a good listener and also he has an outstanding "out of the box" way of thinking.Dr. Anil R. Shah, MDAleksandra K. ratedStarting off I want to say that the staff here is beyond welcoming and helpful. Dr. Anil Shah himself has a warm, yet confident, and at the same time caring personality which made me trust him from the beginning over other doctors I have seen. After my surgery it was extremely easy for me to transition into my 'new nose' because the change was so subtle and non invasive. Recovery for me was a walk in a park as well (and that was my biggest fear going into this). Overall from beginning till now I feel great about my decision and I feel deep in my heart it is thanks to Dr. Shah and his caring staff.Harmony Medical & Wellness Centerpatientmary ratedDr James Mo Excellent Family D...Dr James Mo Excellent Family DoctorI would highly recommend Dr. Mo to everyone! Dr Mo is a caring and very knowledgeable family physician.  He and his office staff are very friendly. My entire family has been seeing Dr. Mo for many years and very satisfied with him. He listens to what you have to say and cares deeply about your condition. He spends a lot of time with us and you don't find a lot of doctors that are willing to do that nowadays.  His diagnosis is always very accurate. We have high level of trust in him. Dr. Mo also does Immigration Exams and Physical Therapy which are awesome!Dr. Anil R. Shah, MDK F. ratedSaw Dr. Shah for a rhinoplasty. Best decision I ever made! I am now 6 months post op and could not be happier with the results. Dr. shah is an excellent, skilled surgeon-really an artist! He also has a very friendly and approachable bedside manner. His staff is always super helpful. Appointments are always on time which is so rare with doctors these days! If you are considering rhinoplasty Dr Shah is the best. I already referred a friend for a rhinoplasty with Dr Shah. His surgery was last week and also had nothing but the best things to say about Dr Shah.Dr. Anil R. Shah, MDK R. ratedDr.Shah turned my vision for my rhinoplasty into a reality. I am so happy with the results. I do however wish that he had been able to articulate to me a little more how the procedure went, what was done and that I had stitches still in my nose after the one week follow up where the black stitches were removed. I did not know the blue stitches were in there and pulled them out on accident thinking it was a hair or something because the swelling had covered them. Overall though very happy I did the procedure and think that Dr.shah did a beautiful job.Dr. Anil R. Shah, MDWaylon F. ratedI had a great experience with Dr. Shah. I was a bit nervous at first because I have never had surgery and did not know what to expect. His staff was very comforting throughout the entire process and answered all of my questions. What I found amazing was that after the removal of a lipoma from my forehead I did not feel any pain, only pressure, throughout the healing process. Best of all, I do not have a visible scar since he went through my hair line. I also did not have to shave any portion of my head. I could not be any happier. Waylon F.Did You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.
