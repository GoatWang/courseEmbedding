Known around the country in nearly16 major metropolitan markets for developing superb business verticals while at current, regarded as one of Philly's top 25 Best Executive Recruiters aside from being a firm owner, Richard's financial and business success has stemmed from truly recognizing to always be a "student" to his discipline, while growing his business platform as a skilled educator to others, and never failing to encourage an entrepreneurial spirit within his own team culture at TRG.  Rich's robust portfolio of countless industries he has staffed while working with multi-level management, C level executives, and business owners has afforded Rich a wide range of diverse network circles who respect his sincere and talented business style.   

I have interacted with hundreds of executive recruiters who tried starting their own business venture over the years and did not succeed because they were all missing three main ingredients Rich Branca clearly has; work balance, self-drive/determination, and the sophistication to realize that professional third party recruitment is about a long range strategy and economically driven and you must strike hard when the iron is hot, and in the many years of working and admiring the skill of Rich Branca, he has done all of this extremely well!

With much respect,
