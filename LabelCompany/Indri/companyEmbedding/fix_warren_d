Warren D.  Fix has had an extensive career in finance and management with particular industry expertise in  real estate, hospitality, agriculture and financial services.
Following several years with PriceWaterhouseCoopers  where he became a Certified Public Accountant, Mr. Fix joined The Irvine Company in 1964 during its initial development phase.  He was one of the initial team of ten professionals hired to initiate the development of a 125,000 acre land asset located in Orange County, California.  During his 25 year career, The Irvine Company became one of the nation’s most prestigious and profitable real estate companies.  The Irvine Company developed residential property, for-sale housing, apartments, commercial, industrial, retail, hotel, cablevision and other land related uses.  He held various executive positions including Chief Financial Officer and had operational responsibility for several significant operating divisions.  He served as a member of the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors.  During his tenure he orchestrated two substantial financing transactions involving major changes in ownership positions of the Company.  He also served as a board member and treasurer of the Irvine Ranch Water District, a state-of-the-art provider of water and waste water services for Irvine Company properties.
 In 1989, Mr. Fix left The Irvine Company to become President of the Pacific Company.  The Pacific Company was the parent of Woodcrest Homes (now part of Hovanian Homes).  Mr. Fix was responsible for the development, acquisition and management of an apartment portfolio comprising in excess of 3,000 units.
Since 1992 Mr. Fix has been, and continues as, an active partner in the Contrarian Group, a private investment  and management company headed by Peter Ueberroth.  In that capacity, he coordinated several investment strategies in the hospitality industry primarily with Doubletree Corporation, Promus Hotel Corporation and Hilton Hotels.
 In 1996, as part of his role with the Contrarian Group, Mr. Fix formed Candlewood Hotel Company with the founder of the Residence Inns, now owned by Marriott Corporation.   Mr. Fix relocated to Kansas and oversaw the development of a chain of extended stay hotels.  Mr. Fix directed the initial public offering of Candlewood in 1996 and raised over $150 million in equity capital and over $750 million of debt to support the development of hotels.  Candlewood developed 117 properties aggregating 13,300 rooms.  Mr. Fix served on the board of directors and in various executive capacities including Chief Financial Officer. In 2003, most of the assets of  Candlewood were sold to Intercontinental Hotel Corporation and Hospitality Properties Trust.   Mr. Fix managed the five year long dissolution of the corporation as Chief Executive Officer.
Mr. Fix serves on the Board of Directors of the Clark Investment Group.  Mr. Fix is an active participant and investor. This firms was established in 1965 and provides equity capital to small and medium size real estate developers, investors and businesses on a national basis.
Mr. Fix currently is a member of the Board of Directors of Healthcare Trust of America. He previously served on the Board of Directors of numerous public and private companies.  He served as Chairman of the California Taxpayers Association, a 1500 member group of businesses, which lobbies legislation in the State of California.  As a board member of the National Realty Committee, he was co-chairman of the Tax Policy Committee. He is an active investor in a number of enterprises.

Lee was very good at writing up the repair and letting us know how much it would cost before the work was done.  Eddie was the mechanic who did the work, and he was very thorough in the job that he did.  Eddie also explained in detail the repairs that were required. He even showed me the parts that had been replaced. We were very impressed at the quality of service that we received at Pride Auto and Truck Repair.  Then the bonus... the charge for the repair was a few dollars LESS than the original estimate, which was a very pleasant surprise.  We were very pleased with the service and quality of work that PRIDE performed on our car.  We also like the warranty they gave us on the work that they did.   You can tell that the workers at PRIDE take PRIDE in their work.  Based upon our experience with Pride Auto and Truck Repair, we would recommend them!!Independence Auto RepairAudra D. ratedI found this great repair shop a few years ago and have been coming back time and time again ever since. Great professionals in that they tell you, show you & explain to you what is going on with your vehicle. They don't rip you off. I've received estimates for repairs from them then got other estimates elsewhere to compare. I always end up back with these guys. Bill (owner & mechanic) Stacy (daughter, receptionist & knows her way around cars too) Greg & Chris (mechanics) are all awesome. I know sometimes reviews may seem too good to be true but these guys are really true gems in the world of dirty mechanics. Everything won't always be the lower cost you want but just know that if a time comes when you have to pay a little more than normal, it couldn't be helped and they will do it right. ����������������Pride Auto & Truck Repair, LLCC N. ratedPRIDE AUTO is a very TRUSTWORTHY auto repair shop that I have recommended to family and friends. We are so glad we found PRIDE AUTO last year when we needed car repairs. Lee and John are very honest.  They do a good job, and they are very fair in what they charge. They go above and beyond trying to help you. We really trust and appreciate Lee and John.  We had an air conditioning problem this year, and we found that same good service at PRIDE AUTO REPAIR. Thank you, Lee and John for running a shop that we can go to with confidence that we will receive good service at fair prices. We have recommended your shop to relatives and friends.  Pride Auto and Truck Repair is a GREAT PLACE to have your car repaired.JB DLCO Transmissionshollylane02 ratedI couldn't say enough good things about JB DLCO. My car was a bit more of a handful than anticipated due to a warranty on the water pump that was leaking, but taking advantage of the warranty stood to save me a lot of money on the repairs. They were insanely patient with the phone tag going on between my father, the family mechanic in Bay City (who had installed the water pump back in Nov), the warranty company, and me. Once all of the payments were sorted he got right to work on my car. He was down a mechanic at his shop so I know he worked longer hours than he usually does in an effort to get my car done in a decent amount of time.  Always and will forever recommend JB DLCO.Fast N Fair65chevy ratedJune 2012 , We were in Warren,...June 2012 , We were in Warren, Mi for the Hot Rod Power Tour. Went to car wash on Mound rd to wash truck, My husband decided to do a burn out and the trailing arm broke on the rearend , so being stranded..SOMEWHERE in Mi, another Hotrodder told us about FNF, The owner drove to the carwash, strapped the rearend up with a strap and told us to follow him, Here we go.... It was already close to closing, he welded it back up and also welded the other side,,GREAT STAFF and Owner,, Didnt even charge us nearly enough,, Thanks to FNF we made it all the WAY from MICHGAN to TEXAS.. Now back home to MOBILE, AL... Words can't say enough..THANKS SO MUCH..Fast N Fairveryhappycustomer ratedFast N Fair is one of the most...Fast N Fair is one of the most honest (literally) auto repair shops around. They will price just about anybody out the water. They do great work and I will always bring my automobiles to them. Anybody who claims to have had a bad experience with these people obviously had other underlying issues or they just have a poor attitude about everything. Anytime I have gone to this place customers proudly discuss their prices in comparison to the other shops they had stopped by and Rob always gains another customer and usually their family and friends too!!! Thanks Fast N Fair Crew for being such a great company.JB DLCO Transmissionsdonnawarfield466 ratedI wanted to thank you for the ...I wanted to thank you for the quality work your employees did while we were on vacation. My daughter was pleased with the performance of her Chrysler with 112,000 miles on it. She said it's better than it's ever been since she bought it! She said her dealings with Jeff were great. She said everyone was polite and helpful. We were all pleasantly surprised when she was asked to bring the car back in 2 weeks or so in order for the transmission to be checked along with the fluid level. Thanks again for the efficient service. Center Line Auto ServiceRyan O. ratedCenterline auto service is the best! John the owner is a top notch guy who believes in honesty and quality work! I brought my car in as a recommendation and John took the time to speak with me about the issue I was experiencing with my car and went over all the bad parts and my options. His goal was to perform a quality job while saving me time and money. I would definitely recommend anyone to go here. Friendly, honest and hard working. It's hard to find repair shops like this anymore.JB DLCO Transmissionsmollymasters324 ratedThey had to totally rebuild my transmission.  They towed the van in, did a complete diagnostic, explained the problem to me, gave me an estimate, and performed the work. They ran into additional electrical problems, but didn’t finish the job until they could guarantee that the new transmission wouldn’t have problems with the electrical like the original one did (it blew at only 66K miles).  I was very pleased. They explained the details to me well. Independence Auto RepairMary L. ratedThis is one of the best auto service repairs cnts.! I have had  Oil Change, radiator replace, rear seal replace on my 2005 Jeep. There prices are lower then most larger auto repair shops that I use to go to. And their friendly service is awesome. They don't just tell you what is wrong they show you and explain things that you can understand. Thanks Bill for the great service!  Did You Know?Finding An Auto Repair ProfessionalThere are more than 700,000 auto service technicians and mechanics in the U.S. Finding the right one to repair a dent in your car door or fix an engine that won't start can be overwhelming, especially when it's an emergency. Review a few important facts about auto repair professionals and what you can do to get the best possible mechanic working on your vehicle's issues for a fair price.Looking For Reliability
Unlike home repair services that evaluate a property, meet with homeowners and have time to prepare before their physical work begins, auto repair businesses are often asked to make fixes on the spot. If you come into a garage with a tire issue, the expectation is the mechanic will know how to correct that problem quickly.That is why reliability is so vital when searching for a trusted auto repair shop. It may take going to several different mechanics before you find one you are truly comfortable with. Pose questions to this professional to find out what approach they will take to repair your car or what alternatives are available. Shopping around also gives you the best opportunity to find the cheapest rate or the fastest service, as some garages may be backed up with other vehicles that need repair first.A recommended way to locate a trustworthy auto repair professional is to seek out customer reviews. Online sites offer honest opinions from real customers who have used a business. Read through this feedback to learn how a business operates and what you can expect if you were to take your vehicle there. Look for reviews about how quick maintenance was completed and if prices were fair. By learning what other people have said about a garage, you can gain a better idea if it's the right place to go when you have a car problem in need of fixing.Understanding When There's An IssueIt can be difficult to know which automotive problems are serious enough to require expert assistance. A ripped seat cushion or broken radio don't involve safety and will not warrant enough of a problem that going into a garage is required. However, setbacks with brakes, lights and other parts that are vital to the safety of your car's driver and passengers, as well as others on the road, necessitate quick fixes. Many modern automobiles will notify drivers of an issue, in the form of a signal on the dashboard or a noise within the vehicle.In the event of an accident, even if your vehicle does not appear to have any damage on the outside, it is generally recommended that you see a trusted auto repair professional. Internal damage may have occurred, or an important part may have been knocked out of place. Fixing these issues before driving much further can prevent further vehicle breakdowns in the future. In the case of a serious accident, a body shop can assess the problems and determine the best course of action for repairs, as well as evaluate how much they will cost.Beyond that, regular checkups are recommended. Tires must be rotated, fluids needs to be replaced and the engine must be evaluated. After driving 25,000 miles, most auto dealers suggest having the vehicle checked out to ensure everything is running smoothly. Taking the car into the auto repair professional you trust will protect you from further problems down the road.Doing Your Own Auto RepairNot every type of auto repair work needs to be done by a certified mechanic. You can fix some of a vehicle's issues just by paying attention to how the automobile is running and having a basic understanding of auto repair. Look over the ways weather may impact your car and what preventative measures you can take to avoid having to take it into the shop. At the same time, be aware of mechanic scams that can impact your experience.Preventing Trips To The Professional
Some fixes to your car can be done without paying a specialist. Issues like replacing oil and air filters are relatively simple, with instructions provided in the owner's manual on how to make these changes. The same goes for replacing broken windshield wipers or burnt-out headlights. Such issues should be repaired quickly to guarantee safety, but don't require a visit to a garage. By handling these types of tasks on your own, you'll gain a better understanding for how your car operates and save time and money.Along with understanding how to fix manageable vehicle issues that may arise, taking preventative measures to avoid future problems is a valuable time saver. Many problem-solving best practices are related to the seasons. Your vehicle will be in different conditions in the winter than in the summer, meaning it requires a different type of preparation.In the spring and summer, you want to be sure your air conditioner and cooling systems work correctly. Given the high temperatures the vehicle will be exposed to, overheating is a common problem. Look over the system by ensuring there is enough coolant available. If it needs to be refilled, it is best to open the hood and add more to the car before it gets too warm out. Also, clean out fan ducts and other ventilation sources necessary for summertime driving.For winter driving, features such as the defroster, heater and exhaust system are paramount. Look in your owner's manual for specific directions on how features should be checked and repaired. Many newer cars have a cabin air filter that can be replaced when needed, allowing warm air to continue to flow in. Also, check your tires before winter driving, as they need to be at the proper pressure to perform well on snow and ice.Avoiding Scams
There is a common worry among many people that auto repair professionals take advantage of the general public. Because so many people are unaware of how to fix the problems in their vehicle, they are nervous of being overcharged by mechanics or worried that the improper work is being done.While the great majority of professionals in the industry are honest, hard-working people, a few bad apples can ruin everything. You should be extra careful when first visiting a mechanic to guarantee that the price you're charged and maintenance the vehicle receives are fair.Among the common scams pulled are needless repairs, where a garage charges you for work that isn't necessary. Another popular one is attracting customers through a cheap oil change or tire pressure check. Then, when you are in the shop and your car is being repaired, they give you a long list of other corrections they'd like to make, therefore boosting the total cost of your bill.The best way to combat these types of problems is getting a written estimate before work is done. That way, you can see how much repairs are expected to cost. If the final bill is higher than the estimate projected, ask to specifically see the work. Make sure information is put in writing as well. If a problem remains, you can have proof that work was not done to your satisfaction.By working closely with an auto repair professional and doing some of the tune-up work on your own, you will be less likely to fall for these scams. At the same time, you'll be able to drive out with a clean and healthy vehicle, thanks to the repairs made by a trained professional.
