Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. Reports First Quarter 2017 Financial Results | Business Wire
























































Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. Reports First Quarter 2017 Financial 
      Results






May 02, 2017 06:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CORAL GABLES, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. (NYSE: FDP) today reported financial 
      results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. The Company reported 
      earnings per diluted share of $0.90 for the first quarter 2017, compared 
      with earnings per diluted share of $1.57 in the first quarter of 2016. 
      Comparable earnings per diluted share were $0.84 in the first quarter, 
      compared with comparable earnings per diluted share of $1.56 in the 
      first quarter of 2016.
    

      “We are very pleased with the progress we made in the first quarter, 
      achieving key objectives that will enhance our diversified business 
      platform,” said Mohammad Abu-Ghazaleh, Chairman and Chief Executive 
      Officer. “During the quarter, we also introduced new products, added 
      customers in our global fresh-cut business, and increased market share 
      in our avocado product line. We faced a number of headwinds during the 
      quarter, including a weak banana market, lower pineapple volume, and a 
      poor Chilean season that constrained our performance. As we move 
      forward, we remain optimistic that investing in our diverse global 
      operations, implementing product innovations, and continuing to instill 
      cost-savings and efficiencies in all of our businesses, will deliver 
      long-term value to our shareholders.”
    

      Net sales for the first quarter of 2017 were $1,032.4 million, compared 
      with $1,018.1 million in the first quarter of 2016. The increase in net 
      sales was primarily the result of higher net sales in the Company's 
      other fresh produce and prepared food business segments, partially 
      offset by lower net sales in the Company's banana business segment.
    

      Gross profit for the first quarter of 2017 was $99.1 million, compared 
      with $140.7 million in the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in gross 
      profit was principally due to higher fruit costs in the Company's other 
      fresh produce business segment, lower selling prices in the banana 
      business segment and unfavorable exchange rates, partially offset by 
      higher sales volume.
    

      Operating income for the first quarter of 2017 was $53.9 million, 
      compared with operating income of $90.5 million in the first quarter of 
      2016. Comparable operating income was $51.2 million in the first quarter 
      of 2017, compared with comparable operating income of $90.1 million in 
      the first quarter of 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower gross 
      profit.
    

      Net income attributable to Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. for the first 
      quarter of 2017 was $46.4 million, compared with net income of $81.7 
      million in the first quarter of 2016. Comparable net income was $43.7 
      million in the first quarter of 2017, compared with comparable net 
      income of $81.3 million in the first quarter of 2016.

Non-GAAP Measures


      The Company's results are determined in accordance with U.S. generally 
      accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Some of the information presented 
      in this press release reflects adjustments to GAAP measures such as 
      amounts related to restructuring, asset impairment charges, gain on 
      sales of assets and certain other special items, if any. Management 
      believes these adjustments provide a more comparable analysis of the 
      ongoing operating performance of the business. These adjustments result 
      in non-GAAP financial measures and are referred to in this press release 
      as comparable operating income, comparable net income and comparable net 
      income per share. Because all companies do not use identical 
      calculations, our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures may 
      not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
    

      Comparable operating income and comparable net income provide us with an 
      understanding of the results from the primary operations of our 
      business. We use comparable operating income and comparable net income 
      to evaluate our period-over-period operating performance because 
      management believes they provide more comparable measures of our 
      continuing business as they adjust for special items that are not 
      reflective of the normal earnings of our business. These measures may be 
      useful to an investor in evaluating the underlying operating performance 
      of our business because these measures:
    


        Are used by investors to measure a company's comparable operating 
        performance;
      

        Are financial measurements that are used by lenders and other parties 
        to evaluate creditworthiness; and
      

        Are used by our management for various purposes, including as measures 
        of performance of our operating entities and as a basis of strategic 
        planning and forecasting.

Forward-looking Information


This press release contains certain forward-looking statements 
      regarding the intent, beliefs or current expectations of the Company or 
      its officers with respect to the Company’s plans and future performance.
These forward-looking statements are based on information currently 
      available to the Company and the Company assumes no obligation to update 
      these statements. It is important to note that these forward-looking 
      statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks 
      and uncertainties. In this press release, these statements appear in a 
      number of places and include statements regarding the intent, belief or 
      current expectations of the Company or its officers (including 
      statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words 
      “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates” or similar expressions). The 
      Company’s plans and performance may differ materially from those in the 
      forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including (i) 
      the uncertain global economic environment and the timing and strength of 
      a recovery in the markets we serve, and the extent to which adverse 
      economic conditions continue to affect our sales volume and results, 
      including our ability to command premium prices for certain of our 
      principal products, or increase competitive pressures within the 
      industry, (ii) the impact of governmental initiatives in the United 
      States and abroad to spur economic activity, including the effects of 
      significant government monetary or other market interventions on 
      inflation, price controls and foreign exchange rates, (iii) the impact 
      of governmental trade restrictions, including adverse governmental 
      regulation that may impact our ability to access certain markets such as 
      uncertainty surrounding the recent vote in the United Kingdom to leave 
      the European Union (often referred as Brexit), including spillover 
      effects to other Eurozone countries, (iv) our anticipated cash needs in 
      light of our liquidity, (v) the continued ability of our distributors 
      and suppliers to have access to sufficient liquidity to fund their 
      operations, (vi) trends and other factors affecting our financial 
      condition or results of operations from period to period, including 
      changes in product mix or consumer demand for branded products such as 
      ours, particularly as consumers remain price-conscious in the current 
      economic environment; anticipated price and expense levels; the impact 
      of crop disease, severe weather conditions, such as flooding, or natural 
      disasters, such as earthquakes, on crop quality and yields and on our 
      ability to grow, procure or export our products; the impact of prices 
      for petroleum-based products and packaging materials; and the 
      availability of sufficient labor during peak growing and harvesting 
      seasons, (vii) the impact of pricing and other actions by our 
      competitors, particularly during periods of low consumer confidence and 
      spending levels, (viii) the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, 
      (ix) our plans for expansion of our business (including through 
      acquisitions) and cost savings, (x) our ability to successfully 
      integrate acquisitions into our operations, (xi) the impact of 
      impairment or other charges associated with exit activities, crop or 
      facility damage or otherwise, (xii) the timing and cost of resolution of 
      pending and future legal and environmental proceedings or 
      investigations, (xiii) the impact of changes in tax accounting or tax 
      laws (or interpretations thereof), and the impact of settlements of 
      adjustments proposed by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing 
      authorities in connection with our tax audits, and (xiv) the cost and 
      other implications of changes in regulations applicable to our business, 
      including potential legislative or regulatory initiatives in the United 
      States or elsewhere directed at mitigating the effects of climate 
      change. All forward-looking statements in this report are based on 
      information available to the Company on the date hereof, and the Company 
      assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. The 
      Company’s plans and performance may also be affected by the factors 
      described in Item 1A. - “Risk Factors” in Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc.’s 
      Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2016 along 
      with other reports that the Company has on file with the Securities and

Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. Reports First Quarter 2017 Financial Results






Business Wire




May 2, 2017 6:00 AM EDT













 


















































  Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. (NYSE: FDP) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. The Company reported earnings per diluted share of $0.90 for the first quarter 2017, compared with earnings per diluted share of $1.57 in the first quarter of 2016. Comparable earnings per diluted share were $0.84 in the first quarter, compared with comparable earnings per diluted share of $1.56 in the first quarter of 2016.  "We are very pleased with the progress we made in the first quarter, achieving key objectives that will enhance our diversified business platform," said Mohammad Abu-Ghazaleh, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "During the quarter, we also introduced new products, added customers in our global fresh-cut business, and increased market share in our avocado product line. We faced a number of headwinds during the quarter, including a weak banana market, lower pineapple volume, and a poor Chilean season that constrained our performance. As we move forward, we remain optimistic that investing in our diverse global operations, implementing product innovations, and continuing to instill cost-savings and efficiencies in all of our businesses, will deliver long-term value to our shareholders."  Net sales for the first quarter of 2017 were $1,032.4 million, compared with $1,018.1 million in the first quarter of 2016. The increase in net sales was primarily the result of higher net sales in the Company's other fresh produce and prepared food business segments, partially offset by lower net sales in the Company's banana business segment.  Gross profit for the first quarter of 2017 was $99.1 million, compared with $140.7 million in the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in gross profit was principally due to higher fruit costs in the Company's other fresh produce business segment, lower selling prices in the banana business segment and unfavorable exchange rates, partially offset by higher sales volume.

Produce
Our produce is a sight to behold. It's like we got it from Central Casting: a visual feast of color, variety and sparkling freshness piled high for your pleasure and convenience. Cue the credits.



Meat & Poultry
If you’re looking for “natural meat,” we’re looking out for you, because that term only means no additives in the finished product. We go further with great-tasting meat from animals raised with no antibiotics, ever, and no added hormones*. Plus, our farmer and rancher partners follow strict standards for farm-animal welfare. And we’ve got you covered when it comes to local, grass-fed and organic, too.



Seafood
Our Seafood Department is the top reason many shoppers give for coming to our stores. Not only will you find a wide selection of fresh and frozen, high-quality seafood, we source only from sustainable fisheries and responsible farms. You can shop with confidence, and our fishmongers are ready with a smile.

Add Share Button To Marquee Box:  Produce
Our produce is a sight to behold. It's the first thing you see when you come into one of our stores: a visual feast of color, variety and sparkling freshness piled high for your pleasure and convenience.
The quality of produce at our stores is simply second to none. Our produce buyers, based in all regions of the country, maintain relationships with our local growers and our field inspectors are on the road 52 weeks a year seeking out the best of the best.
Organic produce is a mainstay for us. Early on, we committed to offering as much organic produce as available because we believe organic farming supports a healthy environment. Fresh fruits and vegetables grown without the use of long-lasting chemical pesticides and fertilizers will always have a prominent place on our shelves.
We feature local produce in season. While the definition of local varies by region of the country, it generally means one day’s drive away or less, and it's usually much less. Ask a produce team member where your store’s local produce comes from and when your favorite items will be in season.
We know that you like to know where your food comes from, so we display the origin of every piece of produce we sell. To meet customer demand, we do our best to offer the highestquality fruits and vegetables year-round, so we use our experience and relationships with growers from around the world to obtain the best of what's "in season" in other parts of the world.
Devotion to quality and service is a daily mantra in every one of our produce departments. That's why you can find just about anything you want there, from the humble to the exotic, from bananas to Buddha's hand (in season, of course!). Come in and explore. You're bound to find something delicious.

        Foodservicedirect offers over 10,000 specialty food items. All of our specialty food products ship in case quantities, typically within three business days. The specialty category encompasses a broad range - from ethnic and regional specialties to organic and gluten-free products. Many of our restaurant operator customers have found these specialty items to be a welcome supplement to their menus. We have also found that we have attracted some new folks, like the guy looking for the barbecue sauce he grew up enjoying in Georgia. If you are not sure where to start, may we suggest organic cookies?

Dining Room Supplies
Make your dining room perfect with our huge selection of tabletop and buffet items



        Dining room supplies have been part of the foodservicedirect product offering for over 15 years. We have cultivated great relationships with premier manufacturers such as Oneida and Libbey glassware. Our goal is to give the independent operator the largest possible selection of name brand items at amazingly competitive prices. Many food service suppliers offered dining room supplies only as an add-on, however, at foodservicedirect, we stock many thousands of these items and they have always been at the core of our offering.
