Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Quidel Corporation (NASDAQ: QDEL), a leader in point-of-care 
      rapid diagnostic tests, today announced that the board of directors 
      appointed Douglas C. Bryant as president and chief executive officer.
    


      Most recently, Mr. Bryant (age 51) served as executive vice president 
      and chief operating officer at Luminex Corporation, managing its 
      Bioscience Group, Luminex Molecular Diagnostics (Toronto), 
      manufacturing, R&D, technical operations, and commercial operations. 
      From 1983 to 2007, he held various worldwide commercial operations 
      positions with Abbott Laboratories including: vice president of Abbott 
      Vascular for Asia/Japan, vice president of Abbott Molecular Global 
      Commercial Operations and vice president of Abbott Diagnostics Global 
      Commercial Operations. Earlier in his career with Abbott, Mr. Bryant was 
      vice president of Diagnostic Operations in Europe, the Middle East and 
      Africa, and vice president of Diagnostic Operations Asia Pacific. He 
      holds a B.A. in Economics from the University of California at Davis.
    

      Announcing the appointment, Mark A. Pulido, chairman of the Quidel 
      board, said, “Doug brings a depth of experience and is a highly 
      respected leader in the worldwide diagnostics industry. Doug’s 
      leadership will enable us to accelerate the momentum built over the last 
      several years as we increase market share of our leading products as 
      well as sharpen our focus on new product and technology opportunities.”
    

      "It's an exciting time to be joining Quidel, with the company well 
      positioned for continued growth," said Bryant. "I especially look 
      forward to advancing the development and commercialization of the next 
      generation of products and technologies.”
    

      Mr. Bryant will begin employment with Quidel and join the Quidel board 
      on February 2, 2009. Caren Mason will continue in her current capacity 
      as president and chief executive officer until March 1, 2009, when Mr. 
      Bryant’s appointment as president and chief executive officer becomes 
      effective. To facilitate the transition in leadership, Ms. Mason will 
      serve as a special advisor until her planned retirement on June 1, 2009.

      intellectual property, product liability, environmental or other 
      litigation, required patent license fee payments not currently reflected

      differently. The risks described under “Risk Factors” in reports and 
      registration statements that we file with the SEC from time to time 
      should be carefully considered. You are cautioned not to place undue 
      reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management’s
