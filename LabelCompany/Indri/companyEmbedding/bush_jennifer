                                                Bush Furniture Envoy Wood Corner Desk in Natural Cherry
                                            



                                                 
                                             
                                            



                                                    I recently purchased this corner desk from Cymax and was quite surprized to find the price was more than half of what other reta
                                                    
                                                        ilers on-line were listing it for. When it arrived right on time as promised, I soon found out that it was very well packaged, and all of the parts inside the box where protected from damaged during shipment. After following the simple assembly instructions, I found it rather easy to assemble.
It was the perfect size for my personal use, and matched the rest of my office furniture. It did have some minor scratches on the under-side, but were unseen after assembled. I have only one minor thing that I did not like.  It did not have a slide out key-board tray. However for me, I was able to transfer the one from my old desk to make it fit on this one. After set up, I found that the desk was quite heavy, and weights about 100 pounds. I'am quite sure that it is sturdy enough to hold up to 200 pounds, as the instructions stayed. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a corner desk for their home office or place of business. I can now sit at my desk and enjoy the window view as well. For me, this was the right desk at a great price.

      Florida woman happily reunited with mom nearly 20 years after arrest for child abuse in high-profile Munchausen case  Florida family in Munchausen case reunited 19 years later   BY  Sasha Goldstein  NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday, April 16, 2015, 2:44 PM     facebook   Tweet   email          Jennifer Bush with her mother Kathy Bush have been reunited after a high-profile child abuse case ripped the Florida family apart in 1996. (Facebook)       BY  Sasha Goldstein  NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday, April 16, 2015, 2:44 PM    
	A Florida mom who did time behind bars for abusing her daughter in a high-profile Munchausen by proxy case is back in contact with the girl 19 years after the family was ripped apart.

	Now 27 years old, Jennifer Bush says all these years later that her mom, Kathy Bush, was not to blame for the 200 times she was hospitalized for some 40 operations, many deemed medically unnecessary, when the girl was between the ages of 2 and 8.

	“Jennifer made it very clear: She thinks her mother never abused her,” lawyer Robert Buschel told the Sun Sentinel as his client released a statement on the anniversary of her mother’s arrest.

	Jennifer was pulled from her parents and thrust into foster care on April 15, 1995, the same day mom Kathy was arrested for child abuse in a bizarre case that captivated the nation. The mom was accused of intentionally making her daughter sick in a twisted plot to gain attention and sympathy for themselves, a mental illness known as Munchausen.

	“That was the day that I was taken from my home and my family, but that day has not changed how close my family continues to be,” Jennifer Bush said in the statement. “The ten years I spent in Foster Care were traumatic, and I had some devastating things happen to me. However, I persevered because of all of the angels that were there for me during these difficult times. These people helped shaped the woman I have become today. Today, I can proudly say my family is extremely close knit. We have flourished despite the devastating separation.”

	Kathy was never diagnosed with Munchausen and her husband and two sons stood by her side as she fought the case. She’s denied to this day that she ever intentionally hurt her daughter.       Jennifer, 8, relaxes with her mother Kathy Bush at their Coral Springs, Fla., home just months before Kathy was arrested for child abuse.

Jennifer was hospitalized more than 200 times, underwent 40 operations and accumulated $3 million in medical expenses. (Alan Diaz/AP)             

	Nearly 20 years later, Jenna says “my parents and I have picked up where we left off, and have a very close and loving relationship.” 

	The Coral Springs family’s story of mounting medical bills made it to the national spotlight in 1994, when Kathy brought along Jennifer for a visit to the White House to lobby for health insurance changes.

History[edit]
In 1904, A. J. (Andrew Jackson) Bush partnered with the Stokely family to open a tomato cannery in Chestnut Hill, Tennessee.[2] His cannery proved so profitable that, by 1908, he was able to buy out the Stokelys' interest and establish his own independent business. He entered into partnership with his two oldest sons, Fred and Claude, and established Bush Brothers & Company.[3][4]
Incorporation and expansion[edit]




Bush cannery, Chestnut Hill, Tennessee


In 1922, A.J. Bush took out a $945 loan on his life insurance policy and used his bank line of credit to incorporate his business. Bush Brothers & Company was incorporated in June 1922, and Fred Bush (A.J.'s oldest son) was named president. (Fred was also a Director of the National Canners Association, the primary industry trade group for canning companies.)[5]
The company's canning operations originally began with laborious, manual processes, then expanding with steam powered engines, and eventually evolving on into electric powered factory machinery.[6]
During the 1920s, Bush Brothers & Company began expanding its operations to include products other than tomatoes. The company constructed a small canning factory in Clinton, Tennessee in 1923, and began canning both tomatoes and peaches in 1924.[7] The year 1928 saw the company's expansion into corn and hominy, as well as the lease of the Smith Brothers & Company's Oak Grove corn processing plant just outside Dandridge, Tennessee.[8] And in 1930, Bush Brothers opened a new plant in LaFollette, Tennessee, where it processed blueberries in addition to tomatoes.[9]
As the company continued to grow, the original cannery in Chestnut Hill became insufficient to meet its needs. Bush Brothers constructed a new building nearby in 1929, which would become the company's main canning facilities for many years.[10]
In 1933, Bush Brothers began offering pork and beans, canned under its Chestnut Hill label. The success of their product led to a contract with Armour and Company and to a wide array of canned meats. The company also started up a canning line for Tony Dog and Cat Food, which it would continue to sell until the 1980s.[11]
By 1935, Bush Brothers were seeing significant expansion and were highlighted in newspaper articles for canning ten million cans of vegetables a year, operating two-thousand acres of company owned farmland, and contracting with five-hundred farmers to supply vegetables.[12]
Properties lost to Tennessee Valley Authority[edit]
In 1942, the Tennessee Valley Authority announced the closing of the Douglas Dam floodgates within the year.[13] The end result would be the flooding of the French Broad River bottom, where Bush Brothers had a number of farms. After several months of negotiation, Bush Brothers & Company agreed to sell seven prime tracts of their farmland to the TVA, as well as the Oak Grove Canning Plant.[14]
In October 1944, Bush Brothers attempted to offset some of their farmland loss by purchasing the Blytheville Canning Company in Arkansas.[1] However, the plant was in bad shape and struggled during its first four years of Bush ownership. Claude Bush moved to Arkansas in 1948 to oversee the facilities and eventually managed to turn it into a profitable business.[15]
Expansion and change[edit]
Following A.J. Bush's death in 1946, Bush Brothers & Company made the move from private label to branded presence. They began offering their goods under the newly developed Bush's Best logo and label. With the advents of supermarkets and television advertising, the 1950s proved very profitable for the company. During this time, they continue to offer a variety of canned vegetables, particularly green beans.[16] They also began offering the dry bean products for which they would eventually become known. In 1952, the company introduced their Great Northern Beans with Plain Sauce. This was followed in 1953 by Mexican Style Beans in Chili Gravy.[17]
Claude Bush became president of the company in 1959, following the death of his older brother Fred. Bush Brothers & Company had amassed a substantial amount of cash and accounts receivable under Fred, and Claude felt the money would best be put to use expanding the company's business into new areas.[18] The 1960s saw the purchase of several canning plants, including Shiocton Kraut Company (Shiocton, Wisconsin), Hyde Park Canning Company (Muskogee, Oklahoma), an unused canning plant in Augusta, Wisconsin, and Valley Canning Sweet Potato plants in Ville Platte and Cecilia, Louisiana.[19] Bush Brothers & Company also created its own truck line, Tennessee Truck Lines, in 1962.[20]
In 1965, Claude became Chairman of the Board, and brother-in-law C.J. Ethier succeeded him as President.[21]
Bush's Best Baked Beans[edit]
The year 1969 proved to be a tough one for the canning industry due to overproduction and low prices. As the family stockholders considered their options and discussed strategies for riding out the tough times ahead, Claude's son Condon Bush hit on the idea of offering a new product that would appeal to a wide audience as well as keep his Augusta plant busy during the off season. Inspired by the company's earlier success with pork and beans, Condon decided to develop a baked bean product based on his mother Kathleen's secret recipe.
The experiment proved far more successful than the Bush family had ever imagined. Sales of Bush's Best Baked Beans went from ten thousand cases in 1969 to a hundred thousand in 1970, eventually hitting close to a million cases in 1971.[22] Baked beans became a very popular dish during the United States Bicentennial, and so Bush Brothers decided to devote all of their resources to Bush's Best Baked Beans sales. Their campaign was a success, with sales increasing by 173% in 1976, and an additional 34% in 1977.[23]
In 1978, Claude stepped down as Chairman of the Board, and C.J. Ethier replaced him. Condon was elected as the new President of Bush Brothers & Company.[24]
Acquisition of Dubon[edit]
In 1979, Bush Brothers acquired the Dubon brand of canned foods when that company was sold, following bankruptcy. Canned vegetables, such as carrots, peas, and beets are sold primarily in the Louisiana and New Orleans areas as a regional brand.[25]
Throughout the 1980s, Bush Brothers continued to make its transition to a branded producer of table-ready products. However, the shift was slow and fraught with tension as the family had trouble agreeing on the best course of action. After the death of C.J. Ethier in 1989 and Claude Bush in 1990, Jim Ethier (C.J.'s son) convinced Condon (President and CEO) and Allen Bush (Vice President of Sales) to consult with Dr. Leon Danco of the Center for Family Business. Under Dr. Danco's guidance, Bush Brothers & Company reorganized its Board of Directors to include members from outside the family and the company.[26] The restructured Board included Jay Carr (The Hershey Company), Bob Johnston (Gerber Products Company), Bill Trubeck (White & Case), and Clay Mathile (The Iams Company).[27]
With the new Board in place, the company turned to the task of hiring professional sales managers. Office space in Chestnut Hill was filled to capacity, and the prospect of recruiting young, urban managers to such a rural location seemed unlikely. In 1991, Bush Brothers & Company moved its company headquarters to Knoxville, Tennessee.[28]
In 1992, Jim Ethier was elected President and COO of Bush Brothers & Company. Condon Bush moved to the position of CEO and Chairman of the Board.[29]
The restructured and reorganized company developed an overarching strategy in 1993. According to Jim Ethier:

The first strategic plan defined the process that would enable us to get out of products where we were losing money, as well as away from business processes that no longer made sense. It was a defining step in the "re-architecting" of the company.[30]

Among other things, this plan involved consolidating the company's subsidiaries into a single entity and team, narrowing the company's focus to its most successful products, and placing a new emphasis on customers satisfaction through a Primary Excellence Goal (PEG) organization.[31]
Jay Bush (and Duke)[edit]
In 1993, Bush Brothers & Company hired a small advertising company in Atlanta, Georgia called Cole, Henderson, Drake (CHD) to develop a new advertising campaign for their line of baked beans. The new ad focused on the "secret family recipe", and introduced Jay Bush (Condon's son) as the company's spokesperson. The ad performed well in test markets in 1993, and was released nationally in May 1994.[32][33]
In the summer 1995, a new ad paired Jay up with a mischievous, talking golden retriever named Duke. The campaign was created by CHD copywriter David Garzotto and was a huge hit for Bush Brothers, who saw a dramatic spike in baked bean sales.[34] The popularity of the company's baked beans can be directly attributed to the success of the Jay Bush and Duke commercials; as well as its catchphrase "Roll that beautiful bean footage!" to market their products, which are made according to the secret family recipe with specially cured bacon, brown sugar, and a secret blend of spices. All the while, Jay is able to keep Duke from selling the secret family recipe, another running gag in the ads. As a result of the ad campaign, the duo became celebrities,[35] and sales of the company's beans increased from a 48% national market share to 80%.[1] The popularity of the commercial inspired the company to publish a children's book, Duke Finds a Home, published in 2006.[36]
In 2012, comedian Julie Klausner tweeted a suggestion that Bush Brothers offer a poetry contest, allowing the winner to pet Duke, who she had seen in a television commercial. The request was reiterated by numerous individuals on various social media sites and inspired an informal online petition to the company.[37]
Recent years[edit]




Bush Visitor Center, Chestnut Hill, Tennessee


The new Bush Visitor Center is an expansion from founder A.J. Bush's original General Store in Chestnut Hill, TN, and includes a museum, retail shop and Cafe. It also houses the guarded display of the "Bush's Secret Family Recipe" book.[38]
Bush's Racing sponsor the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series #47 Toyota Camry of JTG Daugherty Racing team, formerly driven by Bobby Labonte,[39] and now driven by A. J. Allmendinger.[40]
Bush Brothers and Company also sponsors the annual Bean and Bacon Days festival in Augusta, Wisconsin, where the company acquired the old Augusta canning factory in 1961.
On Oprah, in 2009, Kristian Bush, great-grandson of A.J. Bush and half of the band, Sugarland, mentioned that he no longer liked beans because he grew up on them.[41]
On July 23 of 2015, Bill Foster took to the company's Facebook page to declare: "I;m [sic] thinking about thos [sic] beans." This post had a screenshot taken of the exchange and quickly became a meme on Reddit. As of late October there are over 800 signatures on a Change.org petition for Bush's to give Foster a lifetime supply of 'thos beans.'

History[edit]
In 1904, A. J. (Andrew Jackson) Bush partnered with the Stokely family to open a tomato cannery in Chestnut Hill, Tennessee.[2] His cannery proved so profitable that, by 1908, he was able to buy out the Stokelys' interest and establish his own independent business. He entered into partnership with his two oldest sons, Fred and Claude, and established Bush Brothers & Company.[3][4]
Incorporation and expansion[edit]




Bush cannery, Chestnut Hill, Tennessee


In 1922, A.J. Bush took out a $945 loan on his life insurance policy and used his bank line of credit to incorporate his business. Bush Brothers & Company was incorporated in June 1922, and Fred Bush (A.J.'s oldest son) was named president. (Fred was also a Director of the National Canners Association, the primary industry trade group for canning companies.)[5]
The company's canning operations originally began with laborious, manual processes, then expanding with steam powered engines, and eventually evolving on into electric powered factory machinery.[6]
During the 1920s, Bush Brothers & Company began expanding its operations to include products other than tomatoes. The company constructed a small canning factory in Clinton, Tennessee in 1923, and began canning both tomatoes and peaches in 1924.[7] The year 1928 saw the company's expansion into corn and hominy, as well as the lease of the Smith Brothers & Company's Oak Grove corn processing plant just outside Dandridge, Tennessee.[8] And in 1930, Bush Brothers opened a new plant in LaFollette, Tennessee, where it processed blueberries in addition to tomatoes.[9]
As the company continued to grow, the original cannery in Chestnut Hill became insufficient to meet its needs. Bush Brothers constructed a new building nearby in 1929, which would become the company's main canning facilities for many years.[10]
In 1933, Bush Brothers began offering pork and beans, canned under its Chestnut Hill label. The success of their product led to a contract with Armour and Company and to a wide array of canned meats. The company also started up a canning line for Tony Dog and Cat Food, which it would continue to sell until the 1980s.[11]
By 1935, Bush Brothers were seeing significant expansion and were highlighted in newspaper articles for canning ten million cans of vegetables a year, operating two-thousand acres of company owned farmland, and contracting with five-hundred farmers to supply vegetables.[12]
Properties lost to Tennessee Valley Authority[edit]
In 1942, the Tennessee Valley Authority announced the closing of the Douglas Dam floodgates within the year.[13] The end result would be the flooding of the French Broad River bottom, where Bush Brothers had a number of farms. After several months of negotiation, Bush Brothers & Company agreed to sell seven prime tracts of their farmland to the TVA, as well as the Oak Grove Canning Plant.[14]
In October 1944, Bush Brothers attempted to offset some of their farmland loss by purchasing the Blytheville Canning Company in Arkansas.[1] However, the plant was in bad shape and struggled during its first four years of Bush ownership. Claude Bush moved to Arkansas in 1948 to oversee the facilities and eventually managed to turn it into a profitable business.[15]
Expansion and change[edit]
Following A.J. Bush's death in 1946, Bush Brothers & Company made the move from private label to branded presence. They began offering their goods under the newly developed Bush's Best logo and label. With the advents of supermarkets and television advertising, the 1950s proved very profitable for the company. During this time, they continue to offer a variety of canned vegetables, particularly green beans.[16] They also began offering the dry bean products for which they would eventually become known. In 1952, the company introduced their Great Northern Beans with Plain Sauce. This was followed in 1953 by Mexican Style Beans in Chili Gravy.[17]
Claude Bush became president of the company in 1959, following the death of his older brother Fred. Bush Brothers & Company had amassed a substantial amount of cash and accounts receivable under Fred, and Claude felt the money would best be put to use expanding the company's business into new areas.[18] The 1960s saw the purchase of several canning plants, including Shiocton Kraut Company (Shiocton, Wisconsin), Hyde Park Canning Company (Muskogee, Oklahoma), an unused canning plant in Augusta, Wisconsin, and Valley Canning Sweet Potato plants in Ville Platte and Cecilia, Louisiana.[19] Bush Brothers & Company also created its own truck line, Tennessee Truck Lines, in 1962.[20]
In 1965, Claude became Chairman of the Board, and brother-in-law C.J. Ethier succeeded him as President.[21]
Bush's Best Baked Beans[edit]
The year 1969 proved to be a tough one for the canning industry due to overproduction and low prices. As the family stockholders considered their options and discussed strategies for riding out the tough times ahead, Claude's son Condon Bush hit on the idea of offering a new product that would appeal to a wide audience as well as keep his Augusta plant busy during the off season. Inspired by the company's earlier success with pork and beans, Condon decided to develop a baked bean product based on his mother Kathleen's secret recipe.
The experiment proved far more successful than the Bush family had ever imagined. Sales of Bush's Best Baked Beans went from ten thousand cases in 1969 to a hundred thousand in 1970, eventually hitting close to a million cases in 1971.[22] Baked beans became a very popular dish during the United States Bicentennial, and so Bush Brothers decided to devote all of their resources to Bush's Best Baked Beans sales. Their campaign was a success, with sales increasing by 173% in 1976, and an additional 34% in 1977.[23]
In 1978, Claude stepped down as Chairman of the Board, and C.J. Ethier replaced him. Condon was elected as the new President of Bush Brothers & Company.[24]
Acquisition of Dubon[edit]
In 1979, Bush Brothers acquired the Dubon brand of canned foods when that company was sold, following bankruptcy. Canned vegetables, such as carrots, peas, and beets are sold primarily in the Louisiana and New Orleans areas as a regional brand.[25]
Throughout the 1980s, Bush Brothers continued to make its transition to a branded producer of table-ready products. However, the shift was slow and fraught with tension as the family had trouble agreeing on the best course of action. After the death of C.J. Ethier in 1989 and Claude Bush in 1990, Jim Ethier (C.J.'s son) convinced Condon (President and CEO) and Allen Bush (Vice President of Sales) to consult with Dr. Leon Danco of the Center for Family Business. Under Dr. Danco's guidance, Bush Brothers & Company reorganized its Board of Directors to include members from outside the family and the company.[26] The restructured Board included Jay Carr (The Hershey Company), Bob Johnston (Gerber Products Company), Bill Trubeck (White & Case), and Clay Mathile (The Iams Company).[27]
With the new Board in place, the company turned to the task of hiring professional sales managers. Office space in Chestnut Hill was filled to capacity, and the prospect of recruiting young, urban managers to such a rural location seemed unlikely. In 1991, Bush Brothers & Company moved its company headquarters to Knoxville, Tennessee.[28]
In 1992, Jim Ethier was elected President and COO of Bush Brothers & Company. Condon Bush moved to the position of CEO and Chairman of the Board.[29]
The restructured and reorganized company developed an overarching strategy in 1993. According to Jim Ethier:

The first strategic plan defined the process that would enable us to get out of products where we were losing money, as well as away from business processes that no longer made sense. It was a defining step in the "re-architecting" of the company.[30]

Among other things, this plan involved consolidating the company's subsidiaries into a single entity and team, narrowing the company's focus to its most successful products, and placing a new emphasis on customers satisfaction through a Primary Excellence Goal (PEG) organization.[31]

In 1993, Bush Brothers & Company hired a small advertising company in Atlanta, Georgia called Cole, Henderson, Drake (CHD) to develop a new advertising campaign for their line of baked beans. The new ad focused on the "secret family recipe", and introduced Jay Bush (Condon's son) as the company's spokesperson. The ad performed well in test markets in 1993, and was released nationally in May 1994.[32][33]
In the summer 1995, a new ad paired Jay up with a mischievous, talking golden retriever named Duke. The campaign was created by CHD copywriter David Garzotto and was a huge hit for Bush Brothers, who saw a dramatic spike in baked bean sales.[34] The popularity of the company's baked beans can be directly attributed to the success of the Jay Bush and Duke commercials; as well as its catchphrase "Roll that beautiful bean footage!" to market their products, which are made according to the secret family recipe with specially cured bacon, brown sugar, and a secret blend of spices. All the while, Jay is able to keep Duke from selling the secret family recipe, another running gag in the ads. As a result of the ad campaign, the duo became celebrities,[35] and sales of the company's beans increased from a 48% national market share to 80%.[1] The popularity of the commercial inspired the company to publish a children's book, Duke Finds a Home, published in 2006.[36]
In 2012, comedian Julie Klausner tweeted a suggestion that Bush Brothers offer a poetry contest, allowing the winner to pet Duke, who she had seen in a television commercial. The request was reiterated by numerous individuals on various social media sites and inspired an informal online petition to the company.[37]
Recent years[edit]




Bush Visitor Center, Chestnut Hill, Tennessee


The new Bush Visitor Center is an expansion from founder A.J. Bush's original General Store in Chestnut Hill, TN, and includes a museum, retail shop and Cafe. It also houses the guarded display of the "Bush's Secret Family Recipe" book.[38]
Bush's Racing sponsor the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series #47 Toyota Camry of JTG Daugherty Racing team, formerly driven by Bobby Labonte,[39] and now driven by A. J. Allmendinger.[40]
Bush Brothers and Company also sponsors the annual Bean and Bacon Days festival in Augusta, Wisconsin, where the company acquired the old Augusta canning factory in 1961.
On Oprah, in 2009, Kristian Bush, great-grandson of A.J. Bush and half of the band, Sugarland, mentioned that he no longer liked beans because he grew up on them.[41]
On July 23 of 2015, Bill Foster took to the company's Facebook page to declare: "I;m [sic] thinking about thos [sic] beans." This post had a screenshot taken of the exchange and quickly became a meme on Reddit. As of late October there are over 800 signatures on a Change.org petition for Bush's to give Foster a lifetime supply of 'thos beans.'

History[edit]
In 1904, A. J. (Andrew Jackson) Bush partnered with the Stokely family to open a tomato cannery in Chestnut Hill, Tennessee.[2] His cannery proved so profitable that, by 1908, he was able to buy out the Stokelys' interest and establish his own independent business. He entered into partnership with his two oldest sons, Fred and Claude, and established Bush Brothers & Company.[3][4]
Incorporation and expansion[edit]




Bush cannery, Chestnut Hill, Tennessee


In 1922, A.J. Bush took out a $945 loan on his life insurance policy and used his bank line of credit to incorporate his business. Bush Brothers & Company was incorporated in June 1922, and Fred Bush (A.J.'s oldest son) was named president. (Fred was also a Director of the National Canners Association, the primary industry trade group for canning companies.)[5]
The company's canning operations originally began with laborious, manual processes, then expanding with steam powered engines, and eventually evolving on into electric powered factory machinery.[6]
During the 1920s, Bush Brothers & Company began expanding its operations to include products other than tomatoes. The company constructed a small canning factory in Clinton, Tennessee in 1923, and began canning both tomatoes and peaches in 1924.[7] The year 1928 saw the company's expansion into corn and hominy, as well as the lease of the Smith Brothers & Company's Oak Grove corn processing plant just outside Dandridge, Tennessee.[8] And in 1930, Bush Brothers opened a new plant in LaFollette, Tennessee, where it processed blueberries in addition to tomatoes.[9]
As the company continued to grow, the original cannery in Chestnut Hill became insufficient to meet its needs. Bush Brothers constructed a new building nearby in 1929, which would become the company's main canning facilities for many years.[10]
In 1933, Bush Brothers began offering pork and beans, canned under its Chestnut Hill label. The success of their product led to a contract with Armour and Company and to a wide array of canned meats. The company also started up a canning line for Tony Dog and Cat Food, which it would continue to sell until the 1980s.[11]
By 1935, Bush Brothers were seeing significant expansion and were highlighted in newspaper articles for canning ten million cans of vegetables a year, operating two-thousand acres of company owned farmland, and contracting with five-hundred farmers to supply vegetables.[12]
Properties lost to Tennessee Valley Authority[edit]
In 1942, the Tennessee Valley Authority announced the closing of the Douglas Dam floodgates within the year.[13] The end result would be the flooding of the French Broad River bottom, where Bush Brothers had a number of farms. After several months of negotiation, Bush Brothers & Company agreed to sell seven prime tracts of their farmland to the TVA, as well as the Oak Grove Canning Plant.[14]
In October 1944, Bush Brothers attempted to offset some of their farmland loss by purchasing the Blytheville Canning Company in Arkansas.[1] However, the plant was in bad shape and struggled during its first four years of Bush ownership. Claude Bush moved to Arkansas in 1948 to oversee the facilities and eventually managed to turn it into a profitable business.[15]
Expansion and change[edit]
Following A.J. Bush's death in 1946, Bush Brothers & Company made the move from private label to branded presence. They began offering their goods under the newly developed Bush's Best logo and label. With the advents of supermarkets and television advertising, the 1950s proved very profitable for the company. During this time, they continue to offer a variety of canned vegetables, particularly green beans.[16] They also began offering the dry bean products for which they would eventually become known. In 1952, the company introduced their Great Northern Beans with Plain Sauce. This was followed in 1953 by Mexican Style Beans in Chili Gravy.[17]
Claude Bush became president of the company in 1959, following the death of his older brother Fred. Bush Brothers & Company had amassed a substantial amount of cash and accounts receivable under Fred, and Claude felt the money would best be put to use expanding the company's business into new areas.[18] The 1960s saw the purchase of several canning plants, including Shiocton Kraut Company (Shiocton, Wisconsin), Hyde Park Canning Company (Muskogee, Oklahoma), an unused canning plant in Augusta, Wisconsin, and Valley Canning Sweet Potato plants in Ville Platte and Cecilia, Louisiana.[19] Bush Brothers & Company also created its own truck line, Tennessee Truck Lines, in 1962.[20]
In 1965, Claude became Chairman of the Board, and brother-in-law C.J. Ethier succeeded him as President.[21]
Bush's Best Baked Beans[edit]
The year 1969 proved to be a tough one for the canning industry due to overproduction and low prices. As the family stockholders considered their options and discussed strategies for riding out the tough times ahead, Claude's son Condon Bush hit on the idea of offering a new product that would appeal to a wide audience as well as keep his Augusta plant busy during the off season. Inspired by the company's earlier success with pork and beans, Condon decided to develop a baked bean product based on his mother Kathleen's secret recipe.
The experiment proved far more successful than the Bush family had ever imagined. Sales of Bush's Best Baked Beans went from ten thousand cases in 1969 to a hundred thousand in 1970, eventually hitting close to a million cases in 1971.[22] Baked beans became a very popular dish during the United States Bicentennial, and so Bush Brothers decided to devote all of their resources to Bush's Best Baked Beans sales. Their campaign was a success, with sales increasing by 173% in 1976, and an additional 34% in 1977.[23]
In 1978, Claude stepped down as Chairman of the Board, and C.J. Ethier replaced him. Condon was elected as the new President of Bush Brothers & Company.[24]
Acquisition of Dubon[edit]
In 1979, Bush Brothers acquired the Dubon brand of canned foods when that company was sold, following bankruptcy. Canned vegetables, such as carrots, peas, and beets are sold primarily in the Louisiana and New Orleans areas as a regional brand.[25]
Throughout the 1980s, Bush Brothers continued to make its transition to a branded producer of table-ready products. However, the shift was slow and fraught with tension as the family had trouble agreeing on the best course of action. After the death of C.J. Ethier in 1989 and Claude Bush in 1990, Jim Ethier (C.J.'s son) convinced Condon (President and CEO) and Allen Bush (Vice President of Sales) to consult with Dr. Leon Danco of the Center for Family Business. Under Dr. Danco's guidance, Bush Brothers & Company reorganized its Board of Directors to include members from outside the family and the company.[26] The restructured Board included Jay Carr (The Hershey Company), Bob Johnston (Gerber Products Company), Bill Trubeck (White & Case), and Clay Mathile (The Iams Company).[27]
With the new Board in place, the company turned to the task of hiring professional sales managers. Office space in Chestnut Hill was filled to capacity, and the prospect of recruiting young, urban managers to such a rural location seemed unlikely. In 1991, Bush Brothers & Company moved its company headquarters to Knoxville, Tennessee.[28]
In 1992, Jim Ethier was elected President and COO of Bush Brothers & Company. Condon Bush moved to the position of CEO and Chairman of the Board.[29]
The restructured and reorganized company developed an overarching strategy in 1993. According to Jim Ethier:

The first strategic plan defined the process that would enable us to get out of products where we were losing money, as well as away from business processes that no longer made sense. It was a defining step in the "re-architecting" of the company.[30]

Among other things, this plan involved consolidating the company's subsidiaries into a single entity and team, narrowing the company's focus to its most successful products, and placing a new emphasis on customers satisfaction through a Primary Excellence Goal (PEG) organization.[31]
Jay Bush (and Duke)[edit]
In 1993, Bush Brothers & Company hired a small advertising company in Atlanta, Georgia called Cole, Henderson, Drake (CHD) to develop a new advertising campaign for their line of baked beans. The new ad focused on the "secret family recipe", and introduced Jay Bush (Condon's son) as the company's spokesperson. The ad performed well in test markets in 1993, and was released nationally in May 1994.[32][33]
In the summer 1995, a new ad paired Jay up with a mischievous, talking golden retriever named Duke. The campaign was created by CHD copywriter David Garzotto and was a huge hit for Bush Brothers, who saw a dramatic spike in baked bean sales.[34] The popularity of the company's baked beans can be directly attributed to the success of the Jay Bush and Duke commercials; as well as its catchphrase "Roll that beautiful bean footage!" to market their products, which are made according to the secret family recipe with specially cured bacon, brown sugar, and a secret blend of spices. All the while, Jay is able to keep Duke from selling the secret family recipe, another running gag in the ads. As a result of the ad campaign, the duo became celebrities,[35] and sales of the company's beans increased from a 48% national market share to 80%.[1] The popularity of the commercial inspired the company to publish a children's book, Duke Finds a Home, published in 2006.[36]
In 2012, comedian Julie Klausner tweeted a suggestion that Bush Brothers offer a poetry contest, allowing the winner to pet Duke, who she had seen in a television commercial. The request was reiterated by numerous individuals on various social media sites and inspired an informal online petition to the company.[37]

History[edit]
In 1904, A. J. (Andrew Jackson) Bush partnered with the Stokely family to open a tomato cannery in Chestnut Hill, Tennessee.[2] His cannery proved so profitable that, by 1908, he was able to buy out the Stokelys' interest and establish his own independent business. He entered into partnership with his two oldest sons, Fred and Claude, and established Bush Brothers & Company.[3][4]
Incorporation and expansion[edit]




Bush cannery, Chestnut Hill, Tennessee


In 1922, A.J. Bush took out a $945 loan on his life insurance policy and used his bank line of credit to incorporate his business. Bush Brothers & Company was incorporated in June 1922, and Fred Bush (A.J.'s oldest son) was named president. (Fred was also a Director of the National Canners Association, the primary industry trade group for canning companies.)[5]
The company's canning operations originally began with laborious, manual processes, then expanding with steam powered engines, and eventually evolving on into electric powered factory machinery.[6]
During the 1920s, Bush Brothers & Company began expanding its operations to include products other than tomatoes. The company constructed a small canning factory in Clinton, Tennessee in 1923, and began canning both tomatoes and peaches in 1924.[7] The year 1928 saw the company's expansion into corn and hominy, as well as the lease of the Smith Brothers & Company's Oak Grove corn processing plant just outside Dandridge, Tennessee.[8] And in 1930, Bush Brothers opened a new plant in LaFollette, Tennessee, where it processed blueberries in addition to tomatoes.[9]
As the company continued to grow, the original cannery in Chestnut Hill became insufficient to meet its needs. Bush Brothers constructed a new building nearby in 1929, which would become the company's main canning facilities for many years.[10]
In 1933, Bush Brothers began offering pork and beans, canned under its Chestnut Hill label. The success of their product led to a contract with Armour and Company and to a wide array of canned meats. The company also started up a canning line for Tony Dog and Cat Food, which it would continue to sell until the 1980s.[11]
By 1935, Bush Brothers were seeing significant expansion and were highlighted in newspaper articles for canning ten million cans of vegetables a year, operating two-thousand acres of company owned farmland, and contracting with five-hundred farmers to supply vegetables.[12]
Properties lost to Tennessee Valley Authority[edit]
In 1942, the Tennessee Valley Authority announced the closing of the Douglas Dam floodgates within the year.[13] The end result would be the flooding of the French Broad River bottom, where Bush Brothers had a number of farms. After several months of negotiation, Bush Brothers & Company agreed to sell seven prime tracts of their farmland to the TVA, as well as the Oak Grove Canning Plant.[14]
In October 1944, Bush Brothers attempted to offset some of their farmland loss by purchasing the Blytheville Canning Company in Arkansas.[1] However, the plant was in bad shape and struggled during its first four years of Bush ownership. Claude Bush moved to Arkansas in 1948 to oversee the facilities and eventually managed to turn it into a profitable business.[15]
Expansion and change[edit]
Following A.J. Bush's death in 1946, Bush Brothers & Company made the move from private label to branded presence. They began offering their goods under the newly developed Bush's Best logo and label. With the advents of supermarkets and television advertising, the 1950s proved very profitable for the company. During this time, they continue to offer a variety of canned vegetables, particularly green beans.[16] They also began offering the dry bean products for which they would eventually become known. In 1952, the company introduced their Great Northern Beans with Plain Sauce. This was followed in 1953 by Mexican Style Beans in Chili Gravy.[17]
Claude Bush became president of the company in 1959, following the death of his older brother Fred. Bush Brothers & Company had amassed a substantial amount of cash and accounts receivable under Fred, and Claude felt the money would best be put to use expanding the company's business into new areas.[18] The 1960s saw the purchase of several canning plants, including Shiocton Kraut Company (Shiocton, Wisconsin), Hyde Park Canning Company (Muskogee, Oklahoma), an unused canning plant in Augusta, Wisconsin, and Valley Canning Sweet Potato plants in Ville Platte and Cecilia, Louisiana.[19] Bush Brothers & Company also created its own truck line, Tennessee Truck Lines, in 1962.[20]
In 1965, Claude became Chairman of the Board, and brother-in-law C.J. Ethier succeeded him as President.[21]
Bush's Best Baked Beans[edit]
The year 1969 proved to be a tough one for the canning industry due to overproduction and low prices. As the family stockholders considered their options and discussed strategies for riding out the tough times ahead, Claude's son Condon Bush hit on the idea of offering a new product that would appeal to a wide audience as well as keep his Augusta plant busy during the off season. Inspired by the company's earlier success with pork and beans, Condon decided to develop a baked bean product based on his mother Kathleen's secret recipe.
The experiment proved far more successful than the Bush family had ever imagined. Sales of Bush's Best Baked Beans went from ten thousand cases in 1969 to a hundred thousand in 1970, eventually hitting close to a million cases in 1971.[22] Baked beans became a very popular dish during the United States Bicentennial, and so Bush Brothers decided to devote all of their resources to Bush's Best Baked Beans sales. Their campaign was a success, with sales increasing by 173% in 1976, and an additional 34% in 1977.[23]
In 1978, Claude stepped down as Chairman of the Board, and C.J. Ethier replaced him. Condon was elected as the new President of Bush Brothers & Company.[24]
Acquisition of Dubon[edit]
In 1979, Bush Brothers acquired the Dubon brand of canned foods when that company was sold, following bankruptcy. Canned vegetables, such as carrots, peas, and beets are sold primarily in the Louisiana and New Orleans areas as a regional brand.[25]
Throughout the 1980s, Bush Brothers continued to make its transition to a branded producer of table-ready products. However, the shift was slow and fraught with tension as the family had trouble agreeing on the best course of action. After the death of C.J. Ethier in 1989 and Claude Bush in 1990, Jim Ethier (C.J.'s son) convinced Condon (President and CEO) and Allen Bush (Vice President of Sales) to consult with Dr. Leon Danco of the Center for Family Business. Under Dr. Danco's guidance, Bush Brothers & Company reorganized its Board of Directors to include members from outside the family and the company.[26] The restructured Board included Jay Carr (The Hershey Company), Bob Johnston (Gerber Products Company), Bill Trubeck (White & Case), and Clay Mathile (The Iams Company).[27]
With the new Board in place, the company turned to the task of hiring professional sales managers. Office space in Chestnut Hill was filled to capacity, and the prospect of recruiting young, urban managers to such a rural location seemed unlikely. In 1991, Bush Brothers & Company moved its company headquarters to Knoxville, Tennessee.[28]
In 1992, Jim Ethier was elected President and COO of Bush Brothers & Company. Condon Bush moved to the position of CEO and Chairman of the Board.[29]
The restructured and reorganized company developed an overarching strategy in 1993. According to Jim Ethier:

The first strategic plan defined the process that would enable us to get out of products where we were losing money, as well as away from business processes that no longer made sense. It was a defining step in the "re-architecting" of the company.[30]

Among other things, this plan involved consolidating the company's subsidiaries into a single entity and team, narrowing the company's focus to its most successful products, and placing a new emphasis on customers satisfaction through a Primary Excellence Goal (PEG) organization.[31]
Jay Bush (and Duke)[edit]
In 1993, Bush Brothers & Company hired a small advertising company in Atlanta, Georgia called Cole, Henderson, Drake (CHD) to develop a new advertising campaign for their line of baked beans. The new ad focused on the "secret family recipe", and introduced Jay Bush (Condon's son) as the company's spokesperson. The ad performed well in test markets in 1993, and was released nationally in May 1994.[32][33]
In the summer 1995, a new ad paired Jay up with a mischievous, talking golden retriever named Duke. The campaign was created by CHD copywriter David Garzotto and was a huge hit for Bush Brothers, who saw a dramatic spike in baked bean sales.[34] The popularity of the company's baked beans can be directly attributed to the success of the Jay Bush and Duke commercials; as well as its catchphrase "Roll that beautiful bean footage!" to market their products, which are made according to the secret family recipe with specially cured bacon, brown sugar, and a secret blend of spices. All the while, Jay is able to keep Duke from selling the secret family recipe, another running gag in the ads. As a result of the ad campaign, the duo became celebrities,[35] and sales of the company's beans increased from a 48% national market share to 80%.[1] The popularity of the commercial inspired the company to publish a children's book, Duke Finds a Home, published in 2006.[36]
In 2012, comedian Julie Klausner tweeted a suggestion that Bush Brothers offer a poetry contest, allowing the winner to pet Duke, who she had seen in a television commercial. The request was reiterated by numerous individuals on various social media sites and inspired an informal online petition to the company.[37]
Recent years[edit]




Bush Visitor Center, Chestnut Hill, Tennessee


The new Bush Visitor Center is an expansion from founder A.J. Bush's original General Store in Chestnut Hill, TN, and includes a museum, retail shop and Cafe. It also houses the guarded display of the "Bush's Secret Family Recipe" book.[38]
Bush's Racing sponsor the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series #47 Toyota Camry of JTG Daugherty Racing team, formerly driven by Bobby Labonte,[39] and now driven by A. J. Allmendinger.[40]
Bush Brothers and Company also sponsors the annual Bean and Bacon Days festival in Augusta, Wisconsin, where the company acquired the old Augusta canning factory in 1961.
On Oprah, in 2009, Kristian Bush, great-grandson of A.J. Bush and half of the band, Sugarland, mentioned that he no longer liked beans because he grew up on them.[41]
On July 23 of 2015, Bill Foster took to the company's Facebook page to declare: "I;m [sic] thinking about thos [sic] beans." This post had a screenshot taken of the exchange and quickly became a meme on Reddit. As of late October there are over 800 signatures on a Change.org petition for Bush's to give Foster a lifetime supply of 'thos beans.'

ArchiveGeorge Bush Confronts a RumorBy Paula ChinPosted on August 24, 1992 at 12:00pm EDT 
ShareTweetEmail 





 



WHEN THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION opens for business this week in Houston, the program promises a climactic, made-for-TV moment as Barbara Bush addresses the GOP faithful in prime time. Her subject is scheduled to be that totem of the Republican campaign—family values—delivered as she is surrounded on the dais by her brood of five children and 12 grandchildren.
Now, on the eve of this carefully choreographed event, the long la-boo question of an alleged First Mistress has reared its ugly head. A front-page story in the sensationalist tabloid the New York Post reported that a new book quotes former U.S. Ambassador Louis Fields as saying that he arranged for then Vice President George Bush and his former appointments secretary Jennifer Fitzgerald to share a private cottage during an official visit to Geneva in 1984. “It became clear [they] were romantically involved,” said Fields, according to The Power House, a book about influence peddling in the capital written by former congressional aide Susan B. Trento. The ambassador, who retired in 1985 and died of cancer in 1988, was said to have told at least three people that the rendezvous took place when Barbara Bush was out promoting her book about C. Fred, the family dog. Fields said the rendezvous, which had the couple “staying in adjoining bedrooms,” was “so heavy-handed” that it made him “very uncomfortable.”
Trento says that Fields, a U.S. Ambassador to the Geneva nuclear-disarmament talks, revealed details of the alleged Bush-Fitzgerald rendezvous to her husband, former CNN investigative reporter Joseph Trento, in 1986. Joseph Trento said he never reported the story because Fields was fearful of jeopardizing his career and refused to go on record.
When The story broke last week. Fitzgerald, now 59 and deputy chief of protocol in the State Department, was said to be out of the country on business and unreachable for comment. Not so President Bush, who responded sharply when a CNN reporter broached the topic at a news conference in Kennebunkport. “”I’m not going to take any sleazy questions like that,” Bush bristled. “I’m not going to respond other than to say it’s a lie.” Fitzgerald’s mother, 86-year-old Frances Patteson-Knight of McLean, Va., also denied the reports, which she says have “devastated Jennifer. “She had a very unhappy marriage, and she can’t stand men,” says Patteson-Knighl, who recalls her daughter once telling her, “I’ve been through so much. I couldn’t have sex with anybody.”
The public facts of Fitzgerald’s life are sketchy. Her mother, who came from a prominent Boston family, married Brig. Douglas Henry Patteson-Knight, an English military officer. Their British-born daughter attended private schools in Virginia and later Mount Vernon College. In 1955 she married U.S. Army Pvt. Gerald FitzGerald, but they separated the following year and divorced in 1959. (She subsequently dropped the capitalization of the g in her name Fitzgerald.) She later worked for Bush’s close friend and political mentor, former Federal Communications Commission Chairman Dean Burch.
In 1974 she was appointed Bush’s personal assistant after he was named U.S. envoy to Beijing; it was then, rumors say, that the alleged affair began. When Bush returned in 1975 to head the CIA, Fitzgerald came along as his aide. With the exception of a year in England at the U.S. Embassy, she stayed by the Vice President-side-technically as his appointments assistant but in reality as an all-powerful gatekeeper. Colleagues say she has an extremely tough office style and a fondness for shopping.
When Fitzgerald was transferred from the White House to become Bush’s liaison to the Senate in 1985, rumors circulated that it was because their relationship had become a liability to Bush. After Bush became President. Fitzgerald was named to her present job at the State Department. Gossip surfaced again during the 1988 campaign, when the alternative L.A. Weekly ran a story naming Fitzgerald as Bush’s longtime mistress and quoting an unnamed source that Fitzgerald had spoken openly of the affair. Last May, Hilary Clinton, fuming over stories about her husband’s alleged affair with Gennifer Flowers, complained in Vanity Fair that everyone knew there was another “Jennifer”—in Bush’s life—but that no one was reporting it.
It is true that the controversy surrounding Fitzgerald has not been widely covered. Nonetheless her name is well known to influential people in the capital, and Fitzgerald’s run-in with U.S. Customs was a hot topic in 1990. Fitzgerald was fined $648 for underestimating by $2,100 the value of a nutria-lined raincoat and a silver-fox cape that she purchased for 82.100 in Argentina.
The long-term political significance of last week’s accusation was unclear. Most Washington analysts agreed that Bush’s denial would quell the gossip. Bill Clinton, for one. wasn’t gloating over George Bush’s distress. “I didn’t like it when it was done to me,” he said, “and I don’t like it when it’s done to him.”

Munchausen by Proxy? Jennifer Bush says her mom Kathy Bush never abused herPrivacy Policy





It was a heartbreaking case that ripped a 9-year-old girl from her South Florida family and sent her mother to prison for years.Exactly 19 years ago today, Jennifer Bush was placed in state care amid allegations that her mother, Kathy Bush, was deliberately making her ill in an unusual — and some say now discredited — form of child abuse called Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy.After shunning attention for years, Jennifer Bush is publicly defending her mom for the first time and agreed to release a written statement this week and answer a few, limited follow-up questions from the Sun Sentinel. "Jennifer made it very clear: She thinks her mother never abused her," said Fort Lauderdale lawyer Robert Buschel, who defended Kathy Bush in her criminal trial and is the representative Jennifer Bush picked to relay her response to questions.The Coral Springs family's story fascinated and polarized the community for years, generated dozens of headlines internationally and featured on national TV.Many thought the little girl was secretly abused by a mother who caused her to undergo dozens of unnecessary medical procedures and surgeries. Others believed it was a clear case of government overreach by state child welfare workers who split the family and prosecutors who filed criminal charges.

Jennifer Bush never appeared in court, never testified against her mom and never publicly discussed the case. Authorities kept her out of view, and out of state, for years while she moved between foster homes and shelter care. When she was old enough, she made it clear she did not want to be in the spotlight.Now 27, she is happily married and has fully reunited with her parents, Kathy and Craig Bush, who live in Georgia, and her brothers, Matthew and Jason. She still fiercely protects her privacy and does not want to reveal where she lives.

Despite all the public speculation about the case and her mother, Jennifer Bush thinks it is so obvious that her mother did not abuse her that she included no reference to it in her initial prepared written statement. She only made it clear she believes her mother is innocent when the Sun Sentinel asked the question.

Bush wrote that April 15, 1996, changed her life forever."That was the day that I was taken from my home and my family, but that day has not changed how close my family continues to be. The 10 years I spent in foster care were traumatic, and I had some devastating things happen to me. However, I persevered because of all of the angels that were there for me during these difficult times. These people helped shaped the woman I have become today," she wrote."Today, I can proudly say my family is extremely close knit. We have flourished despite the devastating separation. The bond I had with my brothers, prior to being removed from my family, is something that never changed. My relationship with them helped carry me through my years in foster care. My parents and I have picked up from where we left off, and have a very close and loving relationship."Bush's time in foster care was difficult but inspired her to try to fix the system's problems herself. She became a social worker and says she hopes to become a foster parent herself soon."Today, I am living my dream as a social worker and changing the lives of the children and families I am working with today. I am married to my high school sweetheart, who has walked along side me for the past 10 years. I get a lot of joy making memories with my family, and making a difference in my community. Although this isn't always a happy anniversary, it is a day to celebrate my family and who we are today."Kathy Bush, who prosecutors argued was motivated by a desire to seek attention and publicity for herself by making her daughter ill, sent a one-sentence reply to an email requesting comment from her and Craig: "We are very proud of Jennifer and our sons, they have all grown up to be fine adults and dedicated their lives to serving others."She declined further comment. The couple's sons both worked as firefighters and Jason Bush served in the U.S. Marine Corps and was stationed in Iraq during the war.Buschel, the lawyer, said he thinks Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy was a flawed "diagnosis du jour" that has mostly fallen out of favor with medical experts. He said he has since represented other families who faced similar allegations but persuaded investigators that no crimes were committed."It's nice to see the government didn't succeed in destroying this family," Buschel said. "It's just good to see that Jennifer took her ordeal — of being separated from her family — and she really turned it around so that now she's helping other kids and parents."The Bush family's ordeal began early in Jennifer's life when she appeared to be chronically ill with digestive problems, seizures and a host of related illnesses.Before the abuse allegation surfaced, the little girl, sometimes dressed in a ballet tutu or baseball fan gear, and her mom were featured in newspaper articles about her illness.They organized fundraisers to help pay her massive medical bills, were feted by sports stars and even visited the Clinton White House where they were invited to raise awareness about health care costs.In April 1995, police and child welfare investigators began looking into a complaint made by a health care worker who suspected Kathy Bush might be intentionally causing her daughter to become ill by secretly giving her extra doses of medicine, infecting her and interfering with her treatment.In her first eight years, Jennifer had spent 640 days in hospitals and underwent 40 medical procedures and 1,819 nonsurgical treatments, investigators said.Authorities arrested Kathy Bush on abuse charges after a year of investigating. The same day, child welfare workers took Jennifer from her elementary school into state care. Authorities said her health improved immediately; the family said she'd been getting better for some time before she was taken away.Jennifer Bush moved between several state shelter care homes and foster homes during the next several years while her mother battled criminal charges. Through it all, Bush's husband and their two sons managed to maintain their support for both Kathy and Jennifer, never wavering in their belief that Kathy was innocent and both needed to come home. After a long, arduous trial in Broward Circuit Court in 1999, jurors found Kathy Bush guilty of aggravated child abuse. The judge only allowed fleeting references to Munchausen in the trial and jurors said they gave it little attention but believed Bush had harmed the girl.

Bush was later sentenced to five years in state prison. She appealed but lost. She was released in June 2005, after serving more than three years of her sentence. When state authorities moved to terminate her and her husband's parental rights to Jennifer, Bush initially fought but reached a settlement that cut her rights to the child but allowed her husband and sons to continue visiting Jennifer.Courts barred Kathy Bush from seeing Jennifer for about six years, starting in 1999, but they began writing letters, supervised by a therapist, in 2004, and Jennifer asked to be allowed to resume seeing her mother in 2005 when she turned 18.Broward prosecutors did not oppose her wishes and said they believed they had protected her until she was old enough to make her own choices.As Jennifer Bush moves on with the happier phase of her life, she offered words of encouragement to other foster children who struggle:"The odds are often against you to be successful in life. I challenge you to rise up against those odds, and be the very best you can be with the circumstances you are facing. Don't be ashamed or embarrassed to get the extra help that is offered, you will be thankful that you did in the future. There were many times that it would have been easier to give up, but it's persevering against the odds that makes it even more fulfilling. Speak up for yourself, be your biggest advocate, and be proactive. At the end of the day we owe it to ourselves. Don't let your current circumstance shape your future, and never doubt yourself!"pmcmahon@tribune.com, 954-356-4533 or Twitter @SentinelPaula

                                                    Was not expecting the world for the price, but have been pleasantly suprised.  I've purchased many other brands of furniture and
                                                    
                                                         this is the best in terms of quality and value in the "put it together" arena.

                                                    After spending hours searching the internet and reading dozens of product comments, I decided on this desk.  It was delivered wi
                                                    
                                                        thin days and packaged unbelievably secure.  Transportation services must really throw these packages around because the box was so dented in so many areas--needless to say there was a dent in the edge of the desk despite the great packaging. I love the desk so much that I can live with the dent.  The desk is solid, and easy to assemble (within ten minutes and I am a girl).  The drawer is fully assembled and very sturdy. The walnut stain looks rich and warm.  I bought it as a surprise gift for my husband. When he saw it all assembled he said, "I dont just like this desk...I LOVE it!.
Fantastic purchase with Cymax. Will definitely buy from this company again.

Bush Furniture
Bush Furniture is a true market leader in the manufacturing of affordable furniture solutions that will stand the test of time. With over 50 years of market experience, they have put themselves ahead of the pack by adhering to self-imposed safety standards that are well above the market standard. Bush has come a long way from its small beginnings as a small company who specialized in making flat-packed hampers. The hampers were a great success and that lead them to create a line of snap-together TV stands in 1972. Since then, the company has experienced international success. They are still headquartered today in Jamestown, NY with manufacturing plants in Pennsylvania, New York, Germany and China. Trust Bush for exceptional quality and style.Read More
Bush Series A
Series A is a no-frills collection of office furniture that's destined to be the workhorse of your office – whether big or small. But just this version of "basic" doesn't cut any corners. Series A is a totally modular system, which means that it's easy to incorporate into any work environment.  A variety of shapes and configurations are available so that you can custom tailor Series A to your workspace. Clever storage is integrated into the desks and the optional hutches. Use a lateral file for your important documents or a corner overhead shelving unit to make the most of your space. Bush Series A is available in a range of colors and finishes so that your new system will coordinate with your space.
All Bush products offer commercial grade quality to withstand the test of time. Durable thermally-fused laminate surfaces are over 1" thick and have been specially designed to withstand the rigors of a 40+ hour work week. All surfaces are glare, stain and scratch resistant. Grommets and wire management systems have been incorporated to keep your work space tidy.

Bush Furniture
Bush Furniture is a true market leader in the manufacturing of affordable furniture solutions that will stand the test of time. With over 50 years of market experience, they have put themselves ahead of the pack by adhering to self-imposed safety standards that are well above the market standard. Bush has come a long way from its small beginnings as a small company who specialized in making flat-packed hampers. The hampers were a great success and that lead them to create a line of snap-together TV stands in 1972. Since then, the company has experienced international success. They are still headquartered today in Jamestown, NY with manufacturing plants in Pennsylvania, New York, Germany and China. Trust Bush for exceptional quality and style.Read More
Bush Series A
Series A is a no-frills collection of office furniture that's destined to be the workhorse of your office – whether big or small. But just this version of "basic" doesn't cut any corners. Series A is a totally modular system, which means that it's easy to incorporate into any work environment.  A variety of shapes and configurations are available so that you can custom tailor Series A to your workspace. Clever storage is integrated into the desks and the optional hutches. Use a lateral file for your important documents or a corner overhead shelving unit to make the most of your space. Bush Series A is available in a range of colors and finishes so that your new system will coordinate with your space.
All Bush products offer commercial grade quality to withstand the test of time. Durable thermally-fused laminate surfaces are over 1" thick and have been specially designed to withstand the rigors of a 40+ hour work week. All surfaces are glare, stain and scratch resistant. Grommets and wire management systems have been incorporated to keep your work space tidy.
