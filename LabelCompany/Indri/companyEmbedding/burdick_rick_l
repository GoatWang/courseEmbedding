Rick Burdick is the chair of the Global Energy & Transactions group and also serves as the managing partner for the firm’s international offices. Mr. Burdick has been representing companies and investors across the energy sector for more than 30 years. He has played a leading role in some of the industry’s most cutting-edge domestic and cross-border transactions throughout the United States, the Middle East, Russia, Central Europe and China.
Practice & Background
Mr. Burdick has represented a broad range of buyers, sellers, issuers, underwriters and investors in a number of substantial domestic and international transactions, including in the Middle East, Russia, China and India. He led the legal team that completed the largest privatization in Russia’s history and the largest investment ever by a U.S. company in Russia (“ConocoPhillips-Lukoil: One Strange Cocktail,” The Deal, February 7, 2005). He also led a team of lawyers in the representation of a privatized Russian oil company in two international convertible bond offerings. Both transactions were the first securities offerings consummated by a Russian company following the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Mr. Burdick has represented both acquirers and targets in a wide variety of public and private merger and acquisition transactions, including asset acquisitions and dispositions, mergers, proxy solicitations and related financings. He also represents both issuers and underwriters in connection with securities offerings of a variety of debt and equity securities and regularly provides counsel to boards of directors and special committees on corporate governance matters.
Mr. Burdick has represented clients in all facets of the energy industry, including power, exploration and production, transportation, refining, service and equipment manufacturing companies. While much of his practice has focused on the energy industry, he has also represented clients in the manufacturing, retailing, media and transportation sectors.
He has held a number of positions in firm management, including partner in charge of the Houston and Washington offices of the firm, chair of the business transactions department and chair of the partnership admissions committee. Presently, Mr. Burdick serves as managing partner, international, and chair of the international corporate transactions practice.
Mr. Burdick serves as a member of the boards of directors of two public companies, AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE) and CBIZ, Inc. (NYSE).
Representative Matters
Recent transactions that Mr. Burdick has led include:

a $5.5 billion cross border share purchase
an $8.7 billion merger of two NYSE-listed investor-owned utilities
a $12 billion cross-border joint venture in the energy industry
a $2 billion cross-border merger of two public companies in the waste management industry
a $2.2 billion merger of public companies in the quick-service restaurant industry
a $4 billion public company spin-off
an $875 million IPO
counseling a board of directors of an NYSE company on a recapitalization.

Community Involvement
Mr. Burdick is active in the community, serving in a number of capacities, including on the board of directors of The Global Fund for Children and currently the president of the board of trustees of William & Mary’s Marshall-Wythe School of Law.

Rick L.   Burdick

                  Partner Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP 
             






Rick Burdick serves as managing partner, international, and chair of the international corporate transactions practice at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP. He has held a number of positions in firm management, including partner in charge of the Houston and Washington offices of the firm, chair of the business transactions department and chair of the partnership admissions committee. In his practice, Mr. Burdick represents a broad range of buyers, sellers, issuers, underwriters and investors in a number of substantial domestic and international transactions, including in the Middle East, Russia, China and India.  He has represented both issuers and underwriters in connection with securities offerings—he led the legal teams that transacted the first securities offerings consummated by a Russian company following the collapse of the Soviet Union—and regularly provides counsel to boards of directors and special committees on corporate governance matters. Mr. Burdick has also represented both acquirers and targets in a wide variety of public and private merger and acquisition transactions, as well as clients in all facets of the energy industry, including power, exploration and production, transportation, refining, service and equipment manufacturing companies. In 2010, Mr. Burdick was named “Dealmaker of the Week” by The Am Law Daily for his leadership role in the FirstEnergy acquisition of Allegheny Energy. He is also recognized as a “Washington, D.C. Super Lawyer” and is listed as a leading lawyer in corporate/M&A and private equity by Chambers USA: America's Leading Lawyers for Business. Mr. Burdick serves as a member of the boards of directors of two public companies, AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE) and CBIZ, Inc. (NYSE).  He chairs the governance and nominating committees for both and serves as the lead director for the latter.
