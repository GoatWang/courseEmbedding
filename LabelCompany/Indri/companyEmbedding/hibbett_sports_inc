Hibbett Team Sales, Inc. is a full line sporting goods dealer focused on serving schools and teams with their athletic equipment, footwear and apparel needs.
Hibbett Sporting Goods was founded in 1945 under the name Dixie Supply Company and sold merchandise such as boats, marine equipment and even small aircraft. In 1949 Dixie Supply Company entered the team and school athletic equipment business.
In 1952 Dixie Supply Company became Hibbett and Sons, Inc. Over the next seven years, all merchandise not related to athletic equipment, apparel and footwear was slowly dropped out of inventory. By 1968 75% of all sales consisted of school and team business. In 1969 the company became Hibbett Sporting Goods, Inc.
We are now Hibbett Team Sales, Inc., a subsidiary of Hibbett Sports, Inc. Many things have changed since 1945, but the things that have not changed is our commitment to provide excellent service to our customer and supply quality products at competitive pricing.
If you are a college, high school, middle school, elementary school youth organization or just need custom tee shirts, we are your source.
Please contact us so that we may serve you and your team.

Definition
Accounts Receivable is money owed to a business by customers and shown on its Balance Sheet as an asset.

Explanation
1. Accounts Receivable are created when a customer has received a product but has not yet paid for that product. Days sales outstanding measures of the average number of days that a company takes to collect revenue after a sale has been made. It is a financial ratio that illustrates how well a company's accounts receivables are being managed.
Hibbett Sports Inc's Days Sales Outstanding for the quarter that ended in Apr. 2017 is calculated as:



Days Sales Outstanding


=Account Receivable/Revenue*Days in Period

=0/275.688*91


=0.00



2. In Ben Grahams calculation of liquidation value, Hibbett Sports Inc's accounts receivable are only considered to be worth 75% of book value:
Hibbett Sports Inc's liquidation value for the quarter that ended in Apr. 2017 is calculated as:



Liquidation value


=Cash and Cash Equivalents-Total Liabilities+(0.75 * Account Receivable)+(0.5 * Inventory)


=75.856-123.594+0.75 * 0+0.5 * 249.359


=76.9



* All numbers are in millions except for per share data and ratio. All numbers are in their local exchange's currency.

Be Aware
Net receivables tells us a great deal about the different competitors in the same industry. In competitive industries, some attempt to gain advantage by offering better credit terms, causing increase in sales and receivables.
If company consistently shows lower % Net receivables to gross sales than competitors, then it usually has some kind of competitive advantage which requires further digging.
Average Days Sales Outstanding is a good indicator for measuring a companys sales channel and customers. A company may book great revenue and earnings growth but never receive payment from their customers. This may force a write-off in the future and depress future earnings.

Runners and bikers can get their exercise in and around their neighborhood, but sometimes the weather doesn't cooperate. That's why having your own equipment makes it possible for you to exercise anytime day or night without worry about getting too hot or too cold. When buying exercise equipment, there are some things to know before making these big-ticket purchases. Treadmills One of the main considerations regarding a treadmill is how much space it takes up. A typical treadmill is about 6.5 feet long and 3 feet wide. For those with limited space, a treadmill that folds up is ideal, and some can fold up so thin that they fit under a bed when not in use. Another consider is stride length. Some treadmills have a long deck area that is dedicated to running while some have design cues that limit the running space. Treadmills should have a high degree of adjustability to be the most useful to you. This includes speeds that should range between 0 and 10 to 12 miles per hour and incline grades of around 10 to 15 percent. Some upgrades to look for on treadmills includes a dock for iPods or MP3 players, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity and USB ports. elliptical Trainers For a complete workout, consider an elliptical trainer. Similar to a treadmill, an elliptical trainer takes up a decent amount of space. Ellipticals usually run about 6 feet long but can be 7 feet long and between 2.5 and 4 feet wide. Because of the stepping action that is part of using an elliptical, you should know that elliptical trainers have step-up heights of between 6 and 25 inches above the floor. Having adjustable cushioned handgrips is a nice addition, making sure the user is comfortable, and allowing users of different heights to use it. For multi-taskers, you want to look for certain high-tech features for the equipment to have, such as USB ports, Web access, Bluetooth connectivity and the ability to link to a mobile device. The elliptical trainer should offer several programs to keep your workout interesting, such as hill climbing, long-distance climbs and one that targets a specific heart rate. Exercise Bikes Comfort is probably the most important consideration when choosing an exercise (or stationary) bicycle. The saddle should be padded and designed in a manner of your choosing. Some users like a wide saddle and some like a long, narrow saddle. Adjustable handlebars are features that also add to a user's comfort. Weight capacity is another consideration as some lightweight bikes only hold up to 250 pounds while some can hold users of 350 pounds or more. These bikes can be either belt-driven or chain-driven models and should be quiet when operating. Like elliptical machines and treadmills, stationary bikes have built-in programs that allow users to vary their workouts and keep them from becoming tedious. You also want to look for bikes that have heart-rate monitors, computer screens that display your statistics as you ride and adjustable tension levels. Rowing Machines Rowing machines come in four different styles: air, hydraulic, magnetic and water. All simulate the rowing action of a canoe or kayak in the water. Air rowing machines use flywheels (similar to elliptical machines) to create resistance. Hydraulic machines use cylinders filled with oil to create resistance. Magnets provide the resistance in magnetic rowing machines, and water pressure provides the resistance in water rowing machines. The seat should be comfortable and can either be a saddle or have a back connected to it. Some rowing machines are fixed while some are foldable, which is a consideration for those with limited space. One thing to note is that fixed machines tend to be more durable for frequent home use than folding rowers. Home Gyms Home gyms make it possible for users to perform many different weight resistance exercises all with one machine in a small space. Some home gyms use free weights   purchased separately   to provide resistance while others come with the weights attached to the gym. An adjustable bench that detaches is useful for doing several different exercises either seated or lying down. Some gyms that come preloaded with weights have the ability to add more, making them useful to people looking to increase their strength levels. There should be a number of accessories as well, such as a pull-down bar, lat bar, dumbbell and leg lift.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147366600, DC-prod-dfw1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.15.0, SHA-06ca1a9068b558bd33bd1add57a0b13a52090f9f, CID-

Some outdoor sports, like climbing, only require a few items for you to grab before you begin partaking in them, while others, such as fishing or snow skiing, require some supplies for success. Whatever your outdoor passion is, you can find the item you need to enjoy yourself to the fullest. Save money at the same time by taking advantage of our Every Day Low Prices.CampingTo have a successful camping trip, there are certain pieces of equipment that are must-have items, and these include tents, sleeping bags, cooking equipment, lights, coolers and emergency preparedness items you'll want to pick up. Depending on how many people are camping, you can choose tents that sleep one to two people or ones that sleep seven or more people. Many of these tents only have an entrance and space to sleep on the ground, while some of the larger tents have enough room for you to stand up inside and even use cots instead of sleeping on the ground, sleeping bags keep you warm on cold nights especially if there's no fire and you're sleeping on the ground. Many have extra padding for comfort and zip up completely to keep you pest-free as you sleep.For overnight trips or longer, you definitely want to have a cooler or two for cold beverages and to keep fish fresh   if fishing was on your agenda. Whether you're eating what you brought or what you caught, some staples for camping cooking equipment include a portable gas or charcoal grill, cookware like cast-iron skillets or Dutch ovens and utensils like tongs and spatulas. You'll also want things to eat on and with, and you can buy camping dish packs or paper and plastic items that are biodegradable and easy to pack home with you. The most important emergency preparedness items you can have on hand include a flashlight or lantern, first aid kit and some basic tools, including a knife or multitool.FishingIf you're using live or cut bait, all you really need to go fishing is a rod and reel, some fishing line, some hooks and some weights and bobbers. Otherwise, you can get even more detailed and load up a tackle box with artificial baits, lures, spoons and attractants to bring in those fish. Rods vary in lengths; shorter rods are better for boat and pier fishing, and long poles are better suited for surf fishing. You can choose from spincast reels, which are basic reels for beginners; spinning reels, which are common for most kinds of fishing; and baitcasting reels, which are more advanced reels that work for bigger game fish. If you're doing your fishing on a party boat or other offshore vehicle and you're trolling for fish, a trolling reel is your best option.Fishing line is differentiated by type and the weight of fish it can hold. Monofilament line is the most common fishing line; it's made of nylon and has a single strand. Braided fishing line is similar to monofilament line, only it has two lines that are braided together to create more strength. Less common fishing lines include fluorocarbon, which is virtually invisible underwater; wire fishing line, which anglers use to catch mackerel, tuna and other fish with strong teeth; and fly fishing line, which is exclusively used for fly fishing and very lightweight. A basic bait or circle hook   which is a more curved version of a bait hook   will catch most fish, but there are others that work with certain types of fish. If you're fishing on the top of the water, you want to use bobbers to keep the bait near the top; weights work when you want to do bottom fishing for species like halibut.Other outdoor sportsCamping and fishing are two of the most popular outdoor activities, but they're nowhere near exhaustive when it comes to all the fun you can have with outside sports.Winter sports   The two most popular winter sports are skiing and snowboarding. Most of the things you need to do both are the same, such as the clothing and accessories like goggles, jackets and hats. Many people prefer snowboarding to skiing because you can do more tricks and the initial costs to get into the sport are much less than skiing. Another popular winter sport is ice skating, especially in locations with ponds and lakes that freeze over or have indoor skating rinks. All you really need is a pair of good-fitting ice skates and the motivation to get back up again as you're learning.Climbing and mountaineering   If you like climbing and aren't tackling steep rock wall faces, the basic equipment you need includes paracord (or rope), carabiners (both locking and non-locking), a harness, hand protection (like gloves), boots and a helmet. Paracord is rated by weight, so if you have three people climbing on the same rope, or two heavier people, you want to have paracord that's rated for 500 pounds or higher. The carabiners allow you to move up and down the rope as you climb without getting snagged. The harness is a safety device that can keep you from falling if you slip.Show moreElectrode, Comp-138129722, DC-prod-dfw1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.15.0, SHA-06ca1a9068b558bd33bd1add57a0b13a52090f9f, CID-

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
