	AMI Asset Management is a Los Angeles-based registered investment advisor with approximately $1.7 billion* in assets under management.  The firm manages seven investment strategies including U.S. Large Capitalization Growth Equity, U.S. Small Capitalization Growth Equity, U.S. Small-Mid Capitalization Growth Equity, U.S Large Cap Equity Income, Taxable Fixed Income, Tax-Exempt Fixed Income and High-Yield Fixed Income. The management of the equity strategies and fixed income strategies are independent of each another. AMI is employee owned. 

	 

Firm History

	 


1975:  Bill Tanner co-founds a business management accounting firm in Los Angeles which focuses on managing the business affairs of individuals in the entertainment business.   During his time at the accounting firm, Mr. Tanner develops a unique form of a GARP strategy which focuses on investing in companies with recurring business models.


	 


1994: AMI Asset Management Corporation, a registered investment advisor, is formed by Mr. Tanner and Peter Mainstain.  


	 


1998: Mr. Tanner begins managing large cap growth portfolios on behalf of his clients.


	 


2000:  Mr. Tanner is increasingly being called upon by his clients to manage their investment portfolios leading him to step away from managing the day-to-day business of the accounting firm to focus his attention on AMI.  Matt Humiston is hired to help formalize the business structure and co-manage the portfolio.  Asset growth accelerates.


	 


2003: AMI elects to outsource the management of all of their clients’ fixed income portfolios to a local sub-advisor.


	 


2005:  Chris Sessing is hired from Crowell, Weedon & Co. to co-manage the equity portfolio with Mr. Tanner and Mr. Humiston.  New asset growth moves away from referrals from the accounting firm, and more towards relationships of the firm's partners and client referrals.


	 


2008: AMI launches a second equity strategy, AMI Small Cap Growth Equity, which is managed in an identical fashion as the large cap growth strategy but focuses on investing in domestic firms with a market capitalization of between $100 million and $3 billion. 


	 


2009: The firm elects to bring all of the fixed income assets in-house by hiring portfolio manager Tim Somers.


	 


2012: Matt Dorband is hired to lead the institutional sales and marketing efforts.  Institutional asset growth accelerates.


	 


2013: The firm's assets under management surpass $1 billion.  AMI starts a third equity strategy, AMI SMID Cap Growth Equity, which focuses on investing in domestic companies with a market capitalization between $100 million and $10 billion.


	 


2015: With the hiring of Senior Equity Analyst, Andrew Zamfotis, AMI expands its equity research team


	 


2016: Equity Analyst, Richard Schimobor, is hired to join the firm's equity research team. Rob Knowles joins the firm as Senior VP of Institutional Markets, increasing institutional sales & marketing efforts.

About UsOur TeamInstitutionsPhilosophyEquity ApproachIndividualsStrategiesLarge Cap Growth EquitySmall Cap Growth EquitySmall-Mid Cap Growth EquityTaxable Fixed IncomeTax-Exempt Fixed IncomeHigh Yield Fixed IncomeNewsContact




































Equity Philosophy

	AMI Asset Management believes that in order to generate superior long term returns a strategy needs to perform well in bull markets, but equally as important to maintain capital in bear markets.  We strive to achieve this goal by utilizing a disciplined form of a GARP strategy which focuses on investing in companies with recurring revenue business models.   We define recurring revenue business models as those with products that have a short life span (<2 years) and thus must be replaced frequently.  We believe that a recurring revenue business model allows a company to grow at a more predictable and sustainable growth rate while reducing volatility in earnings.  We also believe that companies can go through extended periods of mispricing.  Our rigorous internal due diligence process allows us to uncover these quality growth companies which we believe are undervalued.

Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime.
