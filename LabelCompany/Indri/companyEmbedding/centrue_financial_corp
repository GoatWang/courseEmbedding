About Us
Centrue Bank has roots back to 1874 when its charter was first granted as Union National Bank of Streator. Over the years, growth through acquisitions and restructurings led to the development of a full-service financial institution which offers its clients banking full service retail, mortgage and commercial banking.  In 1989, as the bank continued to grow and provide service to many new markets, the name of all its locations was changed to UnionBank. After many years operating as UnionBank, 2006 brought on another exciting change in the form of a merger of equals with Centrue Financial Corporation.
Today, we’re Centrue Bank and our nearly 250 employees proudly serve clients from the far western suburbs of Chicago, south to St. Louis. As in the very beginning and throughout our rich history, dedication to providing superior products and service to help people achieve financial peace of mind continues to be at the forefront of our operation.

WHY CHOOSE RESEARCH AND MARKETS?



WORLD'S LARGEST SELECTION




TRUSTED BY THE BEST




CUSTOMER FOCUSED




SAFE & SECURE







Research and Markets has exceptional standards in terms of customer service. Stephen was my contact since

                         an initial enquiry last October. He never failed to reply promptly and efficiently. The information provided has always been clear and to the point. This quality of service extends to Thomas at the Orders Department. I will be happy to order publications from Research and Markets again if the situation arises.
