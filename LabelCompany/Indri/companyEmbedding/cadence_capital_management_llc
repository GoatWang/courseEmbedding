RULES-BASED GLOBAL INVESTMENT SOLUTIONS



OVERVIEW





Cadence Capital Management delivers customizable strategic beta portfolios to investors. Our team designs, develops, and implements strategies to target distinct investment opportunities and/or capture specific fundamental or valuation characteristics. Our four main Betas - value, yield, momentum, and quality - are displayed in the accompanying portfolio framework diagram. These four Betas can be applied across the U.S., international, and emerging markets, resulting in a total of 12 base strategies. Cadence Betas are analogous to Lego® pieces; they can stand alone, be integrated into an existing portfolio, or be assembled to provide a comprehensive and consistent global investment. 
 






 






STRATEGIC BETA INVESTING
Cadence Capital Management offers investors low cost, integrated global investment solutions that are transparent, systematic, liquid, and consistent.  We are prepared to work closely with clients to pinpoint the factors that will best serve their specific investment needs, modify or create new strategies to satisfy specific objectives or restrictions, and advise on which betas look more attractive at any given time. 


THE CADENCE APPROACH





DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTICS





FACTOR FOCUS
Each Beta portfolio is built to target a specific factor or characteristic. For example, our Yield Beta is designed exclusively to deliver yield. Our Momentum Beta is designed exclusively to deliver momentum. Every holding contributes to the portfolio's goal. Our Betas express a strong active view. 
BETA-SPECIFIC RULE DESIGN
We do not take a cookie cutter approach to portfolio construction. A proprietary set of rules is used to build each Beta to reflect the idiosyncratic characteristics specific to the client, region, factor, or strategy. Although our construction process is disciplined, objective, and repeatable; rules are not set in stone. They are periodically reviewed to ensure relevancy in an ever changing market environment. 

 
INVESTMENT TOOLS
Cadence Betas offer an efficient way to capture risk premiums. They can be used in place of traditional active managers, in place of index funds, or as a complement to either, as part of a comprehensive investment program. Furthermore, Cadence Betas can be used as stand-alone portfolios or work together seamlessly for efficient exposure to desired markets, regions, or equity cohorts. 
CLIENT CUSTOMIZATION
We partner with clients to pinpoint the factors that will best serve their specific investment needs and goals. Many investment firms speak to working closely with clients, but Cadence's boutique size allows us to understand the goals of our clients and, in the process, form long-lasting relationships. We have the willingness, ability, and platform to work closely with clients to customize existing strategies or develop new ones.
