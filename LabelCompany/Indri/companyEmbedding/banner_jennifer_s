Ms. Banner has been a director of BB&T Corporation since 2003 (presently serving as lead director and as a member of the executive and risk committees) and Branch Banking and Trust Company since 2013 and is a past director of Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (Nashville Branch) and First Virginia Banks, Inc. and First Vantage Bank. Ms. Banner maintains an active license as a Certified Public Accountant in the State of Tennessee, and she holds a Master of Accountancy and Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from the University of Tennessee.

Copies and Documents

Standard Color  

Reach more customers and clients using professional, high-quality materials. Clean, crisp copies and documents provide consumers and employees with an easy way to read your business messages, facilitating the successful communication of company goals while leaving a favorable impression.

Take advantage of our lowest pricing when you submit your copy job online.
Choose from four different sizes, including legal and standard, to better accommodate your mailers or your filing cabinets. Ledger-style and cut-to-size copies and documents are also available.
Attract more customers with color copies and documents, or have your literature duplicated in black & white, and bound for training manuals. Choose from a variety of binding and finishing options for a look that accurately reflects your brand.
Order as few or as many copies and documents as you need. Quantities start at one and continue on up, so you can always have enough printed to meet your business demands.
