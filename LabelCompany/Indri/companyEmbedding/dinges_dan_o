Current operations[edit]
As of December 31, 2016, the company had 8.576 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved reserves, of which 96.5% was natural gas on an energy-equivalent basis, and 92% were in the Marcellus Shale. In 2016, the company produced 627.1 billion cubic feet equivalent of natural gas.[2]
The company operates in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, where it controls approximately 179,000 net acres[2][3] as well as in the Eagle Ford Shale, where it controls approximately 84,000 net acres.[2][4]
History[edit]
The company became a public company via an initial public offering in 1990.[5]
In 1994, the company acquired Washington Energy Resources in a $180 million stock transaction.[6]
In 1995, the company ousted John Lollar, its chairman and CEO, in part due to the ill-timing of the acquisition of Washington Energy Resources.[7]
In 2008, the company was added to the S&P 500 index.[8]
In 2013, the company sold its assets in the Marmaton play of Oklahoma and West Texas for $160 million.[9]
Controversies[edit]
Environmental damage[edit]
The company has been cited for violations in regard to spills of toxic hydro-fracking fluids in Northeastern Pennsylvania.[10]
The company was cited for improper well construction as a result of polluted drinking water.[11]
Restraining order on anti-fracking activist[edit]
In January 2014, Cabot sought, and a judge granted, a temporary injunction barring anti-fracking activist Vera Scroggins from entering on any land in Pennsylvania owned or leased by Cabot. "In total, 312.5 sq miles are no-go areas for Scroggins under a sweeping court order granted by a local judge that bars her from any properties owned or leased by one of the biggest drillers in the Pennsylvania natural gas rush, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation." It was noted by Cabot during court testimony that Scroggins had violated no laws and that this lawsuit was based on her being considered a "nuisance" due to her reporting and activism at Cabot sites.[12]

DAN OREN DINGES, JR., 22, of Spring, Texas, passed away Sunday morning, October 28, 2007 unexpectedly. Born December 26, 1984 in Houston, TX, the son of Dan O. and Kerry E. Dinges and brother to Lindsey E. Dinges. Danny graduated from Klein High School in 2003 and was attending the University of Texas pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Petroleum Engineering. He knew the value of life and acknowledged "life is too short to be upset with others and forgiving is one of the most important aspects of living." Danny believed in loving what life gave him and making the most of every circumstance. He was the life and soul of all gatherings with his family and friends. He lived to laugh and put a smile on every face. He expressed his deep, genuine, unconditional love for his family, a love that was recognized by all that knew him. Danny's best friend in life and his inner strength and confidence came from his Mom. He loved and excelled at all sports especially baseball. He played baseball and football for Klein High School, and club baseball at UT. He also loved the fellowship and camaraderie in the outdoors; extreme skiing in the Colorado mountains, the memorable hunting trips with his Dad and wakeboarding with his sister and friends at Lake Travis. While enjoying his love of the outdoors, he committed his life to Jesus surrounded by his sister and friends at Young Life Frontier Camp. Danny is survived by his parents, Dan O. and Kerry E. Dinges, Spring, TX; his sister Lindsey E. Dinges, Spring, TX; his paternal grandparents, Dr. M. Dan (Marie) Dinges, Houston, TX; his maternal grandparents, Jimmy C. (Kay) Lindley, Sr., Corpus Christi, TX, and Connie Lindley, Houston, TX; his aunts, uncles, many cousins, and many, many beloved friends. Funeral services will take place at 2:00 p.m. on Saturday, November 3, 2007 at Fellowship of the Woodlands in the chapel, One Fellowship Drive, The Woodlands, TX 77384. Pastor Clint Ivy will officiate. In lieu of flowers donations to American Alzheimer Association, 2242 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030 or the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, 5005 Mitchelldale, Suite 115, Houston, TX 77092.

Dan O. Dinges proverb and quote - The world's largest proverb collection for the Nordic countries!Hello! My name is Pex!I hope you'll like my proverb collection - I have been collecting for more than 27 years!I wish you a wonderful time here at nordicquotes.com! / Pex TufvessonP.S. Hug someone, just anyone... :)5 ordspråk av Dan O. Dinges Dan O. Dinges L�s om Dan O. Dinges p� Google eller Bing.  Hitta foto... Much of our strategic shift is providing production advances over the next 60 days in the Gulf Coast. This effort sets the stage for Gulf Coast growth in 2006, along with production growth in our East, West and Canada regions. The Minden prospect originated this past summer through a large acreage acquisition from a major oil company and Cabot now controls 3,500 acres over the area. We are pleased with our initial results and will remain active in this area throughout 2006. On forty-acre spacing, the prospect has the potential for 80 plus locations. We have secured the rigs necessary to complete our program, a program that focuses on more development activity and less risk. The current forecasted activity level calls for 391 wells, with increased activity in each region including expanded drilling on each of the acquisition plays purchased in 2005. With the addition of these volumes, our Gulf Coast region is off to a good start for 2006 in its effort to grow its production. Combined, all regions are now showing growth in both production and reserves which is very attractive, especially considering the organic strategy on which we have predominately focused. With the inherent value in Cabot's capital program, we recommenced buying shares in late November and early December with the market pull back. We still see a lot of merit and long-term value for the shareholders in looking at COG stock as an investment alternative.NordicQuotes.comNumber of proverbs are 1466250varav 1407627 p� engelskaProverb (1466250 st) SearchCategories (2627 st) Search
