Charter Communications Entertainment I, LLC Key Developments

New York State Public Service Commission Issues Order Approving Renewal of Cable Television Franchise for the Petition of Charter Communications Entertainment I, LLC
Oct 28 15
On May 27, 2015, Charter Communications Entertainment I, LLC submitted a petition for approval of the renewal of its cable television franchise with the Town of New Lebanon, Columbia County. The town authorized renewal of the franchise by resolution of the Town Board dated April 14, 2015, after a duly noticed public hearing held on the same date. The term of the franchise is five years, beginning on the date this order is issued and effective. The franchise renewal will serve the public interest because it continues the availability of cable service in the community. It is approved, subject to compliance with and governed by the obligations, requirements and standards in federal and state law, rules, regulations, standards, and orders. No renewal of a franchise is effective without the approval of the Commission (Public Service Law (PSL) section 222). Failure to conform to franchise standards established in Commission regulations does not preclude Commission approval, if the Commission finds that approval of the franchise renewal would serve the public interest; and, the Commission may approve the application contingent upon compliance with the statutory and regulatory standards, terms, or conditions that are not met by the franchise renewal (PSL section 222(3) and (4)). Commission regulations (16 NYCRR section 891.2 and Part 895) require an application for renewal to conform to minimum standards for required contents of franchises and procedural requirements for municipal review of the franchise renewal, including public notice, opportunity for comment, and a public hearing.
