Potential Conflicts of InterestAFCM frequently recommends that separately managed accounts invest a portion of their assets under management in one of the mutual funds described above depending upon the risk profile and investment objectives of the underlying client.  When that occurs AFCM receives management fees from the individual managed account for investing in one of the funds and fees for managing the funds itself.  In both instances AFCM is being compensated on the basis of a percentage of assets under management.  This ability to collect fees from the individual managed accounts and from the mutual funds provides an incentive for Mr. Gonsalves to recommend that a client invest in one of the above described funds and could be considered a conflict of interest on the part of AFCM and Mr. Gonsalves. Mr. Gonsalves attempts to minimize this potential conflict of interest by recommending AFCM-managed mutual funds to a client only if such client’s investment portfolio allocation needs fit the investment profile of the specific funds being recommended.  Absent such an investment profile, Mr. Gonsalves will refrain from making such a recommendation to clients maintaining individual managed accounts. The client is under no obligation to act upon the representative’s recommendation to invest in the above named mutual fund products.  It should be noted that AFCM believes that its current roster of investment vehicles/mutual funds would fit within the asset allocation of either an Aggressive or Moderate Growth portfolio.DisclaimersAn investment in an equity portfolio should be made with an understanding of the risks associated with an investment in common stocks including the risk that the financial condition of the issuers of the equities or the general condition of the stock market may worsen.ETFs are subject to various risks, including management’s ability to meet the fund’s investment objective, and to manage the fund’s portfolio when the underlying securities are redeemed or sold, during periods of market turmoil and as investors’ perceptions regarding ETFs or their underlying investments change. Unlike open-end funds, which trade at prices based on a current determination of the fund’s net asset value, ETFs frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market. Certain ETFs may employ the use of leverage which increases the volatility of such funds.An investment in securities of foreign issuers should be made with an understanding of the additional risks involved, such as currency fluctuations, political risk, withholding, the lack of adequate financial information, and exchange control restrictions impacting foreign issuers.Investing in high-yield securities or "junk" bonds should be viewed as speculative and you should review your ability to assume the risks associated with investments which utilize such securities. High-yield securities are subject to numerous risks, including higher interest rates, economic recession, deterioration of the junk bond market, possible downgrades and defaults of interest and/or principal. High-yield security prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated securities and are affected by short-term credit developments to a greater degree.Investment grade bonds are subject to numerous risks including higher interest rates, economic recession, deterioration of the investment grade bond market or investors' perception thereof, possible downgrades and defaults of interest and/or principal.An investment in a portfolio containing REIT securities is subject to additional risks, as companies involved in the real estate industry are subject to changes in the real estate market, vacancy rates and competition, volatile interest rates and economic recession.The value of the securities held by the portfolio may be subject to steep declines or increased volatility due to changes in performance or perception of the issuers.You should carefully consider the Portfolio’s investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses before investing.Past performance is no guarantee of future results.  You should consider the portfolio’s investment objectives, risks, and expenses carefully before investing. An investment in any investment portfolio should be made with an understanding of the risks involved with owning common stocks, such as an economic recession and the possible deterioration of either the financial condition of the issuers of the equity securities or the general condition of the stock market. An investment in a portfolio containing equity securities of foreign issuers is subject to additional risks, including currency fluctuations, political risks, withholding, the lack of adequate financial information, and exchange control restrictions impacting foreign issuers. Risks associated with investing in foreign securities may be more pronounced in emerging markets where the securities markets are substantially smaller, less liquid, less regulated and more volatile than the U.S. and developed foreign markets.There is no guarantee that any investment strategy will achieve its objectives, generate profits or avoid losses.AmericaFirst Capital Management is a Registered Investment Adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

We learn from history so investors don't have to!
PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RETURNS
[i] Alpha is one of five technical risk ratios; the others are beta, standard deviation, R-squared, and the Sharpe ratio. These are all statistical measurements used in modern portfolio theory (MPT). All of these indicators are intended to help investors determine the risk-reward profile of a mutual fund. Simply stated, alpha is often considered to represent the value that a portfolio manager adds to or subtracts from a fund's return.

PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RETURNS [i] Alpha is one of five technical risk ratios; the others are beta, standard deviation, R-squared, and the Sharpe ratio. These are all statistical measurements used in modern portfolio theory (MPT). All of these indicators are intended to help investors determine the risk-reward profile of a mutual fund. Simply stated, alpha is often considered to represent the value that a portfolio manager adds to or subtracts from a fund's return. Contact: Robert G.
