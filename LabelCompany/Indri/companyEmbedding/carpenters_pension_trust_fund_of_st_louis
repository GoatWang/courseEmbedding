This affects any communication sent to you from the Benefit Plans Office, the Carpenters Regional Council, your Local, and the Apprenticeship School.

What is a Benefit Credit?

A Benefit Credit is the credit a member receives when working in covered employment for an employer who has signed a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with the St. Louis – Kansas City Carpenters Regional Council (Regional Council).
  A Benefit Credit is composed of up to three (3) benefit components: health and welfare credit, pension credit and vacation credit. The health and welfare and pension components are 100% employer contributions, while the vacation credit is payroll deducted and employee (member) paid. Each Benefit Credit is based on the hours the member works. For example, one Benefit Credit is earned for each hour worked, with possible exceptions for additional credit for overtime hours worked. Partial benefit credit may also be earned.   The health and welfare credit earned through an employer's purchase of a Benefit Credit is what determines a member's health and welfare eligibility, or coverage under the Health and Welfare Plan. Refer to Eligibility Actives for more information on earning initial eligibility and continuing eligibility.    Pension credit earned through an employer's purchase of a Benefit Credit builds toward accruing a member's pension benefit. Pension credit may be earned in St. Louis (managed by the Carpenters' Pension Office in St. Louis) or Kansas City (managed by Wilson McShane in Kansas City), or transferred to Geneva (an option based only on the member's original Local affiliation at the time of the Southern Illinois/St. Louis merger), depending on the Member's Home Pension Fund. Please refer to Pension Who We Serve for Local affiliation with participating Pension Funds. There are some employers who do not participate in any Carpenters' Pension Fund. Members employed by these companies would not have pension benefit credit as a part of their Benefit Credit.   Vacation Benefit Credit is payroll deducted by hour during each pay period. Employers use the member's payroll deduction to purchase members' vacation credit. Each June, members are eligible to redeem their Vacation Benefits online on carpdc.org. For every hour payroll deducted, the member will receive that amount in either direct deposit or check form once the member authorizes his/her Vacation Benefit Statement in late May. Online redemption requires members to have a personal carpdc.org account. Accounts are available to participants only. Refer to the FAQ above ↑ for directions on setting up a personal carpdc.org account.   Benefit Credits are purchased by signatory employers through the Carpenters' Estamp system. The Estamp system is an online benefit purchasing tool that allows employers to purchase member benefits weekly or monthly, based on their CBA with the Regional Council. Estamps may be purchased in any hourly increment, by hour or partial hour, depending on which version of the Estamp system the employer uses.   It is always important for members to verify the amount of Estamps purchased on their behalf match the amount of hours worked to ensure proper health and welfare, pension and vacation credit is received. Members can verify their Estamps under the Vacation Redemption menu option while logged into their personal carpdc.org accounts.  



Where can I go to take my drug test?

All PCS Drug Screening locations and hours of operation can be found on carpdc.org here.
  If you received a notice that you are due for a Random or Renewal drug screen but cannot make it to one of the locations on our website referenced in the above link, please contact the Drug Testing Department at 314.644.4802 or Toll-Free at 877.232.3863, press 3 for assistance, as soon as possible. Our representatives will send you to a Quest Diagnostics or one of its affiliates near you for your convenience.

 Benefits  /  About










What are the Carpenters' Benefit Trust Funds? 
The Carpenters' Benefit Trust Funds consist of a Health and Welfare Fund, a Pension Fund, and a Vacation Fund. Each Trust Fund is a
not-for-profit organization under Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidelines. The purpose of each Fund is to provide specific benefits to eligible
members of the Carpenters' Union. As a not-for-profit Trust under federal law, all assets of the Funds must be used to provide those benefits.
  Who is in charge of administering the Benefit Trust Funds? 
Each Benefit Trust Fund is governed by a Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees is made up of one-half Employers and one-half Labor
Representatives. They are responsible for overseeing the financial strength of the plan, making sure the plan complies with all applicable laws and
regulations, and for determining the benefits available for eligible participants.
 
Carpenters' Benefit Funds Office is a member-service not-for-profit that administers multiple benefit plans for union carpenters and their families
in Southern Illinois, Missouri, and Kansas. While seeking to improve accessibility and quality of service, the Benefit Funds Office partners with
the union, employers, and members to provide life changing benefits.

CARPENTERS PENSION TRUST FUND OF ST LOUIS







CARPENTERS PENSION TRUST FUND OF ST LOUIS is a Defined Benefit Plan providing retirees with a predetermined monthly retirement benefit upon reaching a specific age. The retirement benefit paid to a retiree is typically calculated using a formula which often employs years of credited service under the plan and salary information. The retirement benefit is typically payable to the employee upon attainment of their normal retirement age for the remainder of his/her lifetime. Benefits under this type of plan are often referred to as accrued benefits. This type of plan does not maintain individual accounts for employees. 



It is important to remember that under this type of plan, the Alternate Payee is typically not awarded a lump sum cash payment from the Plan. It is usually a requirement of the Plan that the amount awarded to the Alternate Payee be expressed in terms of a monthly benefit payable for either the lifetime of the Participant or the Alternate Payee.
