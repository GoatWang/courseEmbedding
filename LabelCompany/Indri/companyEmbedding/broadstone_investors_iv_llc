Broadstone Net Lease



“Our consistent results are due in part to our selection of credit-worthy tenants with demonstrated operating history in businesses that are typically recession resistant.”
–Norm Leenhouts, Founder

Broadstone Net Lease is a private Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) that acquires and holds freestanding, single-tenant, net-leased properties. It is focused on generating predictable, tax-sheltered cash flow and attractive total return for Shareholders. The REIT is externally managed by Broadstone Real Estate, LLC, and has no direct employees.

Founded by the Leenhouts and Tait families, who previously founded Home Properties*, a multifamily apartment REIT which went public in 1994 and operated as such until the company’s acquisition for $7.6 billion in October, 2015, Broadstone Net Lease began admitting outside shareholders on December 31, 2007. Today, there are 2,000+ investors whose shares are collectively worth more than $1 billion, including the contribution of more than $95 million of properties to the REIT through UPREIT transactions. Since inception, share price has increased from $50 to $79, and distributions have grown from $3.50 to $4.98 per share.  Shares are offered via private placement, and new investors are accepted on a monthly basis.

Investor Information

Investment grade credit rating (Baa3 with stable outlook) from Moody’s
6.3% Annualized Distribution: monthly distribution fully covered by BNL’s current operations
Substantial tax sheltering of distributions for taxable investors; 1099 tax reporting

Monthly closings held for new and additional equity investments
More than $74.2 million of shares held by management team, Board of Directors, and Broadstone Real Estate; all invested on the same terms as other investors
Open to accredited individual and institutional investors
Fee Structure designed to be attractive to institutions, endowments, pension funds, family offices and high net worth individuals

Minimum initial investment (via financial advisor): $250,000
BNL is audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP

*Broadstone Real Estate, its principals and affiliated REITs are not currently affiliated with Home Properties






Investment Strategy
Broadstone Net Lease acquires freestanding, single-tenant properties triple-net leased to credit worthy tenants and brands.  The portfolio uses conservative leverage and is constructed of long-term leases with contractual rent increases to help withstand economic volatility.
Why triple-net leased properties?

High return relative to risk level assumed
Predictable returns due to tenant responsibilities and long term leases
Opportunity for growth in cash flow and valuation attributable to contractual rent increases
Ability to access favorable debt financing due to predictable cash flows
Growth in rent and ownership of real assets helps to hedge against inflation
Still a very fragmented industry and imperfect market, with opportunities for astute buyers
Opportunity to add value at time of acquisition through proper negotiation and underwriting

Portfolio & Acquisitions

May 2017 XBRL webinar series: IFRS requirements

Posted on May 10, 2017 | Leave a comment


Sign up below for our XBRL for IFRS webinars to learn about the taxonomy update, training tips, SEC deadlines, filing success plans and implementation options.

Details:
May 11, 11:00 AM EST – Education

Featuring: Gordon Ruckdeschel, VP Operations, Toppan Vite / Vintage
May 18, 3:00 PM EST – Create a Success Plan


Featuring: Rob Blake, VP Product Management at Certent, Inc.
May 25, 11:00 AM EST – Implementation

Featuring: Campbell Pryde, CEO at XBRL US, Inc.
*CPE Credit Available on May 25



May 11 Agenda & Discussion:  

WHY IS THE SEC ROLLING OUT XBRL TAGGING REQUIREMENTS FOR IFRS?
IFRS tagging requirements went into effect as part of the 2009 XBRL rule. However, these requirements could not be met until an IFRS taxonomy was offcially released on March 1, 2017.
WHEN DOES THE REQUIREMENT BEGIN?
Foreign private issuers submitting applicable forms with a period end date on or after December 15, 2017 will be required to include XBRL exhibits as part of the filing. This will include IFRS filers with the fiscal year end date of December 31st. Registrants may also voluntarily submit XBRL exhibits prior to this date, but that is not required.
HOW DO I GET MORE INFORMATION?
It’s not too early for foreign private issuers to begin educating themselves. We recommend leveraging our educational webinar series (register above) and building a milestone timeline with our XBRL subject-matter experts to ensure a successful XBRL filing period.
Download our FAQ resource guide to learn more about IFRS education.

SEC update: Required revisions to 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K cover pages

Posted on May 9, 2017 | Leave a comment



The SEC has adopted new rules that change the cover pages of Securities Act registration statements (Forms S-1, S-3, S-4, S-8, S-11, F-1, F-3 and F-4) and Exchange Act periodic reports (Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K), as well as Forms 10, 20-F and 40-F, to include new check boxes for a company to mark whether, at the time of filing, the company is an EGC and whether it has elected not to use the extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards.

What Should You Do?
All companies, EGCs or otherwise, should immediately contact their financial printing firm to revise their appropriate cover pages. Specialized printing companies employ experts in the ever-evolving rules from the SEC and other regulatory bodies, as well as EDGAR and XBRL, and can ensure a smooth adoption of any new requirements. These changes have come because the SEC has adopted technical amendments from the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 that impact forms filed under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. According to the new rules, companies must check boxes on the form covers to indicate whether or not they are emerging growth companies (EGCs), and if they are, whether they will comply with the financial accounting standards defined under the JOBS Act or will take advantage of the optional extended transition period before doing so.
Section 107 of the JOBS act allows an EGC to forego any or all of the disclosure exemptions. Any EGC that opts out of the extended transition period must make the SEC aware of this decision when first asked to file a periodic report, registration statement, or any other SEC report that falls under Section 13 of the Exchange Act. The new checkboxes on the listed forms serve as a standardized way to inform the SEC of a company’s status and choice (which, once made, is irrevocable) and can be found with checkboxes regarding a company’s status as accelerated filer. EGCs can be considered accelerated filers, non-accelerated filers, or smaller reporting companies, meaning these boxes should also be appropriately checked.
The final rule can be found here.
Securities Act Forms F-1, F-3, F-4, S-1, S-3, S-4, S-8 and S-11.

"Funded.com has been great and my project is in the final stages of being funded by an investor I found on here. I was surprized at the quick process and how fast investors funded my project. Website was a big help!"

Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again.

I am grateful I had the opportunity to access your network of investors. I am reasonably confident that the current negotiations with one of your investors will go through for our film production. I will be back for my next production.
