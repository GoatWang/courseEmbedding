I was the last one to marry into the family and I was blessed to have known "Pop". I got to hear his many stories about the war and learned a lot about my husband Ron.  I didn't realize Ron's passion for fishing came from Pop who took him fishing when he was a kid - something we now do as a couple. He was a wonderful man who will be greatly missed and his memory will live on.  Lisa and Ron

Air Medal
The Air Medal, established by Executive Order on 11 May 1942 and amended by Executive Order on 11 September 1942, is awarded to a person who, while serving with the United States Armed Forces, has distinguished himself or herself by meritorious achievement while participating in aerial flight. Awards may recognize single acts of heroism or merit, or may recognize sustained meritorious service over a period of six months or more. The Air Medal primarily recognizes personnel on flight status requiring frequent participation in aerial flight. It may be awarded to personnel not on flight status whose duties require frequent flight other than in a passenger status. The Air Medal ranks behind the Distinguished Flying Cross in order of precedence.

Frederick Boyle Named Chief Financial Officer For Pepco Holdings, Inc.






Business Wire




Mar 26, 2012 5:26 PM EDT













 




























































  Pepco Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: POM), announced the appointment today of Frederick J. Boyle as the Company’s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Boyle has nearly three decades of experience in the utility industry, having led financial departments for three electric industry corporations over the past decade. Mr. Boyle was most recently Chief Financial Officer of DPL Inc., holding company for Dayton Power and Light (DPL), an Ohio-based company that was named to the Forbes Platinum 400 “Best Big Companies in America” list during his tenure in 2009. In his CFO role at DPL, Mr. Boyle was responsible for all finance, accounting, treasury, planning and development activities for DPL.  Mr. Boyle will take over the post from current PHI CFO, Anthony J. Kamerick, who announced he will retire after 41 years with the Company. While Mr. Boyle will assume the role of financial lead for PHI, Mr. Kamerick will remain at PHI as Executive Vice President and Chief Regulatory Officer, and continue to oversee the regulatory proceedings of all three of PHI’s utility subsidiaries until his retirement in January 2013.  “We are pleased to welcome Fred to the executive leadership team as an experienced financial leader in the utility industry,” said Joseph M. Rigby, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of PHI. “His experience with both electric and natural gas energy combined with his financial acumen will make him an important addition to the team as we continue to serve our customers and deliver value to our shareholders. I am grateful for Tony Kamerick’s excellent tenure as our CFO, and I am pleased to retain him through the remainder of 2012 to ensure a smooth transition, and provide oversight to our regulatory process.”  Mr. Boyle’s extensive energy industry background includes regulated and non-regulated segments of the electric business as well as experience in the gas utility industry, all of which are components of the PHI business model. Prior to serving as Chief Financial Officer of DPL Inc., Mr. Boyle served as CFO of Accent Energy, a natural gas and electricity retail marketer, and as Vice President of Finance for Direct Energy, a large competitive retailer of energy and related services in North America. For 18 years, Mr. Boyle worked in financial and accounting roles at American Electric Power (AEP), one of the world’s largest energy companies, taking leadership roles in the areas of tax, corporate planning and budgeting, and corporate development with his most senior role as Vice President of Financial Services for the corporate development department. He began his career in accounting with Deloitte & Touche, and is a Certified Public Accountant.
