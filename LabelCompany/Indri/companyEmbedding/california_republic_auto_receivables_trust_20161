CERTIFICATION
 I, John Wilcox,
certify as of March�9, 2016 that:  1. I have reviewed the prospectus relating to�the Class�A-1, Class�A-2,
Class�A-3, Class�A-4, Class�B and Class�C Notes of California Republic Auto Receivables Trust 2016-1 (the �securities�) and am familiar with, in all material respects, the following:�The characteristics of the
securitized assets underlying the offering (the �securitized assets�), the structure of the securitization, and all material underlying transaction agreements as described in the prospectus; 
2. Based on my knowledge, the prospectus does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading;
 3. Based on my
knowledge, the prospectus and other information included in the registration statement of which it is a part fairly present, in all material respects, the characteristics of the securitized assets, the structure of the securitization and the risks
of ownership of the securities, including the risks relating to the securitized assets that would affect the cash flows available to service payments or distributions on the securities in accordance with their terms; and

4. Based on my knowledge, taking into account all material aspects of the characteristics of the securitized assets, the structure of the
securitization, and the related risks as described in the prospectus, there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the securitization is structured to produce, but is not guaranteed by this certification to produce, expected cash flows at times and
in amounts to service scheduled payments of interest and the ultimate repayment of principal on the securities (or other scheduled or required distributions on the securities, however denominated) in accordance with their terms as described in the
prospectus.
 The foregoing certifications are given subject to any and all defenses available to me under the federal securities laws,
including any and all defenses available to an executive officer that signed the registration statement of which the prospectus referred to in this certification is part

This RECEIVABLES PURCHASE AGREEMENT
(as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time
to time, this “Agreement”) is made as of March 1,
2016, between CALIFORNIA REPUBLIC BANK, a California corporation
(the “Seller”), and CALIFORNIA REPUBLIC FUNDING, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (the

WHEREAS, in the regular course of
its business, the Seller purchases from motor vehicle dealers motor
vehicle retail installment sale contracts and motor vehicle loans
secured by automobiles, sport utility vehicles, light duty trucks
or similar motor vehicles;

WHEREAS, the Purchaser desires to
purchase from the Seller certain such motor vehicle retail
installment sale contracts and motor vehicle loans (the
“Receivables”);

WHEREAS, the Seller is willing to
sell the Receivables to the Purchaser;

WHEREAS, the Seller is selling the
Receivables to the Purchaser, the Purchaser is buying the
Receivables for the purpose of selling them to California Republic
Auto Receivables Trust 2016-1, which will in turn issue notes and
certificates backed by the cash flow from those Receivables in a
transaction contemplated by the parties to this Agreement and the
other Basic Documents (as defined below) to be a
“securitization” as that term is defined in 12 CFR
§360.6 (the “FDIC Rule”); and

WHEREAS, the parties hereto wish to
set forth the terms pursuant to which the Receivables are to be
sold by the Seller to the Purchaser.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of

immediately prior to the transactions pursuant to the Indenture,
the Sale and Servicing Agreement and the Trust Agreement, the
Seller does hereby sell, transfer, assign, set over and otherwise
convey to the Purchaser, without recourse (subject to the
obligations herein), all of its right, title and interest in and to
the Conveyed Assets.

The sale, transfer, assignment,

obligation of the Seller to the Obligors, the Dealers or any other
Person in connection with the Receivables and the other assets and
properties conveyed hereunder or any agreement, document or
instrument related thereto.

It is the intention of the parties
hereto that, other than for federal, State and local income, single
