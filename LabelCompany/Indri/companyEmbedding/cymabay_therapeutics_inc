Profile
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and providing access to innovative therapies for patients with liver and other chronic diseases with high unmet medical need.
Seladelpar is a potent, selective, orally active PPARδ agonist currently in development for the treatment of patients with the autoimmune liver disease, primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and the epidemic in NonAlcoholic SteatoHepatitis (NASH). A Phase 2 study of seladelpar demonstrated clinical activity and established proof-of-concept in PBC.  We are now conducting a second Phase 2 study to support dose selection for Phase 3 development. Seladelpar has received an orphan designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) status from the European Medicines Agency.  Clinical development for NASH is currently being planned.
Arhalofenate is a potential urate-lowering anti-flare therapy for gout that is Phase 3 ready. In late 2016, Kowa Pharmaceuticals America, Inc. licensed U.S. rights for arhalofenate and is responsible for all development and commercialization costs in the U.S.  CymaBay retains full development and commercialization rights for outside the U.S. and intends to partner in those geographies.

Oppenheimer Bullish on Bank of America Corp (BAC), CymaBay Therapeutics Inc (CBAY) and TherapeuticsMD Inc (TXMD); Here’s Why
 
 Joe Rabin, Editor-July 19, 2017, 11:34 AM EDT

Bank of America: Net Interest Income is Only Half the Story
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) delivered better-than-expected second-quarter results, posting EPS of $0.46 compared to consensus estimate of $0.43. However, net interest income (NII) fell short of expectations, even in the face of rate hikes in March and June.
Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski points out that NII only tells half the story. The analyst highlights three primary influences which factor into the lack of a rise in NII: “(1) BAC sold its UK card business; (2) trading-related NII, which fluctuates considerably, was down $0.2B this quarter which offset a similar increase in consumer banking; and (3) the decline of LT rates during the quarter slightly pressures NIM.”
Overall, Kotowski do not implicate a slowdown. In fact, the analyst expects “the increase in core consumer NII to remain and grow with further rate increases, while the other two factors will likely fluctuate in both directions but overall likely remain steady.”
As such, Kotowski reiterates an Outperform rating on BAC and raised the target price from $29 to $30, noting, “BAC’s revenue growth story remains intact.” (To watch Kotowski’s track record, click here)
TipRanks analytics indicate BAC as a Strong Buy. Out of 10 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 7 are bullish, while 3 remain neutral. The consensus target price stands at $26.30, revealing a 10% upside from current levels.

CymaBay’s Seladelpar Drug Could Offer Big Advantages
CymaBay Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:CBAY) shares rallied nearly 16% yesterday, after the drug maker announced positive interim results from its ongoing low-dose Phase 2 study of seladelpar in patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), a life-threatening and life-limiting chronic cholestatic liver disease.
Analyst Jay Olson of Oppenheimer looked at how the news will affect the stock and even open the door for strategic partnerships in NASH where clinical studies will be larger and longer in duration. The results of the study found that both 5 and 10mg doses and were effective and that the drug is safe for consumption for patients suffering from PBC and NASH. Furthermore, the FDA removed barriers, which could have prevented further clinical development.
Olson noted “The AP reduction for the 10mg dose of seladelpar was still growing at week 12 suggesting a potential for further AP reduction with continued dosing. These AP reductions compare favorably with existing PBC treatments in our view”. The analysts view also falls in line with opinions from the medical field as well. Professor Gideon Hirschfield praised the preliminary findings stating: “We think that seladelpar could offer patients significant advantages over existing treatments.”
Perhaps most significant was the lack of safety concerns associated with the drug. Olson drew attention to the lack of “drug-induced pruritus or increased LDL-cholesterol… transaminases and LDL actually decreased suggesting additional efficacy.” When factored together with the success the 5mg dose (39%) and the 5mg dose (45%) we could see reductions in AP at week 12 from baseline levels. In Olson’s view “These AP reductions compare favorably with existing PBC treatments.”
The analyst maintains an Outperform rating for CBAY with an $8.00 price target, representing a 15% upside from current levels. (To watch Olson’s track record, click here)
TipRanks analytics indicate CBAY as a Strong Buy. Out of 3 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, all are bullish. The consensus target price stands at $8.83, revealing a 27% upside from current levels.

Optimism High for TherapeuticsMD’s TX-004HR Drug
It has been an eventful week for TherapeuticsMD Inc (NYSEMKT:TXMD) in regard to advancing approval on its new drug TX-004HR. The company received minutes from an FDA meeting on June 14th and filed additional information to which the FDA is expected to respond in the coming weeks. However, Oppenheimer’s Olson noted a curve ball, which was a bit unpredictable. An independent entity has sent a 93K-patient study abstract to the FDA with new unseen data. While no one knows for sure the content of the data, the analyst “suspects this new data is likely to support the safety of VVA estrogen products.” The analyst opines that this is connected with an NIH-sponsored observational trial “that is likely to report on long-term safety outcomes of VVA estrogen products.”
Olson also perceived this week’s regulatory update as “clear collaboration between TXMD and the FDA to achieve a common goal of delivering the safest and most effective VVA treatment to patients.” The analyst substantiated this claim by citing TXMD effort to “proactively cooperate by voluntarily abandoning the 25 mcg dose and drafting a post-approval safety study protocol.” Olson also pointed to the June update to the NAMS position statement as evidence of “growing support from the medical community”.
The analyst believes that the TX-004HR is on track and that he is “optimistic about TX-001HR based on REPLENISH, which showed positive efficacy results for the 2 higher doses combined with clean safety including no incidence of endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy.”
Although a bit conservative compared to the street, the analyst reiterates an Outperform rating for TXMD with a $10 price target representing a 90% upside from current levels.
TipRanks analytics indicate TXMD as a Strong Buy. Out of 5 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, all are bullish. The consensus target price stands at $19.50, revealing a 270% upside from current levels.

	CYMABAY ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER 2015 FINANCIAL RESULTS




	Conference Call Today, Monday, August 10 at 4:30pm Eastern Time




	NEWARK, CA

	 August 10, 2015CymaBay Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: CBAY), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapies
	to treat metabolic diseases with high unmet medical need, today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015.


	We
	continue to make significant progress with our arhalofenate and MBX-8025 clinical programs, said Harold Van Wart, President and Chief Executive Officer of CymaBay. The positive Phase 2 results we announced earlier in the year
	demonstrating arhalofenates potential use in combination with febuxostat were presented at the European Congress of Rheumatology (EULAR) in June. These data along with the positive results from our Phase 2b flare study demonstrate
	arhalofenates competitive target profile as a well tolerated, differentiated and convenient potential therapy for gout patients. We believe arhalofenate could define a new class of gout drugs that we refer to as Urate Lowering Anti-Flare
	Therapies (ULAFTs). We have begun preparations for our end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA that is scheduled for the third quarter.


	For MBX-8025,
	enrollment is progressing well in a Phase 2 study in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), continued Dr. Van Wart. We currently anticipate topline HoFH data by year-end. In addition, we are planning to initiate a Phase 2
	study with MBX-8025 in a second indication, primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), before year-end. Finally, we strengthened our balance sheet in July through a successful public offering of common stock which generated approximately $21.3 million in net
	proceeds.



	SECOND QUARTER 2015 AND RECENT CORPORATE HIGHLIGHTS



	 




	●


	Presented data from a Phase 2 study of arhalofenate in combination with febuxostat for the treatment of gout at the EULAR 2015 Annual Meeting.






	 





	¡


	 



	Data demonstrated the combination of arhalofenate with febuxostat provided robust, clinically meaningful lowering of serum uric acid in patients with gout






	 





	¡


	 



	Arhalofenate treatment increased the fractional excretion of uric acid (FEUA), which is often suppressed in gout, into the normal range






	●


	Received issuance of two new patents for arhalofenate that provide protection through 2032.






	 





	¡


	 



	Use of arhalofenate for treating gout flares including the prevention of flares while lowering serum uric acid






	 





	¡


	 



	Use of arhalofenate for treating hyperuricemia when used in combination with febuxostat






	●


	Initiated a Phase 2 study of MBX-8025 in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH).

	of 2014. The decrease in net loss was due in part to a non-cash gain of $5.3 million for the quarter compared to a non-cash gain of $2.8 million for the same period in 2014, from the mark to market valuation of the companys warrant liability.






	●


	At June 30, 2015, the company had cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments of approximately $27.0 million, as compared to approximately $34.8 million at December 31, 2014.

	the same period in 2014. The decrease in net loss was due in part to a non-cash gain of $9.9 million for the six month period compared to a non-cash loss of $2.0 million for the same period in 2014, from the mark to market valuation of the
	companys warrant liability.

	About CymaBay




	CymaBay Therapeutics, Inc. (CBAY) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapies to treat metabolic diseases with high unmet medical need,
	including serious rare and orphan disorders. Arhalofenate, the companys lead product candidate, has shown two therapeutic actions in a single drug in multiple Phase 2 gout studies. In gout patients, arhalofenate is intended to prevent painful
	flares in joints while at the same time promoting excretion of uric acid by the kidney, thereby addressing both the signs and symptoms of gout and the hyperuricemia that is the root cause of the disease. CymaBays second product candidate,
	MBX-8025 is a potent, selective, orally active PPAR

	d

	agonist. A Phase 2 study of MBX-8025 in patients with mixed dyslipidemia established that it has an anti-atherogenic lipid profile. CymaBay has
	initiated a pilot study of MBX-8025 in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
