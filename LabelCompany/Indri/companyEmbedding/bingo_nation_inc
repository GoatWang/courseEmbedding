Bingo Nation (OTC:BLTO) - The World's First and Only Publicly Traded Indian Gaming Company.












New, Super-Growth Company Bingo Nation (OTC: BLTO) Set to Deliver 1,344% Gains By Year's End: The World's First and Only Publicly Traded Indian Gaming Company



Shares Of Bingo Nation (OTC:BLTO) Could Rise 1,344% This Year As It Installs 3,000 Bingo Kiosks Across Tribal Lands -- Generating $30 Million Per Week In Revenue!


If you want to profit you NEED to take a look at this stock right now -- BEFORE it announces its next quarterly earnings statement!




Bingo Nation Inc.
OTC: BLTO

The house always wins.
That's why gambling companies are such safe bets. The gambling industry is projected to grow 5.7% a year through 2022 – to reach $635 billion.
To put that in perspective, if you created a country named "Casinoland" that got all of its GDP from gambling, and absolutely nothing else… it would be the 21st richest country in the world.
$635 billion is approximately the GDP of Saudi Arabia, and well north of Argentina, Sweden, Norway, or Austria.
But, as impressive as that is overall, Indian Gaming growth in particular puts that to shame. It's growing twice as fast as the industry as a whole… and Indian Gaming is now larger than Las Vegas and Atlantic City combined.

This isn't your grandfather's reservation casino. Today, Indian Gaming is big, big business. To the tune of $28.9 billion in 2014, and rising fast.
Until recently, though, there wasn't much you could do about it. Unless you were the elder of a Native American tribe, you were completely locked out of this rapidly expanding, wildly profitable industry.
Until recently -- being the key.
Today, there is one company -- Bingo Nation (OTC: BLTO), in existence for less than a year -- that gives you a direct in to the Native American gambling industry.

In fact, it's the only pure play in the market today. There is, simply put, nowhere else you can directly invest purely in Native American casinos.
That fact alone makes Bingo Nation one of the most promising young companies in the world. When there's only one way to invest in a massive, fast-growing industry, that play will eventually attract attention.

But what takes Bingo Nation from unique, solid choice to one of the hottest properties on the market are all the other advantages the company possesses.
Like the fact that Bingo Nation is revolutionizing the way gambling works… making it possible to entirely legally gamble on your phone, or in the comfort of your easychair in front of the TV.
Or that Bingo Nation is the first company that's bridging different casinos and tribes, tapping into the gambling action across dozens of sites. And, with exponentially-increasing takes, Bingo Nation is able to produce eye-popping jackpots like no other game.
Or that Bingo Nation has figured out a way to combine two games into one play -- doubling its opportunities to capture attention. And, not coincidentally, capturing a large and growing share of the younger gambling population.
It's little surprise, then, that Bingo Nation is projected to generate revenue that's 1,344% above its current market cap.
That means, if the price of the stock just kept up with revenue growth, it would increase 1,344% by the end of the year.
Of course, that's not how stock prices actually work. In actuality, market caps are almost always much larger than a year's revenue -- usually by orders of magnitude.
In other words, 1,344% growth in almost certainly too conservative an estimate. True growth will likely be multiples higher.
And it's all thanks to the revolutionary new platform and business model that Bingo Nation has invented -- which you'll learn more about in a moment.
But, perhaps even more impressive, is how incredibly safe this business model is.

But With Special Tax Breaks And Management Projecting $30,000,000 A Week In Revenue, Bingo Nation Could Put Other Gambling Stocks To SHAME!

The House's House
The House always wins, of course.
Except when it doesn't... because the truth of the matter is, every game in a casino is guaranteed to make money… but the whole casino isn't.
Because casinos have all sorts of extra expenses: they have to run hotels and restaurants at the same time -- often at steep discounts -- which are far from safe bets.
They also provide entertainment -- from magic acts like Penn and Teller, to music acts like Wayne Newton, to hosting fight nights. None of that is cheap.
And, of course, casinos are constantly competing against each other. As soon as a new one opens, an older one loses business.

That's why casinos aren't sure things. They shut down. They go bankrupt. (Just ask the current resident of the White House.)
But the companies that supply the games to casinos… that's another story.
Because the casino games themselves always win.

Just take a look at Scientific Gaming Industries (Nasdaq: SGMS) -- one of the stalwarts of the industry that manufactures slot machines. From its early stages -- when it was young, like Bingo Nation is today -- it returned 2,093% in a short stretch:
					




Or Galaxy Gaming Inc. (OTC: GLXZ), up 230% in the past five years:





Or Aristocrat Leisure (OTC: ARLUF), rallied over 1,344% since 2003:




The examples are endless. If you make the actual machines that casinos use, well, you basically have a license to print money. Heck – you even get to decide what frequency machines pay out at – meaning, you get to decide, ahead of time, just how much money you make!
But -- and this is key -- Bingo Nation (OTC: BLTO) is different. It's got an even rosier outlook.
And that's because -- unlike all the gaming manufacturer's above -- Bingo Nation isn't competing in an already-established field. It's introducing an entirely new type of action into Indian casinos. One that should prove even more lucrative than what's come before.
Gambling Stocks Have Delivered MASSIVE Profits Recently...

Scientific Games Corp (SGMS): Up 145% in one year
Galaxy Gaming Inc. (GLXZ): Up 167% in just 12 months
Boyd Gaming Corporation (BYD): Up a smoking hot 250%!




Could BLTO be...
Bingo Nation Inc.
(OTC: BLTO)
...the gambling stock to finally make YOU  rich?




The simplest way to describe Bingo Nation's product is: It's like a lottery.
Only it's so much more.
It's true -- the base game works similar to a state lottery.
It takes in money, gives out tickets -- in the form of bingo sheets -- and hands out a variety of prizes of varying size.
Bingo Nation machines can print out up to 100 million unique tickets each week. Think about that. That's up to $100 million in revenue, every week -- just on the main game.

Half the proceeds are handed out as winnings. The other half gets split between the casino and Bingo Nation.
In other words, if Bingo Nation sold 100 million tickets in a week, it would get to keep $12.5 million every week. As pure profit. And that's for a company that, at least at the time of writing, only has a $13 million market cap.
You're starting to see why Bingo Nation has the potential to blast 1,344% higher in short order.
But -- and this is key -- what you've heard about so far is only the beginning.


1.Like Powerball, But Better

You know when the nation starts paying attention to lottery jackpots, right?
When a Powerball jackpot starts getting huge. Usually, once it passes $100 million, people take notice.
And you get news stories of gas stations with lines out the door, with everyone and their mother lining up for a chance at that juicy jackpot.
The way Powerball jackpots get so large is by combining multiple states. You can't get that much money lined up only collecting in New Jersey… but if you add all of New England and the mid-atlantic states down to Georgia -- now you've got a Powerball jackpot!
And huge jackpots work. Because they grab everyone's attention.

Powerball jackpots have been a huge boon for state lotteries. They've increased interest, increased revenue.
What Powerball has never done is increase casino profits. Until today.
That's because Bingo Nation finally figured out how to create a Powerball-like system for casinos.
All of their machines -- across every casino -- are linked together for certain drawings, their "Powerball" drawings.
If someone wins the first one, great -- they get a huge payday.
But if a jackpot rolls over once… and then twice… well, it works just like it does in state lotteries. You get a feeding frenzy.
Only this frenzy isn't made up of hopeful citizens. You're dealing with folks who have come out specifically to gamble.



I have been following the progress of Bingo Nation for years. It creates the 'win win' opportunity for tribal enterprise, our investors and players alike. Just like Powerball did for its multi-state run lotteries.


But if you think this is the end of the story… just wait. It gets better.



2.Armchair Casino


Get this: Bingo Nation's users don't even have to be inside the casino to play.
Once they have their ticket, they can watch online, or on TV, for the weekly drawings.
That's right -- Bingo Nation has brought legal gambling to your living room.
In fact, you don't even have to go into the casino at any point. You can just give your player's card to someone else, who can place your bet for you.
This is, to put it succinctly, a game-changer. It might be the most revolutionary innovation to hit casinos since there have been casinos. This marks a potentially drastic increase in players… and gaming revenue.
But, if you think Bingo Nation is resting on its laurels, think yet again.

3.Drawing In The Next Generation

The biggest problem casinos face is demographics: Millennials.
The people who frequent casinos get older and older… but, in order to make a good business, game makers need to captivate the next generation.
So far, no one has figured it out. Except Bingo Nation.
In addition to its bingo lottery games -- which appeal to an older generation -- Bingo Nation has a second, hybrid way to play.
Think of it as a lottery with an instant payoff, like a scratch ticket. And this form of gambling has proven very popular with younger players.
In addition, Bingo Nation is developing mobile app games for later this year. They'll be available on both Android and iPhone, and they're free to play.

These apps are going to get more players familiar with the games -- an important barrier to lots of potential customers. If they can get to know the game safely, for free, in private, they're much more likely to give it a shot in public.
But -- perhaps even more importantly -- these apps will work as a cheap, accurate form of research and development. Bingo Nation can try out tweaks -- or entirely new games -- with no risk, and see if the public has an appetite for them.
If so, they can put them on casino floors. And if a game is a flop, the company didn't have to spend hundreds of thousands, or millions of dollars developing it.
Free apps like this are the wave of the future. It's easy to imagine an upcoming time, of looser restrictions and regulations, when brick-and-mortar casinos go away and apps like these take over all gambling.
That's a far-off vision for now, but Bingo Nation is already thinking ahead. And, with the incredible, powerful market research these apps can provide today, they're a no-brainer.
The only surprising thing is that more companies haven't done this already.




Bingo for the Hi-Tech Generation: Why Bingo Nation Is the Future of Gaming




Bingo Nation is much more than a stock that promises massive returns for early investors.




It's also a high tech company set to disrupt the entire gaming industry.




Bingo Nation has developed a series of patent-pending gaming technologies, including self-serve kiosks, player cards, and a mobile app that lets players check their stats on their phone.
All of Bingo Nation's patents have been inspected and approved by Gaming Laboratories International, the world’s leading electronic games testing organization.

What does that mean for investors?
That all of Bingo Nation's gaming technologies are ready to go to market and start pumping out profits.

4.The Only Game In Town

Don't forget, Bingo Nation is exclusively catering to Indian casinos. For good reason -- they make up the largest gambling segment in America.
Yet there is almost no way to invest in them. You can't own parts of the casinos. And the very few publicly-traded companies that supply Indian casinos do so as a small part of a larger business.
The only way to get a piece of this $28.9 billion industry is through Bingo Nation (OTC: BLTO). It's got all the tools in place, and the right people running the company.
And there's no better time to get in than right now.




This Is Your Moment.

Why now? Simple -- Bingo Nation has only been around a short while – so it's still cheap.

In January 2017, Bingo Nation received its certification from Gaming Laboratories International (GLI). That's the governing body that decides what companies can install gambling hardware and software on casino floors.
In other words, only this January, the key went in the ignition and the motor started running.
Already, machines are being installed across the nation. And, as more and more casinos see the potent combination of "Powerball" style jackpots, play-at-home potential, along with hybrid lottery and instant games, the steady drumbeat of orders will turn into an avalanche.
And all of this is before the apps are released this summer... introducing an entirely new audience -- and generation -- to Bingo Nation games.
In other words, the stock is cheap today because there isn't even a single quarter's worth of profits to talk about yet.
But that won't be true in three months. And it certainly won't be true in six months.

Bingo Nation is planning a 3,000-kiosk rollout in 2017. And up to an average of $30 million in ticket sales every week.
That's equal to $3.75 million in ticket profits every week to Bingo Nation. Some of that will be eaten up by initial outlays for the kiosks and development – but there's no doubt, that's serious money for a company with a tiny $13.5 million market cap.
Simply put, the cap can't stay this low for long. As 2017 witnesses the burgeoning success of Bingo Nation, investors are going to come rolling in. A company that can bring in $195 million in revenue in its first full year can easily justify a market cap of over $1 billion. With the astonishing growth such a situation implies, $1 billion is probably too cheap a price!

But there's no need to be greedy. We can build in some unforeseen bumps… a misfortune or two… and say that a mere 1,344% increase is enough to hope for.
That would just mean a $195 million market cap. That would just equal revenue. That would still be an insanely cheap stock.
But it would be an insanely great investment at today's valuations. Before Bingo Nation becomes buzzworthy throughout the $28.9 billion Indian casino industry, you want to get in. This is still a ground-floor opportunity.
By the second half of 2017, the big money will likely already have been made.
If you're looking for meaningful profit in your investment portfolio, you NEED to research Bing Nation (OTC: BLTO) today.

The Dow Jones U.S. Gambling industry index rose 40% in 2016 -- easily beating the overall stock market's return of 20.8%. If you had invested $100,000 in the gambling index on January 3, 2016, you would made made a cool $40,000 in just 12 months.
And if you had invested the same amount in the biggest gainers in the industry, you'd have made a mind-blowing $167,000.
That destroys the $20,770 you'd have earned investing in the Dow.
But there is one stock that promises to deliver even bigger returns than these.
A stock that could blow the Dow out of the water by 10x.
A stock that that inject a quick $50,000, or even $100,000 into your brokerage account if you get in early.
A stock with so much upside potential, it could easily be the biggest gainer of 2017.

OTC: BLTO

Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related ETFs Find exchange traded funds (ETFs) whose sector aligns with the same commodity grouping as the symbol you are viewing.
