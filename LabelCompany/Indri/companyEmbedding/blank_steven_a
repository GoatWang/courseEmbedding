Early life[edit]
Blank was born to immigrant parents who ran a grocery in the Chelsea neighborhood in New York City.[12] He grew up with a sister who was 12 years older than him and both siblings were raised by his mother after his father left home when he was aged 6.[12] His parents had never been to college (has father dropped out in 8th grade) but hoped he would.[13] He attended the University of Michigan, but dropped out after one semester.[12][13][14]
From Michigan, Blank hitchhiked to Miami, where he found work at the Miami International Airport, loading racehorses onto aircraft.[12][13] At the airport, Blank developed an interest in avionics. He realized the only way to learn more was to join the Air Force.[13]
His military career took him to Thailand during the Vietnam War, where he was managing a team of 15 electronics technicians within a year and a half.[12][13] He was 20 years old.[13]
After leaving the military, Blank moved to Palo Alto, a town in an area which would ultimately become known as Silicon Valley.[13]
Startup career[edit]
Steve Blank arrived in Silicon Valley at the start of the business boom in 1978.[4][11] His first job in the region was with ESL, a startup that was a pioneering company for National Reconnaissance.[14] The company helped the government understand the Soviets' technological and arms developments during the Cold War.[14]
During his 21-year career as an entrepreneur, Blank went on to found or work with a wide range of high-tech companies.[15] Four of his companies went public.[12] Some of his ventures include Zilog and MIPS Computers, Convergent Technologies, Ardent, SuperMac Technologies, ESL and Rocket Science Games.[7][15]
Blank co-founded his 8th and last startup, the Customer Relationship Management provider E.piphany, in 1996 and retired the day before its IPO in September 1999.[2][4][16][17] Notable members of the company include Roger Siboni and Karen Richardson.[18][19]
Blank has since served on the boards of the public entities Macrovision/Rovi and Immersion as well as several private companies. He continues to invest in and advise Silicon Valley startups including Machine Intelligence companies Geometric (acquired by Uber) and Deepscale .[20]
Customer Development Methodology[edit]
Blank created the Customer Development methodology in the mid 1990s.[14] The concept details a scientific approach that can be applied by startups and entrepreneurs to improve their products success by developing a better understanding of customers’ problems/needs as well as the other hypotheses necessary to build a commercial successful company.[2][4][14]
Lean Startup Movement[edit]
Blank's Customer Development methodology is a cornerstone of the Lean Startup Movement, popularized by Eric Ries[21][22] whom Blank states was “the best student I ever had.”[4] The Lean Startup approach relies on validated learning, scientific experimentation, and iterative product releases to shorten product development cycles, measure progress, and gain valuable customer feedback. Blank and Ries developed the ideas beginning around 2004 when Blank was an investor and advisor to the company, IMVU, that Ries co-founded.[23] The Lean Startup has been adopted by entrepreneurs worldwide as a constructive way to try out ideas and gain customers.[2] Ries has integrated the Customer Development methodology into the Lean Startup practices and considers it to be one of the Lean Startup Movement's pillars.[24][25][26]
Academic teaching career[edit]
Blank began teaching entrepreneurship in 2002 at UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business and has since taught entrepreneurship to both undergraduate and graduate students. He currently teaches at Stanford, the University of California Berkeley Haas School of Business, New York University and Columbia.[7][8][27] His Lean LaunchPad curricula uses the Customer Development methodology and Lean Startup methods he developed throughout his career as a serial entrepreneur and academic.[12]
The Lean LaunchPad[edit]
In January 2011, Blank created the Lean LaunchPad class at Stanford University and UC Berkeley. The class is a scientific method for teaching entrepreneurship that combines experiential learning with the three building blocks of a successful Lean Startup: Alexander Osterwalder's "Business Model Canvas,"[28][29] Blank's "Customer Development Model,[30] and Agile Engineering.
The Lean LaunchPad changed the way entrepreneurship is taught.[31] Instead of relying on the traditional business school practice of teaching students how to write a standard corporate business plan, or simply build a product, the course provides hands-on experience in what it takes to start a company.
Students propose and immediately test business hypotheses. They get out of the building to talk to 10-15 prospective customers, partners and others each week. They use the customer feedback acquired in these interviews to refine their product or service by building a new minimal viable product weekly; ensure their product or service meets a customer need or solves a customer problem; and validate that they have created a repeatable, scalable business model.
Since its inception, Blank’s course has been adopted by more than 100 universities worldwide, and more than 300,000 people have taken a free online version of the class at Udacity.com.[32]
The National Science Foundation Innovation Corps[edit]
In July 2011 the National Science Foundation asked Blank to adapt his Lean LaunchPad class for its Innovation Corps (I-Corps), which develops and nurtures a national innovation ecosystem by helping discoveries from fundamental research to become new companies.
The course is now the standard for science commercialization, serving as the syllabus of the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps (I-Corps) that is taught in 53 universities and has been adopted by the other federal research agencies (NIH, DOE, HHS, NSA);[33] and is helping to drive innovation within the U.S. government, particularly within the defense and intelligence community.
Following a successful pilot, the I-Corps program quickly expanded. A version of the I-Corps program specifically dedicated to biomedical research, called The I-Corps at NIH, was devised in 2014. As of January 2017, I-Corps has a National Innovation Network of more than 190 colleges and universities, and more than 800 teams of scientists and engineers have gone through the program.[1][4][3][33]
Hacking for Defense and Hacking for Diplomacy[edit]
Hacking for Defense and Hacking for Diplomacy are courses created at Stanford in 2016 that use Blank’s Lean LaunchPad curriculum to address national defense and foreign policy challenges while offering a new platform for completing national service.
Hacking for Defense connects the Silicon Valley innovation mindset with islands of innovation inside the U.S. Department of Defense and intelligence community. Student teams work with DOD and intelligence sponsors, using Lean Startup methods and Blank’s Lean LaunchPad curriculum to address real-world national security problems.
Hacking for Defense immediately began to scale after its pilot in spring 2016. In 2017, it will be taught in more than 15 other universities across the country, providing solutions to hundreds of critical national security problems annually.
The pilot Hacking for Diplomacy class wrapped up at Stanford in December. In it, student teams work with State Department sponsors, using Lean Startup methods to address critical foreign policy challenges.[32][34][35]
Awards and honors[edit]
In 2009, Blank won the Stanford University Undergraduate Teaching Award in Management Science and Engineering.[5] That same year he was also named one of the Top 10 Influencers in Silicon Valley by the Silicon Valley Mercury News.[36] In 2010, Blank was a recipient of the Earl F. Cheit Outstanding Teaching Award at U.C. Berkeley Haas School of Business.
In 2012 The Harvard Business Review named him one of 12 Masters of Innovation and CNBC recognized him as one of the "11 Notable Entrepreneurs Teaching the Next Generation."[37][38]
He was named Senior Fellow for Entrepreneurship at Columbia University in 2015 and was recognized by The Thinkers50 global ranking of management thinkers. Blank is an infrequent speaker at conferences and entrepreneurial events but has given commencement speeches at Philadelphia University in 2011, the University of Minnesota in 2013, ESADE Business School in 2014, and at NYU in 2016. NPR ranked his Philadelphia University commencement speech as one of the best in the last 325 years.
Publications[edit]
The Four Steps to the Epiphany[edit]
In 2005, Blank published The Four Steps to the Epiphany: Successful Strategies for Products that Win, (K&S Ranch Press) which details his approach to the Customer Development process.[11] In the book, Blank outlines his views about how entrepreneurship is a practice that can be actively managed rather than an art which must be passively experienced.[14] The book is viewed in entrepreneurship circles as the definitive source on the Customer Development methodology.[14]
Not All Who Wander Are Lost[edit]
Blank released a second book in 2010, Not All Who Wander Are Lost which relates stories from his life as an entrepreneur.[11] The collection of material develops a narrative about how to live life amid the fast-paced world of Silicon Valley startups.[39]
The Startup Owner's Manual[edit]
Steve Blank and Bob Dorf co-authored The Startup Owner's Manual, which was released in March 2012.[40][41] The 608-page reference manual details a scientific approach to entrepreneurship and emphasizes the importance of "rigorous and repeated testing."[10][12] The work draws on ideas from The Business Model Generation and The Four Steps to the Epiphany.[10] According to Blank, the book was designed to be used as an "encyclopedia and a blueprint" for startups.[42]
Holding a Cat by the Tail[edit]
Blank released Holding a Cat by the Tail in 2014. The book is updated version of Not All Those Who Wander Are Lost, featuring additional lessons learned from his life as an entrepreneur.
Blog[edit]
Blank authors a blog about entrepreneurship.[6] In 2012, his blog was ranked one of the "10 Must-Read Blogs for Any Lean Startup" by Welovelean.com.[43] The blog is considered a must-read for entrepreneurs and is often syndicated by UC Berkeley, VentureBeat, Huffington Post, Forbes, Inc.com and NikkeiBP in Japan. It is available as an audio podcast (produced by Clearshore and featuring the voice of HP Lewis) on the blog itself or through SoundCloud, and translated into Spanish (by Alberto Peralta).[5][42][44]
Public service[edit]
Blank was a past Chairman of Audubon California and[15] has also served on the board of the Peninsula Open Space Trust[45] and was a trustee of U.C. Santa Cruz foundation and served on the board of the California League of Conservation Voters.[46] In 2007 he was appointed to the California Coastal Commission.[47] He has made philanthropic gifts to preserve the California Coast and has contributed funds to support the visitors' center at Año Nuevo State Reserve and to the Peninsula Open Space Trust.[4][45]
Reception[edit]
Blank is known amongst entrepreneurs and students as one of the "The Godfathers of Silicon Valley".[42] His books, blog, and interviews are often referred to or featured in world news publications such as Reuters, the New York Times, Forbes, Inc, TechCrunch and The Wall Street Journal.[1][2][6][12][42][48] Blank has hosted numerous sold-out speaking events and conferences about entrepreneurship and the Customer Development methodology.[49][50][50][51][52]

Known for
The Customer Development Methodology


Steve Blank (born 1953) is a Silicon Valley serial-entrepreneur and academician who is based in Pescadero, California.[1]
Blank is recognized for developing the Customer Development method that launched the Lean Startup movement, a methodology which recognized that startups are not smaller versions of large companies, but require their own set of processes and tools to be successful.[2] His May 2013 cover story in the Harvard Business Review, “Why the Lean Startup Changes Everything,” defined the Lean Startup movement.[3] His Lean Launchpad class (taught as the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps) has become the standard for commercialization for all federal research.[1]
Blank has spent over 30 years within the high technology industry, founding or working within eight startup companies, four of which have gone public.[4][5] He is the co-founder of E.piphany.[4][6][5]
Retired since 1999, Blank writes and teaches about Customer Development and the Lean Startup method. He is an adjunct professor of entrepreneurship at Stanford;[7][8] lectures at the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business, and is a senior fellow at Columbia University,[9] and New York University; is a prolific blogger and public speaker; and has written four books: The Four Steps to the Epiphany, Not All Those Who Wander Are Lost, The Startup Owner's Manual and Holding a Cat by the Tail.[10][11]
Blank’s Google Tech talk, "The Secret History of Silicon Valley," offers a widely regarded insider's perspective on the emergence of Silicon Valley's startup ecosystem.

Early life[edit]
Blank was born to immigrant parents who ran a grocery in the Chelsea neighborhood in New York City.[12] He grew up with a sister who was 12 years older than him and both siblings were raised by his mother after his father left home when he was aged 6.[12] His parents had never been to college (has father dropped out in 8th grade) but hoped he would.[13] He attended the University of Michigan, but dropped out after one semester.[12][13][14]
From Michigan, Blank hitchhiked to Miami, where he found work at the Miami International Airport, loading racehorses onto aircraft.[12][13] At the airport, Blank developed an interest in avionics. He realized the only way to learn more was to join the Air Force.[13]
His military career took him to Thailand during the Vietnam War, where he was managing a team of 15 electronics technicians within a year and a half.[12][13] He was 20 years old.[13]
After leaving the military, Blank moved to Palo Alto, a town in an area which would ultimately become known as Silicon Valley.[13]
Startup career[edit]
Steve Blank arrived in Silicon Valley at the start of the business boom in 1978.[4][11] His first job in the region was with ESL, a startup that was a pioneering company for National Reconnaissance.[14] The company helped the government understand the Soviets' technological and arms developments during the Cold War.[14]
During his 21-year career as an entrepreneur, Blank went on to found or work with a wide range of high-tech companies.[15] Four of his companies went public.[12] Some of his ventures include Zilog and MIPS Computers, Convergent Technologies, Ardent, SuperMac Technologies, ESL and Rocket Science Games.[7][15]
Blank co-founded his 8th and last startup, the Customer Relationship Management provider E.piphany, in 1996 and retired the day before its IPO in September 1999.[2][4][16][17] Notable members of the company include Roger Siboni and Karen Richardson.[18][19]
Blank has since served on the boards of the public entities Macrovision/Rovi and Immersion as well as several private companies. He continues to invest in and advise Silicon Valley startups including Machine Intelligence companies Geometric (acquired by Uber) and Deepscale .[20]
Customer Development Methodology[edit]
Blank created the Customer Development methodology in the mid 1990s.[14] The concept details a scientific approach that can be applied by startups and entrepreneurs to improve their products success by developing a better understanding of customers’ problems/needs as well as the other hypotheses necessary to build a commercial successful company.[2][4][14]
Lean Startup Movement[edit]
Blank's Customer Development methodology is a cornerstone of the Lean Startup Movement, popularized by Eric Ries[21][22] whom Blank states was “the best student I ever had.”[4] The Lean Startup approach relies on validated learning, scientific experimentation, and iterative product releases to shorten product development cycles, measure progress, and gain valuable customer feedback. Blank and Ries developed the ideas beginning around 2004 when Blank was an investor and advisor to the company, IMVU, that Ries co-founded.[23] The Lean Startup has been adopted by entrepreneurs worldwide as a constructive way to try out ideas and gain customers.[2] Ries has integrated the Customer Development methodology into the Lean Startup practices and considers it to be one of the Lean Startup Movement's pillars.[24][25][26]
Academic teaching career[edit]
Blank began teaching entrepreneurship in 2002 at UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business and has since taught entrepreneurship to both undergraduate and graduate students. He currently teaches at Stanford, the University of California Berkeley Haas School of Business, New York University and Columbia.[7][8][27] His Lean LaunchPad curricula uses the Customer Development methodology and Lean Startup methods he developed throughout his career as a serial entrepreneur and academic.[12]
The Lean LaunchPad[edit]
In January 2011, Blank created the Lean LaunchPad class at Stanford University and UC Berkeley. The class is a scientific method for teaching entrepreneurship that combines experiential learning with the three building blocks of a successful Lean Startup: Alexander Osterwalder's "Business Model Canvas,"[28][29] Blank's "Customer Development Model,[30] and Agile Engineering.
The Lean LaunchPad changed the way entrepreneurship is taught.[31] Instead of relying on the traditional business school practice of teaching students how to write a standard corporate business plan, or simply build a product, the course provides hands-on experience in what it takes to start a company.
Students propose and immediately test business hypotheses. They get out of the building to talk to 10-15 prospective customers, partners and others each week. They use the customer feedback acquired in these interviews to refine their product or service by building a new minimal viable product weekly; ensure their product or service meets a customer need or solves a customer problem; and validate that they have created a repeatable, scalable business model.
Since its inception, Blank’s course has been adopted by more than 100 universities worldwide, and more than 300,000 people have taken a free online version of the class at Udacity.com.[32]
The National Science Foundation Innovation Corps[edit]
In July 2011 the National Science Foundation asked Blank to adapt his Lean LaunchPad class for its Innovation Corps (I-Corps), which develops and nurtures a national innovation ecosystem by helping discoveries from fundamental research to become new companies.
The course is now the standard for science commercialization, serving as the syllabus of the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps (I-Corps) that is taught in 53 universities and has been adopted by the other federal research agencies (NIH, DOE, HHS, NSA);[33] and is helping to drive innovation within the U.S. government, particularly within the defense and intelligence community.
Following a successful pilot, the I-Corps program quickly expanded. A version of the I-Corps program specifically dedicated to biomedical research, called The I-Corps at NIH, was devised in 2014. As of January 2017, I-Corps has a National Innovation Network of more than 190 colleges and universities, and more than 800 teams of scientists and engineers have gone through the program.[1][4][3][33]
Hacking for Defense and Hacking for Diplomacy[edit]
Hacking for Defense and Hacking for Diplomacy are courses created at Stanford in 2016 that use Blank’s Lean LaunchPad curriculum to address national defense and foreign policy challenges while offering a new platform for completing national service.
Hacking for Defense connects the Silicon Valley innovation mindset with islands of innovation inside the U.S. Department of Defense and intelligence community. Student teams work with DOD and intelligence sponsors, using Lean Startup methods and Blank’s Lean LaunchPad curriculum to address real-world national security problems.
Hacking for Defense immediately began to scale after its pilot in spring 2016. In 2017, it will be taught in more than 15 other universities across the country, providing solutions to hundreds of critical national security problems annually.
The pilot Hacking for Diplomacy class wrapped up at Stanford in December. In it, student teams work with State Department sponsors, using Lean Startup methods to address critical foreign policy challenges.[32][34][35]

Cheit Outstanding Teaching Award at U.C. Berkeley Haas School of Business.

Early life[edit]
Blank was born to immigrant parents who ran a grocery in the Chelsea neighborhood in New York City.[12] He grew up with a sister who was 12 years older than him and both siblings were raised by his mother after his father left home when he was aged 6.[12] His parents had never been to college (has father dropped out in 8th grade) but hoped he would.[13] He attended the University of Michigan, but dropped out after one semester.[12][13][14]
From Michigan, Blank hitchhiked to Miami, where he found work at the Miami International Airport, loading racehorses onto aircraft.[12][13] At the airport, Blank developed an interest in avionics. He realized the only way to learn more was to join the Air Force.[13]
His military career took him to Thailand during the Vietnam War, where he was managing a team of 15 electronics technicians within a year and a half.[12][13] He was 20 years old.[13]
After leaving the military, Blank moved to Palo Alto, a town in an area which would ultimately become known as Silicon Valley.[13]
Startup career[edit]
Steve Blank arrived in Silicon Valley at the start of the business boom in 1978.[4][11] His first job in the region was with ESL, a startup that was a pioneering company for National Reconnaissance.[14] The company helped the government understand the Soviets' technological and arms developments during the Cold War.[14]
During his 21-year career as an entrepreneur, Blank went on to found or work with a wide range of high-tech companies.[15] Four of his companies went public.[12] Some of his ventures include Zilog and MIPS Computers, Convergent Technologies, Ardent, SuperMac Technologies, ESL and Rocket Science Games.[7][15]
Blank co-founded his 8th and last startup, the Customer Relationship Management provider E.piphany, in 1996 and retired the day before its IPO in September 1999.[2][4][16][17] Notable members of the company include Roger Siboni and Karen Richardson.[18][19]
Blank has since served on the boards of the public entities Macrovision/Rovi and Immersion as well as several private companies. He continues to invest in and advise Silicon Valley startups including Machine Intelligence companies Geometric (acquired by Uber) and Deepscale .[20]
Customer Development Methodology[edit]
Blank created the Customer Development methodology in the mid 1990s.[14] The concept details a scientific approach that can be applied by startups and entrepreneurs to improve their products success by developing a better understanding of customers’ problems/needs as well as the other hypotheses necessary to build a commercial successful company.[2][4][14]
Lean Startup Movement[edit]
Blank's Customer Development methodology is a cornerstone of the Lean Startup Movement, popularized by Eric Ries[21][22] whom Blank states was “the best student I ever had.”[4] The Lean Startup approach relies on validated learning, scientific experimentation, and iterative product releases to shorten product development cycles, measure progress, and gain valuable customer feedback. Blank and Ries developed the ideas beginning around 2004 when Blank was an investor and advisor to the company, IMVU, that Ries co-founded.[23] The Lean Startup has been adopted by entrepreneurs worldwide as a constructive way to try out ideas and gain customers.[2] Ries has integrated the Customer Development methodology into the Lean Startup practices and considers it to be one of the Lean Startup Movement's pillars.[24][25][26]
Academic teaching career[edit]
Blank began teaching entrepreneurship in 2002 at UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business and has since taught entrepreneurship to both undergraduate and graduate students. He currently teaches at Stanford, the University of California Berkeley Haas School of Business, New York University and Columbia.[7][8][27] His Lean LaunchPad curricula uses the Customer Development methodology and Lean Startup methods he developed throughout his career as a serial entrepreneur and academic.[12]
The Lean LaunchPad[edit]
In January 2011, Blank created the Lean LaunchPad class at Stanford University and UC Berkeley. The class is a scientific method for teaching entrepreneurship that combines experiential learning with the three building blocks of a successful Lean Startup: Alexander Osterwalder's "Business Model Canvas,"[28][29] Blank's "Customer Development Model,[30] and Agile Engineering.
The Lean LaunchPad changed the way entrepreneurship is taught.[31] Instead of relying on the traditional business school practice of teaching students how to write a standard corporate business plan, or simply build a product, the course provides hands-on experience in what it takes to start a company.
Students propose and immediately test business hypotheses. They get out of the building to talk to 10-15 prospective customers, partners and others each week. They use the customer feedback acquired in these interviews to refine their product or service by building a new minimal viable product weekly; ensure their product or service meets a customer need or solves a customer problem; and validate that they have created a repeatable, scalable business model.
Since its inception, Blank’s course has been adopted by more than 100 universities worldwide, and more than 300,000 people have taken a free online version of the class at Udacity.com.[32]
The National Science Foundation Innovation Corps[edit]
In July 2011 the National Science Foundation asked Blank to adapt his Lean LaunchPad class for its Innovation Corps (I-Corps), which develops and nurtures a national innovation ecosystem by helping discoveries from fundamental research to become new companies.
The course is now the standard for science commercialization, serving as the syllabus of the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps (I-Corps) that is taught in 53 universities and has been adopted by the other federal research agencies (NIH, DOE, HHS, NSA);[33] and is helping to drive innovation within the U.S. government, particularly within the defense and intelligence community.
Following a successful pilot, the I-Corps program quickly expanded. A version of the I-Corps program specifically dedicated to biomedical research, called The I-Corps at NIH, was devised in 2014. As of January 2017, I-Corps has a National Innovation Network of more than 190 colleges and universities, and more than 800 teams of scientists and engineers have gone through the program.[1][4][3][33]
Hacking for Defense and Hacking for Diplomacy[edit]
Hacking for Defense and Hacking for Diplomacy are courses created at Stanford in 2016 that use Blank’s Lean LaunchPad curriculum to address national defense and foreign policy challenges while offering a new platform for completing national service.
Hacking for Defense connects the Silicon Valley innovation mindset with islands of innovation inside the U.S. Department of Defense and intelligence community. Student teams work with DOD and intelligence sponsors, using Lean Startup methods and Blank’s Lean LaunchPad curriculum to address real-world national security problems.
Hacking for Defense immediately began to scale after its pilot in spring 2016. In 2017, it will be taught in more than 15 other universities across the country, providing solutions to hundreds of critical national security problems annually.
The pilot Hacking for Diplomacy class wrapped up at Stanford in December. In it, student teams work with State Department sponsors, using Lean Startup methods to address critical foreign policy challenges.[32][34][35]
Awards and honors[edit]
In 2009, Blank won the Stanford University Undergraduate Teaching Award in Management Science and Engineering.[5] That same year he was also named one of the Top 10 Influencers in Silicon Valley by the Silicon Valley Mercury News.[36] In 2010, Blank was a recipient of the Earl F. Cheit Outstanding Teaching Award at U.C. Berkeley Haas School of Business.
In 2012 The Harvard Business Review named him one of 12 Masters of Innovation and CNBC recognized him as one of the "11 Notable Entrepreneurs Teaching the Next Generation."[37][38]
He was named Senior Fellow for Entrepreneurship at Columbia University in 2015 and was recognized by The Thinkers50 global ranking of management thinkers. Blank is an infrequent speaker at conferences and entrepreneurial events but has given commencement speeches at Philadelphia University in 2011, the University of Minnesota in 2013, ESADE Business School in 2014, and at NYU in 2016. NPR ranked his Philadelphia University commencement speech as one of the best in the last 325 years.
Publications[edit]
The Four Steps to the Epiphany[edit]
In 2005, Blank published The Four Steps to the Epiphany: Successful Strategies for Products that Win, (K&S Ranch Press) which details his approach to the Customer Development process.[11] In the book, Blank outlines his views about how entrepreneurship is a practice that can be actively managed rather than an art which must be passively experienced.[14] The book is viewed in entrepreneurship circles as the definitive source on the Customer Development methodology.[14]
Not All Who Wander Are Lost[edit]
Blank released a second book in 2010, Not All Who Wander Are Lost which relates stories from his life as an entrepreneur.[11] The collection of material develops a narrative about how to live life amid the fast-paced world of Silicon Valley startups.[39]
The Startup Owner's Manual[edit]
Steve Blank and Bob Dorf co-authored The Startup Owner's Manual, which was released in March 2012.[40][41] The 608-page reference manual details a scientific approach to entrepreneurship and emphasizes the importance of "rigorous and repeated testing."[10][12] The work draws on ideas from The Business Model Generation and The Four Steps to the Epiphany.[10] According to Blank, the book was designed to be used as an "encyclopedia and a blueprint" for startups.[42]
Holding a Cat by the Tail[edit]
Blank released Holding a Cat by the Tail in 2014. The book is updated version of Not All Those Who Wander Are Lost, featuring additional lessons learned from his life as an entrepreneur.
Blog[edit]
Blank authors a blog about entrepreneurship.[6] In 2012, his blog was ranked one of the "10 Must-Read Blogs for Any Lean Startup" by Welovelean.com.[43] The blog is considered a must-read for entrepreneurs and is often syndicated by UC Berkeley, VentureBeat, Huffington Post, Forbes, Inc.com and NikkeiBP in Japan. It is available as an audio podcast (produced by Clearshore and featuring the voice of HP Lewis) on the blog itself or through SoundCloud, and translated into Spanish (by Alberto Peralta).[5][42][44]
Public service[edit]
Blank was a past Chairman of Audubon California and[15] has also served on the board of the Peninsula Open Space Trust[45] and was a trustee of U.C. Santa Cruz foundation and served on the board of the California League of Conservation Voters.[46] In 2007 he was appointed to the California Coastal Commission.[47] He has made philanthropic gifts to preserve the California Coast and has contributed funds to support the visitors' center at Año Nuevo State Reserve and to the Peninsula Open Space Trust.[4][45]
Reception[edit]
Blank is known amongst entrepreneurs and students as one of the "The Godfathers of Silicon Valley".[42] His books, blog, and interviews are often referred to or featured in world news publications such as Reuters, the New York Times, Forbes, Inc, TechCrunch and The Wall Street Journal.[1][2][6][12][42][48] Blank has hosted numerous sold-out speaking events and conferences about entrepreneurship and the Customer Development methodology.[49][50][50][51][52]

Blank was born to immigrant parents who ran a grocery in the Chelsea neighborhood in New York City.[12] He grew up with a sister who was 12 years older than him and both siblings were raised by his mother after his father left home when he was aged 6.[12] His parents had never been to college (has father dropped out in 8th grade) but hoped he would.[13] He attended the University of Michigan, but dropped out after one semester.[12][13][14]
From Michigan, Blank hitchhiked to Miami, where he found work at the Miami International Airport, loading racehorses onto aircraft.[12][13] At the airport, Blank developed an interest in avionics. He realized the only way to learn more was to join the Air Force.[13]
His military career took him to Thailand during the Vietnam War, where he was managing a team of 15 electronics technicians within a year and a half.[12][13] He was 20 years old.[13]
After leaving the military, Blank moved to Palo Alto, a town in an area which would ultimately become known as Silicon Valley.[13]
Startup career[edit]
Steve Blank arrived in Silicon Valley at the start of the business boom in 1978.[4][11] His first job in the region was with ESL, a startup that was a pioneering company for National Reconnaissance.[14] The company helped the government understand the Soviets' technological and arms developments during the Cold War.[14]
During his 21-year career as an entrepreneur, Blank went on to found or work with a wide range of high-tech companies.[15] Four of his companies went public.[12] Some of his ventures include Zilog and MIPS Computers, Convergent Technologies, Ardent, SuperMac Technologies, ESL and Rocket Science Games.[7][15]
Blank co-founded his 8th and last startup, the Customer Relationship Management provider E.piphany, in 1996 and retired the day before its IPO in September 1999.[2][4][16][17] Notable members of the company include Roger Siboni and Karen Richardson.[18][19]
Blank has since served on the boards of the public entities Macrovision/Rovi and Immersion as well as several private companies. He continues to invest in and advise Silicon Valley startups including Machine Intelligence companies Geometric (acquired by Uber) and Deepscale .[20]
Customer Development Methodology[edit]
Blank created the Customer Development methodology in the mid 1990s.[14] The concept details a scientific approach that can be applied by startups and entrepreneurs to improve their products success by developing a better understanding of customers’ problems/needs as well as the other hypotheses necessary to build a commercial successful company.[2][4][14]
Lean Startup Movement[edit]
Blank's Customer Development methodology is a cornerstone of the Lean Startup Movement, popularized by Eric Ries[21][22] whom Blank states was “the best student I ever had.”[4] The Lean Startup approach relies on validated learning, scientific experimentation, and iterative product releases to shorten product development cycles, measure progress, and gain valuable customer feedback. Blank and Ries developed the ideas beginning around 2004 when Blank was an investor and advisor to the company, IMVU, that Ries co-founded.[23] The Lean Startup has been adopted by entrepreneurs worldwide as a constructive way to try out ideas and gain customers.[2] Ries has integrated the Customer Development methodology into the Lean Startup practices and considers it to be one of the Lean Startup Movement's pillars.[24][25][26]
Academic teaching career[edit]
Blank began teaching entrepreneurship in 2002 at UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business and has since taught entrepreneurship to both undergraduate and graduate students. He currently teaches at Stanford, the University of California Berkeley Haas School of Business, New York University and Columbia.[7][8][27] His Lean LaunchPad curricula uses the Customer Development methodology and Lean Startup methods he developed throughout his career as a serial entrepreneur and academic.[12]
The Lean LaunchPad[edit]
In January 2011, Blank created the Lean LaunchPad class at Stanford University and UC Berkeley. The class is a scientific method for teaching entrepreneurship that combines experiential learning with the three building blocks of a successful Lean Startup: Alexander Osterwalder's "Business Model Canvas,"[28][29] Blank's "Customer Development Model,[30] and Agile Engineering.
The Lean LaunchPad changed the way entrepreneurship is taught.[31] Instead of relying on the traditional business school practice of teaching students how to write a standard corporate business plan, or simply build a product, the course provides hands-on experience in what it takes to start a company.
Students propose and immediately test business hypotheses. They get out of the building to talk to 10-15 prospective customers, partners and others each week. They use the customer feedback acquired in these interviews to refine their product or service by building a new minimal viable product weekly; ensure their product or service meets a customer need or solves a customer problem; and validate that they have created a repeatable, scalable business model.
Since its inception, Blank’s course has been adopted by more than 100 universities worldwide, and more than 300,000 people have taken a free online version of the class at Udacity.com.[32]
The National Science Foundation Innovation Corps[edit]
In July 2011 the National Science Foundation asked Blank to adapt his Lean LaunchPad class for its Innovation Corps (I-Corps), which develops and nurtures a national innovation ecosystem by helping discoveries from fundamental research to become new companies.
The course is now the standard for science commercialization, serving as the syllabus of the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps (I-Corps) that is taught in 53 universities and has been adopted by the other federal research agencies (NIH, DOE, HHS, NSA);[33] and is helping to drive innovation within the U.S. government, particularly within the defense and intelligence community.
Following a successful pilot, the I-Corps program quickly expanded. A version of the I-Corps program specifically dedicated to biomedical research, called The I-Corps at NIH, was devised in 2014. As of January 2017, I-Corps has a National Innovation Network of more than 190 colleges and universities, and more than 800 teams of scientists and engineers have gone through the program.[1][4][3][33]
Hacking for Defense and Hacking for Diplomacy[edit]
Hacking for Defense and Hacking for Diplomacy are courses created at Stanford in 2016 that use Blank’s Lean LaunchPad curriculum to address national defense and foreign policy challenges while offering a new platform for completing national service.
Hacking for Defense connects the Silicon Valley innovation mindset with islands of innovation inside the U.S. Department of Defense and intelligence community. Student teams work with DOD and intelligence sponsors, using Lean Startup methods and Blank’s Lean LaunchPad curriculum to address real-world national security problems.
Hacking for Defense immediately began to scale after its pilot in spring 2016. In 2017, it will be taught in more than 15 other universities across the country, providing solutions to hundreds of critical national security problems annually.
The pilot Hacking for Diplomacy class wrapped up at Stanford in December. In it, student teams work with State Department sponsors, using Lean Startup methods to address critical foreign policy challenges.[32][34][35]
Awards and honors[edit]
In 2009, Blank won the Stanford University Undergraduate Teaching Award in Management Science and Engineering.[5] That same year he was also named one of the Top 10 Influencers in Silicon Valley by the Silicon Valley Mercury News.[36] In 2010, Blank was a recipient of the Earl F. Cheit Outstanding Teaching Award at U.C. Berkeley Haas School of Business.
In 2012 The Harvard Business Review named him one of 12 Masters of Innovation and CNBC recognized him as one of the "11 Notable Entrepreneurs Teaching the Next Generation."[37][38]
He was named Senior Fellow for Entrepreneurship at Columbia University in 2015 and was recognized by The Thinkers50 global ranking of management thinkers. Blank is an infrequent speaker at conferences and entrepreneurial events but has given commencement speeches at Philadelphia University in 2011, the University of Minnesota in 2013, ESADE Business School in 2014, and at NYU in 2016. NPR ranked his Philadelphia University commencement speech as one of the best in the last 325 years.
Publications[edit]
The Four Steps to the Epiphany[edit]
In 2005, Blank published The Four Steps to the Epiphany: Successful Strategies for Products that Win, (K&S Ranch Press) which details his approach to the Customer Development process.[11] In the book, Blank outlines his views about how entrepreneurship is a practice that can be actively managed rather than an art which must be passively experienced.[14] The book is viewed in entrepreneurship circles as the definitive source on the Customer Development methodology.[14]
Not All Who Wander Are Lost[edit]
Blank released a second book in 2010, Not All Who Wander Are Lost which relates stories from his life as an entrepreneur.[11] The collection of material develops a narrative about how to live life amid the fast-paced world of Silicon Valley startups.[39]
The Startup Owner's Manual[edit]
Steve Blank and Bob Dorf co-authored The Startup Owner's Manual, which was released in March 2012.[40][41] The 608-page reference manual details a scientific approach to entrepreneurship and emphasizes the importance of "rigorous and repeated testing."[10][12] The work draws on ideas from The Business Model Generation and The Four Steps to the Epiphany.[10] According to Blank, the book was designed to be used as an "encyclopedia and a blueprint" for startups.[42]
Holding a Cat by the Tail[edit]
Blank released Holding a Cat by the Tail in 2014. The book is updated version of Not All Those Who Wander Are Lost, featuring additional lessons learned from his life as an entrepreneur.
Blog[edit]
Blank authors a blog about entrepreneurship.[6] In 2012, his blog was ranked one of the "10 Must-Read Blogs for Any Lean Startup" by Welovelean.com.[43] The blog is considered a must-read for entrepreneurs and is often syndicated by UC Berkeley, VentureBeat, Huffington Post, Forbes, Inc.com and NikkeiBP in Japan. It is available as an audio podcast (produced by Clearshore and featuring the voice of HP Lewis) on the blog itself or through SoundCloud, and translated into Spanish (by Alberto Peralta).[5][42][44]
Public service[edit]
Blank was a past Chairman of Audubon California and[15] has also served on the board of the Peninsula Open Space Trust[45] and was a trustee of U.C. Santa Cruz foundation and served on the board of the California League of Conservation Voters.[46] In 2007 he was appointed to the California Coastal Commission.[47] He has made philanthropic gifts to preserve the California Coast and has contributed funds to support the visitors' center at Año Nuevo State Reserve and to the Peninsula Open Space Trust.[4][45]
Reception[edit]
Blank is known amongst entrepreneurs and students as one of the "The Godfathers of Silicon Valley".[42] His books, blog, and interviews are often referred to or featured in world news publications such as Reuters, the New York Times, Forbes, Inc, TechCrunch and The Wall Street Journal.[1][2][6][12][42][48] Blank has hosted numerous sold-out speaking events and conferences about entrepreneurship and the Customer Development methodology.[49][50][50][51][52]

National Security Innovation just got a major boost in Washington

		Posted on July 19, 2017 by steveblank	

Two good things just happened in Washington – these days that should be enough of a headline.
First, someone ideal was just appointed to be Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense.
Second, funding to teach our Hacking for Defense class across the country just was added to the National Defense Authorization Act.
Interestingly enough, both events are about how the best and brightest can serve their country – and are testament to the work of two dedicated men.
Soldier, Scholar, Entrepreneur
Joe Felter was just appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for South and Southeast Asia. As a result, our country just became a bit safer and smarter. That’s because Joe brings a wealth of real-world experience and leadership to the role.
I got lucky to know and teach with Joe at Stanford. When we met, my first impression was that of a very smart and pragmatic academic. And I also noticed that there was always a cloud of talented grad students who wanted to follow him. (I learned later I was watching one of the qualities of a great leader.) Joe had appointments at Stanford’s Center for International Security and Cooperation (CISAC), where he was the co-director of the Empirical Studies of Conflict Project and at the Hoover Institute where he was a research fellow. I learned he’d gone to Harvard to get his MPA at the Kennedy School of Government in conflict resolution. But the thing that really caught my attention: his Stanford Ph.D thesis in Political Science had the world’s best title: “Taking Guns to a Knife Fight: A Case for Empirical Study of Counterinsurgency.” I wondered how this academic knew anything about counterinsurgency.
This was another reminder that when you reach a certain age, people you encounter may have lived multiple lives, had multiple careers, and had multiple acts. It took me a while to realize that Joe had one heck of a first act before coming to Stanford in 2011.
As I later discovered, Joe’s first act was 24 years in the Army Special Operations Forces (SOF), retiring as a Colonel.
His Special Forces time was with the 1st Special Forces Group as a team leader and later as a company commander. He did a tour with the 75th Ranger Regiment as a platoon leader. In 2005, he returned to West Point (where he earned his undergrad degree) and ran the Combating Terrorism Center. Putting theory into practice, he went to Iraq in 2008 as part of the 75th Ranger Regiment, in support of a Joint Special Operations Task Force. In 2010 Joe was in Afghanistan as the Commander of the Counterinsurgency Advisory and Assistance Team. At various points his Special Forces career took him to countries in Southeast Asia where counterinsurgency was not just academics.
Ironically, I was first introduced to Joe not at Stanford but through one of his other lives – that of an entrepreneur and businessman – at the company he founded, BMNT Partners. It was there that Joe and I along with another retired Army Colonel, Pete Newell, came up with the idea of creating the Hacking for Defense class. We combined the Lean Startup methodology – used by the National Science Foundation to commercialize science  – with the rapid problem sourcing and solution methodology Pete developed on the battlefields in Afghanistan and Iraq when he ran the US Army’s Rapid Equipping Force.
My interest was to get Stanford students engaged in national service and exposed to parts of the U.S. government where their traditional academic path and business career would never take them. (I have a strong belief that we’ve run a 44-year experiment with what happens when you disconnect the majority of Americans from any form of national service. And the result hasn’t been good for our country. Today if college students want to give back to their country, they think of Teach for America, the Peace Corps, or Americorps or perhaps the US Digital Service or the GSA’s 18F. Few consider opportunities to make the world safer with the Department of Defense, State Department, Intelligence Community or other government agencies.)
Joe, Pete and I would end up building a curriculum that would turn into a series of classes — first, Hacking for Defense, then Hacking for Diplomacy (with the State Department and Professor Jeremy Weinstein), Hacking for Energy, Hacking for Impact, etc.
Hacking For Defense
Our first Hacking for Defense class in 2016 blew past our expectations – and we had set a pretty high bar. (See the final class presentations here and here).
Our primary goal was to teach students entrepreneurship while they engaged in national public service.
Our second goal was to introduce our sponsors – the innovators inside the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community –  to a methodology that can help them understand and better respond to rapidly evolving asymmetric threats. We believed if we could get teams to rapidly discover the real problems in the field using Lean methods, and only then articulate the requirements to solve them, then defense acquisition programs could operate at speed and urgency and deliver timely and needed solutions.
Finally, we also wanted to show our sponsors in the Department of Defense that students can make meaningful contributions to understanding problems and rapid prototyping of solutions to real-world national security problems.
The Innovation Insurgency Spreads
Fast forward a year. Hacking for Defense is now offered at eight universities in addition to Stanford – Georgetown, University of Pittsburgh, Boise State, UC San Diego, James Madison University, University of Southern Mississippi, and later this year University of Southern California and Columbia University. We established Hacking for Defense.org, a non-profit to train educators and provide a single point of contact for connecting the DOD/IC sponsor problems to these universities.
By the middle of this year Hacking For Defense started to feel like it had the same momentum as when my Lean LaunchPad class at Stanford got adopted by the National Science Foundation and became the Innovation Corps (I-Corps). I-Corps uses Lean Startup methods to teach scientists how to turn their discoveries into entrepreneurial, job-producing businesses. Over 1,000 teams of our nation’s best scientists have been through the program. It has changed how federally funded research is commercialized.
Recognizing that it’s a model for a government program that’s gotten the balance between public/private partnerships just right, last fall Congress passed the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act, making the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps a permanent part of the nation’s science ecosystem.
It dawned on Pete, Joe and me that perhaps we could get Congress to fund the national expansion of Hacking for Defense the same way. But serendipitously, the best person we were going to ask for help had already been thinking about this.
The Congressman From Science and Innovation
Before everyone else thought that teaching scientists how to build companies using Lean Methods might be a good for the country, there was one congressman who got it first.
In 2012, Rep. Dan Lipinski (D-Il), ranking member on the House Research and Technology Subcommittee, got on an airplane and flew to Stanford to see first-hand the class that would become I-Corps. For the first few years Lipinski was a lonely voice in Congress saying that we’ve found a better way to train our scientists to create companies and jobs. But over time, his colleagues became convinced that it was a non-partisan good idea. Rep. Lipinski was responsible for helping I-Corps proliferate through the federal government.
While Joe Felter and Pete Newell were thinking about approaching Congressman Lipinski about funding for Hacking for Defense Lipinski had already been planning to do so. As he recalled, “I was listening to your podcast as I was working in my backyard cutting, digging, chopping, etc. (yes, I do really work in my backyard,) when it dawned on me that funding Hacking for Defense as a national program – just like I did for the Innovation Corps – would be great for our nation’s defense when we are facing new unique threats. I tasked my staff to draft an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act and I sponsored the amendment.”
(The successful outcome of I-Corps has given the Congressman credibility on entrepreneurship education among his peers. And it doesn’t hurt that he has a Ph.D and was a university professor before he ended up in Congress.)
Joe Felter and Pete Newell mobilized a network of Hacking for Defense supporters. Joe and Pete’s reputations preceded them on Capitol Hill, but in part a testament to the strength of Hacking for Defense, there’s now a large network of people who have experienced and believe in the program, and were willing to help out by writing letters of support, reaching out to other members of Congress to ask for support, and providing Congressman Lipinski’s office with information and background.
Congressman Lipinski led the amendment. He brought on co-sponsors from both sides of the aisle: Representatives Steve Knight (R-CA 25), Ro Khanna (D-CA 17), Anna Eshoo (D-CA 18), Seth Moulton (D-MA 6) and Carol Shea-Porter (D-NH 1).
On the floor of the House, Lipinski said, “Rapid, low-cost technological innovation is what makes Silicon Valley revolutionary, but the DOD hasn’t historically had the mechanisms in place to harness this American advantage. Hacking for Defense creates ways for talented scientists and engineers to work alongside veterans, military leaders, and business mentors to innovate solutions that make America safer.”
Last Friday the House unanimously approved an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act authorizing the Hacking for Defense (H4D) program and enabling the Secretary of Defense to expend up to $15 million to support development of curriculum, best practices, and recruitment materials for the program.
This week the H4D amendment moves on to the Senate and Joe Felter moves on to the Pentagon. Both of those events have the potential to make our world a much safer place – today and tomorrow.

Why good people leave large tech companies

		Posted on July 11, 2017 by steveblank	

If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the people to gather wood,
divide the work, and give orders. 
Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.
Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
I was visiting with an ex-student who’s now the CFO of a large public tech company. The company is still one of the hottest places to work in tech. They make hardware with a large part of their innovation in embedded software and services.
The CFO asked me to stay as one of the engineering directors came in for a meeting.
I wish I hadn’t.
—-
The director was there to protest the forced relocation of his entire 70-person team from Palo Alto to the East Bay. “Today most of my team walks to work or takes the train there. The move will have them commuting for another 45 minutes. We’re going to lose a lot of them.”
The director had complained to his boss, the VP of Engineering, who admitted his hands were tied, as this was a “facilities matter,” and the VP of facilities reported to the CFO. So, this was a meeting of last resort, as the engineering director was making one last appeal to the CFO to keep his team in town.
While a significant part of the headcount of this tech company was in manufacturing, the director’s group was made up of experienced software engineers. Given they could get new jobs by just showing up at the local coffee shop, I was stunned by the CFO’s reply: “Too bad, but we need the space. They’re lucky they work here. If they leave at least they’ll have ‘name of our company’ on their resume.”
WTF? I wasn’t sure who was more shocked, the director or me.
After the director left, I must have looked pretty surprised as the CFO explained, “We have tens of thousands of employees, and at the rate we’re growing it’s almost impossible to keep up with our space needs in the Bay Area. You know for our CEO, ‘love us or leave us’ has been his policy from day one.” (By coincidence, the CEO was an intern at one of my startups more than two decades ago.) I asked, “Now that the company is public and has grown so large, has the policy changed?” The CFO replied, “No, our CEO believes we are on a mission to change the world, and you really have to want to work here or you ought to leave. And because we’re inundated with resumes from people who want to work for us, he sees no reason to change.”
I don’t know what was more sobering, thinking that the policy which might have made sense as a scrappy startup, was now being applied to a company with 10,000+ employees or that the phrase, “…we are on a mission to change the world, and you really have to want to work here or you ought to leave…” was the exact same line I used when the now-CEO was my intern.
Adult Supervision
Before the rapid rise of Unicorns, (startups with a valuation over a billion dollars), when boards were still in control, they “encouraged” the hiring of “adult supervision” of the founders after they found product/market fit. The belief then was that most founders couldn’t acquire the HR, finance, sales, and board governance skills rapidly enough to steer the company to a liquidity event, so they hired professional managers. These new CEOs would also act as a brake to temper the founder’s excesses.
In the last decade, technology investors realized that these professional CEOs were effective at maximizing, but not finding, product cycles. Yet technology cycles have become a treadmill, and to survive startups need to be on a continuous innovation cycle. This requires retaining a startup culture for years – and who is best to do that? The founders. Founders are comfortable in the chaos and disorder. In contrast, professional managers attempt to bring order to chaos and often kill the startup culture in the process. Venture firms realized that teaching a founding CEO how to grow a company is easier than teaching the professional CEO how to find the new innovation for the next product cycle. And they were right.  It was true in the company I was visiting— and in the last five years over 200 other Unicorns have emerged, and most still have their founders at the helm.
And so, this startup found itself with a “founder friendly” board that believed that the company could grow at a greater rate if the founding CEO continued to run the company. This founder’s reality distortion field attracted a large number of employees who shared his vision. It was so compelling, everyone worked extremely long hours, for little pay and some stock. They were lucky, they got the timing right, and after a painful couple of years figured out product/market fit, and went public. And those early employees got rewarded as their stock turned into cash.
The problem was that at some point past employee 1000, the big payoffs ended from pre-public stock and the stock’s subsequent run-up from their IPO. But the CEO never noticed that the payoff had ended for the other 95% of his company. Flying to his remote company locations in his private jet, and surrounded by his early employees who were now worth tens of millions of dollars, the mantra of “you really have to want to work here or you ought to leave” rang hollow for the latest employees.
The company was now attracting interns who did want the name of this hot company on their resume. But since compensation was way below average, they stayed just long enough to pump up their resumes and left for much better paying jobs – often in a startup.
And because fewer senior engineers considered it a great place to work, the company’s initial technology advantage has started to erode.
Wakeup Call
The downside of founders running large companies is that there are no written best practices, no classes, no standard model at all. And given that in the past, founders as a group were rarely in charge as startups became large companies, it’s no surprise. Reprogramming founders who grew their business by being agile, relentless, tenacious, and often aggressive, and irrational and at times, into CEOs that can drive organizational growth, is tough.
This means quickly learning a new set of skills; sublimating large egos, working through direct reports, when their span of control can no longer encompass the entire company; and building repeatable processes that enable scale. At times this comes only after a crisis that provides a wakeup call.
As a startup scales into a company, founders and the board need to realize that the most important transitions are not about systems, buildings or hardware. They’re about the company’s most valuable asset – its employees.
Founders of great companies figure out how the keep their passion but put people before process.
Postscript
I can tell this story now, as the director left the company and founded his own startup in a different market segment. Over the next six months 55 of the 70 employees in his group that were asked to relocate left. 25 of them joined his new startup. And of the other 30 who left?  Six new startups were formed.
Lessons Learned


Be careful of unintended consequences when you grow
Recognize the transition boundaries in company size
Recognize that what drove an Innovation Culture when you were small may no longer apply when you’re large

Why a Company Can’t “Be More Like a Startup”

		Posted on June 27, 2017 by steveblank	

This article originally appeared in the Harvard Business Review
 
As more and more companies face disruption from globalization, new technology, and startups that have more capital than the incumbents, the continuing cry from Wall Street investors is, “Why can’t companies be as innovative as startups?”
Here’s one reason why:
Startups can do anything.
Companies can only do what’s legal.
Startups can do anything
One of the unheralded advantages of a startup is what at first glance appears to be its weakness. Initially, a startup has no business model and no market share to defend. Its employees and investors don’t depend on an existing revenue stream. If they select a business model that targets industry incumbents, they don’t have to worry about upsetting existing customers, partners or distribution channels.
Yet those very weaknesses give startups an overwhelming advantage in innovation.  Startups can try any idea and any business model—even those that are on the surface patently illegal.
At times laws and regulations are in place for the health and safety of consumers. But often the legal obstacles confronting startups have been put in place by companies that look to the government and regulators as their first line of defense against new market entrants. (Existing companies also use network effects of monopolies/duopolies, distribution channel kickbacks, etc., to stifle competition.)
In the past, these anti-innovation tools were sufficient to keep new entrants out. But today, investors realize that companies that depend on regulation and artificial market constraints are actually vulnerable. Once presented with an alternative to the status quo, customers who have been locked into rent-seeking companies flock to innovative startups with business models that provide better service, lower prices, etc. Enormous financial returns are available to startups taking on incumbents, regulators and the law. So, startup investors comfortable making a risk capital bet are actively encouraging startups to go after large, static industries that look prime for disruption.
Here are some of the most visible examples.
Uber – current valuation >$70 billion – knew the day they started that their ridesharing service violated the law in most jurisdictions. Carrying passengers for payment, historically considered commercial use, was regulated in most cities.  In addition, some cities put an artificial limit on the number of taxi operators by requiring them to buy medallions and agree to a set of local regulations.  Uber ignored all of these requirements and reinvented local transportation by offering a more convenient service. Today, New York City has 13,587 yellow-taxi medallions and more than 50,000 Uber and Lyft cars.
PayPal – acquired by eBay three years after it was founded for $1.5 billion – started as a money transfer system for buyers and sellers on eBay. Banks protested that PayPal was an unregulated bank; and of course, are regulated by the federal government and states. As PayPal grew, incumbent banks forced it to register in each state. Ironically, once PayPal complied with state regulations by registering as a “money transmitter” on a state-by-state basis, it created a barrier to entry for future new entrants.
Airbnb – current valuation $31 billion – allows people to rent out their homes, rooms or apartments to visitors. Not surprisingly Airbnb violates local housing laws and regulations in many cities.  None of the renters pay hotel or tourist tax.  Every Airbnb rental is a lost night of revenue for hotels that hate it.  The company has more rooms available then any hotel chain.
Tesla – current valuation $50 billion – sells cars directly through its own distribution channel. To protect auto dealerships in the 1920s, direct sales by an automobile manufacturer were made illegal in most states in the U.S.  Because Tesla believed that existing auto dealers would have no incentive to sell electric cars, they created an alternative option for consumers.
Companies can do anything legal
In the 20th century companies worried about increasing their market share, profit margins, return on investment and return on net assets. They tenaciously protected their existing markets from other existing companies that were using the same business model. They very rarely worried about disruption from new firms as the barriers to entry (financial, legal, regulatory) were so high.
Ironically once companies become locked in their entrenched market positions, it became difficult for them to compete by breaking the same laws or untangling their existing channel relationships. In contrast to startups, companies are constrained by local, state and federal laws and regulations.  The risk of breaking laws can result in large penalties and shareholder lawsuits.  The Justice Department and State Attorneys General find large companies attractive targets.
As a consequence, one of the roles of the legal department in large corporations is to protect the company from straying into any legal or regulatory danger. (For example, when Volkswagen discovered their diesel cars couldn’t pass U.S. pollution standards, it faked the tests by programming cars to pass inspections. However, in normal driving these cars put out over 40 times the allowed nitrous oxide pollutants allowed by law.  After it was discovered, legal penalties cost Volkswagen $18 billion and several indicted executives.)
Yet trying to stay within the legal lines companies paint themselves into a corner by creating their own internal barriers to innovation. Instead of innovating, most industries being disrupted turn to litigation.
To compete with Tesla’s direct sales to consumers, GM, Ford, and the rest of the auto industry either have to shut Tesla out of selling directly to consumers or they have to abandon their own dealer networks and sell directly as well. It’s an untenable and unsustainable position as consumers find car salesmen to be one of the least trusted groups. To defend their dealer network, car makers decided to litigate instead of innovating.
Taxi companies needed to start copying Uber’s business model but instead they turned to lobbyists and legislation to convince cities that deregulated ridesharing was a bad idea.
Hotel chains burdened with even a greater capital investment in their physical buildings are doing the same thing.
Corporations using existing business models have people, processes and revenue goals that can’t be changed overnight. These incumbents tend to have short-term goals and incentives (stock price, quarterly earnings, year-end bonuses) and often fail to recognize that more money can be made on new platforms and new distribution channels. In each case litigation versus innovation is seems obvious choice.
What can a company do?
The introduction of new technology has always been disruptive to existing markets, particularly to those who sell through well-established distribution channels and have extensive capital equipment and fixed investments. But today, as disruption happens faster, and is funded at enterprise scale, companies need to figure how to create a portfolio of innovation. They can do so by first identifying technology trends with innovation outposts located in technology centers; second, by investing in early-stage disruptors; third – buying disruptors and keeping their innovation culture and people; while fourth, creating an innovation culture internally that disrupts their own business model before others do.

Tesla Lost $700 Million Last Year, So Why Is Tesla’s Valuation $60 Billion?

		Posted on June 14, 2017 by steveblank	

Automobile manufacturers shipped 88 million cars in 2016. Tesla shipped 76,000. Yet Wall Street values Tesla higher than any other U.S. car manufacturer. What explains this more than 1,000 to 1 discrepancy in valuation?
The future.
—
Too many people compare Tesla to what already exists and that’s a mistake. Tesla is not another car company.
At the turn of the 20th century most people compared existing buggy and carriage manufacturers to the new automobile companies. They were both transportation, and they looked vaguely similar, with the only apparent difference that one was moved by horses attached to the front while the other had an unreliable and very noisy internal combustion engine.
They were different. And one is now only found in museums. Companies with business models built around internal combustion engines disrupted those built around horses.  That’s the likely outcome for every one of today’s automobile manufacturers. Tesla is a new form of transportation disrupting the incumbents.
Here are four reasons why.
Electric cars pollute less, have fewer moving parts, are quieter and faster than existing cars. Today, the technology necessary (affordable batteries with sufficient range) for them to be a viable business have all just come together. Most observers agree that autonomous electric cars will be the dominate form of transportation by mid-century. That’s bad news for existing car companies.
First, car companies have over a century of expertise in designing and building efficient mechanical propulsion systems – internal combustion engines for motive power and transmissions to drive the wheels. If existing car manufacturers want to build electric vehicles, all those design skills and most of the supply chain and manufacturing expertise are useless. And not only useless but they become this legacy of capital equipment and headcount that is now a burden to a company. In a few years, the only thing useful in existing factories building traditional cars will be the walls and roof.
Second, while the automotive industry might be 1000 times larger than Tesla, Tesla may actually have more expertise and dollars committed to the electric car ecosystem than any legacy car company. Tesla’s investment in Lithium/Ion battery factory (the Gigafactory), its electric drive train design and manufacturing output exceed the sum of the entire automotive industry.
Third, the future of transportation is not only electric, it’s autonomous and connected. A lot has been written about self-driving cars and as a reminder, automated driving comes in multiple levels:

Level 0: the car gives you warnings but driver maintains control of the car. For example, blind spot warning.
Level 1: the driver and the car share control. For example, Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) where the driver controls steering and the automated system controls speed.
Level 2: The automated system takes full control of the vehicle (accelerating, braking, and steering). The driver monitors and intervenes if the automated system fails to respond.
Level 3: The driver can text or watch a movie. The vehicle will handle situations that call for an immediate response, like emergency braking. The driver must be prepared to intervene within some limited time, when called upon by the vehicle.
Level 4: No driver attention is ever required for safety, i.e. the driver may safely go to sleep or leave the driver’s seat.
Level 5: No human intervention is required. For example, a robotic taxi

Each level of autonomy requires an exponential amount of software engineering design and innovation. While cars have had an ever-increasing amount of software content, the next generation of transportation are literally computers on wheels. Much like in electric vehicle drive trains, autonomy and connectivity are not core competencies of existing car companies.
Fourth, large, existing companies are executing a known business model and have built processes, procedures and key performance indicators to measure progress to a known set of goals. But when technology disruption happens (electric drive trains, autonomous vehicles, etc.) changing a business model is extremely difficult. Very few companies manage to make the transition from one business model to another.
And while Tesla might be the first mover in disrupting transportation there is no guarantee they will be the ultimate leader. However, the question shouldn’t be why Tesla has such a high valuation.
The question should be why the existing automobile companies aren’t valued like horse and buggy companies.
Lesson Learned


Few market leaders in an industry being disrupted make the transition to the new industry
The assets, expertise, and mindset that made them leaders in the past are usually the baggage that prevents them from seeing the future

Hacking for Defense @ Stanford 2017 – Lessons Learned Presentations

		Posted on June 8, 2017 by steveblank	

We just finished our second Hacking for Defense class at Stanford. Eight teams presented their Lessons Learned presentations.
Hacking for Defense is a battle-tested problem-solving methodology that runs at Silicon Valley speed. It combines the same Lean Startup Methodology used by the National Science Foundation to commercialize science, with the rapid problem sourcing and curation methodology developed on the battlefields in Afghanistan and Iraq by Colonel Pete Newell and the US Army’s Rapid Equipping Force.
Goals for the Hacking for Defense Class
Our primary goal was to teach students entrepreneurship while they engaged in a national public service. Today if college students want to give back to their country they think of Teach for America, the Peace Corps, or Americorps or perhaps the US Digital Service or the GSA’s 18F. Few consider opportunities to make the world safer with the Department of Defense, Intelligence Community or other government agencies.
Our second goal was to teach our sponsors (the innovators inside the Department of Defense (DOD) and Intelligence Community (IC)) that there is a methodology that can help them understand and better respond to rapidly evolving asymmetric threats. That if we could get teams to rapidly discover the real problems in the field using Lean methods, and only then articulate the requirements to solve them, could defense acquisition programs operate at speed and urgency and deliver timely and needed solutions.
Finally, we also wanted to show our sponsors in the Department of Defense and Intelligence community that civilian students can make a meaningful contribution to problem understanding and rapid prototyping of solutions to real-world problems.
The Class
Here’s a brief description of the Lean Methodology our students used:

If you can’t see the video click here
Our mantra to the students was that we wanted them to learn about “Deployment not Demos.” Our observation is that the DOD has more technology demos than they need, but often lack deep problem understanding.  Our goal was to have the students first deeply understand their sponsors problem – before they started building solutions. As you can imagine with a roomful of technologists this was tough. Further we wanted the students to understand all parts of the mission model canvas, not just the beneficiaries and the value proposition. We wanted them to learn what it takes to get their product/service deployed to the field, not give yet another demo to a general. This meant that the minimal viable products the students built were focused on maximizing their learning of what to build, not just building prototypes.
(Our sponsors did remind us, that at times getting a solution deployed meant that someone did have to see a demo!)
The Hacking for Defense class was designed as “fundamental research” to be shared broadly and the results are not subject to restriction for proprietary or national security reasons. In the 10 weeks the students have, Hacking for Defense hardware and software prototypes don’t advance beyond a Technology Readiness Level 4 and remain outside the scope of US export control regulations and restrictions on foreign national participation.
Results

Eight teams spoke to over 800 beneficiaries, requirements writers, program managers, warfighters, legal, security, customers, etc.
Seven out of the eight teams realized that the problem as given by the sponsor really wasn’t the problem. Their sponsors agreed.
Received from a problem sponsor mid-live stream broadcast “we are working funding for this team now.”
Over half the student teams have decided to continue working on national security projects after this class.

This is the End
Each of the eight teams presented a 2-minute video to provide context about their problem and then gave an 8-minute presentation of their Lessons Learned over the 10-weeks. Each of their slide presentation follow their customer discovery journey. All the teams used the Mission Model Canvas, Customer Development and Agile Engineering to build Minimal Viable Products, but all of their journeys were unique.
The teams presented in front of several hundred people in person and online.

The Innovation Insurgency Spreads
Hacking for Defense is now offered at eight universities in addition to Stanford – Georgetown,  University of Pittsburgh, Boise State, UC San Diego, James Madison University, University of Southern Mississippi, and later this year University of Southern California and Columbia University. We established Hacking for Defense.org a non-profit, to train educators and to provide a single point of contact for connecting the DOD/IC sponsor problems to these universities.
The Department of Defense has expanded their use of Hacking for Defense to include a classified version, and corporate partners are expanding their efforts to support the course and to create their own internal Hacking for Defense courses.
Another surprise was how applicable the “Hacking for X…” methodology is for other problems. Working with the State Department we offered a Hacking for Diplomacy class at Stanford.
Both the Defense and Diplomacy classes created lots of interest from organizations that have realized that this “Hacking for X…” problem-solving methodology is equally applicable to solving public safety, energy, policy, community and social issues internationally and within our own communities. This fall a series of new “Hacking for X…” classes will address these deserving communities. These include:

Hacking for Impact (helping NGO’s and Nonprofits) at Berkeley
Hacking for Energy at Columbia
Hacking for Urban Resilience (Cities) at Stanford
Hacking for Journalism at Stanford

If you’re interested in learning how to apply a “Hacking for X…” class in your workplace or school we’ve partnered with the 1776 incubator in Washington DC to offer a 2-day “Hacking for X…” certification course 26-27 July for those interested in learning how. Sign up here.
It Takes a Village
While I authored this blog post, these classes are a team project. The teaching team consisted of:

Joe Felter a retired Army Special Forces Colonel with research and teaching appointments at Stanford’s Center for International Security and Cooperation (CISAC), the Hoover Institution, and the dept. of Management Science and Engineering. Joe is the incoming Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for South and Southeast Asia.
Pete Newell is a retired Army Colonel currently a Senior Visiting Research Fellow at the National Defense University’s Center for Technology and National Security Policy and CEO of BMNT Partners.
Steve Weinstein a 30-year veteran of Silicon Valley technology companies and Hollywood media companies.  Steve is CEO of MovieLabs the joint R&D lab of all the major motion picture studios.

Our teaching assistants were all prior students: Issac Matthews our lead TA, and Melisa Tokmak, Jared Dunnmon, and Darren Hau.
We were lucky to get a team of 25 mentors (VC’s and entrepreneurs) who selflessly volunteered their time to help coach the teams.

Dalhousie University Commencement Speech – 2017

		Posted on June 1, 2017 by steveblank	

Light a path for the better angels
Thank you, Chancellor McLellan, President Florizone, Dean Charlebois, Dr. Hewitt, and Dr. Kilfoil for the invitation to speak today and thank you for the honorary degree.
I’m honored to speak at a university whose motto is: Pray and Work.
It’s pretty close to the one I had as an entrepreneur, which was – Pray it Will Work.
—
First, my congratulations. Your degree is a big deal. This is your day, not mine.
At worst, a commencement speaker is all that stands between you and lunch. At best, I can give you something to think about as you embark on the next chapter in your life.
—
What, I wondered, would I have said to a group of graduates living on the edge of a revolution the day writing was invented, or the year after Gutenberg printed the first book, or when radio reached into the homes of millions.  What advice would I have given to those about to enter a world no one had ever experienced?
Whether you like it or not, or know it or not, you’re coming of age at just that extraordinary time in human development.
Let me be honest about my bias.  I love technology. I’ve spent my life at the center of innovation in Silicon Valley –  doing eight startups in 21 years, and the last 15 years in academia teaching others innovation and entrepreneurship. I was present at the creation of the first microprocessors, participated in the PC revolution, built video games, and shipped software on the first Internet browsers. And I’ve watched how, in a blink of an eye, technology went from products used by the very few, to ending up in the pockets of billions, bringing social change and corporate disruption.
But nothing, absolutely nothing, I’ve experienced, will come close to what you’re going to see.
Only a few generations have been granted the role of determining whether a revolution in communication will allow our better angels – or our darker angels – to win. You leave here with incredible opportunity, but also with immense responsibility.
—
Half the world now owns a smartphone. On an average day, you’ll look at your phone over 200 times. You’ve gone through college interacting with your friends and connecting to the world using Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Snapchat, Twitter, Tinder, Pandora, Pinterest, Uber, YouTube and other apps I don’t even know. Living “phone forward” and connecting to the world through this software seems normal – to you.
You communicate, interact and network with each other in a way that’s unique in the history of our species. Faster, with infinitely more data, in shorter bursts, with more connections to more people and places.
We now know that the way we consume information changes our brains. Whether new forms of communication physically change our gray matter, or just cause us to use different parts of it, is still open to debate. But clearly, our brains process information differently depending on the form of communication we’re engaged in.
Your brains have been rewired to process all this Net-based information. Your brains are dealing with the world in a different way than humans ever have.
That kind of profound shift has occurred only six times in the entire 200,000-year history of Homo Sapiens. And you, here today, are the vanguard of the seventh wave.
Each time this happened, the human race made major leaps forward. Your generation, all of you graduating today, are our unintended science experiment. Have we have given you a gift or a curse?
Let’s look at what happened the six other times our brains were rewired.
—
If you remember from your anthropology class, modern humans emerged about 200,000 years ago, and with them, spoken language. For the next 195,000 years, we passed information on to one another via stories. You sat by a fire, looked at the stars and listened to a storyteller recount creation myths, hero myths and stories for entertainment, and your imagination was engaged as you filled in the details.
Over thousands of years, these storytellers rewired their own brains into something different from those who were simply listening. Storytellers trained to memorize outrageously long narratives, more than most humans alive today can.
Storytellers had new brains.
—
After more than 100,000 years of telling stories, something unprecedented happened. A few merchants in the Mideast created writing, at first to keep track of crops.
I think it’s appropriate to remind a university class that some of the oldest written inscriptions were not only about crops, but also the celebration of beer.
With written text, the minds of the readers required a whole new way of processing information. We now had to first learn how to read, and then we had to understand what the words were trying to tell us.
Readers and writers of language had new brains.
The written word also meant that information could now be standardized. Our better angels blossomed.
We could formalize laws, create religious texts, and communicate orders to coordinate activities farther than the spoken word could travel. Written language enabled the creation of large societies and with them, governments.
Our darker angels also found ways to use the written word – to dominate and oppress others.
—
But in 1440, Gutenberg rocked the world when he invented the printing press.
Until the middle of the 15th century, most people couldn’t read. The mass production of books changed that. Within 50 years, books created an information explosion across Europe – 10’s of thousands of titles, and 10’s of millions of copies of books. Our better angels soared as printed books became the Internet of the Renaissance.
Readers of books now had new brains.
And mass production of printed books fueled a reconfiguration of our society, not just our brains. With the printing press, it only took a couple of months to spread Martin Luther’s 95 Theses over much of northern Europe. The result was the Protestant Reformation, which ushered in a new era of political, intellectual and cultural change.
Our darker angels were frightened by the free and unfettered access to information – and banned books – and burned heretics that challenged church and state dogma.
—
It took about two centuries from the appearance of the book to the emergence of what we would now call newspapers – mass communication had arrived.
The first weekly newspapers appeared in Italy and Germany, and quickly spread through Europe.
In Canada, the first newspaper ever was right here – the Halifax Gazette.
By the end of the 19th century mass circulation papers had developed the characteristics that your parents would recognize today—headlines, illustrations, entertaining stories – all designed to shortcut critical thinking, and stir passion and emotion to sell newspapers and, of course, advertising.
Now, newspaper readers had a daily or weekly stream of “clickbait” headlines.
Readers of newspapers had new brains.
—
The next wave was Radio. It gave us instantaneous communication to national audiences.  Advertisers immediately figured out how to turn those engaged audiences into consumers. And some governments learned how to turn radio into a weapon of mass deception.
Radio meant that we could now hear the voices of storytellers again. As our brains were newly engaged, our imaginations were required to translate the spoken words into mental pictures.
Listeners to radio had new brains.
—
It wasn’t more than 30 years from widespread radio that television came onto the scene. TV was something different than just radio with voices.
Our better angels shined a light into homes and battlefields across the world. It changed for the better how we viewed race, gender and class.
But our darker angels dimmed our imaginations. We could gaze all evening and disengage our brains.
Viewers of television had new – and slightly diminished –  brains.
For decades, the phrase “As seen on TV” sold as many products as it obliterated much critical thinking.
Not only did this work for commercial products, but it also extended to politicians.  A handsome, young, telegenic politician could capture a country.
—
And that brings us to today.
I don’t have to explain the Internet to you. You live it, you’re immersed in it. But let me take a minute to contrast it with the world I grew up in. I spent my first seventeen years in a city where there were just three major TV channels, three major newspapers, and no Internet. If I wanted to look something up, I had to go to library.  If I wanted to connect with a friend, I used a hardwired phone at a desk at home, or paid for each call by physically putting money into a phone in a booth.  And that was in New York City.  The rest of the world had much, much less.
The Net is like we invented writing, the printing press, radio, TV and the Internet in the same decade.  That’s the world you’re graduating into – immersed in social media, with infinite facts and continuous news.
The seventh wave in communication and brain rewiring has arrived. You think and process things differently from how your parents, grandparents and any other humans who have ever lived.
When each of the other six waves initially arrived, the early adopters were the more agile outliers. But ultimately, governments and companies figured out how to master the new technology and individuals lost, as the power of the state, and power of profit, controlled the new media. The same is true for the Internet.
Today, China, Russia, North Korea and other countries have locked their citizens behind a great firewall. They control what their citizens can see and access. Yet at the same time, Facebook, Google, Twitter and the rest of social media capture more personal information on you than any government security agency — except their goal is to profit from your presence.
So, What Does This Mean For You?
You’ve been in a university where information distribution in your classroom was not a democracy. There were voices of expertise and authority, you had certified data providers called professors. You didn’t vote on whether you believed what you were taught; in fact, you were graded on how well you understood it.
But you’re entering a world where you won’t have such certainty. Let me give you an example of the challenges you are going to face in a 24/7 Internet world on a personal level, as a citizen, and in your career.
You deal in streams of short-form information – 140 characters, pictures and messages that disappear. The question for you is: how will you deal with issues that are more complex than soundbites, and require deep dives?
Every generation has had to deal with “fake news” – deliberate misinformation spread by storytelling, books, newspaper, radio and TV. It had different names in the past — “yellow journalism,” propaganda, misinformation.
But unlike in previous generations, fake news today is like a social disease – you catch it from your “friends.”
And the feeling of validity that comes from hearing something from someone you know makes social media much more powerful than what you see on TV or read in a newspaper.
In your generation, Facebook is one of the leading sources of fake news. And that’s a shame, since Facebook is not a news source, it doesn’t originate news, it’s just a distributor of news – one designed to get you to spend time on their site, click on their ads and gather your personal information.
Today, AP and Bloomberg already have bots that write sports stories and earnings reports. Soon machines will make the news by optimizing stories for clicks. Before long computers will create fake videos – and we won’t be able to tell the difference between what was created by a human and what’s computer generated.
What kind of skills will you need to operate in a world of real and fake manufactured data coming from friends? Will you vote for people who value facts or manufacture them?
Will you let darker angels win as you add fire to the flame, or will you seek out and spread real news?
We’ve become digital junkies.
Information consumption and engagement with social media means these platforms have become your emotional drug dealers. “Likes” and thumbs up and posting on social media are addictive, at times like a chemical dependency. They provide immediate rewards after each interaction. They prey on the “fear of missing out” – of the moment or event. Your sense of identity and your values are now validated by a crowd.
Research shows that talking about your own views generates more emotional rewards than listening to conflicting ones. This becomes a self-reinforcing system as you seek out sources of information and other people that support your world view.  It creates a polarized world.
Addiction is one of our perpetual dark angels. You need a purpose-driven life to survive in a world where social media is monetizing both your emotions and your time spent looking at ads.
Finally, the Net has the power to pull us apart as well as bring us together
Each wave in the last 200,000 years – storytelling, writing, books, newspapers, radio, TV and the Net – started with the optimistic view that if we could communicate faster and more efficiently it would bring out the better angels of our nature. We could be more cohesive, we could be smarter, we could learn new things that would help us make the world a better place. All these things happened, and yet…
At each step forward, our darker angels found a way to use these tools, too.
In spite of that, today the human race is in a better place than in any time in human history. Each advancement in our capabilities to communicate gave us the ability to reject a world dominated by violence and ignorance for a world where knowledge and cooperation drove civilization forward.
—
Most revolutions are not obvious when they happen. When the first scribe wrote on a tablet, no one said, “This is the day everything changes.”  When the first Bible came off Gutenberg’s press, no one said, “There will be billions of these.”
I do not believe that any of you would exchange places with any other generation.
But the question is whether you’ll tell your children that this decade was the beginning of a new dark age, or whether it was the time of something new and wonderful. When it was the time the Internet and social media allowed us to work faster and more collaboratively. When scientific discoveries and technological breakthroughs were integrated into the fabric of society faster than they had ever been before. And when how businesses operated changed forever.
—
Now graduates of 2017, as you turn back to your phones, light a path for the better angels. The world is counting on you.
Thank you.

Books for Startups

Entrepreneurial Management Stack
Over the last few years we’ve discovered that startups are not smaller versions of large companies. The skills founders need are not covered by traditional books for MBA’s and large company managers. There are now a few books that specifically address founders needs. Alexander Osterwalder’s Business Model Generation is the first book that allows you to answer “What’s your business model?” intelligently and with precision. Make sure this one is on your shelf.
Osterwalders follow-on book Value Proposition Design describes how to get product/market fit right.  It’s another “must have” for your bookshelf.
Eric Ries was the best student I ever had. He took the Customer Development process, combined it with Agile Engineering, and actually did the first implementation in a startup. His insights about the combined Customer Development/Agile process and its implications past startups into large corporations is a sea change in thinking. His book, The Lean Startup is a “must have” for your shelf.
Ben Horowitz’s The Hard Thing About Hard Things is a series essays about what CEO face in the “Build” phase – the transition from searching for a business model into a company.
It’s impossible to implement any of this if you don’t understand Agile Development. Extreme Programming Explained by one of the pioneers of Agile, Kent Beck, is a great tutorial. If you don’t understand Values, Principles and Practices in XP it makes Customer Development almost impossible.
If you’re in a large company, The Other Side of Innovation makes sense of how to actually insert innovation into an execution organization.  If you’re starting a medical device company Biodesign:The Process of  Innovating Medical Technologies is a must have. It has a great customer discovery process.
Talking to Humans is a great simple primer on Customer Discovery.

Business Model Generation and Value Proposition Design: by Alexander Osterwalder
The Lean Startup: by Eric Ries
The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz
Extreme Programming Explained by Kent Beck
the other side of innovation – Vijay Govindarajan & Chris Trimble
Talking to Humans: Success Starts with Understanding Your Customers – by Giff Constable & Frank Rimalovski
Biodesign: The Process of  Innovating Medical Technologies by Zenios, Makower, Yock, et al  (great website here)
The Four Steps to the Epiphany:


Order Here
And my newest book, The Startup Owners Manual

The Founders Workbook – The Checklist Companion to the Startup Owners Manual

Must Read Books
The subtitle of Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital is the “dynamics of bubbles and golden ages”.  A must read to understand the long 50-year innovation cycle we’re in. The other side of innovation is the closest recipe I’ve read for getting entrepreneurship right in large companies. Innovator’s Dilemma and Innovator’s Solution helped me refine the notion of the Four types of Startup Markets.  I read these books as the handbook for startups trying to disrupt an established company. The Innovators DNA rings true about the skills founders need to have. Crossing the Chasm made me understand that there are repeatable patterns in early stage companies. It started my search for the repeatable set of patterns that preceded the chasm.  The Tipping Point has made me realize that marketing communications strategies for companies in New Markets often follow the Tipping Point. Blue Ocean Strategy is a great way to look at what I’ve called “market type.”

Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital – Carlota Perez
the other side of innovation – Vijay Govindarajan & Chris Trimble

The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference by Malcolm Gladwell
Blue Ocean Strategy: How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make Competition Irrelevant by R. Mauborgne and W. C. Kim

Strategy Books for Startups
The Marketing Playbook gives marketers five strategy options, teaches you gap analysis and offer tactical marketing campaign advice. Do More Faster identifies issues that first-time entrepreneurs encounter and offer useful advice. Getting Real is web-focussed. Wasserman’s Founders Dilemma is essential reading to building a great startup team.
These books are classics but timeless. The Entrepreneurial Mindset articulates the critically important idea that there are different types of startup opportunities.  The notion of three Market Types springs from here and Christensen’s work.  The book provides a framework for the early marketing/sales strategies essential in a startup.  Delivering Profitable Value talks more about value propositions and value delivery systems than you ever want to hear again.  However, this is one of the books you struggle through and then realize you learned something valuable. Schumpeter’s book Theory of Economic Development is famous for his phrase “creative destruction”  and its relevance to entrepreneurship. Peter Drucker’s Concept of the Corporation was the first insiders view of how a decentralized company (GM) works. His Practice of Management defined “management by objective” and Innovation and Entrepreneurship is a classic. While written for a corporate audience, read it for the sources of innovation. If you write software you already know about Fred Brooks classic text the Mythical Man Month. If you manage a software company you need to read it so you don’t act like Dilbert’s pointy-haired boss. Peppers and Rogers, The One to One Future opened my eyes to concepts of lifetime value, most profitable customers and the entire customer lifecycle of “get, keep and grow.” Bill Davidow’s Marketing High Technology introduced me to the concept of “whole product” and the unique needs of mainstream customers. Michael Porter is the father of competitive strategy. His books Competitive Strategy, Competitive Advantage, and On Competition are still the standards.

Innovation and Entrepreneurship in the Enterprise
How large companies can stay innovative and entrepreneurial has been the Holy Grail for authors of business books, business schools, consulting firms, etc.  There’s some great work from lots of authors in this area but I’d start by reading the other side of innovation. Next I’d read The Alchemy of Growth to understand the three horizons of innovation and The Future of Mangement and consider its implications.  Rita McGrath’s The End of Competitive Advantage shows companies how to take advantage of transient competitive advantage.  Stanley Mcchrystal’s Team of Teams is a real world example of chapter 6 of the Four Steps to the Epiphany.  Ed Catmull’s description of the Pixar innovation process in Creativity, Inc is a great synthesis of how founders in startup innovate translated into a corporate continuous innovation process.
Then I’d read the short Harvard Business Review articles. Eric Von Hippel work on new product introduction methodologies and the notion of “Lead Users” offer many parallels with Customer Discovery and Validation. But like most books on the subject it’s written from the point of view of a large company. Von Hippel’s four steps of 1) goal generation and team formation, 2) trend research, 3) lead user pyramid networking and 4) Lead User workshop and idea improvement is a more rigorous and disciplined approach then suggested in our book, the Four Steps to the Epiphany.  If you’re a mid-level manager in a company or government agency trying to figure out how to your ideas adopted, you need to own a copy of Rebels@Work – it will save your sanity. And Corporate Cultures is a classic about the stories, heroes, values, and rituals that build a corporate culture.

“War as Strategy” Books
The metaphor that business is war is both a cliché and points to a deeper truth.  Many basic business concepts; competition, leadership, strategy versus tactics, logistics, etc. have their roots in military affairs. The difference is that in business no one dies.  At some time in your business life you need to study war or become a casualty.  Sun Tzu covered all the basics of strategy in The Art of War until the advent of technology temporarily superseded him. Also, in the same vein try The Book of Five Rings by Miyamoto Musashi.  These two books have unfortunately turned into business clichés but they are still timeless reading.  Carl Von Clausewitz’s On War is a 19th century western attempt to understand war. The “Boyd” book, The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War is a biography and may seem out of place here, but John Boyd’s OODA loop is at the core of Customer Development and the Pivot. Read it and then look at all the web sites for Boyd papers, particularly Patterns of Conflict. The New Lanchester Strategy is so offbeat that it tends to be ignored.  Its ratios of what you require to attack or defend a market keep coming up so often in real life, that I’ve found it hard to ignore.

The Art of War by Sun Tzu, translated by Thomas Cleary, or the one by Griffith
The Book of Five Rings by Miyamoto Musashi
On War by Carl Von Clausewitz’s  Everyman’s Library Series
Boyd: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War by Robert Coram and/or
The Mind of War: John Boyd and American Security by Grant T. Hammond
Lanchester Strategy: An Introduction by Taoka and/or
New Lanchester Strategy: Sales and Marketing Strategy for the Weak (New Lanchester Strategy) by Shinichi Yano, Kenichi Sato, Connie Prener

Marketing Communications Books
Ries and Trout positioning books can be read in a plane ride, yet after all these years they are still a smack on the side of the head.  Regis McKenna has always been a favorite of mine. However, as you read Relationship Marketing separate out the examples Regis uses into either startups or large sustainable businesses.  What worked in one, won’t necessarily work in another.  Read these books first before you dive into the 21st century stuff like Seth Godin.
Seth Godin “gets deeply” the profound changes the internet is having in the way we think about customers and communicating with them.  Godin’s All Marketers are Liars talks about the power of storytelling in marketing. His Permission Marketing book crystallized a direct marketing technique (permission marketing), which was simply impossible to achieve pre-internet.  Read his Ideavirus after you’ve read Permission Marketing. Made to Stick gives you the tools to make your messages “sticky.” I put Sway here because great marketers know how to find these irrational behaviors Lakoff’s book, Don’t Think of an Elephant! while written for a political audience has some valuable insights on framing communications.

Sales
Lean Analytics is a great discussion about metrics that matter for web/mobile startups. Predictable Revenue is one of those short, smart, tactical books that you need to read if you have a direct sales force. Thomas Freese is the master of consultative selling. Both his books are a great start in understanding how a pro sells. Cracking the Sales Management Code provides a best practice approach to on how to effectively manage a sales force. Jeff Thull’s Mastering the Complex Sale has a lot of elements of Customer Discovery and Validation, but skip the first 50 pages. Many of the ideas of Customer Validation are based on the principles articulated by Bosworth, Heiman and Rackham. Bostworth’s Solution Selling and it’s successor, The New Solution Selling are must reads for any executive launching a new product.  Its articulation of the hierarchy of buyers needs as well its description of how to get customers to articulate their needs, makes this a “must read”, particularly those selling to businesses. Yet in his new book What Great Salespeople Do he says, ignore those books follow this advice. Heiman’s books are a bit more tactical and are part of a comprehensive sales training program from his company Miller-Heiman.  If you are in sales or have a sales background you can skip these.  But if you aren’t they are all worth reading for the basic “blocking and tackling” advice.  The only bad news is that Heiman writes like a loud salesman – but the advice is sound. Rackham’s Spin Selling is another series of books about major account, large ticket item sales, with again the emphasis on selling the solution, not features.  Lets Get Real is of the Sandler School of selling (another school of business to business sales methodology.) Jill Konrath has great strategies and insights for large sales. Baseline Selling uses baseball metaphors but it’s an effective explanation of how to do consultative selling. I sure could have used the Complete Idiots Guide to Cold Calling when it was just me and the telephone. The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing provides a great framework for thinking about “how much should I charge for this?”

Startup Law and Finance
If you don’t pay attention to the law from the day you start your company it can kill you. But most books (and lawyers) speak in their own arcane language. David Weekly’s An Introduction to Stock and Options should be your first read (unfortunately its Kindle only.)  The Entrepreneurs Guide to Business Law is the one book you ought to have on your shelf.  While not written explicitly for Silicon Valley startups it demystifies the most common areas you need to know. Term Sheets and Valuations is a great read if you’re faced with a term sheet and staring at words like “liquidation preferences and conversion rights” and don’t have a clue what they mean.  Read this and you can act like you almost understand what you are giving away.

Silicon Valley/Regional Clusters
Brad Feld’s Startup Communities posits a big idea: startup communities are driven by entrepreneurs who are the leaders and everyone else is a feeder. Essential reading if you’re trying to build your own cluster. Anna Lee Saxenian’s Regional Advantage  is the definitive text of why Silicon Valley beat Boston as the hub of U.S. entrepreneurship. Startup Nation is the story of how the Israeli government engineered the country into becoming the hottest cluster outside the U.S. for startups. In contrast, Josh Lerner’s Boulevard of Broken Dreams describes the multiple ways governments can screw up a cluster. Jessica Livingston’s Founders At Work are the best case studies/vignettes without a PR rewrite of how founders really start companies. The Startup Playbook  also does a good job of offering founders advice. An Engineer’s Guide to Silicon Valley Startups is one of those quirky books that perfectly match Silicon Valley culture. If you’re an engineer in the valley or coming out, this is a useful read. It describes what types of startups are there, how to get a job at one, negotiating your salary, stock options, etc. Geek Silicon Valley is part history and part travel guide. Also useful.

Venture Capital
If you buy one book to understand how VC’s and fund raising works, Venture Deals is the one. Wish I had it when I did startups. Same for Mastering the VC Game. If you read two books about how to deal with VC’s start here. The rest of the books are personal stories. Bill Draper’s book is both history and advice from a VC pioneer. If you have never experienced a startup first hand, Jerry Kaplan’s bookStartup and Michael Wolff’s book Burn Rate are good reads of a founder’s adventure with the venture capitalists.  Eboys is the story of Benchmark Capital during the Internet Bubble.  Ferguson’s book is a great read for the first time entrepreneur.  His personality and views of the venture capitalists and “suits” are a Rorschach ink blot test for the reader.

Startup Nuts & Bolts
Nesheim’s book High Tech Startup is the gold standard of the nuts and bolts of all the financing stages from venture capital to IPO’s. If you promise to ignore the marketing advice he gives you, Baird’s book, Engineering Your Startup is the cliff notes version in explaining the basics of financing, valuation, stock options, etc. Gordon Bells’ book High-Tech Venturesis incomprehensible on the first, second or third read.  Yet it is simply the best “operating manual” for startups that has been written.  (The only glaring flaw is Bell’s assumption that a market exists for the product and that marketing’s job is data sheets and trade shows.)  Read it in doses for insight and revelation and make notes, (think of reading the bible) rather than reading it straight through.

Startup Textbooks
If you take an entrepreneurship class in a Business School or University you’ll probably encounter one of these textbooks.The reason you don’t see them on the desks of working entrepreneurs is that at $100-$150+ they’re all priced for a captive student audience. (Some do have paperback versions for $50-$85.) The other uncomfortable fact is that most startups in Silicon Valley ignore these textbooks once they leave school. In the real-world startups are now built using the business model/customer development/agile engineering stack. Not one of these textbooks teach that.
Of all the texts, Technology Ventures is “the gold standard” of entrepreneurship textbooks. Jeff Timmons’ New Venture Creation has too much great stuff in it to ignore. At first read it is simply overwhelming but tackle it a bit a time and use it to test your business plan for completeness. Business Plans that Work summarizes the relevant part of Timmons’ New Venture Creation book and teaches how to write a document (the business plan) that no one ever reads. However, both books are worth having if you’re in a large company thinking about introducing follow-on products.

Manufacturing
I’ve yet to meet a manufacturing person that does not reference The Goal when talking about lean manufacturing principles first. It’s a book inside a novel – so it humanizes the manufacturing experience.  Lean Thinking is the best over all summary of the lean manufacturing genre. Toyota Production System is the father of all lean manufacturing – it’s simple tone is refreshing.

The Goal by Eliyahu Goldratt
Lean Thinking by James Womack
Toyota Production System: Beyond Large-Scale Production by Taiicho Ohno.
The Toyota Way by Jeffrey Liker

Presentation and Product Design
Nancy Duarte’s two books, Slid:eology and Resonate are about presentation design. These are the two books I refer entrepreneurs to who want to build a killer customer presentation. The advice may not work for all audiences but it’s a great place to start. Cooper’s book, The Inmates are Running the Asylum, is about product design. It had the same impact on me as Moore’s Crossing the Chasm – “why of course, that’s what’s wrong.”  It’s important and articulate.

Slid:eology and Resonate by Nancy Duarte
The Inmates Are Running the Asylum: Why High Tech Products Drive Us Crazy and How To Restore The Sanity by Alan Cooper

Culture/Human Resources
What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20 and InGenious are the books I give all young entrepreneurs.If you are in a large company and wondering why your company isn’t going anywhere your answers might be found in Good to Great.  Written by Jim Collins, the same author who wrote Built to Last, both are books that “you should be so lucky” to read.  What differentiates good companies versus great?  How do you institutionalize core values into a company that enable it to create value when the current management is long gone?  When I first read these, I thought they were only for companies that were lucky enough to get big.  Upon reflection, these books were the inspiration for the “Mission-Oriented Culture.”  Read these two books together.
Ironically, the best HR stuff for anyone in a startup to read is not a book.  It is the work James Baron at Stanford has done.    Download his slides on the Stanford Project on Emerging Companies.  Baron’s book, Strategic Human Resources – is a classic HR textbook. Finally, if you are working at a startup and wondering why the founder is nuts, The Founder Factor helps explain a few things.
I’m not sure how to characterize The Checklist Manifesto so I stuck it here. It’s a quick read with some insights that match why Business Model strategy need to be translated into Customer Development checklists.

Business History (See here for Silicon Valley History)
Alfred Sloan’s My Years with General Motors is a great read, but not for the traditional reasons.  Read it from the point of view of an entrepreneur (Durant) who’s built a great company by gut and instinct, got it to $200M and is replaced by the board.  Then watches as a world-class bureaucrat grows into one of the largest and best run companies in the world.  Make sure you read it in conjunction with Sloan Rules and A Ghost’s Memoir. If you’re an entrepreneur the one founder you probably never heard of but should is William Durant. Read Madsen’s biography. The Nudist on the Late Shift is a book you send to someone who lives outside of Silicon Valley who wants to know what life is like in a startup. If you want to understand how the modern corporation formed Chandlers’ Strategy and Structure is the “Ur text.”

Good collection, I can definitely endorse this.
However, it is crucial that any startup focuses on sales as the top priority (it’s easy to get caught up in the entrepreneurial literature, but that doesn’t pay the bills).
Going to a trade fair, talking to potential customers early, trying to build relationships and attempting an early sale are the crucial steps. But definitely have a read through Steve’s list in the evening.

Thanks so much for this fantastic list of books.  I was surprised by two omissions:
1) Art of the Start
2) Founders at Work
I think the two free videos of Jeff Haskins at the Stanford E-corner you highlight in your syllabus as incredibly on point too.
Finally, I’m curious if books on software (for instance Joel on Software), project management (for instance Scott Berkun), and outsourcing would be increasingly valuable as globalization revolutionizes what start ups look like and how they behave.
Again fantastic list….Looking forward to reading your book.

Thanks Steve,
A number of the books I have read, or have given to others in our team to review.  Some reviews are on our blog:
http://blog.global-roam.com/
I will be adding all the others to our shopping cart in due course (and we will also divvy up a watch on the blogs you mention).
However it surprises me that I did not see a mention of the following 3 books:
1)  “7 Habits” = http://blog.global-roam.com/index.php/1995/05/book-review-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people/      (about becoming a real person)
2)  “Speed of Trust” = http://blog.global-roam.com/index.php/2008/06/book-review-speed-of-trust/     (why it is important, and how to improve how someone trusts you)
3)  “Adversity Quotient” = http://blog.global-roam.com/index.php/2009/09/book-review-adversity-quotient-by-paul-g-stoltz/     (as you will need a high AQ, guaranteed, for your enterprise to succeed – AND, what’s more, you can improve it).
I give a copy of each of these books to pretty much everyone who comes to work with our company.  
An absolutely essential starting point in terms of human behaviour – start with the person first, before they are able to contributed interdependetly in an organisation.
Cheers
Paul

Fantastic list!
Cheers for Davidow, Miller & Heiman, Ries & Trout, and Goldratt.
I was surprised, though, that Competitive Stragey (Michael Porter) is not on this list. Forbes’ “Checklist: The 20 Most Important Questions In Business”, for example, relies heavily on Porter’s five forces. No business plan or ppt, or even value statement is complete without an understanding of competition.
http://www.forbes.com/2010/06/17/most-important-questions-in-business-entrepreneurs-management-small-business_slide.html 
Prolific A. David Silver (e.g. Venture Capital) might  also be considered for this list.
In the HR section, how about “Who” by Street and Smart? This definied ‘A Players’ and how to attract them.
With respect to an overall plan and execution, there are two books that jump to mind. Harnish’s “Mastering the Rockefeller Habits” builds a critical ‘Right Things Right’ model.  Second,  Thomson’s ‘Blueprint to a Billion” does a fantastic job of reverse engineering the seven critical sucess elements from those companies that made it big.

Hi Steve,
My current ACTiVATE class (see http://www.txstate.edu/activate for more details) is reading and discussing your Epiphany book.  The content is invaluable as we pursue the opportunities presented by tech transfer and own own entrepreneurial projects.  If you ever want input from a professional editor (I teach technical writing at the university level) for your next edition, please let me know.  I have been editing each chapter as we progress through our assignments and would be happy to discuss how an edited presentation of your experience/knowledge can communicate ideas more effectively.  Who knows, it might increase sales?  In any case, thanks for sharing your wisdom!

Hey Steve,
One of the most formative books recommended to me on complex sales is “Exceptional Selling” by Jeff Thull.  I found it to be very complimentary to your book “The four steps to the epiphany.”
I would be interested to here your perspective on this book.  I recommend it to budding entrepreneurs as it forces them to validate their value hypothesis with a “real” problem, the problem’s cost for the customer, and the priority of the problem for the customer.

Hi Steve,
Thanks for compiling very useful list of books and resources. I have read some and the rest I will when it may be required.
I wanted to thank you for a great presentation on ‘Retooling early stage startups’ at Stanford edcorner. I live in Tokyo and have listened to this when on the subway at least a 100 times and can almost say the words before you say it on the podcast 🙂 It is a testament to how valuable you words and thoughts have  been to me as I make way through various entrepreneurial ventures.
Would love to meet you if and when you do come to Tokyo. Your dinner will be on me. Seriously! So do give me a shout and I will be honoured to meet you.
Best regards.

I would like to add at least one book to the list. The topic is human behavior. As an entrepreneur I risk saying that on the end we’re all Illusionists, because we offer lust for a better future in uncertain present. And for us the only way to succeed is to create commitment, retention and passion on our customers, co-workers and employees. So the understanding of the mechanics of the human motivation, urgency and decision are key knowledges to the entrepreneur.

Hello Mr. Blank,
Why there is no audio book for your book “The four steps to the Epiphany” ?
It actually helpful for some readers to publish audio books, and here are the benefits I think that worth it:
* Listening and following the hardcover book at the same time double the comprehension, because I’m using two senses here..
* Some people like to hear audio books while driving and commuting.
Thanks

You forgot your brilliant talk from SLLconf 2010: http://www.justin.tv/startuplessonslearned/b/262670582
Or do you reckon it’s outdated now? In that case, what else should I refer to as a masterpiece talk of yours on the Lean Startup? 😉

I appreciate the great information, but this page is nearly unusable for me — it brings my browser (up-to-date Firefox) to its knees for about 15 minutes, and greatly slows down UI responsiveness for the machine as a whole during that time period. (I have an iMac that is only six months old and has 4GB of memory.) Safari seems to have just as much trouble with this page.

Please, please, please REMOVE the overwhelming multitude of embedded videos from this page that are actually loading and cuing videos to play.
The embedded YouTube videos are perfectly fine because YouTube makes embedding smart and easy, and their method of embedding is light in its resource demands.  
However, the additional videos that you have embedded from other hosting platforms like Videopress and Vimeo are resource hogs, and they are causing this page either to take MINUTES to load or to cause the browser (Firefox, Chrome, others) to crash in memory.
Instead, please provide links to these videos that launch in a new page or in unique viewer.  
Alternatively, you could also use a plugin to create a video gallery or unique player in WordPress.  The previous, recommended solution (link to video and open in new page or window), though, is easier and quicker to implement.
Please note that this problem was addressed to you in the comments by someone else almost 2 years ago and has obviously either not merited the attention it deserves or has simply not been corrected for reasons unknown.  Please see “Kevin Van Horn, on December 30, 2012 at 11:44 am said:” 
Just because a new Macbook or PC with 6, 8, 12GB of RAM and its i5, i7 CPU can handle the demands of the massive data on this page does not mean that lesser endowed Macbooks, laptops, iPads, Android tablets, iPhones or Android phones can.
Without adding the NoScript plugin to the Firefox browser and interrupting the loading of the page, the incredible resource demands of all of these embedded videos causes Firefox to crash in memory over and over and over again. 
The Chrome browser has a similar experience, regardless of the device (laptop, tablet or smartphone).
The net effect of the huge amount of data and its requisite memory and processor demands is that the access to your content has been put behind an exclusive wall for an elite minority of users with the requisite higher end devices and that your much wider audience for this content has been effectively blocked from accessing it.  
What is the point of sharing knowledge to a gated community?
We very much want to hear what you have to say and learn what you have to teach, but the chosen method of sharing it on this page has effectively made that desired goal nearly impossible.
Please hear this sincere request for change and act to make it a reality.
If you need my help, you have my email address.  Please feel free to contact me.
Thank you.

Hi steve, your HBR paper was great and recently I stumbled upon your MOOC at udacity on ” how to build a startup”. Abour 90 MBA students are taking this MOOC at Alliance University, Bangalore, India which is presently midway.
There is a request from here. Can you come on a live skype session with these youngsters from Bangalore India, talk to them and clear their doubts at a convenient time in the next two weeks ? It will def give a great thrust for the lean startup ecosystem in India.
Thanks, regards,
George..

About Steve

Put to a vote, I might have been chosen “least likely to succeed” in my New York City high school class. My path has taken me from repairing fighter planes in Thailand during the Vietnam War (a member of the Society of Wild Weasels), to spook stuff in undisclosed location(s), and I was lucky enough to arrive at the beginning of the boom times of Silicon Valley in 1978.
After 21 years in 8 high technology companies, I retired in 1999. I co-founded my last company, E.piphany, in my living room in 1996. My other startups include two semiconductor companies, Zilog and MIPS Computers, a workstation company Convergent Technologies, a consulting stint for a graphics hardware/software spinout Pixar, a supercomputer firm, Ardent, a computer peripheral supplier, SuperMac, a military intelligence systems supplier, ESL and a video game company, Rocket Science Games.
Total score: two large craters (Rocket Science and Ardent), one dot.com bubble home run (E.piphany) and several base hits.
After I retired, I took some time to reflect on my experience and wrote a book (actually my class text) about building early stage companies called Four Steps to the Epiphany. It’s been called the book that launched the Lean Startup movement. My latest book, co-authored with Bob Dorf, The Startup Owners Manual integrates 10 years of new knowledge (and fixes lots of typos.)
I moved from being an entrepreneur to teaching entrepreneurship to both undergraduate and graduate students at U.C. Berkeley, Stanford University, Columbia University, NYU and UCSF. The “Customer Development” model that I developed in my book is one of the core themes in these classes and the core of the Lean Startup movement.  In 2009, I was awarded the Stanford University Undergraduate Teaching Award in the department of Management Science and Engineering. The same year, the San Jose Mercury News listed me as one of the 10 Influencers in Silicon Valley. In 2010, I was awarded the Earl F. Cheit Outstanding Teaching Award at U.C. Berkeley Haas School of Business.
In 2011 at the request of the National Science Foundation I modified my Lean Launchpad class and it became the curriculum for the NSF I-Corps. Science wrote an article about the I-Corps and so did Nature, the Economist, and Forbes. National Public Radio did a story on the class here and so did the San Jose Mercury. I testified in front of Congress about the success and future of the program.
In 2012 the Harvard Business Review listed me as one of the “Masters of Innovation” and I was the keynote at the National Governors Conference. My talk was on C-Span here, slides are here.  I write weekly for the Wall Street Journal Accelerators blog and occasionally for Forbes, the Huffington Post and in Japan for NikkeiBP.
In 2013 Forbes listed me as one of the 30 most influential people in Tech. The May 2013 Harvard Business Review cover story was my article, “Why the Lean Startup Changes Everything” and in June I won the 2013 Silicon Valley Visionary Forum award, and the same month my wife and I were honored with the 2013 Northern California Environmental Leadership award.
All my coursework, syllabuses, and presentations can be found here. In 2012 I put my Lean LaunchPad class on-line and over 250,000 students are taking it. The NY Times had a few things to say about my work here, here and here.
In 2013 I partnered with UCSF  and the National Science Foundation to offer the Lean LaunchPad class for Life Science and Healthcare (therapeutics, diagnostics, devices and digital health.) In 2014 the National Science Foundation and NCIIA awarded me the Outstanding Leadership Award for my work on developing the Innovation Corps curriculum.
In 2014 I took the UCSF Life Science curriculum, and in conjunction with the National Science Foundation, we developed and launched the I-Corps@NIH program. Four National Institutes of Health divisions; NCI, NHBLI, NCATS and NINDS sponsored 21 teams in therapeutics, diagnostics and medical devices to accelerate how research gets from the lab bench to the bedside.
In 2015 I helped launch the Lean LaunchPad for Synthetic Biology in the UK at Imperial College in London. I began co-hosting the Entreprenuers Are Everywhere radio program on SiriusXM channel 111. My second article in Nature described the I-Corps @ NIH class.
In 2016 I co-launched two new classes at Stanford – Hacking for Defense and its sister class – Hacking for Diplomacy. Stanford, Bloomberg and the LA Times talked about the classes here,  here and here. I made the list in the Thinkers50 global ranking of management thinkers.
I’ve guest written for several publications including the Huffington Post, Wall Street Journal, Harvard Business Review and the Peoples Daily.
I also followed my curiosity about why entrepreneurship blossomed in Silicon Valley and was stillborn elsewhere. It has led to several talks on The Secret History of Silicon Valley.
I served as a public official on the California Coastal Commission for seven years, (the public body which regulates land use and public access on the California coast,) I was on the board of the California League of Conservation Voters (CLCV), the Expert Advisory Panel for the California Ocean Protection Council as well as on the boards of Audubon California (and its past chair), the Audubon National Board as well as the Peninsula Open Space Land Trust (POST) and I was a trustee of the U.C. Santa Cruz foundation.
I was the commencement speaker at Philadelphia University in 2011. Text of the speech is here. In 2013 I was the commencement speaker at the University of Minnesota. Text of the speech is here.  In 2014 I was the commencement speaker at ESADE Business School in Barcelona. Text of the speech is here. I was the 2016 commencement speaker at NYU’s engineering school. In 2017 I was the commencement speaker at Dalhousie University. NPR selected the Philadelphia University speech as one of the 300 best commencement speeches in the last 300 years.

We Have A Moral Obligation

		Posted on June 21, 2017 by steveblank	

I was in Boston and was interviewed by The Growth Show about my current thinking about innovation in companies and government agencies.The interviewer was great and managed to get me to summarize several years of learning in one podcast.
It’s worth a listen.
At the end of the interview I got surprised by a great question – “What’s the Problem that Still Haunts You?”  I wasn’t really prepared for the question but gave the best answer I could on the fly.
Part of the answer is the title of this blog post.
Listen to the entire interview here:
Taking the Lean Startup From Silicon Valley to Corporations and the State and Defense Department

Hacking for Defense @ Stanford 2017 – Lessons Learned Presentations

		Posted on June 8, 2017 by steveblank	

We just finished our second Hacking for Defense class at Stanford. Eight teams presented their Lessons Learned presentations.
Hacking for Defense is a battle-tested problem-solving methodology that runs at Silicon Valley speed. It combines the same Lean Startup Methodology used by the National Science Foundation to commercialize science, with the rapid problem sourcing and curation methodology developed on the battlefields in Afghanistan and Iraq by Colonel Pete Newell and the US Army’s Rapid Equipping Force.
Goals for the Hacking for Defense Class
Our primary goal was to teach students entrepreneurship while they engaged in a national public service. Today if college students want to give back to their country they think of Teach for America, the Peace Corps, or Americorps or perhaps the US Digital Service or the GSA’s 18F. Few consider opportunities to make the world safer with the Department of Defense, Intelligence Community or other government agencies.
Our second goal was to teach our sponsors (the innovators inside the Department of Defense (DOD) and Intelligence Community (IC)) that there is a methodology that can help them understand and better respond to rapidly evolving asymmetric threats. That if we could get teams to rapidly discover the real problems in the field using Lean methods, and only then articulate the requirements to solve them, could defense acquisition programs operate at speed and urgency and deliver timely and needed solutions.
Finally, we also wanted to show our sponsors in the Department of Defense and Intelligence community that civilian students can make a meaningful contribution to problem understanding and rapid prototyping of solutions to real-world problems.
The Class
Here’s a brief description of the Lean Methodology our students used:

If you can’t see the video click here
Our mantra to the students was that we wanted them to learn about “Deployment not Demos.” Our observation is that the DOD has more technology demos than they need, but often lack deep problem understanding.  Our goal was to have the students first deeply understand their sponsors problem – before they started building solutions. As you can imagine with a roomful of technologists this was tough. Further we wanted the students to understand all parts of the mission model canvas, not just the beneficiaries and the value proposition. We wanted them to learn what it takes to get their product/service deployed to the field, not give yet another demo to a general. This meant that the minimal viable products the students built were focused on maximizing their learning of what to build, not just building prototypes.
(Our sponsors did remind us, that at times getting a solution deployed meant that someone did have to see a demo!)
The Hacking for Defense class was designed as “fundamental research” to be shared broadly and the results are not subject to restriction for proprietary or national security reasons. In the 10 weeks the students have, Hacking for Defense hardware and software prototypes don’t advance beyond a Technology Readiness Level 4 and remain outside the scope of US export control regulations and restrictions on foreign national participation.
Results

Eight teams spoke to over 800 beneficiaries, requirements writers, program managers, warfighters, legal, security, customers, etc.
Seven out of the eight teams realized that the problem as given by the sponsor really wasn’t the problem. Their sponsors agreed.
Received from a problem sponsor mid-live stream broadcast “we are working funding for this team now.”
Over half the student teams have decided to continue working on national security projects after this class.

This is the End
Each of the eight teams presented a 2-minute video to provide context about their problem and then gave an 8-minute presentation of their Lessons Learned over the 10-weeks. Each of their slide presentation follow their customer discovery journey. All the teams used the Mission Model Canvas, Customer Development and Agile Engineering to build Minimal Viable Products, but all of their journeys were unique.
The teams presented in front of several hundred people in person and online.

The Innovation Insurgency Spreads
Hacking for Defense is now offered at eight universities in addition to Stanford – Georgetown,  University of Pittsburgh, Boise State, UC San Diego, James Madison University, University of Southern Mississippi, and later this year University of Southern California and Columbia University. We established Hacking for Defense.org a non-profit, to train educators and to provide a single point of contact for connecting the DOD/IC sponsor problems to these universities.
The Department of Defense has expanded their use of Hacking for Defense to include a classified version, and corporate partners are expanding their efforts to support the course and to create their own internal Hacking for Defense courses.
Another surprise was how applicable the “Hacking for X…” methodology is for other problems. Working with the State Department we offered a Hacking for Diplomacy class at Stanford.
Both the Defense and Diplomacy classes created lots of interest from organizations that have realized that this “Hacking for X…” problem-solving methodology is equally applicable to solving public safety, energy, policy, community and social issues internationally and within our own communities. This fall a series of new “Hacking for X…” classes will address these deserving communities. These include:

Hacking for Impact (helping NGO’s and Nonprofits) at Berkeley
Hacking for Energy at Columbia
Hacking for Urban Resilience (Cities) at Stanford
Hacking for Journalism at Stanford

If you’re interested in learning how to apply a “Hacking for X…” class in your workplace or school we’ve partnered with the 1776 incubator in Washington DC to offer a 2-day “Hacking for X…” certification course 26-27 July for those interested in learning how. Sign up here.
It Takes a Village
While I authored this blog post, these classes are a team project. The teaching team consisted of:

Joe Felter a retired Army Special Forces Colonel with research and teaching appointments at Stanford’s Center for International Security and Cooperation (CISAC), the Hoover Institution, and the dept. of Management Science and Engineering. Joe is the incoming Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for South and Southeast Asia.
Pete Newell is a retired Army Colonel currently a Senior Visiting Research Fellow at the National Defense University’s Center for Technology and National Security Policy and CEO of BMNT Partners.
Steve Weinstein a 30-year veteran of Silicon Valley technology companies and Hollywood media companies.  Steve is CEO of MovieLabs the joint R&D lab of all the major motion picture studios.

Our teaching assistants were all prior students: Issac Matthews our lead TA, and Melisa Tokmak, Jared Dunnmon, and Darren Hau.
We were lucky to get a team of 25 mentors (VC’s and entrepreneurs) who selflessly volunteered their time to help coach the teams. Thanks to the team Lean Startup mentors: Paul Dawes, Tom Bedecarre, Kevin Ray, Craig Seidel, Daniel Bardenstein, Roi Chobadi, Donna Slade, and Rafi Holtzman and other advisors; Lisa Wallace, Peter Higgins, Steve Hong, Robert Medve.
We were privileged to have the support of an extraordinary all volunteer team of professional senior military officers representing all branches of service attending fellowship programs at Stanford’s Hoover Institution, and Center for International Security and Cooperation (CISAC) and Asia Pacific Research Center (APARC) at the Freeman Spogli Institute (FSI). These included: Colonel Lincoln Bonner (US Air Force), Colonel Curtis Burns (US Army), Captain Kurt Clark (US Coast Guard), Lieutenant Colonel Kurt Helphinstine (US Air Force), Colonel Seth Krummrich (US Army)), Commander Leo Leos (US Navy), Lieutenant Colonel Eric Reid (US Marine Corps), Colonel Mike Turley (US Army), and Colonel Dave Zinn US Army.  Additional volunteers from the active duty military providing support to our teams included  Lieutenant Colonel Donny Haseltine (US Marine Corps), Captain Jason Rathje (US Air Force), Major Dave Ahern US Army) and, Major Kevin Mott (US Army).
And finally a special thanks to our course advisor Bill Perry, former Secretary of Defense and Professor Emeritus, and Tom Byers, Professor of Engineering and Faculty Director, STVP.

Herding Cats – Using Lean to Work Together

		Posted on March 28, 2017 by steveblank	

When Colonel Peter Newell headed up the Army’s Rapid Equipping Force (REF) he used lean methods on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan to provide immediate technology solutions to urgent problems.
Today, his company BMNT does for government and commercial customers what the Rapid Equipping Force did for the U.S. Army.
Pete and I created the Hacking for Defense class (with Joe Felter and Tom Byers.) One of the problems our students run into is that there are always multiple beneficiaries and stakeholders associated with a problem, often with conflicting value propositions and missions.  So how do you figure out whose needs to satisfy?
Here’s Pete’s view of how you do it.

Unlike businesses, government organizations don’t sell products, and they don’t earn revenue. Instead, they have missions to accomplish and very hard problems to solve.  They use a variant of the Business Model Canvas –  the Mission Model Canvas – to map their hypotheses, and they get of the building to do beneficiary discovery. (A beneficiary can be a soldier, program manager, commanding general, government contractor, stakeholder, customer, etc.)  And just like in a commercial business they are trying to determine whether the value proposition solves the problem and helps the beneficiary accomplish their mission.
Discovery for both business and government is similar in that the only way to do it is to turn assumptions into facts by generating hypotheses, developing Minimum Viable Products and getting out of the building to test those MVP’s in the trenches where the customers and beneficiaries work. Early in the discovery process, teams are faced with a cacophony of personalities and organizations. Often, they struggle with understanding which person or group represents a beneficiary, supporter, advocate or potential key partner. It’s only through repetitive hypothesis testing that they begin to sort them all out.
It’s in the trenches however, where things become different.
Multiple Beneficiaries, Multiple Conflicts
Unlike their commercial counterparts, government problem solvers are often faced with multiple beneficiaries associated with a problem, often with conflicting value propositions. As these differences become apparent, teams must make decisions about the value proposition trade-offs between conflicting beneficiaries – sometimes even pivoting completely in favor of one beneficiary to the detriment of another.
During last year’s Hacking for Defense class at Stanford Team Aqualink experienced the conflicting beneficiaries’ problem.  The result was a significant pivot of both beneficiary and value proposition.
Aqualink started with a problem given to them from the chief medical officer of the Navy SEALS – they had no way to understand chronic long-term health issues divers face. Divers work 60 to 200 feet underwater for 2-4 hours, but Navy doctors currently have no way to monitor divers’ core temperature, maximum dive pressure, blood pressure, pulse and the rebreather (air consumption), or the dive computer (dive profile) data.

Having all this new data would give a diver early warning of hypothermia or the bends. More importantly the data would allow the medical director to individually assess the short and long-term health of each diver. And medical researchers would have access to detailed physiological data. The medical director tasked the team with building a wearable sensor system and developing apps that would allow divers to monitor their own physiological conditions while underwater and to download it for later analysis.
In the first week of the class this team got out of the building, suited up in full Navy diving gear and did customer discovery by spending an hour in the life of the beneficiary.
But as the students on the Aqualink team spoke to the SEAL team divers, (another one of their beneficiaries), they experienced an existential crisis. Most of the divers were “ambivalent” (read hostile) about the introduction of a vitals monitoring platform, (“If you gave to us at 0900, it would end up on the bottom of the ocean by 0905.”) Having worked so hard to get into the SEALS, no diver wanted doctors telling them they could no longer dive.
After further questioning, the team discovered the reason the divers were spending so much time underwater – they often did not know where they were. To find out, they had to get a GPS fix. This meant their minisub (called the SEAL Delivery Vehicle) had to rise to within 6 feet of the ocean surface so the GPS antenna could broach the surface. And to do so they had to surface slowly to avoid giving the divers the bends.
The divers told our student team, “Screw the health sensors. Build us a GPS sensor that can be deployed from 100 feet underwater.”
Now the team had a dilemma. They would have to decide which beneficiary to focus on – the SEAL Team medical director, who was the sponsor of their problem, or the operators of the delivery vehicle and divers within SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team One, along with their immediate chains of command in SDVT-1 and Naval Special Warfare Group 3.
When they went back to the medical director with their findings, he was surprised as they were.  “Never knew that’s why they spent all that time down there.  Heck, yes, fix their problem first.”


Understanding the Problem Context and Problem Ecosystem
As Aqualink shows, getting out of the building – interviewing the beneficiaries, drawing their workflows and mapping a day-in -their-life – will give you a more complete picture of the context in which a proposed problem exists. Talking to multiple beneficiaries will lead to better understanding of the entire ecosystem of the problem. Often this will show that the problem you have been given is merely a symptom of a larger problem, or is the result of a different problem.
The solution is to:

Cross check the results of your discovery between different beneficiaries. Often, you’ll find that they seldom have a complete understanding of one another’s workflows and pain points but instead are championing the solution to a mere symptom of a different problem.
Share what you learned in discovery among the different beneficiaries. This will arm you with the tools needed to get them (or their leadership) to agree on the right problem that needs to be solved first. In many cases this will lead to your first pivot!

The goal is to sort out who has a value proposition that must be addressed first.
The power of beneficiaries helping one another
While discovery with multiple beneficiaries can be confusing and exhausting, there is immense power when all the beneficiaries work together. Therefore, the goal of customer discovery is not just to understand the pains and gains of individual beneficiaries, but to find a shared purpose between all of them.
Once they understand they share the same goal, they can solve pain points or create gains for each other using the resources they already control. A “shared” sense of purpose is a very powerful step in the pathway towards a deployable solution.
When the Department of Energy asked BMNT to build a training program for getting veterans into advanced manufacturing jobs, we saw the power of a shared purpose between multiple beneficiaries first hand.
The problem we were asked to solve is that of the 10,000 veterans who leave military service every month, many remain unemployed or underemployed, yet at the same time the number of unfilled advanced manufacturing jobs in the U.S. is expected to climb to over a million by 2020. From a business perspective, obtaining technically qualified talent is among the top constraints to growth in the US.
Seems like it would be a match made in heaven, right?  Not so fast…
While we initially thought the beneficiaries of the effort were the veterans, we quickly discovered there were other beneficiaries in advanced manufacturing. We found these additional beneficiaries had different pains and gains which in turn required different value propositions to solve their problems.
Our customer discovery taught us that there were three additional beneficiaries:

Universities needed to grow their enrollments. Our discovery showed us universities were willing to create programming for Advanced Manufacturing, but first needed to see a business case for how it would increase their enrollment to make it a worthwhile effort.
Industry needed to attract and hire qualified employees. We learned that technically qualified employees within industry were in such demand that the number one way to get qualified employees was to pilfer them from others.
Government Agencies needed to help their communities build skilled labor pools to attract new industries.

And we learned that our initial beneficiary, veterans leaving service, didn’t need internships or low-paying jobs, but needed jobs that paid enough to support their families.
We found each of these beneficiaries had a shared purpose. And each of them had a value proposition that would create a gain or relieve a pain point for another beneficiary. These were big ideas.
We found that as these overlapping value propositions emerged, we used the results to get the beneficiaries to come together in a workshop designed to jointly create a shared minimum viable product that they could then use to test within their own organizations.
Bringing the groups together in a workshop also served to align value propositions between beneficiaries by demonstrating that there was a way to create a single program that served all their needs. And we created an environment that allowed each beneficiary to discover that the other beneficiaries were partners they could work with in the future.
What was the impact of bringing the beneficiaries together in a workshop and creating this beneficiary ecosystem for advanced manufacturing?
Lawrence Livermore National Lab (LLNL) created a veterans’ jobs program. They teamed with a local college to create internships that allowed veterans to work during the summer.  In turn, the local college created additional advanced manufacturing classes to meet LLNL’s technical needs and the regional workforce investment board provided funding.
In Fort Riley, the Army base in Kansas, the military teamed with Kansas State University to create an advanced manufacturing program. Kansas State created a series of advanced manufacturing classes. Soldiers leaving the service can take these courses at a nearby campus beginning up to six months before they leave service.
An unexpected consequence is that today there are soldiers from Fort Riley using advanced manufacturing processes to create parts for vehicles and equipment at the Army base.
Lessons learned


Government problem solvers will often be faced with multiple beneficiaries with different value propositions. Share what you learn from different beneficiaries with each other to sort out which has a value proposition that must be addressed first.
The benefit of having multiple beneficiaries is that their strengths can be used to help one another create gains and relieve pains for one another. Creating a shared sense of empowerment from working together smooths the pathway towards scaling the right solution.

Don’t let process distract you from finding the strategy

		Posted on February 28, 2017 by steveblank	

When you’re up to your neck in alligators, don’t forget the goal was to drain the swamp.
I love teaching because I learn something new every class.
This time it was, “Don’t let process distract you from finding the strategy.”

The latest “aha” moment for me when I was at Columbia University teaching an intensive 5-day version of the Lean LaunchPad/I-Corps class.  The goal of the class is to expose students to the basics of the Lean Methodology – Business Model Design, Customer Development and Agile Engineering.
In this short version of the class, students (in teams of four) spend half their day out of the classroom testing their hypotheses by talking to customers and building minimum viable products.  The teams come back into the class and present what they found, and then they get out and talk to more customers.  Repeat for 5 days.  All teams talk to at least 50 customers/ partners/ stakeholders, and some manage to reach more than 100.
One of the teams wanted to create a new woman’s clothing brand. The good news is that they were passionate, smart and committed.  The not so good news is that other than having been customers, none of them had ever been in the fashion business. But hey, no problem.  They had the Lean Startup model to follow. They could figure it out by simply talking to customers and stores that carry unique fashion brands.  How hard can this be?!
By the second day the team appeared to be making lots of progress –  they had talked to many women about their clothing line, and had marched up and down NY stores talking to buyers in clothing boutiques.  They built detailed value proposition canvases for each customer segment (young urban professional woman, students, etc.) –  trying to match customer pains, gains and jobs to be done with their value proposition (their new clothing line.) They were busily testing their hypotheses about customer segments and value proposition, seeing if they could find product/market fit.
In listening to them it dawned on me that I had fallen victim to teaching process rather than helping the teams gain insight. I asked them to remind the class what business they were in.  “We’re creating a clothing fashion brand,” was the reply.  I asked, “And how much fashion brand expertise do you have as a team?” “None, we’re using customer discovery to quickly acquire it.”  On the surface, it sounded like a good answer.
But then I asked, “Has anyone on your team asked if any of your 120 classmates are in the apparel/fashion business?”  After a moment of reflection they did just that, and eight of their classmates raised their hands. I asked, “Do you think you might want to do customer discovery first on the domain experts in your own class?”  A small lightbulb appeared over their heads.
A day later, after interviewing their classmates, the team discovered that when creating a woman’s clothing brand, the clothing itself has less to do with success than the brand does. And the one critical element in creating a brand is getting written about by a small group (less than 10) of “brand influencers” (reviewers, editors, etc.) in fashion magazines and blogs.
Whoah… the big insight was that how you initially “get” these key influencers – not customers or stores – is the critical part of creating a clothing fashion brand. This meant understanding these influencers was more important than anything else on the business model canvas. The team immediately added brand influencers to their business model canvas, created a separate value proposition canvas for them and started setting up customer discovery interviews.
The lessons?

This team was entering an existing market. (The team had already drawn the Petal Diagram mapping the competitive landscape.)
In an existing market there is a track record for how new entrants create a brand, get traction and scale. Many of the key insights about the business model and value proposition canvases are already known.
In an existing market, going through customer discovery (talking to customers, buyers, distribution channel, etc.) without first asking, “Are there any insights that can be gained by understanding the incumbent strategies, can be a trap for the unwary.”

Ironically, when I was entrepreneur I knew and practiced this. When I started a new venture in existing markets I would spend part of my initial customer discovery attending conferences, reading analysts’ reports and talking to domain experts to understand current market entry strategies. (None of this obligated me to follow the path of other companies. At times I took this information and created a different strategy to disrupt the incumbents.) But as an educator I was getting trapped in teaching the process not the strategy.
The fashion brand team’s experience was a great wake-up call.
From now on my first question to startups in an existing market is: “Tell me the critical success factors of the existing incumbents.”
Lessons Learned


In an existing market, draw a Petal Diagram with adjacent companies
Focus part of your initial customer discovery on learning competitive insights.
Describe how those companies entered the market. What was critical?

Innovation – something both parties can agree on

		Posted on January 15, 2017 by steveblank	

On the last day Congress was in session in 2016, Democrats and Republicans agreed on a bill that increased innovation and research for the country.
For me, seeing Congress pass this bill, the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act, was personally satisfying. It made the program I helped start, the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps (I-Corps) a permanent part of the nation’s science ecosystem. I-Corps uses Lean Startup methods to teach scientists how to turn their discoveries into entrepreneurial, job-producing businesses.  I-Corps bridges the gap between public support of basic science and private capital funding of new commercial ventures. It’s a model for a government program that’s gotten the balance between public/private partnerships just right. Over 1,000 teams of our nation’s best scientists have been through the program.
The bill directs the expansion of I-Corps to additional federal agencies and academic institutions, as well as through state and local governments.  The new I-Corps authority also supports prototype or proof-of-concept development activities, which will better enable researchers to commercialize their innovations. The bill also explicitly says that turning federal research into companies is a national goal to promote economic growth and benefit society. For the first time, Congress has recognized the importance of government-funded entrepreneurship and commercialization education, training, and mentoring programs specifically saying that this will improve the nation’s competitiveness. And finally this bill acknowledges that networks of entrepreneurs and mentors are critical in getting technologies translated from the lab to the marketplace.
This bipartisan legislation was crafted by senators Cory Gardner (R–CO) and Gary Peters (D–MI). Senator John Thune (R–SD) chairs the Senate commerce and science committee that crafted S. 3084. After years of contention over reauthorizing the National Science Foundation, House Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith and Ranking Member Eddie Bernice Johnson worked to negotiate the agreement that enabled both the House and the Senate to pass this bill.
While I was developing the class at Stanford, it was my counterparts at the NSF who had the vision to make the class a national program.  Thanks to Errol Arkilic, Don Millard, Babu Dasgupta, Anita LaSalle (as well as current program leaders Lydia McClure, Steven Konsek) and the over 100 instructors at the 53 universities who teach the program across the U.S.
But I haven’t forgotten that before everyone else thought that teaching scientists how to build companies using Lean Methods might be a good for the country, there was one congressman who got it first.  IN 2012, Representative Dan Lipinski (D-Il), co-chair of the House STEM Education Caucus, got on an airplane and flew to Stanford to see the class first-hand.
For the first few years Lipinski was a lonely voice in Congress saying that we’ve found a better way to train our scientists to create companies and jobs.
This bill is a reauthorization of the 2010 America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science (COMPETES) Act, which set out policies that govern the NSF, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and federal programs on innovation, manufacturing, and science and math education. Reauthorization bills don’t fund an agency, but they provide policy guidance.  It resolved partisan differences over how NSF should conduct peer review and manage research.
I-Corps is the  accelerator that helps scientists bridge the commercialization gap between their research in their labs and wide-scale commercial adoption and use.
Why This Matters
While a few of the I-Corps teams are in web/mobile/cloud, most are working on advanced technology projects that don’t make TechCrunch. You’re more likely to see their papers (in material science, robotics, diagnostics, medical devices, computer hardware, etc.) in Science or Nature.
I-Corps uses everything we know about building Lean Startups and Evidence-based Entrepreneurship to connect innovation to entrepreneurship. It’s curriculum is built on a framework of business model design, customer development and agile engineering – and its emphasis on evidence, Lessons Learned versus demos, makes it the worlds most advanced accelerator. It’s success is measured not only by the technologies that leave the labs, but how many U.S. scientists and engineers we train as entrepreneurs and how many of them pass on their knowledge to students. I-Corps is our secret weapon to integrate American innovation and entrepreneurship into every U.S. university lab.
Every time I go to Washington and spend time at the National Science Foundation or National Institute of Health I’m reminded why the U.S. leads the world in support of basic and applied science.  It’s not just the money we pour into these programs (~$125 billion/year), but the people who have dedicated themselves to make the world a better place by advancing science and technology for the common good.
Congratulations to everyone in making the Innovation Corps a national standard.

Hacking for Diplomacy @ Stanford –What We Learned With the State Department

		Posted on December 12, 2016 by steveblank	

“Being in Silicon Valley, a lot of my friends want to work for Google or Apple, but this class showed me that the problems in public service were even more challenging and rewarding. I used to watch the news about Syrian refugees and feel that I was just a bystander to a hopeless situation. But this class helped me realize I can have an impact and be part of the solution.”
Hacking for Diplomacy student
We just held our final week of the Hacking for Diplomacy class, teaching students entrepreneurship and “Lean Startup” principles while they engaged in national public service applying advanced technologies to solve global challenges. Seven student teams delivered their final Lessons Learned presentations documenting their intellectual journey over just 10 short weeks in front of several hundred people in person and online. And what a journey it’s been.
In this class, we partnered with sponsors in the State Department including:

Office of Space and Advanced Technology
Bureau of Political-Military Affairs
Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations
Bureau of Counterterrorism and Countering Violent Extremism
Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration

Office of Assistance to Europe, Central Asia, & the Americas
Office of Assistance to the Near East


Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons

Our sponsors treated our students like serious problem solvers who could contribute unique technical skills and unfettered customer access. In exchange the sponsors got access to fresh ideas, new technology and a new perspective on serious problems.
By the end of the class our sponsors inside State had experienced a practical example of a new and powerful methodology which could help them better understand and deal with complicated international problems and apply technology where appropriate.
And finally, our students learned that they could serve their country without having to put on a uniform. Today, if college students want to give back to their country, most think of Teach for America, the Peace Corps, or Americorps or perhaps if you wanted to offer your technical skills, the US Digital Service or the GSA’s 18F. Few consider opportunities to make the world safer with the State Department, Department of Defense, Intelligence Community or other government agencies.
(This post is a continuation of a series. See all the posts about Hacking for Diplomacy here.)
Lessons Learned – Not a Demo Day
Silicon Valley folks are familiar with Demo Days – presentations where the message is: “Here’s how smart we are right now.” That’s nice, but it doesn’t let the audience know, “Is that how smart you were three months ago, did you get smarter or dumber, what did you learn?”
Hacking for Diplomacy Lessons Learned presentations are different. Each team presents a two-minute video to provide context about their problem and then presents for eight minutes about the Lessons Learned over their ten weeks in the class.
As an example, Team Trace worked with the State Department Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons. The team was challenged to help companies push policies of responsible business lower down the supply chain. The key thing to note in this presentation is not only that the team came up with a solution, but also how in talking to 85 people, their understanding of the problem evolved, and as it did, so did their solution. (see Slides 12 and 25).

Team Hacking CT was sponsored by Bureau of Counterterrorism and Countering Violent Extremism with the goal of deterring individuals from joining violent extremist groups. After 100 interviews, the team realized that a bottom-up approach, focusing on support for friends and family of those at risk for radicalization, might be effective.

Getting Lean
Each of the teams used the Lean Startup methodology. For those new to Lean, the process has three key components.
First, students took the problems they got from their State Department sponsors and transformed those into what we call hypotheses. For instance, one problem was: “We need to improve coordination among all the organizations trying to help Syrian refugees.” That’s a big, unwieldy problem. Students had to break it down into a series of hypotheses. They had to identify who were the beneficiaries and stakeholders, and think about what specific service they were going to provide them, how they were going to get it to them and who was going to pay for it.  To help them do that, we have them map their nine critical hypotheses onto a single sheet of paper called the Mission Model Canvas.

Then in step two, the teams got out of the classroom to test these hypotheses through interviews with people in the real world. Every team spoke to close to 100 potential “beneficiaries,” partners and stakeholders including NGOs, tech company executives, supply chain managers, foreign service officers in embassies around the world, and even refugees. While the students were interviewing, they also employed the third piece of the Lean methodology: building the solution incrementally and iteratively. These solutions, called Minimal Viable Products (MVP’s), are what allow the teams to become extremely agile and responsive.
As teams talk to stakeholders they gather evidence to either validate, invalidate or modify their hypotheses. If they find out that their assumptions are wrong (and almost all do,) they Pivot, that is, they make fundamental changes to their hypotheses, instead of blindly proceeding forward simply executing a plan. This ability to gather data, build and test MVPs, and then change course is what gives Lean it’s tremendous speed and agility to deliver rapid solutions that are needed and wanted.
As an example, Team Aggregate DB was working with the State Department Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations (CSO). CSO helps embassies and diplomats to visualize, understand, and stabilize conflict. The team’s challenge was to get helps embassies and diplomats get more information about informal leader networks. Getting out of the building and talking to 87 people gave the team got a firsthand view of the downside when an embassy does not have access to the right local contacts. (Slides 3-9)

If you can’t see the presentation click here.
As they developed MVPs, our students took these solutions out into the real world for feedback. At first the solutions were nothing more than drawings, wireframes or PowerPoint slides. As they came to understand their problems more deeply, they refined their solutions into the final products we saw.

For example, Team 621 – Fatal Journeys worked with the State Department Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration. The team’s challenge: how to get more data on missing or perished refugees. In this presentation, note how the team’s understanding of the problem evolved over the course of talking to 88 people. They realized there was a missing link between key stakeholders that limited identification of perished refugees and prevented emotional and legal closure for their families. The team pivoted three times as they gained deeper and deeper insight into their problem. With each pivot, their solution radically changed. (Their first pass of problem/solution understanding is on Slides 1-29, but then they get additional insight in slides 36-50. Finally, slides 51-64 is their third and final iteration).

Hacking for Diplomacy was profiled this week in the L.A. Times. We’ve also had L.A. Times Beijing bureau chief Julie Makinen, who is on a JSK journalism fellowship at Stanford, helping coach students this quarter on interviewing and research techniques. Julie has been sharing her impressions of the class on this blog. Here’s her last installment:

In the Netflix age, suspense is an increasingly rare commodity. If we’re intrigued by an hour of “House of Cards,” we need not delay gratification – we can just queue up the next episode and push play. But following Stanford’s Hacking for Diplomacy class over the last 10 weeks has been like watching a TV drama the old-fashioned way. There were cliffhangers every time, and you had to wait seven days to find out what would happen next.
The class, which meets just once a week but requires massive outside work, is run not as a traditional lecture where professors drone on in front of passive students — just the opposite. It’s the students standing up in front, discussing what they’ve found out in the past seven days, what progress they’ve made, what obstacles they’ve run smack into. The teachers sit in the back row and lob questions and critiques forth — sometimes very direct critiques. That format keeps students and teachers alike on the edge of their seats.
Conflicts and misunderstandings within student teams — and between students and sponsors — cropped up as the students tried to learn about the State Department, their sponsors problem, and Lean Startup methodology all at once. Students, teachers, and interviewees said surprising, intriguing, even stunning things. Some days, you could see teams going off the rails, but instead of just shouting at your screen, “No, don’t go down that alley!” a professor would actually speak up from the back with something blunt like, “You’re way off track, and we’re firing your idea.”
And just when you thought a team had struck upon a brilliant notion for a product, they’d report back during the next session that everyone they put it in front of hated it. I started looking forward to each Thursday at 4:30 p.m. like my parents looked forward to watching “Dragnet” as kids, because the suspense was killing me.
Thursday’s season finale did not disappoint. Teams that just two or three weeks ago seemed to be foundering pulled off some amazing comebacks.
Take Team Exodus, which had spent a substantial part of the quarter focused on how to match private companies seeking to assist Syrian refugees with NGOs working in the field. Late in the term, the students scrapped that idea after finding competitors who were already deeply engaged in that space. They did a major pivot and decided to concentrate directly on refugees as customers — building on all they had learned during their first eight weeks of interviewing and research.
In week 9, they decided to build an AI chatbot on Facebook’s Messenger platform to allow refugees to ask questions like, “Where can I get clothing?” The bot will tap into a network of NGOs to source answers. A very basic prototype, built primarily by team member Kian Katanforoosh, a master’s student in computer science and management science & engineering, is already up and running.
On the eve of Thursday’s class, team members Katie Joseff and Berk Coker had a call with the United Nations’ refugee agency, UNHCR, and learned that the organization was very interested in working with the students to bring an Arabic chatbot to the field, most likely starting in Jordan.
“At the end, our team kind of came out of the weeds,” said Joseff, an undergrad majoring in human biology. “We finally got to the thing that Steve Blank talks about – where you can see the whites of a customer’s eyes and they just really want the product you’re talking about.”

Watching the students’ process and progress was an eye-opener even for many State Department sponsors and private-sector mentors. Team Space Evaders, who in week 7 seemed to be vying for the title of Team Whose Proposed Products Generated the Most Yawns from Potential Customers, had an “ah-ha” moment and decided instead of focusing on tracking objects already in space, they’d pivot and concentrate on objects that will be launched in the future.
They’re proposing a “debris footprint” that would rate satellites before they’re sent into orbit on how much space junk they could generate. The team hopes that this could lead to international design standards to reduce space debris.
“They had a fundamental insight – don’t track ’em, solve it before they even get into space,” said Jonathan Margolis, deputy assistant secretary of State for science, space and health who came all the way from Washington to meet with the team and sit in on the class in Week 9. “It’s a reconceptualization of a problem we’ve really been struggling with.”
Team members Dave Gabler, a master’s student in business and public policy with an Air Force background, and Matthew Kaseman, an Army vet and freshman in aerospace engineering, said the next step is to produce a white paper that fleshes out the mathematical formulas that could underpin a ratings system, then take that to academic and industry conferences. “That would help start a public discussion and push the debate,” said Gabler.
“The math is probably the easy part,” said Pablo Quintanilla, a former Foreign Service Officer and current head of public policy for Asia for Salesforce, who served as mentor for the Space Evaders team. “There’s so much more to the behavioral side – who in the international space community will adopt this?”
Quintanilla said that working with Space Evaders drove home for him the merits of forming diverse teams to tackle problems. Besides Gabler and Kaseman, the student team included Kate Boudreau, a junior majoring in biomedical computation, and Tyler Dammann, a junior in computer science.
“This cross-functionality and working across disciplines is really effective,” Quintanilla said. “I feel like this is living proof that you should work everywhere like this.”

Professor Jeremy Weinstein,  a co-instructor for the class who recently served as deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, acknowledged that 10 weeks is a really short time frame for the students to make any meaningful impact. But unlike an internship, where a lone student “plugs into an existing bureaucratic hierarchy and rules,” the Hacking for Diplomacy students had the advantage of being able to work in teams — and approach the problem more as outsiders.
“The students don’t have to play by the same rules [as insiders]. They can ask the non-PC questions,” said Weinstein. “To be ignorant of the rules is a blessing at times — if you can do it respectfully.”
Getting students to have a healthy appreciation for how government policy is made — sometimes painfully slowly — is part of the educational process. And so perhaps is getting bureaucrats to be more open to fresh ideas. “There’s not going to be a flip of the switch” in State as a result of this class, Weinstein said. “There is some skepticism. But I think more broadly, we’ve won some people over.”
Thursday’s wrap-up session attracted a diverse audience, including representatives from leading Silicon Valley tech companies as well as diplomats from France, Britain and Denmark. Susan Alzner, head of the U.N. Non-Governmental Liaison Service’s New York office, said after watching the student presentations, she wants to take the customer discovery and interview methodology back to her agency.
“The U.N. has lots of small teams of people who often believe they already know the solution to a problem. … And the U.N. does way too much consultation digitally. Interviews are critical. It’s so elaborate to see these students doing 100 interviews to understand a problem, but it’s so important to orient yourself before making a plan to do something.”

Weinstein noted that scaling up Hacking for Diplomacy may not be as easy as expanding Hacking for Defense, simply because “there are millions of people who work in the Department of Defense… while the size of the State Department foreign service corps is smaller than the total number of people who play in military bands.” That means there are fewer people who can serve as sponsors.
At the same time, the class could tap a wider array of sponsor organizations. “Scale maybe has to look different — we can look to the [State Department], but also UNHCR, the foreign ministry of the U.K., other international organizations,” Weinstein said. “You have to think of a different array of partners.”
Most of the State Department sponsors for this year’s class, Weinstein noted, were not political appointees but career foreign service officers or career civil servants.
“They are the glue that holds the agency together and they are key to getting anything implemented in government. And so the buy-in is there,” he said. “But they also need permission; they need a blessing to experiment with radically different ideas. And you need political cover in these bureaucracies to do this kind of work.”
“I hope,” he added, “we’ll have that cover in a subsequent administration. More than cover. Endorsement. Enthusiasm. Excitement.”

Our Teaching Team
Like the students’ efforts, the teaching of this class was also a team project. I was joined by Jeremy Weinstein, former deputy to the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and a Stanford professor of political science; Zvika Krieger, the State Department’s representative to Silicon Valley and senior advisor for technology and innovation; retired U.S. Army Col. Joe Felter, who co-created Hacking for Defense and is a senior research scholar at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford; and Steve Weinstein, chief executive of MovieLabs who teaches entrepreneurship at Stanford and UC Berkeley.

Our teaching assistants were Shazad Mohamed, Sam Gussman and Roland Gillah. We were fortunate to get a team of seven mentors currently or formerly served in the State Department and selflessly volunteered their time to help coach the teams. Each team also got a mentor from the tech industry who helped guide them through creating their final products. Of course, huge thanks to the Stanford students who gave their all through this class.
Going forward
While our previous Hacking for Defense class gave us a hint that doing the same for Diplomacy would work, we’re a little stunned about how well this class with the State Department went. A surprising number of students have decided to continue working on foreign policy projects after this class with the State Department or with NGO’s. Other colleges and universities have raised their hands, and said they want to offer Hacking for Diplomacy or potentially a USAID Hacking for Development class at their school.
Meanwhile our Hacking for Defense class continues to scale through H4Di.org the non profit we set up to curate the problems from our sponsors (JIDO, ARCYBER, AWG, USMC, NSA, AFNWC, SOCOM, 75th Ranger Regiment, USTRANSCOM, Cyber Force Protection Brigade, National Defense University, and the Center for Technology and National Security Policy). And H4Di.org supports the universities teaching the class this year: Stanford, UC San Diego, Georgetown, Air Force, University of Pittsburgh, James Madison University, Boise State, and RIT.
If you’re interested in offering Hacking for Diplomacy (or Defense) in your school, or if you’re a sponsor in a federal agency interested in solving problems with speed and urgency, join us at our next H4D educators class January 17-19th at Georgetown.
Lessons Learned


Our sponsors inside State saw examples of a new and powerful methodology – Lean which could help them better understand and deal with complicated international problems
Lean offers State speed and agility to deliver rapid solutions that are needed and wanted
Our students learned that they could serve their country without having to put on a uniform
Other universities are willing to have their students work on diplomacy and development problems
The class was a success

Machine Learning Meets the Lean Startup

		Posted on November 18, 2016 by steveblank	

We just finished our Lean LaunchPad class at UC Berkeley’s engineering school where many of the teams embedded machine learning technology into their products.
It struck me as I watched the teams try to find how their technology would solve real customer problems, is that machine learning is following a similar pattern of previous technical infrastructure innovations. Early entrants get sold to corporate acquirers at inflated prices for their teams, their technology, and their tools. Later entrants who miss that wave have to build real products that people want to buy.
—–
I’ve lived through several technology infrastructure waves; the Unix business, the first AI and VR waves in the 1980’s, the workstation wave, multimedia wave, the first internet wave. Each of those had a set of common characteristics that the Gartner Group characterizes as the Hype Cycle .

The five stages of the hype cycle are:
Stage 1: The Technology Trigger: A potential technology breakthrough kicks things off. Early proof-of-concept stories and media interest trigger significant publicity. Often no usable products exist and commercial viability is unproven.
Stage 2: Peak of Inflated Expectations: Early publicity produces a number of success stories—often accompanied by scores of failures. Some companies take action; most don’t.
Stage 3: Trough of Disillusionment: Interest wanes as experiments and implementations fail to deliver. Producers of the technology shake out or fail. Investments continue only if the surviving providers improve their products to the satisfaction of early adopters.
Stage 4: Slope of Enlightenment: More instances of how the technology can benefit the enterprise start to crystallize and become more widely understood. Second- and third-generation products appear from technology providers. More enterprises fund pilots; conservative companies remain cautious.
Stage 5: Plateau of Productivity: Mainstream adoption starts to take off. Criteria for assessing provider viability are more clearly defined. The technology’s broad market applicability and relevance are clearly paying off.
Shiny Object meets First Mover Advantage
What’s become apparent in the last few technology hype cycles is that for startups and their investors there is a short multi-year window of opportunity (at the Peak of Inflated Expectations) to sell a startup at an inflated price. This occurs because large technology companies (Google, Facebook, IBM, Microsoft, Twitter, Apple, Salesforce, Intel, et al,) and increasingly other non-tech firms, are in an arms race to stay relevant. For example, according to CBInsights nearly 140 machine intelligence have been acquired since 2011, with over 40 being bought so far in 2016.

Most often the first acquisitions in a hype cycle are for the “shiny objects” – the technology, the team and the tools. The acquired technical teams usually start up or complement the company’s research group in a specific new technology area.
If you’re a startup (or their investors) getting acquired at this point in the hype cycle is exactly where you want to be – short time in business, large acquisition price, value based on a frenzy, perceived scarcity of expertise, and fear of a competitor getting the key talent.
History shows that the acquirers often overpay buying this expertise early. While these acquisitions have teams of great researchers, they rarely contribute actual revenue generating products (because most never reached that stage when they were acquired.)  The irony is that the acquisitions made later in the hype cycle – when companies have built real products that customers want, are the ones that generate revenue and profit for the acquirer.
I had all that in mind as we watched our teams present.
Machine Learning Meets Lean – Berkeley Lean LaunchPad Class

Each of our teams in this class followed the canonical Lean model:

Articulate your hypotheses using the business model canvas
Get of the building and test those hypotheses using customer development
Validate learning by building minimal viable products and getting them in front of customers

Each week the teams got out of the classroom and talked to 10-15 customers, testing a new part of the business model canvas.  And after week two, they had to build and then update their minimal viable product weekly. And present what they learned each week in an 8-minute presentations.
The presentations below are their final Lessons Learned presentations, along with a 2-minute video summary.
SalesStash
Three Berkeley PhD computer science students and an MBA working on machine learning. How can you not hit out of the park on day one?
This team epitomized rapid learning. Once their initial assumptions ran into the wall of actual customer feedback they rapidly built multiple minimum viable products (MVPs) and kept pivoting until they found product/market fit (i.e. a customer segment that was grabbing the product out of their hands.)

Delphi
Before this class this team had spent three months in an incubator building the product after talking to only one customer. After  week two of the class they realized they had wasted three months building something no one actually wanted. What they next learned was pretty amazing.

Homeslice
Homeslice had a great journey. They came together over a personal pain – the inability to afford a house in Silicon Valley. Their initial plan was to provide fractional ownership to solve that problem. But they found that first serving an adjacent market – slices of investment properties – could serve as a launchpad for their initial idea of fractional home ownership.

Exit Strategy
Exit Strategy was building the penultimate planning tool. This teams learning that this wasn’t a business was as important as finding one that is. Really impressive process.

This class this was a team effort. Professor Kurt Keutzer and Errol Arkilic (former program director for the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps (NSF I-Corps), now founder of M34 Capital) were the lead instructors. Steve Weinstein (CEO of MovieLabs) and I assisted. Thanks to our TA Kathryn Crimmins and all the team mentors: Lev Mass, Kanu Gulati, Ewald Detjens, James Cham, Kanu Gulati, Patrick Chung, Rick Lazansky, Ashmeet Sidhana, Mike Olson, Michael Borrus, Fabrizo De Pasquale, Amit Kumar, Rob Rodick, Mar Hershenson.

The canonical product development model - concept, develop, alpha, beta, first customer, ship - is how Silicon Valley grew strong. But why does this process to build a business only succeed part of the time? And how can early stage ventures reduce their overall risk? Serial entrepreneur Steve Blank points out that most founding partners strongly focus on product and ship. But too often, startups confuse engineering's accomplishments with marketing and sales success, and they pop the champagne corks too soon.

An MVP is not a Cheaper Product, It’s about Smart Learning

					Posted on July 22, 2013 by steveblank									

A minimum viable product (MVP) is not always a smaller/cheaper version of your final product. Defining the goal for a MVP can save you tons of time, money and grief.
Drones over the Heartland
I ran into a small startup at Stanford who wants to fly Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (drones) with a Hyper-spectral camera over farm fields to collect hyper-spectral images. These images would be able to tell farmers how healthy their plants were, whether there were diseases or bugs, whether there was enough fertilizer, and enough water. (The camera has enough resolution to see individual plants.) Knowing this means farms can make better forecasts of how much their fields will produce, whether they should treat specific areas for pests, and put fertilizer and water only where it was needed.
(Drones were better than satellites because of higher resolution and the potential for making more passes over the fields, and better than airplanes because of lower cost.)
All of this information would help farmers increase yields (making more money) and reduce costs by using less water and fertilizer/chemicals but only applying where it was needed.
Their plan was to be a data service provider in an emerging business called “precision agriculture.” They would go out to a farmer fields on a weekly basis, fly the drones, collect and process the data and then give it to the farmers in an easy understandable form.
Customer Discovery on Farms
I don’t know what it is about Stanford, but this was the fourth or fifth startup I’ve seen in precision agriculture that used drones, robotics, high-tech sensors, etc. This team got my attention when they said, “Let us tell you about our conversations with potential customers.”  I listened, and as they described their customer interviews, it seemed like they had found, that – yes, farmers do understand that not being able to see what was going on in detail on their fields was a problem – and yes, – having data like this would be great – in theory.
So the team decided that this felt like a real business they wanted to build.  And now they were out raising money to build a prototype minimum viable product (MVP.) All good. Smart team, real domain experts in hyper-spectral imaging, drone design, good start on customer discovery, beginning to think about product/market fit, etc.
Lean is Not an Engineering Process
They showed me their goals and budget for their next step. What they wanted was a happy early customer who recognized the value of their data and is willing to be an evangelist. Great goal.
They concluded that the only way to get a delighted early customer was to build a minimum viable product (MVP). They believed that the MVP needed to, 1) demonstrate a drone flight, 2) make sure their software could stitch together all the images of a field, and then 3) present the data to the farmer in a way he could use it.
And they logically concluded that the way to do this was to buy a drone, buy a hyper-spectral camera, buy the software for image processing, spend months of engineering time integrating the camera, platform and software together, etc  They showed me their barebones budget for doing all this. Logical.
And wrong.
Keep Your Eyes on the Prize
The team confused the goal of the MVP, (seeing if they could find a delighted farmer who would pay for the data) with the process of getting to the goal. They had the right goal but the wrong MVP to test it. Here’s why.
The teams’ hypothesis was that they could deliver actionable data that farmers would pay for. Period. Since the startup defined itself as a data services company, at the end of the day, the farmer couldn’t care less whether the data came from satellites, airplanes, drones, or magic as long as they had timely information.
That meant that all the work about buying a drone, a camera, software and time integrating it all was wasted time and effort – now. They did not need to test any of that yet. (There’s plenty of existence proofs that low cost drones can be equipped to carry cameras.) They had defined the wrong MVP to test first. What they needed to spend their time is first testing is whether farmers cared about the data.
So I asked, “Would it be cheaper to rent a camera and plane or helicopter, and fly over the farmers field, hand process the data and see if that’s the information farmers would pay for?  Couldn’t you do that in a day or two, for a tenth of the money you’re looking for?”  Oh…
They thought about it for a while and laughed and said, “We’re engineers and we wanted to test all the cool technology, but you want us to test whether we first have a product that customers care about and whether it’s a business. We can do that.”
Smart team. They left thinking about how to redefine their MVP.

It is very important for entrepreneurs to be reminded of this simple but important principle: the purpose of your MVP is to test your core value proposition. You often do not have to engineer a solution to do this. In our consulting business we often have to remind our entrepreneurs and startups that there are often very easy ways to do this. That is why when building a software company, a MVP can be a video, landing page, clickable wireframe, etc. Thanks for reminding entrepreneurs to a) talk to customers and b) determine value through an MVP that tests the core value proposition of the product.

Awesome real-world description of an MVP in practice. The way I think of it, and MVP allows you to black box important components of the value proposition. Within these black boxes are highly processes that are extremely unscalable in the long-term, but with a near 0 startup phase. 
Renting a plane or helicopter and hand-tuning the data is great short-term alternative to robots and software. 
Building a great landing page is a great complementary exercise as well.

Thanks a lot Steve. I have to admit that I’m guilty of this line of thinking as well (being an engineer).
Sometimes, I guess, it’s because I subconsciously want to delay the testing with customers (in this case: checking whether the farmers want the data) b/c of fears of failure. 
This is a lesson that I’d definitely take to my heart.

Thank you for this article. The article talks about the right MVP for the question that needs to be tested. Fair enough.
I am wondering how do you qualify/quantify the test from the MVP. In this case I assume, it would be money that the farmer paid and probably the easy by which he paid. Correct me if I am wrong. 
How do you judge the results from an MVP? No of users who are actively using the MVP(functional MVP) or number of people who are exiting about the MVP (assuming that the MVP is a non functional mockup)

What a great reminder, thanks Steve!
Building on what Alex said:
A non-functional MVP can only really give you good negative information, i.e. if no one is excited about the picture of your baby, then that is a strong negative signal. But if lots of people are excited, that is often only a weak positive signal…enough reason to build a functional MVP, and useful guidance about what it should do, but not much more than that.
For a functional MVP, having lots of people use it is often only a weak positive signal, and having only a few people use it is a weak negative signal, especially early on. However, you have a strong negative signal if no one is really excited about it, and you have a strong positive signal if you find a _clearly identifiable_ group of users who are really excited about it, regardless of how many people use it.
Think about Steve’s article. In a B2B context, he’s saying getting one evangelical customer from a functional MVP is a good goal.
In my experience, you can usually tell within the first 3 to 5, maybe 7, customers in B2B if you have a clear target customer up front. In consumer, usually the first 200 to 500, maybe 1000. If no one is really excited, that should give you pause. If someone is really excited, that should give you confidence to continue.

Hey Erik, that reply was helpful. However there is one thing that i dont get – Why is a clearly identifiable group which is small but exited about your mvp a strong signal? Little confused about the definition of clearly identifiable group
As in, say I did the test with 700 people and out of that 25 people were very excited and say out of the 25 excited people, 20 people were one group of people – say group A. But looking at  number of people in group A in the set of 700 people I noticed that group A consists of 200 people. In that case I dont really have a clearly indentifiable group as 20/200 is pretty low. 
I am guessing you are talking about the case when the 20/200 ratio is pretty close to one, no matter how nitche the group is and the total size of the market is defined by the number of such people in the world.

Thanks allot for this reminder, it hit me like a hammer to my head.
You saved them from a bunch of frustration and grief. Wish I read this 6 months ago. We did the exact opposite, got caught up in the dev process and lost our focus on the “prize”. We spent 4-5 months working on nifty features and forgot to ask both the customer and the end-user, if they found value in what we were creating. Now we are struggling to salvage what we have and restart testing for value. Still optimistic but we had a very expensive lesson. It’s very easy to lose focus if you stay in your comfort zone and avoid regular reality checks.

Very interesting article – as always. Thanks Steve.
I still struggle to see how the MVP and the entire Lean Startup framework applies to add-ons of a core product, or to services that are not core (yet) to a business model. For example a mobile app built by a bank, that locates its branches and ATMs. You can do A/B testing of course and it provides great leanings. But it does not seem to converge to a “successful startup” inside of this bank.
Happy to further discuss if there is an opportunity to!

These days if u do a decent Kickstarter or IndieGogo campaign ( which includes a product walkthrough)  + targeted landing pages showing a clear value prop + key Screenshots , then top it off with followup Customer discovery…. that should give u a ton of data and prove viability..
Although we skipped the KS and landing pages when we started JuicyCanvas.com, and had to build an mvp first because we were not solving pain points – but rather offering a fun new creative experience which could only truly be understood when used. 
BUT we were foolish and lucky.. kids dont try this at home.

They could probably have saved even more money by just cold calling farmers and say:
“Hey farmer! I can sell you weekly data xyz of your farm land for price w. Want to make an order?”
Renting a plane and manually sorting through data is expensive. And you would need to “try sell” to more than one farmer to get reliable data.
If your idea is an IPO idea, then it should be enough in most cases to just EXPLAIN your idea to get orders. 
My guess is that people overdo the mvp for several reasons. These ive seen in real life (and been guilty of myself sometimes):
1 The idea is feels so good that there is no chance its gonna fail. Building a “cheap” $5000 MVP is OK in this case even though they could have validated it much cheaper with a simple landing page and picture.
2 The idea has sparked adrenaline, feel good emotions and they forget all logic and proven methods of moving forward in the most pragmatic way. 
3 The notion of an MVP/cust. dev./a startup method is not even known to the founder.
4 They have tried cust dev before and always had their idea fail (which they should, but arent, happy for). They start distrusting the method and say “f*ck cust dev. i just need to burn the boats and start building. then i have no other option than winning. cust dev is too boring”.

meb, I think you identified some excellent points. Simply cold calling would identify the first set of criteria customers are looking for to make their purchasing decision. If the custom isn’t convinced over the phone, create some sample reports. Still not convinced, create a mockup and run a WebEx or sample video. All for less that the price of the first fly-over and real data crunching.
As reason number 5 for avoiding the direct path to customer insight, I would propose fear of discovery. Especially fear of discovering no one wants what you’re developing.

I suspect #3 is all too common. I like #5 and #6 added by Joshua and Saul.
#8 Founders are engineers and think that customer development requires skills they don’t have (possibly true), so they skip the task completely and move onto building. For an engineer, building a product is more natural than talking about the product.
Does anybody else think concept of MVP clashes with “Ideas are worthless, execution is everything”? If the idea is about convenience, it can be a chicken-and-egg problem since MVP is meant to validate an idea but not execution. For example, many refer to manual data processing and emailing in MVP phase, but what if timeliness (real-time) of a solution is a core feature of the product?

One case and thought experiment: let’s think a bit backwards and imagine we are in 2007, before Fitbit, Jawbone UP, Nike Fuelband, etc came to market with activity trackers that sync up to your computer/mobile phone, what would be the MVP for such a product? Step counters are out on the market for 20-30 years), hundreds of thousands were entering the steps on websites and competed with each other. The key value proposition of these fancy wireless activity trackers is the experience with syncing and providing visual insights and the gamification around it.

I don’t think this is a case of a wrong MVP. This is a jobs-to-be-done example of picking the wrong… job. As you wrote, data is what farmer wanted, not the way to get them. Anything else is addressing the wrong job. MVP is about identifying the minimum set of features that make a product viable. This is still far from marketable, no-one should ever consider market a MVP seriously. That’s the agile disillusion of being earlier in the market. With the level of competition that exists now, being out in the market with product that is just viable and not fully “lovable”, brings no-where. There were tablets before iPad, but none of them at the level of quality that user love.

Steve: 
I have been following you for some time as a business consultant and find myself using and promoting you regularly to a variety of folks. I forwarded your drone blog to potential customers for their thoughts about your example startup.  
While I know that drones and farming are used here as an example of startup technique, I thought you (and your Stanford team) might enjoy some comments from my sister and her husband who who are mega-family farmers in Ohio. Their son (Matt) is a recent graduate of Nebraska employed there collecting some of the same data…on foot. I am waiting for his comments and will forward if you are interested.  
My point is the same I always have used�talk to the ‘consumer’ first�sometimes they don’t know what they want until you hand it to them, but they will always shorten your development time. 
Hey family:   Does this idea below have any fundamental value in your farming worlds? I have been conversationally toying with the possibility of drone application of fertilizers/chemicals with some of the folks at Dayton Development Coalition and this stirred up the thought again. 
Yeah, pretty much they forgot to ask the farmers if they cared about the data. For sure. Some farmers would care and love it, but many, many fewer would be willing to pay for that service. A lot fewer. Farmers do not let go of their money easily for ANYTHING. I don�t foresee drones taking Matt�s job away from him anytime soon. It�s hard enough getting farmers to let go of money for what Matt does, let alone a techno drone.   BTW, if our experience the techies have a very hard time getting the info into a form that the farmers can actually use. They can rarely make it �user friendly�. THAT is a huge barrier to getting the farmers to even want to look at the possibility � they are the most skeptical group I know.  J   Matt and Richard � care to chime in here?

When I think about MVP’s I can’t help but see examples of cases where the opposite was successful: the iPhone, the Kindle. These were massive projects with huge backend engineering and operations, with huge big-bang launches.
Is there a rubric for determining when a project can benefit from an MVP vs when a Big Bang release is more appropriate?
Is it possible that some projects will only be successful on scale, and that aiming for an MVP is sometimes a *bad idea*?

Great point, however
1) Apple and Amazon have considerable resources… they can afford to stumble, and they can afford to take MANY years (iPhone took many many years) to develop and quietly test the product and business models.
2) There are countless counterexamples to iPhones’s/Kindle ereader success… Google is not afraid to fail publicly and does so often enough (Google TV, Google Wave, etc).  They also make nearly all of their money selling advertising so they will survive to try the next big thing (balloon based internet services for the 3rd world for instance)
Those companies can fail and probably not sink.  Most startups may not survive a large investment in engineering that produces no customers.

If you are Apple/Amazon/Google you have enough data to base your business decisions on and enough resources to build a viable product, so you don’t really need an MVP. They also have their brand to protect so have to be more sensitive to quality of the products they introduce.
“Do opportunities that aren’t a good fit for MVP approaches demand bigger budgets …?”
Not necessarily. In the case of reinventing an existing product or idea your cost to market is actually lower – innovation is expensive, imitation is cheap and effective. MVP is a method for learning (validating) who your customers are and what they want and willing to pay for while keeping the cost to a minimum.

I can think of 2 factors that determine a need for an MVP:
1. Whether the product idea is new or just a variation/improvement/extension of an already validated product. Many founders say “I can do this better and cheaper than company X” and improve upon an existing product that already has a proven market.
2. Whether business survival or even existence depends on the success of the product or not. In cases of startups, not validating a product is intolerable risk compared to launching of another product for a big established company.

This is all about defining the product. Is the product the technology or the output? What the product IS depends on the problem that the team is trying to solve. If the problem is that there is no way to get high resolution data, the plane / helicopter idea is a good one, but if the plane / helicopter thing is already being done, as one commenter pointed out, then the value proposition may be that doing it with drones is cheaper or somehow better than using manned aircraft, in which case they will have to develop a prototype to prove that out.

Rather than “talk to the customer first” I would advise to “check for competitors first” and that preferably on a global scale since data providers can come from anywhere. In this specific case the startup would likely have discovered http://www.eleaf.com doing exactly what they are planning to do and not with drones but with available satellite data.

Responsive to Eric and Alex comments of 7/22, keep in mind that when Xerox originators had AD Little do a market survey for interest in their photocopying  concept, the conclusion was that they could expect only about 5000 possible customers in the USA.  The fact is that with new concepts,  customers many times cannot get their head around the full impact or potential of the idea and hence the misleading marketing survey results.

Very helpful! Based on our experience with startups and large companies in the enterprise software space, there seems to be a common theme: Not picking the ‘right’ customers and not spending enough time with those customers from the beginning is likely to cause damage which proves irreparable. This is what we saw to work in practice https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141014183906-296431546-six-steps-to-the-maximum-desirable-customer

Steve Blank rounds up all of those questions that you've had floating around in your mind but were too afraid to ask, illustrates why failure to answer these questions means failure for your business, and shows you a clear path towards answering these questions and growing your company.I wish that I had gotten my hands on this book about 12 months ago because it would have made the process of starting a company a lot less hectic.  Moving forward, this book is going to serve as an invaluable "How To" and roadmap as we begin to make our first sales and start hiring employees.All that being said, perhaps this book is not one to read cover-to-cover.  There is so much information in here that my head almost exploded every 5 pages.  Trying to go through it all at once is just information overload.  I think the real value of this book will be as a reference manual that I can come back to it and look at the relevant sections when the company reaches certain stages.An incredibly insightful book and a must-have for any startup. All 5 reviews »Other editions - View allThe Four Steps to the Epiphany: Successful Strategies for Products that WinSteve BlankLimited preview - 2013The Four Steps to the Epiphany: Successful Strategies for Products That WinSteve BlankNo preview available - 2013The Four Steps to the Epiphany: Successful Strategies for Products that WinSteven Gary BlankNo preview available - 2007Bibliographic informationTitleThe Four Steps to the Epiphany: Successful Strategies for Products that WinAuthorSteven BlankPublisherLulu Enterprises Incorporated, 2003ISBN1411601726, 9781411601727Length281 pages&nbsp&nbspExport CitationBiBTeX EndNote RefManAbout Google Books - Privacy Policy - Terms of Service - Blog - Information for Publishers - Report an issue - Help - Sitemap - Google Home

Editor's note: This post is part of a series featuring excerpts from the recently published book, The Startup Owner's Manual, written by serial entrepreneurs-turned-educators Steve Blank and Bob Dorf. Come back each week for more how-tos from this 608-page guide.    
Once your Business Model Canvas is done, it's time for your team to "get out of the building" to test your hypotheses. You need to answer three key questions: 

Do we really understand the customer's problem or need?
Do enough people care about the problem or need to deliver a huge business?
And will they care enough to tell their friends, to grow our business quickly? 

Regardless of whether you have a physical or Web/mobile product, Customer Development experiments are short, simple, objective pass/fail tests. 
Start by asking yourself, "What do I want to learn?" And, "What's the simplest pass/fail test I can run to learn?" Finally, think about, "How do I design a pass/fail experiment to run this simple test?" 
The goal of these tests is not just to collect customer data or get a "pass" on the test.
It's something more profound and intangible: entrepreneurial insight. Did anyone end your sales call by saying, "Too bad you don't sell x, because we could use a ton of those"? That's the kind of feedback you're looking for. 
How to Test a Web/Mobile Concept 
The problem phase is markedly different for Web/mobile startups, where feedback comes far faster. The best strategy is to use a "low-fidelity" minimum viable product (MVP) that can be as simple as a landing page with your value proposition, benefits summary, and a call to action to learn more, answer a short survey, or preorder. It could be even a quick website prototype built in PowerPoint or with a simple landing-page creation tool. Your goal is something basic--no fancy U/I, logos, or animation.  
And no matter what, there's no substitute for face-to-face discovery with customers to see their reaction to the problem or the solution. Do their eyes light up or glaze over? (You may have to do all this for each "side" in multi-sided markets, where the issues differ for buyers and sellers/users and payers.) 
Get the MVP live as quickly as possible (often the day you start the company) to see if anybody shares your vision of the customer need/problem. Your website/prototype should:

Describe the problem in words or pictures ("Does your office look like this?")
Show screen shots of the potential solution ("Pay your bills this way")
Encourages users to "sign up to learn more" 

Measure how many people care about the problem or need and how deeply they care. The most obvious indicator is the percentage of invitees who register to learn more. Next you need to learn if visitors think their friends have the same need or problem, so include widgets for forwarding, sharing, and tweeting the MVP. 
Focus on the conversion rates. If the MVP gets 5,000 page views and 50 or 60 sign-ups, it's time to stop and analyze why. If 44% of the people who saw an AdWord or textlink to the MVP signed up, you're almost certainly on to something big. What percentage of people invited to the test actually came? What percentage of people in each test (a) provided their email address, (b) referred or forwarded the MVP to friends, or (c) engaged further in a survey, blog, or other feedback activity? Of those who answered survey questions, how many declared the problem "very important" as opposed to "somewhat important?" 
Consider Using Multiple MVPs 
Many start-ups develop multiple low-fidelity websites to test different problem descriptions. For example, a simple online accounts payable package can be simultaneously tested three different ways: as fastpay, ezpay, and flexipay. Each addresses three different accounts payable problems-speed, ease of use, and flexibility. Each landing page would be different, stressing the "ease of use" problem, for example. 
How to Test a Physical Product 
Start with at least 50 target customers--people you know directly. Next, expand the list by scouring your cofounders' and employees' address books, social-network lists, etc. Add names from friends, investors, founders, lawyers, recruiters, accountants, and more. 
In contrast with a product presentation, a problem presentation is designed to elicit information from customers. The presentation summarizes your hypotheses about customers' problems and about how they're solving the problem today. It also offers some potential solutions, to test whether your assumptions are correct. 
Hopefully you'll never get to use your presentation. Your goal is to get the customers to talk, not you. This is the biggest idea in Customer Development. Remember: You aren't trying to convince anyone you're right. You're there to listen. "Presenting" in this context really means inviting the customers' responses. So, after describing your assumed list of problems, pause and ask the customers what they think the problems are, whether you're missing any problems, how they would rank the problems, and which are must-solve rather than nice-to-solve. You've hit the jackpot when the customer tells you she will do anything to solve the problem. 
What if a customer tells you that the issues you thought were important really aren't? You've just obtained great data. While it may not be what you wanted to hear, it's wonderful to have that knowledge early on. 
Summarize this discussion by asking two questions: "What's the biggest pain in how you work? If you could wave a magic wand and change anything about what you do, what would it be?" (These are the "IPO questions." Understand the answers to these questions and your start-up is going public.) Casually ask, "How much does this problem cost you (in terms of lost revenue, lost customers, lost time, frustration, etc.)?"Finally, introduce a taste of your proposed solution (not a set of features but only the big idea). Pause and watch the customers' reactions. Do they even understand what the words mean? Is the solution evident enough that they say, "If you could do that, all my problems would be solved?" Alternatively, do they say, "What do you mean?" Then do you have to explain it for 20 minutes and they still don't understand? Once again, the point is not to deliver a sales pitch but to get their reaction and a healthy discussion. 
Be Ready to Learn 
Some of your hypotheses might be shot down in flames in the first hour or two. For example, most entrepreneurs would change something if they invited 50 friends to an MVP "problem" page and not a single one clicked or signed up. Imagine your surprise if you bought a list of 1,000 mothers of toddlers and just three accepted your invitation to join toddlermom.com. 
In business-to-business companies, experience the customer at work, or at the very least observe it. Your goal should be to know the customer you're pursuing, and every aspect of his or her business, so deeply and intimately that they start to think of you and talk to you as if you were "one of them." 
After testing the customer problem (or need) and gaining a complete understanding of the customer, it's time to expose the product itself to potential customers for the first time. Not to sell to them but to get their feedback. We'll discuss that more in the next excerpt.

Occupation
Academic, Author, Entrepreneur


Known for
The Customer Development Methodology


Steve Blank (born 1953) is a Silicon Valley serial-entrepreneur and academician who is based in Pescadero, California.[1]
Blank is recognized for developing the Customer Development method that launched the Lean Startup movement, a methodology which recognized that startups are not smaller versions of large companies, but require their own set of processes and tools to be successful.[2] His May 2013 cover story in the Harvard Business Review, “Why the Lean Startup Changes Everything,” defined the Lean Startup movement.[3] His Lean Launchpad class (taught as the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps) has become the standard for commercialization for all federal research.[1]
Blank has spent over 30 years within the high technology industry, founding or working within eight startup companies, four of which have gone public.[4][5] He is the co-founder of E.piphany.[4][6][5]
Retired since 1999, Blank writes and teaches about Customer Development and the Lean Startup method. He is an adjunct professor of entrepreneurship at Stanford;[7][8] lectures at the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business, and is a senior fellow at Columbia University,[9] and New York University; is a prolific blogger and public speaker; and has written four books: The Four Steps to the Epiphany, Not All Those Who Wander Are Lost, The Startup Owner's Manual and Holding a Cat by the Tail.[10][11]
Blank’s Google Tech talk, "The Secret History of Silicon Valley," offers a widely regarded insider's perspective on the emergence of Silicon Valley's startup ecosystem.

Early life[edit]
Blank was born to immigrant parents who ran a grocery in the Chelsea neighborhood in New York City.[12] He grew up with a sister who was 12 years older than him and both siblings were raised by his mother after his father left home when he was aged 6.[12] His parents had never been to college (has father dropped out in 8th grade) but hoped he would.[13] He attended the University of Michigan, but dropped out after one semester.[12][13][14]
From Michigan, Blank hitchhiked to Miami, where he found work at the Miami International Airport, loading racehorses onto aircraft.[12][13] At the airport, Blank developed an interest in avionics. He realized the only way to learn more was to join the Air Force.[13]
His military career took him to Thailand during the Vietnam War, where he was managing a team of 15 electronics technicians within a year and a half.[12][13] He was 20 years old.[13]
After leaving the military, Blank moved to Palo Alto, a town in an area which would ultimately become known as Silicon Valley.[13]
Startup career[edit]
Steve Blank arrived in Silicon Valley at the start of the business boom in 1978.[4][11] His first job in the region was with ESL, a startup that was a pioneering company for National Reconnaissance.[14] The company helped the government understand the Soviets' technological and arms developments during the Cold War.[14]
During his 21-year career as an entrepreneur, Blank went on to found or work with a wide range of high-tech companies.[15] Four of his companies went public.[12] Some of his ventures include Zilog and MIPS Computers, Convergent Technologies, Ardent, SuperMac Technologies, ESL and Rocket Science Games.[7][15]
Blank co-founded his 8th and last startup, the Customer Relationship Management provider E.piphany, in 1996 and retired the day before its IPO in September 1999.[2][4][16][17] Notable members of the company include Roger Siboni and Karen Richardson.[18][19]
Blank has since served on the boards of the public entities Macrovision/Rovi and Immersion as well as several private companies. He continues to invest in and advise Silicon Valley startups including Machine Intelligence companies Geometric (acquired by Uber) and Deepscale .[20]
Customer Development Methodology[edit]
Blank created the Customer Development methodology in the mid 1990s.[14] The concept details a scientific approach that can be applied by startups and entrepreneurs to improve their products success by developing a better understanding of customers’ problems/needs as well as the other hypotheses necessary to build a commercial successful company.[2][4][14]
Lean Startup Movement[edit]
Blank's Customer Development methodology is a cornerstone of the Lean Startup Movement, popularized by Eric Ries[21][22] whom Blank states was “the best student I ever had.”[4] The Lean Startup approach relies on validated learning, scientific experimentation, and iterative product releases to shorten product development cycles, measure progress, and gain valuable customer feedback. Blank and Ries developed the ideas beginning around 2004 when Blank was an investor and advisor to the company, IMVU, that Ries co-founded.[23] The Lean Startup has been adopted by entrepreneurs worldwide as a constructive way to try out ideas and gain customers.[2] Ries has integrated the Customer Development methodology into the Lean Startup practices and considers it to be one of the Lean Startup Movement's pillars.[24][25][26]
Academic teaching career[edit]
Blank began teaching entrepreneurship in 2002 at UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business and has since taught entrepreneurship to both undergraduate and graduate students. He currently teaches at Stanford, the University of California Berkeley Haas School of Business, New York University and Columbia.[7][8][27] His Lean LaunchPad curricula uses the Customer Development methodology and Lean Startup methods he developed throughout his career as a serial entrepreneur and academic.[12]
The Lean LaunchPad[edit]
In January 2011, Blank created the Lean LaunchPad class at Stanford University and UC Berkeley. The class is a scientific method for teaching entrepreneurship that combines experiential learning with the three building blocks of a successful Lean Startup: Alexander Osterwalder's "Business Model Canvas,"[28][29] Blank's "Customer Development Model,[30] and Agile Engineering.
The Lean LaunchPad changed the way entrepreneurship is taught.[31] Instead of relying on the traditional business school practice of teaching students how to write a standard corporate business plan, or simply build a product, the course provides hands-on experience in what it takes to start a company.
Students propose and immediately test business hypotheses. They get out of the building to talk to 10-15 prospective customers, partners and others each week. They use the customer feedback acquired in these interviews to refine their product or service by building a new minimal viable product weekly; ensure their product or service meets a customer need or solves a customer problem; and validate that they have created a repeatable, scalable business model.
Since its inception, Blank’s course has been adopted by more than 100 universities worldwide, and more than 300,000 people have taken a free online version of the class at Udacity.com.[32]
The National Science Foundation Innovation Corps[edit]
In July 2011 the National Science Foundation asked Blank to adapt his Lean LaunchPad class for its Innovation Corps (I-Corps), which develops and nurtures a national innovation ecosystem by helping discoveries from fundamental research to become new companies.
The course is now the standard for science commercialization, serving as the syllabus of the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps (I-Corps) that is taught in 53 universities and has been adopted by the other federal research agencies (NIH, DOE, HHS, NSA);[33] and is helping to drive innovation within the U.S. government, particularly within the defense and intelligence community.
Following a successful pilot, the I-Corps program quickly expanded. A version of the I-Corps program specifically dedicated to biomedical research, called The I-Corps at NIH, was devised in 2014. As of January 2017, I-Corps has a National Innovation Network of more than 190 colleges and universities, and more than 800 teams of scientists and engineers have gone through the program.[1][4][3][33]
Hacking for Defense and Hacking for Diplomacy[edit]
Hacking for Defense and Hacking for Diplomacy are courses created at Stanford in 2016 that use Blank’s Lean LaunchPad curriculum to address national defense and foreign policy challenges while offering a new platform for completing national service.
Hacking for Defense connects the Silicon Valley innovation mindset with islands of innovation inside the U.S. Department of Defense and intelligence community. Student teams work with DOD and intelligence sponsors, using Lean Startup methods and Blank’s Lean LaunchPad curriculum to address real-world national security problems.
Hacking for Defense immediately began to scale after its pilot in spring 2016. In 2017, it will be taught in more than 15 other universities across the country, providing solutions to hundreds of critical national security problems annually.
The pilot Hacking for Diplomacy class wrapped up at Stanford in December. In it, student teams work with State Department sponsors, using Lean Startup methods to address critical foreign policy challenges.[32][34][35]
Awards and honors[edit]
In 2009, Blank won the Stanford University Undergraduate Teaching Award in Management Science and Engineering.[5] That same year he was also named one of the Top 10 Influencers in Silicon Valley by the Silicon Valley Mercury News.[36] In 2010, Blank was a recipient of the Earl F. Cheit Outstanding Teaching Award at U.C. Berkeley Haas School of Business.
In 2012 The Harvard Business Review named him one of 12 Masters of Innovation and CNBC recognized him as one of the "11 Notable Entrepreneurs Teaching the Next Generation."[37][38]
He was named Senior Fellow for Entrepreneurship at Columbia University in 2015 and was recognized by The Thinkers50 global ranking of management thinkers. Blank is an infrequent speaker at conferences and entrepreneurial events but has given commencement speeches at Philadelphia University in 2011, the University of Minnesota in 2013, ESADE Business School in 2014, and at NYU in 2016. NPR ranked his Philadelphia University commencement speech as one of the best in the last 325 years.
Publications[edit]
The Four Steps to the Epiphany[edit]

Known for
The Customer Development Methodology


Steve Blank (born 1953) is a Silicon Valley serial-entrepreneur and academician who is based in Pescadero, California.[1]
Blank is recognized for developing the Customer Development method that launched the Lean Startup movement, a methodology which recognized that startups are not smaller versions of large companies, but require their own set of processes and tools to be successful.[2] His May 2013 cover story in the Harvard Business Review, “Why the Lean Startup Changes Everything,” defined the Lean Startup movement.[3] His Lean Launchpad class (taught as the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps) has become the standard for commercialization for all federal research.[1]
Blank has spent over 30 years within the high technology industry, founding or working within eight startup companies, four of which have gone public.[4][5] He is the co-founder of E.piphany.[4][6][5]
Retired since 1999, Blank writes and teaches about Customer Development and the Lean Startup method. He is an adjunct professor of entrepreneurship at Stanford;[7][8] lectures at the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business, and is a senior fellow at Columbia University,[9] and New York University; is a prolific blogger and public speaker; and has written four books: The Four Steps to the Epiphany, Not All Those Who Wander Are Lost, The Startup Owner's Manual and Holding a Cat by the Tail.[10][11]
Blank’s Google Tech talk, "The Secret History of Silicon Valley," offers a widely regarded insider's perspective on the emergence of Silicon Valley's startup ecosystem.

Early life[edit]
Blank was born to immigrant parents who ran a grocery in the Chelsea neighborhood in New York City.[12] He grew up with a sister who was 12 years older than him and both siblings were raised by his mother after his father left home when he was aged 6.[12] His parents had never been to college (has father dropped out in 8th grade) but hoped he would.[13] He attended the University of Michigan, but dropped out after one semester.[12][13][14]
From Michigan, Blank hitchhiked to Miami, where he found work at the Miami International Airport, loading racehorses onto aircraft.[12][13] At the airport, Blank developed an interest in avionics. He realized the only way to learn more was to join the Air Force.[13]
His military career took him to Thailand during the Vietnam War, where he was managing a team of 15 electronics technicians within a year and a half.[12][13] He was 20 years old.[13]
After leaving the military, Blank moved to Palo Alto, a town in an area which would ultimately become known as Silicon Valley.[13]
Startup career[edit]
Steve Blank arrived in Silicon Valley at the start of the business boom in 1978.[4][11] His first job in the region was with ESL, a startup that was a pioneering company for National Reconnaissance.[14] The company helped the government understand the Soviets' technological and arms developments during the Cold War.[14]
During his 21-year career as an entrepreneur, Blank went on to found or work with a wide range of high-tech companies.[15] Four of his companies went public.[12] Some of his ventures include Zilog and MIPS Computers, Convergent Technologies, Ardent, SuperMac Technologies, ESL and Rocket Science Games.[7][15]
Blank co-founded his 8th and last startup, the Customer Relationship Management provider E.piphany, in 1996 and retired the day before its IPO in September 1999.[2][4][16][17] Notable members of the company include Roger Siboni and Karen Richardson.[18][19]
Blank has since served on the boards of the public entities Macrovision/Rovi and Immersion as well as several private companies. He continues to invest in and advise Silicon Valley startups including Machine Intelligence companies Geometric (acquired by Uber) and Deepscale .[20]
Customer Development Methodology[edit]
Blank created the Customer Development methodology in the mid 1990s.[14] The concept details a scientific approach that can be applied by startups and entrepreneurs to improve their products success by developing a better understanding of customers’ problems/needs as well as the other hypotheses necessary to build a commercial successful company.[2][4][14]
Lean Startup Movement[edit]
Blank's Customer Development methodology is a cornerstone of the Lean Startup Movement, popularized by Eric Ries[21][22] whom Blank states was “the best student I ever had.”[4] The Lean Startup approach relies on validated learning, scientific experimentation, and iterative product releases to shorten product development cycles, measure progress, and gain valuable customer feedback. Blank and Ries developed the ideas beginning around 2004 when Blank was an investor and advisor to the company, IMVU, that Ries co-founded.[23] The Lean Startup has been adopted by entrepreneurs worldwide as a constructive way to try out ideas and gain customers.[2] Ries has integrated the Customer Development methodology into the Lean Startup practices and considers it to be one of the Lean Startup Movement's pillars.[24][25][26]
Academic teaching career[edit]
Blank began teaching entrepreneurship in 2002 at UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business and has since taught entrepreneurship to both undergraduate and graduate students. He currently teaches at Stanford, the University of California Berkeley Haas School of Business, New York University and Columbia.[7][8][27] His Lean LaunchPad curricula uses the Customer Development methodology and Lean Startup methods he developed throughout his career as a serial entrepreneur and academic.[12]
The Lean LaunchPad[edit]
In January 2011, Blank created the Lean LaunchPad class at Stanford University and UC Berkeley. The class is a scientific method for teaching entrepreneurship that combines experiential learning with the three building blocks of a successful Lean Startup: Alexander Osterwalder's "Business Model Canvas,"[28][29] Blank's "Customer Development Model,[30] and Agile Engineering.
The Lean LaunchPad changed the way entrepreneurship is taught.[31] Instead of relying on the traditional business school practice of teaching students how to write a standard corporate business plan, or simply build a product, the course provides hands-on experience in what it takes to start a company.
Students propose and immediately test business hypotheses. They get out of the building to talk to 10-15 prospective customers, partners and others each week. They use the customer feedback acquired in these interviews to refine their product or service by building a new minimal viable product weekly; ensure their product or service meets a customer need or solves a customer problem; and validate that they have created a repeatable, scalable business model.
Since its inception, Blank’s course has been adopted by more than 100 universities worldwide, and more than 300,000 people have taken a free online version of the class at Udacity.com.[32]
The National Science Foundation Innovation Corps[edit]
In July 2011 the National Science Foundation asked Blank to adapt his Lean LaunchPad class for its Innovation Corps (I-Corps), which develops and nurtures a national innovation ecosystem by helping discoveries from fundamental research to become new companies.
The course is now the standard for science commercialization, serving as the syllabus of the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps (I-Corps) that is taught in 53 universities and has been adopted by the other federal research agencies (NIH, DOE, HHS, NSA);[33] and is helping to drive innovation within the U.S. government, particularly within the defense and intelligence community.
Following a successful pilot, the I-Corps program quickly expanded. A version of the I-Corps program specifically dedicated to biomedical research, called The I-Corps at NIH, was devised in 2014. As of January 2017, I-Corps has a National Innovation Network of more than 190 colleges and universities, and more than 800 teams of scientists and engineers have gone through the program.[1][4][3][33]
Hacking for Defense and Hacking for Diplomacy[edit]
Hacking for Defense and Hacking for Diplomacy are courses created at Stanford in 2016 that use Blank’s Lean LaunchPad curriculum to address national defense and foreign policy challenges while offering a new platform for completing national service.
Hacking for Defense connects the Silicon Valley innovation mindset with islands of innovation inside the U.S. Department of Defense and intelligence community. Student teams work with DOD and intelligence sponsors, using Lean Startup methods and Blank’s Lean LaunchPad curriculum to address real-world national security problems.
Hacking for Defense immediately began to scale after its pilot in spring 2016. In 2017, it will be taught in more than 15 other universities across the country, providing solutions to hundreds of critical national security problems annually.
The pilot Hacking for Diplomacy class wrapped up at Stanford in December. In it, student teams work with State Department sponsors, using Lean Startup methods to address critical foreign policy challenges.[32][34][35]
Awards and honors[edit]
In 2009, Blank won the Stanford University Undergraduate Teaching Award in Management Science and Engineering.[5] That same year he was also named one of the Top 10 Influencers in Silicon Valley by the Silicon Valley Mercury News.[36] In 2010, Blank was a recipient of the Earl F. Cheit Outstanding Teaching Award at U.C. Berkeley Haas School of Business.
In 2012 The Harvard Business Review named him one of 12 Masters of Innovation and CNBC recognized him as one of the "11 Notable Entrepreneurs Teaching the Next Generation."[37][38]
He was named Senior Fellow for Entrepreneurship at Columbia University in 2015 and was recognized by The Thinkers50 global ranking of management thinkers. Blank is an infrequent speaker at conferences and entrepreneurial events but has given commencement speeches at Philadelphia University in 2011, the University of Minnesota in 2013, ESADE Business School in 2014, and at NYU in 2016. NPR ranked his Philadelphia University commencement speech as one of the best in the last 325 years.

Lower East Side, New York City


Alma mater
University of Michigan (dropped out)


Occupation
Academic, Author, Entrepreneur


Known for
The Customer Development Methodology


Steve Blank (born 1953) is a Silicon Valley serial-entrepreneur and academician who is based in Pescadero, California.[1]
Blank is recognized for developing the Customer Development method that launched the Lean Startup movement, a methodology which recognized that startups are not smaller versions of large companies, but require their own set of processes and tools to be successful.[2] His May 2013 cover story in the Harvard Business Review, “Why the Lean Startup Changes Everything,” defined the Lean Startup movement.[3] His Lean Launchpad class (taught as the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps) has become the standard for commercialization for all federal research.[1]
Blank has spent over 30 years within the high technology industry, founding or working within eight startup companies, four of which have gone public.[4][5] He is the co-founder of E.piphany.[4][6][5]
Retired since 1999, Blank writes and teaches about Customer Development and the Lean Startup method. He is an adjunct professor of entrepreneurship at Stanford;[7][8] lectures at the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business, and is a senior fellow at Columbia University,[9] and New York University; is a prolific blogger and public speaker; and has written four books: The Four Steps to the Epiphany, Not All Those Who Wander Are Lost, The Startup Owner's Manual and Holding a Cat by the Tail.[10][11]
Blank’s Google Tech talk, "The Secret History of Silicon Valley," offers a widely regarded insider's perspective on the emergence of Silicon Valley's startup ecosystem.

Early life[edit]
Blank was born to immigrant parents who ran a grocery in the Chelsea neighborhood in New York City.[12] He grew up with a sister who was 12 years older than him and both siblings were raised by his mother after his father left home when he was aged 6.[12] His parents had never been to college (has father dropped out in 8th grade) but hoped he would.[13] He attended the University of Michigan, but dropped out after one semester.[12][13][14]
From Michigan, Blank hitchhiked to Miami, where he found work at the Miami International Airport, loading racehorses onto aircraft.[12][13] At the airport, Blank developed an interest in avionics. He realized the only way to learn more was to join the Air Force.[13]
His military career took him to Thailand during the Vietnam War, where he was managing a team of 15 electronics technicians within a year and a half.[12][13] He was 20 years old.[13]
After leaving the military, Blank moved to Palo Alto, a town in an area which would ultimately become known as Silicon Valley.[13]
Startup career[edit]
Steve Blank arrived in Silicon Valley at the start of the business boom in 1978.[4][11] His first job in the region was with ESL, a startup that was a pioneering company for National Reconnaissance.[14] The company helped the government understand the Soviets' technological and arms developments during the Cold War.[14]
During his 21-year career as an entrepreneur, Blank went on to found or work with a wide range of high-tech companies.[15] Four of his companies went public.[12] Some of his ventures include Zilog and MIPS Computers, Convergent Technologies, Ardent, SuperMac Technologies, ESL and Rocket Science Games.[7][15]
Blank co-founded his 8th and last startup, the Customer Relationship Management provider E.piphany, in 1996 and retired the day before its IPO in September 1999.[2][4][16][17] Notable members of the company include Roger Siboni and Karen Richardson.[18][19]
Blank has since served on the boards of the public entities Macrovision/Rovi and Immersion as well as several private companies. He continues to invest in and advise Silicon Valley startups including Machine Intelligence companies Geometric (acquired by Uber) and Deepscale .[20]
Customer Development Methodology[edit]
Blank created the Customer Development methodology in the mid 1990s.[14] The concept details a scientific approach that can be applied by startups and entrepreneurs to improve their products success by developing a better understanding of customers’ problems/needs as well as the other hypotheses necessary to build a commercial successful company.[2][4][14]
Lean Startup Movement[edit]
Blank's Customer Development methodology is a cornerstone of the Lean Startup Movement, popularized by Eric Ries[21][22] whom Blank states was “the best student I ever had.”[4] The Lean Startup approach relies on validated learning, scientific experimentation, and iterative product releases to shorten product development cycles, measure progress, and gain valuable customer feedback. Blank and Ries developed the ideas beginning around 2004 when Blank was an investor and advisor to the company, IMVU, that Ries co-founded.[23] The Lean Startup has been adopted by entrepreneurs worldwide as a constructive way to try out ideas and gain customers.[2] Ries has integrated the Customer Development methodology into the Lean Startup practices and considers it to be one of the Lean Startup Movement's pillars.[24][25][26]
Academic teaching career[edit]
Blank began teaching entrepreneurship in 2002 at UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business and has since taught entrepreneurship to both undergraduate and graduate students. He currently teaches at Stanford, the University of California Berkeley Haas School of Business, New York University and Columbia.[7][8][27] His Lean LaunchPad curricula uses the Customer Development methodology and Lean Startup methods he developed throughout his career as a serial entrepreneur and academic.[12]
The Lean LaunchPad[edit]
In January 2011, Blank created the Lean LaunchPad class at Stanford University and UC Berkeley. The class is a scientific method for teaching entrepreneurship that combines experiential learning with the three building blocks of a successful Lean Startup: Alexander Osterwalder's "Business Model Canvas,"[28][29] Blank's "Customer Development Model,[30] and Agile Engineering.
The Lean LaunchPad changed the way entrepreneurship is taught.[31] Instead of relying on the traditional business school practice of teaching students how to write a standard corporate business plan, or simply build a product, the course provides hands-on experience in what it takes to start a company.
Students propose and immediately test business hypotheses. They get out of the building to talk to 10-15 prospective customers, partners and others each week. They use the customer feedback acquired in these interviews to refine their product or service by building a new minimal viable product weekly; ensure their product or service meets a customer need or solves a customer problem; and validate that they have created a repeatable, scalable business model.
Since its inception, Blank’s course has been adopted by more than 100 universities worldwide, and more than 300,000 people have taken a free online version of the class at Udacity.com.[32]
The National Science Foundation Innovation Corps[edit]
In July 2011 the National Science Foundation asked Blank to adapt his Lean LaunchPad class for its Innovation Corps (I-Corps), which develops and nurtures a national innovation ecosystem by helping discoveries from fundamental research to become new companies.
The course is now the standard for science commercialization, serving as the syllabus of the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps (I-Corps) that is taught in 53 universities and has been adopted by the other federal research agencies (NIH, DOE, HHS, NSA);[33] and is helping to drive innovation within the U.S. government, particularly within the defense and intelligence community.
Following a successful pilot, the I-Corps program quickly expanded. A version of the I-Corps program specifically dedicated to biomedical research, called The I-Corps at NIH, was devised in 2014. As of January 2017, I-Corps has a National Innovation Network of more than 190 colleges and universities, and more than 800 teams of scientists and engineers have gone through the program.[1][4][3][33]
Hacking for Defense and Hacking for Diplomacy[edit]
Hacking for Defense and Hacking for Diplomacy are courses created at Stanford in 2016 that use Blank’s Lean LaunchPad curriculum to address national defense and foreign policy challenges while offering a new platform for completing national service.
Hacking for Defense connects the Silicon Valley innovation mindset with islands of innovation inside the U.S. Department of Defense and intelligence community. Student teams work with DOD and intelligence sponsors, using Lean Startup methods and Blank’s Lean LaunchPad curriculum to address real-world national security problems.
Hacking for Defense immediately began to scale after its pilot in spring 2016. In 2017, it will be taught in more than 15 other universities across the country, providing solutions to hundreds of critical national security problems annually.
The pilot Hacking for Diplomacy class wrapped up at Stanford in December. In it, student teams work with State Department sponsors, using Lean Startup methods to address critical foreign policy challenges.[32][34][35]
Awards and honors[edit]
In 2009, Blank won the Stanford University Undergraduate Teaching Award in Management Science and Engineering.[5] That same year he was also named one of the Top 10 Influencers in Silicon Valley by the Silicon Valley Mercury News.[36] In 2010, Blank was a recipient of the Earl F. Cheit Outstanding Teaching Award at U.C. Berkeley Haas School of Business.
In 2012 The Harvard Business Review named him one of 12 Masters of Innovation and CNBC recognized him as one of the "11 Notable Entrepreneurs Teaching the Next Generation."[37][38]
He was named Senior Fellow for Entrepreneurship at Columbia University in 2015 and was recognized by The Thinkers50 global ranking of management thinkers. Blank is an infrequent speaker at conferences and entrepreneurial events but has given commencement speeches at Philadelphia University in 2011, the University of Minnesota in 2013, ESADE Business School in 2014, and at NYU in 2016. NPR ranked his Philadelphia University commencement speech as one of the best in the last 325 years.
Publications[edit]
The Four Steps to the Epiphany[edit]
In 2005, Blank published The Four Steps to the Epiphany: Successful Strategies for Products that Win, (K&S Ranch Press) which details his approach to the Customer Development process.[11] In the book, Blank outlines his views about how entrepreneurship is a practice that can be actively managed rather than an art which must be passively experienced.[14] The book is viewed in entrepreneurship circles as the definitive source on the Customer Development methodology.[14]
Not All Who Wander Are Lost[edit]
Blank released a second book in 2010, Not All Who Wander Are Lost which relates stories from his life as an entrepreneur.[11] The collection of material develops a narrative about how to live life amid the fast-paced world of Silicon Valley startups.[39]
The Startup Owner's Manual[edit]
Steve Blank and Bob Dorf co-authored The Startup Owner's Manual, which was released in March 2012.[40][41] The 608-page reference manual details a scientific approach to entrepreneurship and emphasizes the importance of "rigorous and repeated testing."[10][12] The work draws on ideas from The Business Model Generation and The Four Steps to the Epiphany.[10] According to Blank, the book was designed to be used as an "encyclopedia and a blueprint" for startups.[42]
Holding a Cat by the Tail[edit]
Blank released Holding a Cat by the Tail in 2014. The book is updated version of Not All Those Who Wander Are Lost, featuring additional lessons learned from his life as an entrepreneur.
Blog[edit]
Blank authors a blog about entrepreneurship.[6] In 2012, his blog was ranked one of the "10 Must-Read Blogs for Any Lean Startup" by Welovelean.com.[43] The blog is considered a must-read for entrepreneurs and is often syndicated by UC Berkeley, VentureBeat, Huffington Post, Forbes, Inc.com and NikkeiBP in Japan. It is available as an audio podcast (produced by Clearshore and featuring the voice of HP Lewis) on the blog itself or through SoundCloud, and translated into Spanish (by Alberto Peralta).[5][42][44]
Public service[edit]
Blank was a past Chairman of Audubon California and[15] has also served on the board of the Peninsula Open Space Trust[45] and was a trustee of U.C. Santa Cruz foundation and served on the board of the California League of Conservation Voters.[46] In 2007 he was appointed to the California Coastal Commission.[47] He has made philanthropic gifts to preserve the California Coast and has contributed funds to support the visitors' center at Año Nuevo State Reserve and to the Peninsula Open Space Trust.[4][45]
Reception[edit]
Blank is known amongst entrepreneurs and students as one of the "The Godfathers of Silicon Valley".[42] His books, blog, and interviews are often referred to or featured in world news publications such as Reuters, the New York Times, Forbes, Inc, TechCrunch and The Wall Street Journal.[1][2][6][12][42][48] Blank has hosted numerous sold-out speaking events and conferences about entrepreneurship and the Customer Development methodology.[49][50][50][51][52]

Steve Blank





Born
1953 (age 63–64)
Lower East Side, New York City


Alma mater
University of Michigan (dropped out)


Occupation
Academic, Author, Entrepreneur


Known for
The Customer Development Methodology


Steve Blank (born 1953) is a Silicon Valley serial-entrepreneur and academician who is based in Pescadero, California.[1]
Blank is recognized for developing the Customer Development method that launched the Lean Startup movement, a methodology which recognized that startups are not smaller versions of large companies, but require their own set of processes and tools to be successful.[2] His May 2013 cover story in the Harvard Business Review, “Why the Lean Startup Changes Everything,” defined the Lean Startup movement.[3] His Lean Launchpad class (taught as the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps) has become the standard for commercialization for all federal research.[1]
Blank has spent over 30 years within the high technology industry, founding or working within eight startup companies, four of which have gone public.[4][5] He is the co-founder of E.piphany.[4][6][5]
Retired since 1999, Blank writes and teaches about Customer Development and the Lean Startup method. He is an adjunct professor of entrepreneurship at Stanford;[7][8] lectures at the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business, and is a senior fellow at Columbia University,[9] and New York University; is a prolific blogger and public speaker; and has written four books: The Four Steps to the Epiphany, Not All Those Who Wander Are Lost, The Startup Owner's Manual and Holding a Cat by the Tail.[10][11]
Blank’s Google Tech talk, "The Secret History of Silicon Valley," offers a widely regarded insider's perspective on the emergence of Silicon Valley's startup ecosystem.

Early life[edit]
Blank was born to immigrant parents who ran a grocery in the Chelsea neighborhood in New York City.[12] He grew up with a sister who was 12 years older than him and both siblings were raised by his mother after his father left home when he was aged 6.[12] His parents had never been to college (has father dropped out in 8th grade) but hoped he would.[13] He attended the University of Michigan, but dropped out after one semester.[12][13][14]
From Michigan, Blank hitchhiked to Miami, where he found work at the Miami International Airport, loading racehorses onto aircraft.[12][13] At the airport, Blank developed an interest in avionics. He realized the only way to learn more was to join the Air Force.[13]
His military career took him to Thailand during the Vietnam War, where he was managing a team of 15 electronics technicians within a year and a half.[12][13] He was 20 years old.[13]
After leaving the military, Blank moved to Palo Alto, a town in an area which would ultimately become known as Silicon Valley.[13]
Startup career[edit]
Steve Blank arrived in Silicon Valley at the start of the business boom in 1978.[4][11] His first job in the region was with ESL, a startup that was a pioneering company for National Reconnaissance.[14] The company helped the government understand the Soviets' technological and arms developments during the Cold War.[14]
During his 21-year career as an entrepreneur, Blank went on to found or work with a wide range of high-tech companies.[15] Four of his companies went public.[12] Some of his ventures include Zilog and MIPS Computers, Convergent Technologies, Ardent, SuperMac Technologies, ESL and Rocket Science Games.[7][15]
Blank co-founded his 8th and last startup, the Customer Relationship Management provider E.piphany, in 1996 and retired the day before its IPO in September 1999.[2][4][16][17] Notable members of the company include Roger Siboni and Karen Richardson.[18][19]
Blank has since served on the boards of the public entities Macrovision/Rovi and Immersion as well as several private companies. He continues to invest in and advise Silicon Valley startups including Machine Intelligence companies Geometric (acquired by Uber) and Deepscale .[20]
Customer Development Methodology[edit]
Blank created the Customer Development methodology in the mid 1990s.[14] The concept details a scientific approach that can be applied by startups and entrepreneurs to improve their products success by developing a better understanding of customers’ problems/needs as well as the other hypotheses necessary to build a commercial successful company.[2][4][14]
Lean Startup Movement[edit]
Blank's Customer Development methodology is a cornerstone of the Lean Startup Movement, popularized by Eric Ries[21][22] whom Blank states was “the best student I ever had.”[4] The Lean Startup approach relies on validated learning, scientific experimentation, and iterative product releases to shorten product development cycles, measure progress, and gain valuable customer feedback. Blank and Ries developed the ideas beginning around 2004 when Blank was an investor and advisor to the company, IMVU, that Ries co-founded.[23] The Lean Startup has been adopted by entrepreneurs worldwide as a constructive way to try out ideas and gain customers.[2] Ries has integrated the Customer Development methodology into the Lean Startup practices and considers it to be one of the Lean Startup Movement's pillars.[24][25][26]
Academic teaching career[edit]
Blank began teaching entrepreneurship in 2002 at UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business and has since taught entrepreneurship to both undergraduate and graduate students. He currently teaches at Stanford, the University of California Berkeley Haas School of Business, New York University and Columbia.[7][8][27] His Lean LaunchPad curricula uses the Customer Development methodology and Lean Startup methods he developed throughout his career as a serial entrepreneur and academic.[12]
The Lean LaunchPad[edit]
In January 2011, Blank created the Lean LaunchPad class at Stanford University and UC Berkeley. The class is a scientific method for teaching entrepreneurship that combines experiential learning with the three building blocks of a successful Lean Startup: Alexander Osterwalder's "Business Model Canvas,"[28][29] Blank's "Customer Development Model,[30] and Agile Engineering.
The Lean LaunchPad changed the way entrepreneurship is taught.[31] Instead of relying on the traditional business school practice of teaching students how to write a standard corporate business plan, or simply build a product, the course provides hands-on experience in what it takes to start a company.
Students propose and immediately test business hypotheses. They get out of the building to talk to 10-15 prospective customers, partners and others each week. They use the customer feedback acquired in these interviews to refine their product or service by building a new minimal viable product weekly; ensure their product or service meets a customer need or solves a customer problem; and validate that they have created a repeatable, scalable business model.
Since its inception, Blank’s course has been adopted by more than 100 universities worldwide, and more than 300,000 people have taken a free online version of the class at Udacity.com.[32]
The National Science Foundation Innovation Corps[edit]
In July 2011 the National Science Foundation asked Blank to adapt his Lean LaunchPad class for its Innovation Corps (I-Corps), which develops and nurtures a national innovation ecosystem by helping discoveries from fundamental research to become new companies.
The course is now the standard for science commercialization, serving as the syllabus of the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps (I-Corps) that is taught in 53 universities and has been adopted by the other federal research agencies (NIH, DOE, HHS, NSA);[33] and is helping to drive innovation within the U.S. government, particularly within the defense and intelligence community.
Following a successful pilot, the I-Corps program quickly expanded. A version of the I-Corps program specifically dedicated to biomedical research, called The I-Corps at NIH, was devised in 2014. As of January 2017, I-Corps has a National Innovation Network of more than 190 colleges and universities, and more than 800 teams of scientists and engineers have gone through the program.[1][4][3][33]
Hacking for Defense and Hacking for Diplomacy[edit]
Hacking for Defense and Hacking for Diplomacy are courses created at Stanford in 2016 that use Blank’s Lean LaunchPad curriculum to address national defense and foreign policy challenges while offering a new platform for completing national service.
Hacking for Defense connects the Silicon Valley innovation mindset with islands of innovation inside the U.S. Department of Defense and intelligence community. Student teams work with DOD and intelligence sponsors, using Lean Startup methods and Blank’s Lean LaunchPad curriculum to address real-world national security problems.
Hacking for Defense immediately began to scale after its pilot in spring 2016. In 2017, it will be taught in more than 15 other universities across the country, providing solutions to hundreds of critical national security problems annually.
The pilot Hacking for Diplomacy class wrapped up at Stanford in December. In it, student teams work with State Department sponsors, using Lean Startup methods to address critical foreign policy challenges.[32][34][35]
Awards and honors[edit]
In 2009, Blank won the Stanford University Undergraduate Teaching Award in Management Science and Engineering.[5] That same year he was also named one of the Top 10 Influencers in Silicon Valley by the Silicon Valley Mercury News.[36] In 2010, Blank was a recipient of the Earl F. Cheit Outstanding Teaching Award at U.C. Berkeley Haas School of Business.
In 2012 The Harvard Business Review named him one of 12 Masters of Innovation and CNBC recognized him as one of the "11 Notable Entrepreneurs Teaching the Next Generation."[37][38]
He was named Senior Fellow for Entrepreneurship at Columbia University in 2015 and was recognized by The Thinkers50 global ranking of management thinkers. Blank is an infrequent speaker at conferences and entrepreneurial events but has given commencement speeches at Philadelphia University in 2011, the University of Minnesota in 2013, ESADE Business School in 2014, and at NYU in 2016. NPR ranked his Philadelphia University commencement speech as one of the best in the last 325 years.
Publications[edit]
The Four Steps to the Epiphany[edit]
In 2005, Blank published The Four Steps to the Epiphany: Successful Strategies for Products that Win, (K&S Ranch Press) which details his approach to the Customer Development process.[11] In the book, Blank outlines his views about how entrepreneurship is a practice that can be actively managed rather than an art which must be passively experienced.[14] The book is viewed in entrepreneurship circles as the definitive source on the Customer Development methodology.[14]
Not All Who Wander Are Lost[edit]
Blank released a second book in 2010, Not All Who Wander Are Lost which relates stories from his life as an entrepreneur.[11] The collection of material develops a narrative about how to live life amid the fast-paced world of Silicon Valley startups.[39]
The Startup Owner's Manual[edit]
Steve Blank and Bob Dorf co-authored The Startup Owner's Manual, which was released in March 2012.[40][41] The 608-page reference manual details a scientific approach to entrepreneurship and emphasizes the importance of "rigorous and repeated testing."[10][12] The work draws on ideas from The Business Model Generation and The Four Steps to the Epiphany.[10] According to Blank, the book was designed to be used as an "encyclopedia and a blueprint" for startups.[42]
Holding a Cat by the Tail[edit]
Blank released Holding a Cat by the Tail in 2014. The book is updated version of Not All Those Who Wander Are Lost, featuring additional lessons learned from his life as an entrepreneur.
Blog[edit]
Blank authors a blog about entrepreneurship.[6] In 2012, his blog was ranked one of the "10 Must-Read Blogs for Any Lean Startup" by Welovelean.com.[43] The blog is considered a must-read for entrepreneurs and is often syndicated by UC Berkeley, VentureBeat, Huffington Post, Forbes, Inc.com and NikkeiBP in Japan. It is available as an audio podcast (produced by Clearshore and featuring the voice of HP Lewis) on the blog itself or through SoundCloud, and translated into Spanish (by Alberto Peralta).[5][42][44]
Public service[edit]
Blank was a past Chairman of Audubon California and[15] has also served on the board of the Peninsula Open Space Trust[45] and was a trustee of U.C. Santa Cruz foundation and served on the board of the California League of Conservation Voters.[46] In 2007 he was appointed to the California Coastal Commission.[47] He has made philanthropic gifts to preserve the California Coast and has contributed funds to support the visitors' center at Año Nuevo State Reserve and to the Peninsula Open Space Trust.[4][45]
Reception[edit]
Blank is known amongst entrepreneurs and students as one of the "The Godfathers of Silicon Valley".[42] His books, blog, and interviews are often referred to or featured in world news publications such as Reuters, the New York Times, Forbes, Inc, TechCrunch and The Wall Street Journal.[1][2][6][12][42][48] Blank has hosted numerous sold-out speaking events and conferences about entrepreneurship and the Customer Development methodology.[49][50][50][51][52]

      Reseña de The Four Steps to The Epiphany, Customer Development         Reseña de The Four Steps to The Epiphany de Steve BlankPor Xavi Sanchez sobre Creación de empresas, Metodologías Lean        [Nota: En 2012 Steve Blank publicó la versión actualizada de este libro, bajo el nombre de El manual del emprendedor]Steven Gary BlankSteve Blank es un emprendedor en serie que ha participado en muy diversos proyectos tanto como promotor de los mismos como asesor en muy diferentes aspectos.Fruto de esta amplia experiencia fue vislumbrando poco a poco una serie de características comunes en los proyectos de éxito.   Finalmente decidió enseñar su teoría de desarrollo de startups llamada Customer Development, y gracias a la gran acogida de esta metodología y a la aportación de sus alumno, dio forma al libro donde se describe en detalle las condiciones, procesos, pautas e indicaciones necesarias para conseguir el éxito con una nueva empresa mediante el Customer Development, que viene a ser un desarrollo totalmente orientado al cliente.The Four Steps to the EpiphanyThe Four Steps to the Epiphany es el libro donde se condensa toda la experiencia y conocimiento de Steve Blank y constituye una metodología precursora de Lean Startup, otra de las grandes metodologías actuales.El libro centra su foco en el desarrollo de la empresa y proyecto orientado totalmente al cliente, basando su lógica en la gran incertidumbre con la que tienen que lidiar los emprendedores de muy diversos sectores.Vamos a ser francos y a atrevernos a decir que no es un libro hecho para todos aunque si es un libro que todos los emprendedores o futuros emprendedores deberían leer, probablemente después de la lectura de Business Model Generation, ya que ofrece una serie de conocimiento tan elaborado que se pueden extraer lecciones valiosísimas aunque no se llegue finalmente a aplicar la metodología.Es un libro duro de leer, denso, con mucha información y con constantes rupturas respecto al pensamiento tradicional como por ejemplo el típico desarrollo orientado al producto que hemos seguido durante tanto tiempo.Más allá del conjunto que supone la metodología de Customer Development, el libro se desarrolla ciertos temas de muchos interés como la curva de adopción del ciclo de vida de tecnología (early adopters, the chasm, mas market…), el aprendizaje basado en la dualidad de hipótesis sobre el problema y solución, o los 4 mercados diferentes que puede abordar una startup.Como son temas que ya hemos abordado en Emprenderalia, Customer Development, o que abordaremos más adelante, no vamos a tratarlos en esta reseña, pero los destacamos por su valioso contenido dentro del libro.Los 4 pasos hacia la epifanía: Customer DevelopmentLa metodología de Customer Development se basa en 4 pasos básicos sobre los que se puede iterar las veces que sea necesario antes de pasar al siguiente, muy en la línea de pivotar o perserverar que defiende la metodología de Lean Startup.El primer paso se llama Customer Discovery y se trata de testear una serie de hipótesis antes de lanzarnos a desarrollar nada. Lo que buscamos es saber si realmente hemos encontrado un problema que cierto número de personas/organizaciones necesitan resolver, y si la solución que proponemos es una solución válida para ellos. Esta fase se centra sobre todo en la dupla problema-solución, realizando muchos contactos con posibles clientes (early adopters) para aprender de ellos siempre respecto a nuestras hipótesis. En este paso se puede usar la filosofía de MVP, Producto Viable Mínimo, alternativamente a sistemas de cuestionarios.   El segundo paso se llama Customer Validation y se centra en crear un roadmap de ventas que sea repetible y que esté enfocado en los early adopters, que serán los que nos perdonen las carencias de un producto no acabado o ni siquiera empezado, para asegurarnos de que realmente podemos vender nuestro producto como solución a su problema. Si salimos airosos de estos 2 primeros pasos, podemos asegurar que tenemos un modelo de negocio válido.El tercer paso se llama Customer Creation y es una fase más cercana a los que estamos acostumbrados, ya que trata de generar demanda de nuestro producto para alimentar a nuestros canales de ventas. En esta fase debemos acabar de definir el mercado que estamos abordando, ya que las acciones a realizar serán muy diferentes. Damos el salto al mass market, por lo que empiezan los grandes gastos de marketing y ventas.El cuarto y último paso es Company Building que consiste en afianzar nuestra estructura empresarial cambiando el caos típico de las startups por una estructura en departamentos orientados ya no respecto al cliente sino a su propia misión.Como vemos la empresa realiza un crecimiento progresivo según aumentan las necesidades reales, así nos evitamos quemar dinero en las primeras fases del proyecto cuando todavía ni sabemos si existirá un mercado para nuestro producto ni si estamos solucionando un problema que vale la pena solucionar.En conclusión, un libro potentísimo, lleno de conocimiento fundamental para emprendedores y que recomendamos totalmente desde Emprenderalia. Un must have que se dice.Puedes comprar el libro en inglés en el siguiente enlace: The four steps to the epiphany.     Escrito por Xavi SanchezXavi Sánchez es el fundador de Emprenderalia. Su objetivo es acompañar a otros emprendedores en su aventura empresarial y crear nuevos proyectos. Entre sus campos de acción preferidos se encuentran el marketing online, y las metodologías de negocio, creación de empresas y proyectos.Si quieres leer más artículos de Xavi Sanchez visita su página.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
