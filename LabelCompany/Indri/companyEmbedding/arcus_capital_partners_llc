The Arcus Difference | Arcus Capital Partners

























client login







The Arcus Difference
Our People
Each of Arcus’ investment professionals is highly experienced and thoroughly trained in the fundamentals of wealth preservation. In addition, through extensive hands-on investing for clients in various market cycles at some of the most prestigious wealth management organizations in the world, we believe each of our professionals has the discipline, rigor and investment acumen to help Arcus clients “grow wealth sensibly”. 
Our Incentives are Aligned with our Clients
Arcus invests firm and personal capital in the investment strategies we recommend to our clients.  In doing so, our incentives are completely aligned with those of our clients.  
Truly Independent Advice & Transparent Pricing
Whether it is in the form of investment management, or in connection with a wide range of strategic and financial matters, clients of Arcus receive advice that is independent, transparently priced and in support of their specific goals.
Disciplined Customized Asset Management 
Arcus employs a two-tiered investment approach to deliver its investment results.  The first tier matches each clients strategic asset allocation to their risk profile and long-term goals.  The second tier employs a bottom up analysis of investment manager due diligence and selection with whom we invest.  In doing so, Arcus applies a rigorous process that seeks to uncover and anticipate future opportunities, rather than extrapolating recent performance.    
Access to Unique and Differentiated Investment Strategies
As an independent advisor, Arcus is not limited by a finite list of investment strategies and managers like the traditional Wall Street broker/dealer.  In fact, given its size and investment acumen, Arcus is viewed as an institutional investor by the investment community and is regularly approached by the best and most recognizable investment managers in the world.  However, as an innovative and independent organization, Arcus is always in search of, no matter how large or small, unique investment strategies and managers to deliver superior investment returns to our clients.
Safety and Soundness of Client Assets
Arcus client assets are predominantly held at Charles Schwab & Company, which custodies over $2.2 trillion in client assets1.  Schwab has long been recognized as an industry leader in custody, safekeeping and securities processing and is the largest custodian for independent investment advisors like Arcus2.  Additionally, although Arcus has discretionary investment authority over most of its client assets, Arcus employees or third-parties can not move or transfer client assets into or out of any of it's custodians without the approval and at the direction of each respective client.

About
Preserving and Building Wealth by Anticipating Opportunities
The name of the firm was derived from Arcus, which is the Latin word for arch. Throughout history, the arch has served as a symbol of support and integrity and is regarded as one of the greatest innovations in architecture. As such, atop the firm's arch is the Latin phrase "Semper Memor Futuri" or, "Always Mindful of the Future". The phrase underscores the Arcus belief that an investment approach that collectively anticipates future opportunities will, over the long term, outperform those that mimic current trends based on consensus thinking. And, like the arch, Arcus Capital Partners strives to support client objectives with innovation and integrity.

What are analysts saying about CA stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about CA stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period." (7/17/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "CA announced the acquisition of privately held Veracode for $614M in cash. Veracode provides SaaS-based application security for integration across the software development lifecycle. The deal value represents about 6.0-8.0x NTM revenue, which we view as reasonable, and discuss in more detail below. We believe providing security at the application level will become even more important over time given the ever increasing distributed nature of IT infrastructures." (3/7/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for CA (NASDAQ:CA) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Sell Ratings, 7 Hold Ratings, 5 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.13)Consensus Price Target: $34.85 (0.50% downside)

About
Preserving and Building Wealth by Anticipating Opportunities
The name of the firm was derived from Arcus, which is the Latin word for arch. Throughout history, the arch has served as a symbol of support and integrity and is regarded as one of the greatest innovations in architecture. As such, atop the firm's arch is the Latin phrase "Semper Memor Futuri" or, "Always Mindful of the Future". The phrase underscores the Arcus belief that an investment approach that collectively anticipates future opportunities will, over the long term, outperform those that mimic current trends based on consensus thinking. And, like the arch, Arcus Capital Partners strives to support client objectives with innovation and integrity.
