BBB Reason for Ratings


        BBB rating is based on 13 factors: Get the details about the factors considered.










BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

Hotel Deals: Up To 60% Off Hotels!
Our advertising partners offer great deals at savings of up to 60%. 


Priceline.com offers savings of up to 60% using their 'Name Your Own Price' program. Priceline's 'Name Your Own Price' reservation system is different from other online travel sites. With Priceline's 'Name Your Own Price' reservation system, the exact hotel is shown only after purchase. Over the last 12 months, a substantial percentage of accepted offers have resulted in savings of up to 60% in comparison to the lowest published rates on other leading online travel sites for the same itinerary. There is no guarantee that hotels, dates or prices will be available and savings are not guaranteed. Actual prices and availability are always subject to change.
You can also save up to 60% at Hotwire with 'Hotwire Hot Rates'. 
These are just two examples of amazing offers our partners are offering. Visit Booking.com, Hotels.com, and many more sites for other super deals.

OneTime allows you to search various partner sites at once so you can compare the prices and options offered. Offers and savings are based on information available on these sites. There is no guarantee that these prices, savings, hotels, or dates will be available at the time of booking. Please check the site for the most recent details. When you book travel, your booking is handled by one of those sites directly, not by OneTime. Transactions, and all subsequent customer care, are directly handled by the site where you booked your travel. OneTime does not control the price, rules, regulations, or restrictions surrounding the price. Please read all rules and regulations before booking.

Hotel Deals: Up To 60% Off Hotels!
Our advertising partners offer great deals at savings of up to 60%. 


Priceline.com offers savings of up to 60% using their 'Name Your Own Price' program. Priceline's 'Name Your Own Price' reservation system is different from other online travel sites. With Priceline's 'Name Your Own Price' reservation system, the exact hotel is shown only after purchase. Over the last 12 months, a substantial percentage of accepted offers have resulted in savings of up to 60% in comparison to the lowest published rates on other leading online travel sites for the same itinerary. There is no guarantee that hotels, dates or prices will be available and savings are not guaranteed. Actual prices and availability are always subject to change.
You can also save up to 60% at Hotwire with 'Hotwire Hot Rates'. 
These are just two examples of amazing offers our partners are offering. Visit Booking.com, Hotels.com, and many more sites for other super deals.

OneTime allows you to search various partner sites at once so you can compare the prices and options offered. Offers and savings are based on information available on these sites. There is no guarantee that these prices, savings, hotels, or dates will be available at the time of booking. Please check the site for the most recent details. When you book travel, your booking is handled by one of those sites directly, not by OneTime. Transactions, and all subsequent customer care, are directly handled by the site where you booked your travel. OneTime does not control the price, rules, regulations, or restrictions surrounding the price. Please read all rules and regulations before booking.

Compare Prices






























Get the Scoop: Here's the Truth About Those 80% Off Sales
Now that we have your attention, are you ready to find out why you shouldn't believe those overhyped advertisements?
First off, those enticing "65% Off!", "70% Off!", and "80% Off!" ads generally refer to "discounts" off the highest-priced, most-restricted ticket classes (refundable, etc.). What the carriers are really saying is that there are cheaper flights out there than the most expensive tickets. News flash! In most cases, they're providing absolutely no support that any of those discounts exist under any circumstances.
Here's the bottom line: Most leisure travelers never actually buy the costliest, most-restricted tickets. Those are generally picked up by business travelers shopping on the company dime. With low-cost airlines, online travel agents, and flexible date searches all factoring in to your price hunting, it's rare that you'd ever pay the highest possible price anyway. So that 80% off "discount" doesn't apply to any flight you're likely to book.
For the best strategy, search flights from a wide variety of providers. Comparing rates is the only way to ensure you're getting a competitive price. It's the closest thing you've got to a foolproof strategy for booking flights. Here are our top tips:

Most domestic airlines release sales on Tuesdays, with the majority of competitors matching these deals within 24 hours. To take advantage of these airfare sales and have the largest amount of seats to choose from, search for fares on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Historically, Saturdays have also proved fair prices for domestic travel.
When heading to a destination serviced by multiple airports, be sure to check them all to ensure you're getting the best fare. For example, if you're flying to New York City, search for the major airports (JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark), as well as smaller options (Long Island/Islip and White Plains).
Be flexible with your dates. Searching a range of dates gives you a good ballpark budget for what you can expect to spend on airfare.
Search, then search again. Frequently checking fares for your preferred route over a fixed period of time (e.g., once or twice per day over a week or two) gives you an in-depth, realistic understanding of what your airfare costs should be. Then, when you see a price you think is fair, book with confidence, knowing you've locked in the best fare for your route and budget.

Get the Scoop: Here's the Truth About Those 70% Off Hotel Deals
You may have seen an enticing ad boasting huge discounts on hotel rooms. Though it got your attention, the deal's unlikely to hold up when subject to scrutiny. Here, we detail why:

That discount is likely "subtracted" from the room's rack rate (the highest price for the room on specific days during the peak booking season). Since it's unlikely that you'll ever be charged that price, the discount isn't really a discount at all.
Advertisers also like to add "extras" to the room rate to artificially inflate that "70% off" and sometimes even "80% off" claim. This "value" often includes daily breakfast, internet access, and other surcharge-carrying services in the nightly rate. The discount, therefore, isn't based on just the room but is based on all the related services that might not be of use to you.
Hotel rates are constantly changing. If an event is coming to town, room rates will skyrocket since demand is at a premium. Conversely, if there are extended periods of lower vacancy (hurricane season in the Caribbean, for example), room prices plummet. Attempting to determine the value of a percentage savings from such volatile price points is, at best, an inexact science.

Here are our top tips for getting the best hotel deals every time:

Don't only check one site and call it a day. By comparing prices across several providers, major online travel agencies, and your favorite hotel brand's site, you may find that one price point undercuts the rest-or offers a little something extra for the same price.
Go for it, go opaque. You'll see the room class, neighborhood, amenities, price, and reviews before you book, but if you're willing to take a chance with the hotel brand, opaque sites such as our partners Hotwire and Priceline are great ways to save big.
Forget the oranges, only compare apples to apples. Make sure you're comparing the same offerings across providers. And to ensure you're getting an even better deal, you'll want to compare prices for similar room types at all hotels.
Look for discounts. Oftentimes, hotels offer additional savings for AAA and AARP members, students, military personnel and their families, teachers, and other groups.
Join a private sale site. Sign up for a luxury discount-hotels site, such as JetSetter, which offers exclusive, members-only discounts at the finest properties throughout the world.

Transactions, and all subsequent customer care, are directly handled by the site where you booked your travel. BookingBuddy does not control the price, rules, regulations, or restrictions surrounding the price. Please read all rules and regulations before booking.
Always Get Low-Price Guarantees!
You may have seen low- or best-price guarantees for hotel rooms. But what does that low-price guarantee for hotels actually mean? The answer, as you'll see below, is a little complicated. Best-price guarantees for hotels promise the following:

The price you pay for your hotel room is the lowest available. You won't find a cheaper rate for that hotel room during your preferred travel dates anywhere else.
If you find a lower price for your hotel room after booking, you can get that cheaper rate, a refund in the amount of the difference, or a fixed-guarantee payout.

But how can competing hotel providers all guarantee to have the best price for the same hotel room, you ask? The answer is simple: They all have plenty of "out" built in to their "guarantees" to get around those promises. For example:

Most hotel providers only honor identical "apples to apples" claims (e.g. same-class room for the same travel period, etc.), with absolutely no room for deviation. Maybe you're staying two nights; someone else could be getting a better price for one or three nights.
The refund process for hotel price guarantees is typically lengthy and confusing. You might be able to get a refund for said hotel room, but you'll have to work hard for it.

So, how do you know that you're truly getting the lowest price for your hotel room? By comparing hotel prices across several providers, that's how. Shopping around is the closest there is to a foolproof strategy for booking the best hotel rate. Here are our top tips:

Be as flexible as possible.
Know the destination.
Keep in mind seasonality.
Search, and search often.

Get the Scoop: Here's the Truth About Those 70% Off Sales
Now that we have your attention, are you ready to find out why you should be skeptical of such claims - or any other advertisements like it, for that matter?
First and foremost, those enticing "65% Off!", "70% Off!", and "80% Off!" ads often may refer to "discounts" off the highest-priced car rental during peak times, which may not even apply to your needs. It's difficult to pinpoint the actual value in savings you're getting at any given time. Additionally, those advertised prices might just be the base rates, which don't include taxes, fees, or mileage. 
When comparing your ultimate car rental price, keep in mind the following: 

Daily, weekly, and weekend rates typically vary.
Car rental companies charge fees beyond the time and mileage charges of the rental (e.g., taxes, concession recovery fees, vehicle license recovery fees, and customer facility charges).
Some special offers only apply to specific vehicle categories.
There may be holiday, weekend, or other blackout windows for advertised discounts.
Drivers must meet age and other requirements, which may vary by location.

But don't worry, start your rate comparison by checking out the latest deals through BookingBuddy.com.
Here are some examples we found on June 22, 2017:

Compare Prices






























Get the Scoop: Here's the Truth About Those 80% Off Sales
Now that we have your attention, are you ready to find out why you shouldn't believe those overhyped advertisements?
First off, those enticing "65% Off!", "70% Off!", and "80% Off!" ads generally refer to "discounts" off the highest-priced, most-restricted ticket classes (refundable, etc.). What the carriers are really saying is that there are cheaper flights out there than the most expensive tickets. News flash! In most cases, they're providing absolutely no support that any of those discounts exist under any circumstances.
Here's the bottom line: Most leisure travelers never actually buy the costliest, most-restricted tickets. Those are generally picked up by business travelers shopping on the company dime. With low-cost airlines, online travel agents, and flexible date searches all factoring in to your price hunting, it's rare that you'd ever pay the highest possible price anyway. So that 80% off "discount" doesn't apply to any flight you're likely to book.
For the best strategy, search flights from a wide variety of providers. Comparing rates is the only way to ensure you're getting a competitive price. It's the closest thing you've got to a foolproof strategy for booking flights. Here are our top tips:

Most domestic airlines release sales on Tuesdays, with the majority of competitors matching these deals within 24 hours. To take advantage of these airfare sales and have the largest amount of seats to choose from, search for fares on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Historically, Saturdays have also proved fair prices for domestic travel.
When heading to a destination serviced by multiple airports, be sure to check them all to ensure you're getting the best fare. For example, if you're flying to New York City, search for the major airports (JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark), as well as smaller options (Long Island/Islip and White Plains).
Be flexible with your dates. Searching a range of dates gives you a good ballpark budget for what you can expect to spend on airfare.
Search, then search again. Frequently checking fares for your preferred route over a fixed period of time (e.g., once or twice per day over a week or two) gives you an in-depth, realistic understanding of what your airfare costs should be. Then, when you see a price you think is fair, book with confidence, knowing you've locked in the best fare for your route and budget.

BookingBuddy allows you to search various partner sites at once so you can compare the prices and options offered. Offers and savings are based on information available on these sites. There is no guarantee that these prices, savings, hotels, or dates will be available at the time of booking. Please check the site for the most recent details. When you book travel, your booking is handled by one of those sites directly, not by BookingBuddy. Transactions, and all subsequent customer care, are directly handled by the site where you booked your travel. BookingBuddy does not control the price, rules, regulations, or restrictions surrounding the price. Please read all rules and regulations before booking.


Get the Scoop: Here's the Truth About Those 70% Off Hotel Deals
You may have seen an enticing ad boasting huge discounts on hotel rooms. Though it got your attention, the deal's unlikely to hold up when subject to scrutiny. Here, we detail why:

That discount is likely "subtracted" from the room's rack rate (the highest price for the room on specific days during the peak booking season). Since it's unlikely that you'll ever be charged that price, the discount isn't really a discount at all.
Advertisers also like to add "extras" to the room rate to artificially inflate that "70% off" and sometimes even "80% off" claim. This "value" often includes daily breakfast, internet access, and other surcharge-carrying services in the nightly rate. The discount, therefore, isn't based on just the room but is based on all the related services that might not be of use to you.
Hotel rates are constantly changing. If an event is coming to town, room rates will skyrocket since demand is at a premium. Conversely, if there are extended periods of lower vacancy (hurricane season in the Caribbean, for example), room prices plummet. Attempting to determine the value of a percentage savings from such volatile price points is, at best, an inexact science.

Here are our top tips for getting the best hotel deals every time:

Don't only check one site and call it a day. By comparing prices across several providers, major online travel agencies, and your favorite hotel brand's site, you may find that one price point undercuts the rest-or offers a little something extra for the same price.
Go for it, go opaque. You'll see the room class, neighborhood, amenities, price, and reviews before you book, but if you're willing to take a chance with the hotel brand, opaque sites such as our partners Hotwire and Priceline are great ways to save big.
Forget the oranges, only compare apples to apples. Make sure you're comparing the same offerings across providers. And to ensure you're getting an even better deal, you'll want to compare prices for similar room types at all hotels.
Look for discounts. Oftentimes, hotels offer additional savings for AAA and AARP members, students, military personnel and their families, teachers, and other groups.
Join a private sale site. Sign up for a luxury discount-hotels site, such as JetSetter, which offers exclusive, members-only discounts at the finest properties throughout the world.

BookingBuddy does not control the price, rules, regulations, or restrictions surrounding the price. Please read all rules and regulations before booking.
Always Get Low-Price Guarantees!
You may have seen low- or best-price guarantees for hotel rooms. But what does that low-price guarantee for hotels actually mean? The answer, as you'll see below, is a little complicated. Best-price guarantees for hotels promise the following:

The price you pay for your hotel room is the lowest available. You won't find a cheaper rate for that hotel room during your preferred travel dates anywhere else.
If you find a lower price for your hotel room after booking, you can get that cheaper rate, a refund in the amount of the difference, or a fixed-guarantee payout.

But how can competing hotel providers all guarantee to have the best price for the same hotel room, you ask? The answer is simple: They all have plenty of "out" built in to their "guarantees" to get around those promises. For example:

Most hotel providers only honor identical "apples to apples" claims (e.g. same-class room for the same travel period, etc.), with absolutely no room for deviation. Maybe you're staying two nights; someone else could be getting a better price for one or three nights.
The refund process for hotel price guarantees is typically lengthy and confusing. You might be able to get a refund for said hotel room, but you'll have to work hard for it.

So, how do you know that you're truly getting the lowest price for your hotel room? By comparing hotel prices across several providers, that's how. Shopping around is the closest there is to a foolproof strategy for booking the best hotel rate. Here are our top tips:

Be as flexible as possible.
Know the destination.
Keep in mind seasonality.
Search, and search often.

Get the Scoop: Here's the Truth About Those 70% Off Sales
Now that we have your attention, are you ready to find out why you should be skeptical of such claims - or any other advertisements like it, for that matter?
First and foremost, those enticing "65% Off!", "70% Off!", and "80% Off!" ads often may refer to "discounts" off the highest-priced car rental during peak times, which may not even apply to your needs. It's difficult to pinpoint the actual value in savings you're getting at any given time. Additionally, those advertised prices might just be the base rates, which don't include taxes, fees, or mileage. 
When comparing your ultimate car rental price, keep in mind the following: 

Daily, weekly, and weekend rates typically vary.
Car rental companies charge fees beyond the time and mileage charges of the rental (e.g., taxes, concession recovery fees, vehicle license recovery fees, and customer facility charges).
Some special offers only apply to specific vehicle categories.
There may be holiday, weekend, or other blackout windows for advertised discounts.
Drivers must meet age and other requirements, which may vary by location.

But don't worry, start your rate comparison by checking out the latest deals through BookingBuddy.com.

“Nice Room Big Place”


Reviewed 1 week ago



via mobile




Everything was very nice at this hotel. The room was very big and everything was clean. However, I don't think I would stay here again unless I was specifically going to the casino. It is so big that it was cumbersome to get our things to the room. Also, because of the size it wasn't as cozy as many hotels. It is a nice place though.

“Unfortunate stay”


Reviewed 1 week ago




I stayed here a few years ago and had a lovely weekend. My most recent trip wasn't as nice - here's why. My BF booked over the phone so we could have 2 rooms next to each other. He verified the rate, wrote pricing and confirmation #s and we brought them with. Once we got there, the rate had changed and we went through extensive conversation with the manager on duty to reach an agreeable rate/solution. Tip if you book over the phone, insist that they send an email confirmation so you can address any issues ahead of time. We were frustrated from the minute we checked in. On top of the price difference, our room wasn't entirely clean. We swept aside a good handful of public hairs on the bathroom floor and had open single use coffee packs for morning coffee. The air conditioner in the room was really loud and keep my BF awake on and off (I slept with earplugs and managed to sleep except when the toddler in the room next door screamed for daddy). Last, the pool was cloudy and lined with scum like it hadn't been cleaned in quite a while. I've had worse experiences, but it's too bad a place I had a good experience at a while back wasn't consistent the second time around.

“Fourth of July get away with allergies”


Reviewed 1 week ago




Micheal and Ryan in William B's are amazing bartenders they remember names and made sure that food was allergy free by talking to Chef Jeff who even came out to talk to us about allergies! Jessica a waitress in William B's even knew about our allergies and alerted other staff about placing food on our table that carried the allergen in it!  Never once felt like a nuisance at William B's Steakhouse. At the game Hynissa and Jessica the bartenders made sure that the chefs were aware of the allergen issues. Jonas in Nelson's Deli even went to the back to read the cake label and give me cake that had not been displayed. Bradley the security office remembered us and was constantly smiling and had such a great attitude. Nikki Thenner in housekeeping did a fantastic job making sure that our room was clean and we had plenty of towels and such. Management that helped to assure we had an allergy free trip were: Jessica in the game, Patrick in William B's, and Sherry B in food and beverage who made sure all staff was aware of allergy issues. Definitively looking forward to a return get away at Blue Chip Casino!

“Quoting one room price and then charging at a much higher rate.”


Reviewed 3 weeks ago




We recently stayed at the Blue Chip Casino for 1 night. Upon check in we were told our room rate was $140. When initialing the reservation we saw the rate of $123. We just assumed that the $140 was the total with taxes. Upon check out we received a bill for $190. We immediately told them that it was incorrect. We told them we were quoted $140. They told us that the $123 was the base room rate and that they could change the rate if they felt the quoted price was wrong. Seriously? They then said that they would have to contact the clerk who checked us in (like she would even remember who we were) and they would give us a call. It has been over a week since we were there and they have not called. We have tried calling them and receive no response. Think twice before staying here. Despicable customer service. If you check the Better Business Bureau (which I just did) I was not surprised to see an "F' as their score. There are so many other places to gamble and spend the night - no need to spend your money here. Will never go back.

The bars inside are fun. The music venue sucks. It is just a banquet hall with chairs so you can't see the stage well at all. The casino is so smoke filled you can't see or breath. The hotel rooms are way to expensive. It's just like any other casino boat in the area.

This was my 1st trip here. We went to see a band where we knew the singer play in the band (South City Revival) that played in bar directly on your right when you walk into the casino. The music and drinks were a good start to a fun night. Very reasonable tables, plenty of machines as well. Our room was very nice, the bathroom had a spa feel to it. The rooms were also reasonably priced. Looking forward to coming back again.

“I'ts just a casino boat”


Reviewed 1 week ago




The bars inside are fun. The music venue sucks. It is just a banquet hall with chairs so you can't see the stage well at all. The casino is so smoke filled you can't see or breath. The hotel rooms are way to expensive. It's just like any other casino boat in the area.

“Vegas Feel, Close to Home”


Reviewed 1 week ago



via mobile




This was my 1st trip here. We went to see a band where we knew the singer play in the band (South City Revival) that played in bar directly on your right when you walk into the casino. The music and drinks were a good start to a fun night. Very reasonable tables, plenty of machines as well. Our room was very nice, the bathroom had a spa feel to it. The rooms were also reasonably priced. Looking forward to coming back again.

It was a great getaway though!Upvoted 3 days agoTommi SerritelliJune 16, 2014Been here 50+ timesPatrick at the steakhouse is one of the nicest men I ever met. He also runs the best steakhouse too!Upvoted 3 days agoAllan MJune 20, 2016Good band that was performing in the bar area right by the gaming floor, past the buffet. Be ready for the ID and bag check to go to the gaming floor, including opening your bag for them.Steph WilkinsJanuary 16, 2012Here with family. Husband has a class for playground safety. Place is fine. Not amazing or terrible. Friendly people, but the baby always waves at everyone.Daniel LouieNovember 27, 2010Been here 25+ timesStay away from the buffet. The cafe is slow. William B's Steakhouse is excellent though it's all smoking seating (go late when there aren't as many people). The rooms in the new tower are excellent.Clementine MottolaDecember 11, 2012Been here 5+ timesMake sure you have your ID handy, they check every time you enter the casino. Both security guards change every single hour.Timmie L. DavisOctober 29, 2012Been here 10+ timesJust to clarify something- IF U LOOK YOUNG, U WILL GET CARDED NO MATTER HOW OLD U ARE! I should know, I work @ Blue Chip. I had fun at Vegas Baby & love William B'sAndy ScottFebruary 18, 2012Been here 5+ timesBe careful here. I get carded everytime I shave. Coming here 3 its and know the security by site but over zealous with checks.Tommi SerritelliApril 6, 2014Been here 50+ timesThey have the best 2 hosts ever!!! Tim Connor & Nicole they know how to treat people fantastic!!!!! Love them both!!!Frank RojasJune 26, 2013I went for a wedding on the hotel, and the service was great !!!! no complain about the room... I do highly recommend this hotel !!!Brenda ShroutApril 21Great staff good food and nice rooms. Fair selection of games however I like how the casino used to be 3 levels.Michael CampbellDecember 28, 2014I felt like I was in Vegas until I looked out the window. Nice and friendly staff. William B's food could have been hotter being that the place had just opened.B Connected OnlineJuly 18, 2012The Blue Chip Casino Chicago is an hour's drive away from central and downtown Chicago, so you may want to stay the night.Ad BaileyAugust 2, 2012Been here 5+ timesFlashy outside, lackluster inside compared to Firekeepers+Four Winds, better than it was. HATE ALWAYS BEING LOOKED AT LIKE A CRIMINAL WHEN GETTING CARDED! KEEPS ME FROM GOING!Drew DavisSeptember 21, 2015Hotel and play. Rooms are nice. Play area is big as well. Nightclub too!Brenda ShroutApril 21Bring back the other levels on the boat...it was much nicer I miss the beautiful stairways that were once there.Daniel LouieJanuary 8, 2012Been here 25+ timesIf you stay in the new Spa Tower, they come around each room about 8pm to leave chocolate bars on your pillow. Keep Do Not Disturb off or you won't get one.Brenda ShroutApril 21Great food and great staff. There is plenty to do to keep you busy.Matthew GasperSeptember 3, 2015Perhaps a bit dated but I love the lower limit tables and Caribbean Stud Poker!!Nicole LeonardAugust 18, 2014Been here 10+ timesLove the remodeling they did. Nice little gem in our part of the state. :)Scott SaxFebruary 23, 2012Been here 10+ timesJoin the players club and come often. They send a lot of perks. Expect a good payout.Alex ClaneySeptember 27, 2013Tip: if you ever stay here be sure and request a non-smoking room. Otherwise, you will end up sleeping in a fucking ash tray!Clementine MottolaDecember 11, 2012Been here 5+ timesSex & the City slot machine is addictive & so fun to play! You cant help but dance while playing :)Clementine MottolaDecember 11, 2012Been here 5+ timesRocks lounge bartender Ryan is one of the best bartenders Ive ever had, while Tim was absolutely the worst. They were like good cop, bad cop... Jekyll & Hyde even!Jen R.September 27, 2014TAXI WARNING!! If you need a taxi to leave the casino during late after hours, prepare for an hour wait. Therefore, I suggest you call in a taxi an hour before you decide to leave the casino.Luke MillerOctober 30, 2011Pretty good hotel. Not the biggest or fanciest place but the employees are very nice. Food is good at all the restaurants.Daniel LouieJanuary 3, 2011Been here 25+ timesAlcohol isn't free while playing, but it's cheap. Ask for mixed drinks in a glass so you don't get your order in a flimsy plastic cup.TammyJuly 20, 2010Love the non smoky atmosphere. Definitely a lot cleaner than most places. Good buffet too!Margaret MartinezAugust 4, 2012Hotel is great, Williams B's has excellent food and serviceAd BaileyAugust 2, 2012Been here 5+ timesBetter music entertainment on the weekends than Four Winds (in two venues). Four Winds moved bands to Hard Rock w/ cover charge.Vikki HornakJuly 13, 2013Been coming here for 7rs keeps getting better every year!!!Jason CopelandApril 13, 2013Dance with as many different cougars as you can (High Score: 17)Daniel LouieJanuary 3, 2011Been here 25+ timesSadly, Blue Chip has changed over to Pepsi products. This is property wide, including the free soda fountains.Jake ScottJuly 30, 2011Been here 5+ timesOptions buffet is good. Everyone here pretends to be in Vegas when they are in michigan shitty. Hotel is a nursing home. Nobody under 80 stays there. Constantly getting carded sucks...Kyle TurnerSeptember 9, 2015A neat little place.

                        My husband and I took an impromptu road trip and decided to check out the Blue Chip casino for a day. Never again will I go there. First of all, there was next to NO ventilation, so I felt like I was choking on cigarette smoke. Then they had slot machines shoved into every possible nook and cranny, so it made it nearly impossible to get around. The staff was rude and it just wasn't a fun time. Save your money and go to Windsor!

Fun on Easy St.

                        I absolutely love going to the Blue Chip or "The Boat."  I have never won much there but it is still fun to play. There is always an open seat at the tables or the slots. They recently added the penny slots. While they don't pay much their still fun. I wish they had lower limit blackjacks tables though. The restaurant has good food although the gift shop could be a little cheaper.
