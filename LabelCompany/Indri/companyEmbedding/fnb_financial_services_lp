FIXED ANNUITIES

FNB Financial
      Services offers you the choices you expect with the financial protection you
      need. A retirement plan is an important component of your financial journey.
      FNB Financial Services uses highly rated carriers through whom you can gain the
      satisfaction of a 100% guarantee on your principal with a Fixed Annuity.
 
      Whether
      you are interested in steady growth, a guaranteed rate, or a specific length
      of time for your annuity, FNB Financial Services offers 12 highly-rated carriers,
      each rated A or better.

      If you are seeking alternatives to certificates of deposit,
      short-term bond mutual funds, or a savings account, a tax-deferred annuity
      may be the answer. We will talk with you about various Income Options,
      from Cost
      of Living Adjustments (COLAs) to joint life and survivor alternatives.
      At FNB Financial Services, you’ll have a variety of annuities from
      which to choose.



LONG-TERM
CARE 


You
    know there are no guarantees for staying healthy. However, you shouldn’t
    have to risk everything you have worked so hard to get to pay for long term care.
    Long Term Care insurance can ensure that your assets are protected if you should
    need in home care or a professional nursing facility. When you meet with our
    representative, we will discuss the available coverage, the different protection
    and reimbursement options, and the adaptability that the different policies provide.
    Long term care protects you and your loved one’s “nest egg” along
    life’s journey.

Products + Services






We offer a range of tailored products and services to suit your specific business needs, whether a single retail store seeking a standalone device, a hospitality business / restaurant seeking a mobile device or a multi-lane chain of stores seeking an integrated card payment solution
Standalone Solutions

	For single outlet or non complex retail environments Merchant Services will assist you with an informed selection and deployment of a standalone device. The choice between a desktop or mobile standalone device will be a function of your specific sector and business needs, with consideration for your communication network. 


	Desktop standalone devices normally support a fixed till / counter based retail format, whereas mobile standalone devices are normally conducive to a hospitality or restaurant based format. A standalone device based solution will be cost effective and manageable within single outlet or non complex retail environments

Integrated Solutions

	For complex multi-lane retail environments Merchant Services will assist you with an informed selection and deployment of an integrated solution that integrates your point of sale (POS) retail system and communication network per your individual store to your pin entry device (PED). 


	This integration enables the POS retail system to initiate the payment instruction to the PED thereby eliminating the risk of transposition errors and potential employee / operator fraud.


	Integration will also support the seamless consolidation of card payment acceptance information with transaction based POS information thereby enhancing effectiveness of back office reconciliations, reporting and internal control measures


	We provide the merchant with exclusive access to specialised service team to support this complex environment and limit the inherent operational and financial risks to the merchant.

e-Commerce

	Whether you are new to e-Commerce or a retailer looking to provide your customers with a new shop front (channel) Merchant Services facilitates card not present (CNP) payment acceptance over the internet.


	Working with a select group of competent Service Providers and deploying a robust card authentication service (Mastercard SecureCode, Verified by Visa) we ensure that you can offer your customers a secure e-Commerce payment acceptance offering.


	All eCommerce merchants have to be 3D Secure. With 3D Secure merchants are protected against certain chargebacks arising from cardholder identity disputes when cardholder authentication has successfully occurred, or has been successfully attempted

What is 3D Secure?

	3D Secure is an XML-based protocol designed to be an additional security layer for online credit and debit card transactions. 3D Secure improves online transaction performance and provides the ability to authenticate cardholders during an online purchase, thus reducing the likelihood of fraudulent usage of cards.


	FNB Merchant Services is required by PASA (Payments Association of South Africa) to assist in ensuring that all eCommerce merchants are 3D Secure compliant. PASA performs a crucial function in the South African economy by assisting the South African Reserve Bank in managing the safety and integrity of the National Payments System, through which all payments between financial institutions must flow.

Recurring Payments

	Many consumers prefer to use their card as a payment method for the purchase of recurring services or products. Merchant Services will support you in offering this payment method by enabling recurring payments acceptance for services or products, such as: subscriptions, policy premiums, membership fees and bulk collections.

Our Services

As a financial institution, FNB provides personal, private, business, commercial and corporate banking services to millions of customers across South Africa.


As part of the FirstRand Group and as one of the top three banks in the country, FNB measures success not only by the growth in our profits but also by the contribution we make towards our community's growth.


FNB is the oldest bank in South Africa and can be traced back to the Eastern Province Bank formed in Grahamstown in 1838. Today, FNB trades as a division of FirstRand Bank Limited.


When looking at FNB's history, two things in particular stand out. The first is a story of survival - different circumstances in South Africa have posed many great challenges in our history, all of which FNB has successfully met. This track record provides a strong foundation for our future challenges. The second is a story of people - our history has always been firmly influenced by the needs of the people we serve.


The Acacia tree in our brand logo is a suitable representation of our history. Our roots run deep in South Africa, and we have grown thanks to our commitment to serving the needs of our clients and communities.
