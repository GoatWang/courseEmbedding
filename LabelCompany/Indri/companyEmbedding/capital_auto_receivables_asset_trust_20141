                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

and authorized to act as agent for the Owner of the Receivables and
in such capacity shall manage, service, administer and process
collections on the Receivables with reasonable care, using that
degree of skill and attention that the Servicer exercises with
respect to comparable motor vehicle related receivables that it
services for itself or others. The Servicer hereby accepts such

for collections and furnishing monthly and annual statements to the
Owner of any Receivables with respect to distributions, generating
federal income tax information and performing the other duties
specified herein. Subject to the provisions of
Section 3.02 , the Servicer shall follow its customary
standards, policies and procedures and shall have full power and
authority, acting alone, to do any and all things in connection
with such managing, servicing, administration and collection that
it may deem necessary or desirable.

(c) Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Servicer is hereby authorized and empowered
by the Owner of the Receivables, pursuant to this
Section 3.01 , to execute and deliver, on behalf of all
Interested Parties, or any of them, any and all instruments of
satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full release or
discharge, and all other comparable instruments, with respect to
the Receivables and the Financed Vehicles (including proceeds). The
Servicer is hereby authorized to (i) commence, in its own name
or in the name of the Owner of such Receivable a legal proceeding,
whether through judicial process or (with respect to repossession
of a Financed Vehicle) non-judicial process, (ii) participate
in a voluntary or involuntary liquidation proceeding to enforce a
Liquidating Receivable or Receivable as contemplated by
Section 3.03 , (iii) enforce all obligations of

Agreement and under the Further Transfer and Servicing Agreements
or (iv) commence or participate in a legal proceeding
(including a bankruptcy case) relating to or involving a Receivable
or a Liquidating Receivable. If the Servicer commences or
participates in such a legal proceeding in its own name, the
Servicer is hereby authorized and empowered by the Owner of the
Receivables pursuant to this Section 3.01 to obtain
possession of the related Financed Vehicle and immediately and
without further action on the part of the Owner or the Servicer,
the Owner of such Receivable shall thereupon automatically assign
in trust such Receivable and the security interest in the related
Financed Vehicle to the Servicer for the benefit of the Interested
Parties immediately prior to such legal or liquidation proceeding
for purposes of commencing or participating in any such proceeding
as a party or claimant. Upon such automatic assignment, the
Servicer will be, and will have all the rights and duties of, a
secured party under the UCC and other applicable law with respect
to such Receivable and the related Financed Vehicle. At the
Servicer’s request from time to time, the Owner of a
Receivable assigned under this Section 3.01 shall
provide the Servicer with evidence of the assignment in trust for
the benefit of the Interested Parties as may be reasonably
necessary for the Servicer to take any of the actions set forth in
the following sentence.

authorized and empowered by the Owner of a Receivable to execute
and deliver in the Servicer’s name any notices, demands,
claims, complaints, responses, affidavits or other documents or
instruments in connection with any such proceeding. Any Owner of
Receivables shall furnish the Servicer with any powers of attorney
and other documents and take any other steps which the Servicer may
deem necessary or appropriate to enable the Servicer to carry out
its servicing and administrative duties under this Agreement and
the Further Transfer and Servicing Agreements. Except to the extent
required by the preceding two sentences, the authority and rights
granted to the Servicer in this Section 3.01 shall be
nonexclusive and shall not be construed to be in derogation of the
retention by the Owner of a Receivable of equivalent authority and
rights.

SECTION 3.02 Collection of
Receivable Payments . The Servicer shall make reasonable
efforts to collect all payments called for under the terms and
provisions of the Receivables as and when the same shall become
due, and shall follow such collection practices, policies and
procedures as it follows with respect to comparable motor vehicle
related receivables that it services for itself or others in
connection therewith. Except as provided in
Section 3.06(a)(iii) , the Servicer is hereby
authorized to grant extensions, rebates or adjustments on a
Receivable without the prior consent of the Owner of such
Receivable. The Servicer is authorized in its discretion to waive
any prepayment charge, late payment charge or any other fees that
may be collected in the ordinary course of servicing such
Receivable.

SECTION 3.03 Realization Upon
Liquidating Receivables . The Servicer shall use reasonable
efforts, consistent with its customary practices, policies and
procedures, to repossess or otherwise comparably convert the
ownership or gain control of any Financed Vehicle that it has
reasonably determined should be repossessed or otherwise converted
following a default under the Receivable secured by the Financed
Vehicle. The Servicer is authorized to follow such customary
practices, policies and procedures as it follows with respect to
comparable motor vehicle related receivables that it services for
itself or others, which customary practices, policies and
procedures may include reasonable efforts to realize upon any
recourse to Dealers, selling the related Financed Vehicle at public
or private sale and other actions by the Servicer in order to
realize upon such a Receivable. The Servicer is hereby authorized
to exercise its discretion consistent with its customary practices,
policies and procedures and the terms of the Basic Documents, in
servicing Liquidating Receivables so as to maximize the net
collection of those Liquidating Receivables, including the
discretion to choose to sell or not to sell any of the Liquidating
Receivables itself on behalf of the Depositor or any other Owner.
The Servicer shall not be liable for any such exercise of its
discretion made in good faith and in accordance with such servicing
procedures. The foregoing is subject to the provision that, in any
case in which the Financed Vehicle shall have suffered damage, the
Servicer shall not expend funds in connection with any repair or
towards the repossession of such Financed Vehicle unless it shall

shall increase the proceeds of liquidation of the related
Receivable by an amount greater than the amount of such expenses.

respect to each Liquidating Receivable at such time as the
Receivable becomes a Liquidating Receivable (or as may otherwise be
provided in the Further Transfer and Servicing
Agreements).

Fitch Rates Chrysler Capital Auto Receivables Trust 2016-B; Outlook Stable | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Rates Chrysler Capital Auto Receivables Trust 2016-B; Outlook 
      Stable
    





November 04, 2016 03:53 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings to Chrysler Capital 
      Auto Receivables Trust (CCART) 2016-B:
    

      --$168,000,000 class A-1 asset-backed notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$260,000,000 class A-2 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$220,000,000 class A-3 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$82,030,000 class A-4 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$29,380,000 class B asset-backed notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$47,460,000 class C asset-backed notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$33,910,000 class D asset-backed notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Limited Performance History: Chrysler Capital (CC) was founded in 2013; 
      thus, performance data are limited and were not utilized by Fitch to 
      determine the base case loss proxy. Fitch utilized conservative 2006 - 
      2008 vintage securitization loss data from the DaimlerChrysler Auto 
      Trust (DCAT) platform to derive a loss proxy for this portion of the 
      pool. The loss proxy has increased relative to 2016-A due to weaker 
      performance observed on outstanding CCART transactions.
    

      Performance Weakening: The Santander Consumer USA Inc. (SC) and CC 
      portfolios, along with CCART securitizations, recorded rising 
      delinquencies and cumulative net losses (CNL) year-over-year (YoY) 
      through 2015 and the second quarter of 2016. Fitch took this into 
      account when deriving the 2016-B proxy. CCART pools have certain prime 
      borrower characteristics, but Fitch classifies the platform as midprime 
      based on historical loss performance to date and, thus, applied midprime 
      loss multiples in its analysis.
    

      Stable CC/SC Receivables Mix: CC originations total 88% of the pool, 
      while core SC nonprime originations total 12%, consistent with recent 
      pools. Fitch utilized conservative nonprime core SC loss data to derive 
      a loss proxy for the core SC portion of the pool.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement (CE): Initial hard CE totals 19.5% for the 
      class A notes, down from 20.0% in 2016-A. CE for the class B through D 
      notes is also marginally lower versus 2016-A. Excess spread is 4.89%, 
      consistent with 2016-A. CE is sufficient to cover Fitch's 5.50% base 
      case proxy and modeled net loss levels for all the notes.
    

      Consistent Collateral Pool: The collateral is fairly consistent with 
      prior pools. The weighted average (WA) FICO score is 712, WA 
      loan-to-value (LTV) is 106% and new vehicles total 73.3%. Commercial 
      contracts, which typically perform stronger than retails contracts, 
      total 9.0% of the pool. The pool's collateral characteristics comprise 
      elements of prime and nonprime consumer credits.
    

      Increasing Extended-Term Loans: Loans with terms of 60-plus months total 
      80.8%, down from 2016-A and prior transactions. However, 73 to 75 month 
      contracts total 21.6% of the pool, the highest level observed to date 
      for the platform. Fitch applied a stress to the loss proxy to account 
      for the risk posed by these loans due to limited performance history and 
      weaker loan attributes and credit quality.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: SC has been profitable each year since 2007, 
      including recent years. Fitch rates Santander, majority owner of SC via 
      Santander Holding USA, Inc. (SHUSA), 'A-/F2'/Stable Outlook.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Along with its CC 
      division, SC demonstrates adequate abilities as originator, underwriter 
      and servicer, as evidenced by historical portfolio and securitization 
      performance. Fitch deems SC capable to service this series.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of SC would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This in turn could result in Fitch taking negative rating actions 
      on the notes.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to 2016-B to 
      increased credit losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's 
      analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to 
      increased defaults and credit losses. We saw a potential downgrade of 
      one category under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario, 
      especially for the subordinate bonds. The notes could experience 
      downgrades of up to two rating categories, potentially leading to 
      distressed ratings, under Fitch's severe (2x base case loss) scenario.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from 
      Deloitte & Touche LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on 
      comparing or re-computing certain information with respect to 145 retail 
      and 30 commercial receivables from the statistical data file. Fitch 
      considered this information in its analysis, and the findings did not 
      have an impact on the analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E

      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000

      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer,

Fitch to Rate Chrysler Capital Auto Receivables Trust 2016-B | Business Wire


























































      Fitch to Rate Chrysler Capital Auto Receivables Trust 2016-B
    





October 20, 2016 08:42 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings to Chrysler 
      Capital Auto Receivables Trust (CCART) 2016-B (2016-B):
    

      --$168,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$260,000,000 classes A-2 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$220,000,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$82,030,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$29,380,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$47,460,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$33,910,000 class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Limited Performance History: CC was founded in 2013; thus, performance 
      data are limited and were not utilized by Fitch to determine the base 
      case loss proxy. Fitch utilized conservative 2006 - 2008 vintage 
      securitization loss data from the DaimlerChrysler Auto Trust (DCAT) 
      platform to derive a loss proxy for this portion of the pool. The loss 
      proxy has increased relative to 2016-A due to weaker performance 
      observed on outstanding CCART transactions.
    

      Performance Weakening: The SC and CC portfolios, along with CCART 
      securitizations, recorded rising delinquencies and cumulative net losses 
      (CNL) year-over-year (YoY) through 2015 and the second quarter of 2016. 
      Fitch took this into account when deriving the 2016-B proxy. CCART pools 
      have certain prime borrower characteristics, but Fitch classifies the 
      platform as midprime based on historical loss performance to date and, 
      thus, applied midprime loss multiples in its analysis.
    

      Stable CC/SC Receivables Mix: CC originations total 88% of the pool, 
      while core SC nonprime originations total 12%, consistent with recent 
      pools. Fitch utilized conservative nonprime core SC loss data to derive 
      a loss proxy for the core SC portion of the pool.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement (CE): Initial hard CE totals 19.5% for the 
      class A notes, down from 20.0% in 2016-A. CE for the class B through D 
      notes is also marginally lower versus 2016-A. Excess spread is expected 
      to be 4.73%, consistent with 2016-A. CE is sufficient to cover Fitch's 
      5.50% base case proxy and modeled net loss levels for all the notes.
    

      Consistent Collateral Pool: The collateral is fairly consistent with 
      prior pools. The WA FICO score is 712, WA LTV is 106% and new vehicles 
      total 73.3%. Commercial contracts, which typically perform stronger than 
      retails contracts, total 8.8% of the pool. The pool's collateral 
      characteristics comprise elements of prime and nonprime consumer credits.
    

      Increasing Extended-Term Loans: Loans with terms of 60-plus months total 
      80.6%, down from 2016-A and prior transactions. However, 73-75 month 
      contracts total 21.2% of the pool, the highest level observed to date 
      for the platform. Fitch applied a stress to the loss proxy to account 
      for the risk posed by these loans due to limited performance history and 
      weaker loan attributes and credit quality.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: SC has been profitable each year since 2007, 
      including recent years. Fitch rates Santander, majority owner of SC via 
      SHUSA, 'A-'/'F2'/Stable Outlook.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Along with its CC 
      division, SC demonstrates adequate abilities as originator, underwriter 
      and servicer, as evidenced by historical portfolio and securitization 
      performance. Fitch deems SC capable to service this series.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of SC would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This in turn could result in Fitch taking negative rating actions 
      on the notes.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to 2016-B to 
      increased credit losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's 
      analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to 
      increased defaults and credit losses. We saw a potential downgrade of 
      one category under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario, 
      especially for the subordinate bonds. The notes could experience 
      downgrades of up to two rating categories, potentially leading to 
      distressed ratings, under Fitch's severe (2x base case loss) scenario.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from 
      Deloitte & Touche LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on 
      comparing or re-computing certain information with respect to 145 retail 
      and 30 commercial receivables from the statistical data file. Fitch 
      considered this information in its analysis, and the findings did not 
      have an impact on the analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E 
      received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained 
      through the link at the bottom of the related rating action commentary 
      (RAC).
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in the reports titled 'Chrysler Capital Auto 
      Receivables Asset Trust 2016-B -- Appendix'. These R&W are compared to 
      those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special 
      report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in 
      Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated May 31, 2016.
