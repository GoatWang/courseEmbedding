Pharmacies








INRange provides cost effective pharmacy automation solutions that reduce costs, increase revenue and fit into your existing pharmacy practices. We provide solutions that include not only hardware and software, but the “best practice” protocols that enable you to quickly implement our solutions, providing dollars to your bottom line.



 

First Dose/Emergency Kit (E-Kit)
Our E-Kit provides an immediate financial return to your pharmacy operations, as well as a major cost savings to the skilled nursing facility you service.
INRange’s E-Kit is a low-cost, secure solution for First Dose/Emergency Kit (E-Kit) at skilled nursing facilities. Our system provides convenient, secure access to narcotics and other first dose medication in a fully contained and trackable environment.
Our E-Kits:

Eliminate stock-outs
End E-Kit documentation
Provide a complete chain of custody
Provide simplified DEA compliance
Provide automatic refill notifications
Can be configured for automatic or pharmacist release
Provide significant savings and benefits to the SNFs you service



A reliable, low-cost solution.
Management and control of E-Kits is a major responsibility and a drain on resources. Regulatory requirements governing the dispensing of narcotics create a significant workload for both the pharmacy and the facility operators. INRange has developed a better solution to this problem – one that can be deployed at a fraction of the cost of other alternatives.
Our low cost solutions can be justified in skilled nursing facilities of any size. Let us show you how.

EMMAEMMA is the only FDA-cleared Remote Medication Management
System available today.  It communicates wirelessly that enables the
pharmacy to remotely control and program the device.... More Info Less Info



With the INRange First Dosing / Emergency Kit you save time, money and solve a great “pain point” in your operations. Our highly cost effective solution provides superior unit dose control at a fraction of the cost of other systems. Our E-Kit provides: Complete chain of custody tracking; Simplified DEA audit compliance; Tamper and movement notification; Automatic refill notification; Reporting of medications on a per dose basis; Modular, scalable solution; Optional electronic cabinet for non-oral medications.
The INRange E-Kit provides total pharmacy control from your desktop, laptop or mobile device. You can configure your remote EMMA units to auto-approve orders or require pharmacy pre-approval before a nurse can dispense the medications. Management and control of E-Kits is a major responsibility and a drain on resources. Regulatory requirements governing the dispensing of narcotics create a significant workload for both the pharmacy and the facility operators. INRange has developed a better solution to this problem - one that can be deployed at a fraction of the cost of other alternatives.
Our focus has been the development of remote medication devices that improve total wellness by ensuring accurate medication usage. We pride ourselves on providing easy-to-use systems that require very little training . Our systems make a difference in people’s lives. With the shift to outcomes-based reimbursement models, population health business models will soon dominate the healthcare market. INRange is at the forefront at providing products that can address the critical and costly issues associated with proper medication management, both in facilities and in the home. INRange’s systems provide direct pharmacy control over medication delivery. We utilize unit dose control and accountability to provide an economical, modular system to save money, generate new revenue and meet the needs of a new healthcare marketplace.

Frequently Asked Questions









E-Kit

What is a First Dose/Emergency Kit?
A First Dose/Emergency Kit (E-Kit) is used by a long-term-care pharmacy to store a variety of different medications at a Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF). Its purpose is to remotely dispense initial medications to patients admitted to the facility who are in need of medications before the pharmacy can deliver their prescriptions.
INRange has two different solutions to meet the SNF’s needs while complying with State & Federal Pharmacy regulations. The EMMA unit dose-dispenser delivers individual unit-dose solid oral medications and can hold up to 300 individual doses of medication per unit; it is ideal for narcotic control. The EMMA E-Cabinet holds up to 120 different medications for multi-dose storage of oral medications, or individual doses of non-oral or injectable medications.



What medications can be dispensed using EMMA?
The EMMA unit can hold up to 30 different control or non-control solid oral medications.
The EMMA E-Cabinet can hold virtually any type of control or non-control medication package: oral, non-oral, injectables, inhalers, patches, etc.. It can hold up to 252 different medications in individual active security containers.



Can the system be configured to meet the specific requirements for my state?
The control software, which is accessible from any PC, tablet, or mobile device, allows a pharmacy to configure the operation of the First Dose / E-Kit to meet most requirements needed to comply with the individual states in which they operate.



Can I operate EMMA from a tablet, PC, or mobile device?
Yes. EMMA is a secure, cloud-based platform that allows a user to access the system from any web-enabled device (PC, Tablet, smart phone). Alerts from the systems can be send via email and allows a user to use their smart phone to take action or respond.
