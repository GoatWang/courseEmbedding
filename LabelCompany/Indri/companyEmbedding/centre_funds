Welcome to the Portfolio Bond fund centre
With effect from June 2017 our internal insurance funds are no longer available for switches in. Policyholders already holding an insurance fund can remain invested but cannot switch to another insurance fund. Portfolio Bond continues to allow policyholders to invest into almost any type of externally managed asset, with some exceptions. If you are unsure as to whether or not an asset can be held under your policy please contact us.

The fund centre is here to assist existing policyholders obtain insurance fund performance information. You can search for a fund by name or ISIN using the search box below. There is a multitude of information available from pricing to performance and factsheets to charts.

 Please note:

This fund centre only provides information for the insurance funds and does not include externally managed funds available to this product.
All underlying data is supplied by Morningstar and RL360° cannot be held responsible for the accuracy of the information provided.
In some instances the fund names displayed may differ slightly to how they are reflected on RL360° Services systems. Performance tabs are calculated in fund currency and are not rebased.

Funds marked with a # are not available to Hong Kong policyholders.

You can use the charting tool to track historic prices and download them into excel. Chart performance is initially displayed in the currency of the first fund you select to chart, and will rebase multi-selected funds into that currency. To rebase the performance to a currency of your choosing, click on 'Chart Settings', then 'Plot Types' within the interactive chart window.

UK Cycle Centre Seeks Funds on Crowd2Fund For New Products & European Expansion
 Tweet Share Share +1 Reddit Pin1 EmailShares 1

August 4, 2016 @ 10:10 am By Samantha Hurst 



UK Cycle Centre announced on Thursday it is seeking a minimum of £40,000 on Crowd2Fund as it prepares to grow its product line and begin its European expansion.
The company was launched in 2014 by owner Adam Broadhurst. It currently sells new and approved used bicycles, cycling accessories and allows customers to sell and exchange parts of their bicycles without any extra charges or fees.

“UK Cycle Centre supplies quality bicycles, components, clothing [and] accessories worldwide. They have a superb service that allows users to reduce the cost when purchasing by part exchanging their used bikes, components, clothing & accessories, with free EU collection inclusive.”

 Since its debut, UK Cycle Centre has seen its turnover increase by 300% year after year, and it predicts that the turnover will be at least £1 million by the end of year three. 

“UK Cycle Centre projects a £1.5m EBITDA after 5 years, at a 10x exit multiple; this would raise a sale amount of £15m. Toward the 5 year milestone, UKCC will review the advantages and disadvantages of increasing the timeline to 10 years. If they can continue or increase the ROI over the period, they would very much enjoy growing for the foreseeable future.”

Along with product growth and European expansion, the funds will be used to hire new staff members, expand the Malvern site, open a new flagship store in the Bristol area, and new website development. Explaining why he and his team turned to Crowd2Fund for the funding, Broadhurst stated:

“We wanted to find a platform for longer term investment. Crowd2Fund as a professional and flexible partner, deliver quickly so was the right choice for UK Cycle Centre.”

The initiative is set to run for another 46 days.

* Fund charges


Pensions unit-linked fund charges
Pensions unit-linked fund charges consist of a flat charge per Policy, plus an ad valorem
			charge. A fee scale applies for certain PF sections.1


			The Policy charge is a flat amount per annum and is levied at the start of each calendar year and is
			based on the scheme assets invested in the PF sections at this date.
		

			The ad valorem charge is based on the average value of the Policy’s holding(s) on a Dealing Price basis
			in the Daily Priced PF sections, and on the average value of the Policy’s holding(s) on the Offer Price
			basis in the Weekly Priced PF sections.
		

Exit charges – Open-ended investment companies: LGIM Sterling Liquidity Fund and LGIM US Dollar Liquidity Fund
Exit charge - 0% (subject to a 2% charge at the Director’s discretion on redemptions deemed to be
			for arbitrage purposes or generally after one month’s notice has been given). This is the maximum that
			might be taken out of your money before it is invested or before the proceeds of your investment are paid
			out. 
				Full information
				on Open-ended investment company fund charges can be found here.
			


Ongoing charges – SICAV
Ongoing charges are based on actual expenses for the period ending date or an estimate of the expected
			future charges. An estimate has been used when a share class has been in existence for less than a year. It
			covers all aspects of operating the fund during the year, including fees paid for investment management,
			administration and the independent oversight functions. 
				Full information on SICAV fund charges can be found here.

Mutual Fund product details
Investment needs of an individual vary over time and depend on his/her investment objectives and financial goals. Defining your investment objectives and identifying financial goals is the key to financial security and wealth.
Once investment objectives have been identified, you now need to plan meticulously to achieve them. Investment experts around the world advise instruments like equity funds and stocks for long-term (more than 5 years), income funds for medium-term and liquid funds for short-term needs.


The investment matrix above depicts a broad variety of available investment options in mutual funds. These are categorised by risk/return levels. Those at the top provide for a greater opportunity for long-term capital growth with a higher risk level while those at the bottom take care of current income and conservation of capital with a lower risk level. HSBC Mutual Fund offers products at both ends to cater to your individual needs.

Things to bear in mind
It is important to remember

You need to have an HSBC current or savings account to buy funds via our Global Investment Centre. 
The Global Investment Centre is offered without advice, on an execution only basis. HSBC is not required to assess the suitability of this service for you, which means that the protection offered by the Financial Conduct Authority's rules on assessing suitability will not apply. If you have any doubts about whether this service is suitable for your needs, you should seek advice from a Financial Adviser (you may be charged for any advice you receive)
Investments should be considered as a medium to long-term commitment. This means you should be prepared to hold them for at least five years. 
Investing through our Global Investment Centre involves taking some investment risk. The value of investments can go down as well as up and you may get back less than you invested. For some investments this can also happen as a result of exchange rate fluctuations as shares and funds may have an exposure to overseas markets. 
You should carefully consider the specific risks of investing in emerging market securities. 
The value of any tax benefits described depends on your individual circumstances. Tax rules may change in the future. 
Additional risks may apply, please refer to our Key Features of Funds Portfolio and ISA Funds Portfolio document for further information. 

Apply online (via Personal Internet Banking)

More details/FAQs


How it works


Once you've registered for the Global Investment Centre, you can open a Funds Portfolio in which to buy, sell and hold your investments.
You can also apply for an ISA Funds Portfolio so you can hold your investments within a tax-efficient ISA.
There are no new passwords to remember because you access your Global Investment Centre through Internet Banking. Simply log on and select 'Investments'.
You can see the current value of your investment and track its performance online.
Interactive research tools help you make informed decisions about what to invest in and when.
Anyone with an HSBC current or savings account can register for our Global Investment Centre.
Global Investment Centre integrates seamlessly with your nominated bank account as the money for your purchases and the proceeds from your sales will be taken from and paid into that account.
You can choose to buy, sell or switch funds either online or by phone. Please note that purchases or sales you make from 4pm onwards on a business day will be processed the following business day. The minimum initial investment is £100 for each class of fund shares for each portfolio. The minimum additional investment is also £100.
Please note online trades through the Global Investment Centre are limited to £99,999. If you would like to place a trade of £100,000 or more, please call us on 03456 076180**.




How much does it cost?


There is no charge for setting up the Global Investment Centre service.
An Account Fee of 0.39% per annum applies when investing in clean share class funds.
There is no initial charge on any funds in the Global Investment Centre.
An annual management charge and other expenses will apply.
In the past fund managers, including HSBC, have used several different methods to illustrate charges. To make these charges clearer and comparisons simpler for you, we’re moving to the Ongoing Charges Figure (OCF), which is being adopted throughout the investment fund industry. The OCF incorporates the Annual Management Charge (AMC) as well as any other additional charges from the fund provider.
Full details of the annual management charge and any other expenses (including the Account Fee) are available in the Key Features of Funds Portfolio and ISA Funds Portfolio Document. Specific fund charges are available in the relevant Key Investor Information Documents for each fund.




What types of funds can I hold?


There is a wide range of open ended investment company (OEIC) and unit trust clean share class funds that you can hold within each of your account(s).




What are the charges?


An Account Fee of 0.39% per annum applies when investing in clean share class funds. There is no initial charge on any funds in the Global Investment Centre; however an annual management charge and other expenses will apply.
The Account Fee will be charged as an annual percentage rate and calculated using the value of any holdings in clean share classes within your account. The annual percentage rate for the Account Fee will be 0.39% per annum. The charge will be taken on a monthly basis from your default settlement account for your Funds Portfolio in arrears. The Account Fee will be payable by you for the services we provide when arranging the sale and purchase of fund shares in clean share classes as well as custody and administration of those fund shares when they are held in your account.
Full details of charges, including annual management charges and any other expenses are available in the Key Features Document and the individual Fund Details.




Is there a minimum amount that I have to invest?


The minimum initial investment is £100 for each class of fund shares for each portfolio. The minimum additional investment is also £100.




What happens after I have placed a buy instruction?


If a Buy instruction is placed prior to the dealing deadline (for individual dealing deadlines please see the Fund Details Document for the specific fund) then your order will normally be placed with the fund provider before the fund's next valuation point. The valuation point for each fund is shown in the Fund Details.
You can then view the status of an instruction by clicking on 'Details' located within the 'My order status' section. Once we receive confirmation that the instruction has been executed by the fund provider, your new holding will be reflected within 'My fund portfolio' section. When you place a Buy instruction a hold will be placed on the required monies in your chosen settlement account or in the case of your ISA this will be the Uninvested cash account. The money will be taken from your settlement account or your Uninvested cash account on settlement day.
We will send you a confirmation of the number of fund shares purchased for you and the price you paid.




Can I make regular contributions to a fund or make a joint application?


No. We don't currently offer this service for Global Investment Centre. However, you may invest as often as you like subject to the minimum investment amount of £100 for each fund for each account.








Investment risk
All investments carry some risk. The value of investments (and any income received from them) can fall as well as rise and you may not get back what you invested. For some investments this can also happen as a result of exchange rate fluctuations as shares and funds may have an exposure to overseas markets.


Time commitment
Most investments should be considered as a medium to long-term commitment, meaning you should be prepared to hold them for at least five years.


Tax benefits
The value of any tax benefits described depends on your individual circumstances. Tax rules may change in the future.

Key features

We have chosen to offer restricted advice. This means we don't recommend products from the whole of the market, but rather a limited range of products from a limited number of carefully selected companies, including HSBC.
We charge for our service - our fees vary depending on your individual needs. Our expert advisers will clearly explain our fees upfront and the type of advice we offer. That way, you know exactly how much you will pay and what you’re paying for.
We'll explore your current financial goals and personal circumstances at length before creating a bespoke financial plan. 
We use sophisticated risk profiling software and modelling techniques to help you identify the level of investment risk you're comfortable with.
Our advisers are supported by a worldwide team of analysts who use powerful local knowledge to hand select products from a wide range of investments.

The value of investments, and any income from them, can fall as well as rise and you may not get back what you invested. For some investments this can happen as a result of exchange rate fluctuations, as shares and funds may have an exposure to overseas markets.
Investments in emerging markets are by their nature higher risk and potentially more volatile than those inherent in established markets.
We recommend that you should regard stock market investments as medium to long term commitments (by which we mean that you should be prepared to hold them for a period of not less than 5 years).


Eligibility requirements

Existing Selected Investment Funds customers
If you hold an existing Selected Investment Funds ISA or Investment Plan you can top up into your existing fund or any alternative fund - view more information.










Time commitment
Most investments should be considered as a medium to long-term commitment, 
                                                meaning you should be prepared to hold them for at least five years.


Investment risk
All investments carry some risk. The value of investments (and any income received from them) can fall as well as rise and you may not get back what you invested. For some investments this can also happen as a result of exchange rate fluctuations as shares and funds may have an exposure to overseas markets.


Tax benefits
The value of any tax benefits this product can offer will depend 
                                                on your individual circumstances – tax rules may change in future.















Our top 5 FAQs

What is the difference between a cash ISA and a stocks and shares ISA?


What is the difference between a cash ISA and a stocks and shares ISA?
With a cash ISA, you make cash deposits similar to any other savings account, except that all interest earned is received tax free.
With a stocks and shares ISAs, you invest your money into either a collective investment scheme (eg, 'investment funds' which invest in a range of different assets such as shares, government bonds, gilts and even other investment funds), or directly into individual stocks and shares (eg, equities or bonds). 
stocks and shares ISAs are not investments in their own right, they are tax wrappers that surround an investment to provide the tax efficient returns. The value of your stocks and shares ISA will depend on how well the underlying investments (ie, investment funds or individual stocks and shares) perform, and whether you choose to have any income re-invested or paid out at regular intervals.
All UK residents are able to save in cash ISAs from the age of 16 years. From the age of 18, you can start investing in stocks and shares ISAs, although do bear in mind that your investment can go down as well as up. This means that you could get back less than the amount you originally invested.

What is Crowdfunding?

noun
Crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or cause by raising money from a large number of people, typically through the Internet. It is a form of peer-to-peer fundraising that harnesses the power of social networks to raise awareness and draw donations from around the world for online campaigns.








How is Compassionate Crowdfunding™ Different?

YouCaring is a free online fundraising platform that pioneered Compassionate Crowdfunding™—empowering people worldwide to rally support for personal and charitable causes without the fundraising fees associated with other sites. To date, the YouCaring community is 5.5 million strong and has raised more than $500 million for humanitarian causes.

The Rise of Crowdfunding


The flourishing sharing economy is changing the landscape of fundraising, and in recent years, crowdfunding has dominated the scene. According to research firm Massolution, donation-based crowdfunding alone grew more than 50 percent in 2015, raising nearly $3 billion. The overall crowdfunding market, including donation-based, lending-based, reward-based and equity-based funding, was expected to grow to $34.5 billion in 2015, more than double that of 2014.







Recent statistics contributing to crowdfunding’s popularity:

Annual out-of-pocket medical expenses in the U.S. have risen to $400 billion, or $1,254 per person.1
Average medical deductibles in the last eight years have increased 100 percent, from $584 to $1,217 for individuals, not including the price of co-pays, co-insurance, drugs and procedures not covered by health insurance plans.2
Forty seven percent of Americans can’t afford $2,000 in an emergency
Annual charitable giving in the U.S. has grown to $360 billion, with 72 percent coming from individuals.3
The sharing economy in 2015 is estimated to be $15 billion and projected to grow to $335 billion by 2035.4





How can you key into the trend and help yourself or someone you love overcome a hardship or challenge by launching a successful crowdfunding campaign?


How To Crowdfund













1. Create
YouCaring’s easy-to-use fundraiser template allows you to create an effective home page for your crowdfunding campaign. Show potential donors how they can help by telling a compelling story, uploading several pictures and videos, and posting updates.



2. Share
Activate your social network. With just a few clicks, spread the word of your fundraiser to friends, family and other potential donors through Facebook, Twitter, email and other channels. Each share is worth $37 on average.



3. Collect
Donations to your fundraiser can be transferred into your account as they’re received. YouCaring provides free fundraising, which means we don’t charge a thing. The donation processor does, however, take 2.9%, plus $.30 per transaction.








Best Crowdfunding Practices
The most important goal of crowdfunding is to build a community and a network that empathizes with your cause and donates.






Five Key Strategies:


Plan Ahead
Create a social presence by setting up Facebook and Twitter accounts if you haven’t already done so. Immediately start connecting with as many friends, family members, coworkers and acquaintances as possible. See our Using Social Media to Promote Your Fundraiser page. Also consider setting up a blog or website devoted to your cause to further boost your social presence. See our How to Start a Fundraising Website or Blog page.

Make It Compelling
From the title to the story to the visuals, your campaign should inspire potential donors to contribute to your cause. Take time to create a great name for your campaign and write an engaging story. Uploading several high-quality photos and one or more videos can exponentially increase donations to your campaign. For additional tips, see these YouCaring articles: Great Ideas for Naming Your Online Fundraiser, How Images Can Lead to Fundraising Success and Videos Are Powerful Fundraiser Tools.

Share and Update
Sharing your campaign often via social media channels and asking your friends, family and others to do the same is the best way to raise awareness and support for your cause. Every share can raise $37. Multiply those shares and your fundraiser may go viral. Meanwhile, well-written updates keep supporters and potential donors engaged. Fundraisers with five updates can raise 15 times more than those with one. Fundraisers with 20 or more updates on average meet their fundraising goal.

Organize Offline Events
Complementing your online campaign with an offline fundraiser can get your community personally involved and rally support from local businesses. Sports tournaments, dinners, auctions, dances and other events are great options. See our Fundraising Ideas page for other tips.

Reach Out to the Media
Getting your campaign covered by a local newspaper, T.V. station, radio station or even blogger and Facebook pages can propel your fundraiser to new heights. See our tips page, How to Get Local Media to Cover Your Fundraiser.

The Crowdfunding Platform You Choose Matters
It is vital to pick the crowdfunding platform that best suits your needs and your cause. The most important aspects include the fees charged to fundraise, the site’s customer service standards and reputation, the schedule for payment of donations, the caliber of online tools available to illustrate and share your campaign, and the quality of the site—from the visuals to the user experience.

Crowdfunding Campaign Success Stories






Help Save Matthew!





Goal: $800,000

Raised: $835,918



Matthew Schreindorfer and his wife, Katia Luciani, could not have imagined the journey they would face starting in August 2014. At age 24, Matthew was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He had gone through every possible treatment in Canada, all of which failed to bring him into remission. According to his doctors, his only hope was to be admitted for a CART-19 clinical trial in the U.S. The couple started working with Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute in New York and started a YouCaring fundraiser with a goal of $800,000, the estimated cost for the treatment. With the help of family and friends in Canada, and newfound supporters in the U.S. and around the world, the couple was able to drum up plenty of support for the clinical trial in the U.S., which proved to be fruitful, putting Matthew in remission for more than six months.

And Luca Makes 5 – Mullen Family Adoption





Goal: $40,500

Raised: $41,259



In February 2016, the Mullen Family of Bethany, Okla., brought home their third adoptive child, Luca, a 3-year-old Eastern European boy with special needs. The joyous occasion came after nearly one year of fundraising, the majority of which included the YouCaring campaign, And Luca Makes 5: The Mullen Family Adoption. After 15 years of marriage, during which the couple was unable to have children, they embarked on an adoptive journey to grow their family, and brought Levi and Lia home in 2011. Their YouCaring fundraiser to adopt Luca raised more than $41,000. Successful strategies didn’t get any better than the Mullen’s over the course of their campaign, during which time they involved their children in many of the happy moments leading up to the last stretch to welcome little Luca.

Help Fatal Arson Survivor Safyre Terry and Family





Goal: $15,000

Raised: $432,249



The story of 7-year-old Safyre Terry stole the hearts of people around the world when a Facebook post in 2015 describing her wish to receive Christmas cards went viral. Safyre was a courageous young burn victim from Upstate New York who was the only survivor of a house fire that killed the rest of her family in 2013. At the time, Safyre was 5 years old, and through all of her medical treatments and ensuing challenges, has remained a bright, optimistic girl who loves life. Around the time of the Facebook post, a YouCaring fundraiser had also been started by friends for Safyre’s aunt and uncle, Mike and Liz Dolder, who are now raising her. The fundraiser was set up to help with the costs of medical treatments and other expenses. Nearly 10,000 people from around the world contributed to the campaign.

Bonsai: Half the Bulldog, Twice the Love





Goal: $1

Raised: $22,898



It’s hard to resist a cute black and white bulldog puppy. But when you see Bonsai, born with multiple rare medical conditions that left him with only half a spine and no pelvis playing with a big pink squeaky toy, still just as rambunctious and playful as any puppy with four legs, it truly tugs at your heartstrings. A group of individuals from Friends of Emma, a rescue organization, took to crowdfunding to give Bonsai a leg up in his treatment. The fundraiser has successfully raised nearly $23,000 to help pay for Bonsai’s medical treatments and a possible mobility device to give him an even happier and healthier life.

FREE FUNDRAISING






YouCaring is dedicated to helping as many people as possible. This is why we will never charge anyone to raise money on our site.

Start your own fundraiser today.
It's free!
Create Fundraiser







Our Crowdfunding Platform Charges $0
Most crowdfunding sites charge 5% to 10% in fees just to use their platform. We never have and never will. This is because we believe that for people facing life’s challenges, every dollar counts. With more than $500 million in donations raised, our free fundraising platform has saved fundraisers more than $13 million in fees.

0% fee















5% – 10% fee









Donation Processor Costs

All online fundraising requires a third-party credit card processor such as PayPal, WePay or Stripe. These processors allow money to be safely collected and transferred online, but they do charge small fees for this service. Each donation processor charges 2.9% plus $0.30 per transaction.
This is not a YouCaring fee.

To learn more about our donation processors, read our blog post Which Donation Processor Is Right for Your Fundraiser. Rest assured, you can change donation processors at any time during your campaign. Simply contact us and we’ll be happy to guide you through the process.






Keep More of Your Money

When a donation is processed, the donation processor deducts their cost from the donation total. For example, if someone donates $100, the donation processor will take 2.9% plus $.30, resulting in a $3.20 fee. Other sites charge an additional 5% to 10% just to use their site.
YouCaring saves you money by charging no site fees.

How YouCaring Supports Itself

We rely on the generosity of our users to help us provide a free crowdfunding platform for those struggling with life’s challenges. At times, we do receive financial support from our amazing processors and other partners. People who give to fundraisers on YouCaring have the option of providing a voluntary contribution to support our operations and help keep fundraising free. We are incredibly grateful to those who have contributed and in doing so, chosen to participate in our mission to bring life-changing philanthropy to as many people as possible.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI India Index (NDEUSIA) is designed to measure the performance of the large- and mid-capitalization segments of the Indian market, covering approximately 85% of companies in the Indian equity securities market.  One cannot invest directly in an Index.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI India Index (NDEUSIA) is designed to measure the performance of the large- and mid-capitalization segments of the Indian market, covering approximately 85% of companies in the Indian equity securities market.  One cannot invest directly in an Index.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year
