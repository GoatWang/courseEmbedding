II LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

Dissolution (the “Plan”) dated as of July 1, 2010 of

Partner.  Boston Capital Associates II Limited
Partnership, as the sole General Partner of the Partnership,
believes that the liquidation and dissolution (the
“Liquidation”) of the Partnership at this time is in
the best interest of the Partnership, its Limited Partner and the
holders of the Partnership’s beneficial assignee certificates

shall be effective upon the approval hereof by the affirmative vote
of more than 50% of the Limited Partners, as directed by the
holders of greater than 50% of the outstanding beneficial assignee
certificates (“BACs”) of the Partnership as required by
the Partnership Agreement.  Until such time as the BAC Holders
approve this Plan, the General Partner shall not take and shall not
cause the Partnership to take any of the actions, and shall not do

provided that the foregoing shall in no event limit the right of
the General Partner to sell, on behalf of the Partnership,

3. Dissolution. In accordance
with the Partnership Agreement, ninety days after the sale of all

dissolved without any further action by or on behalf of the
Partnership, the Limited Partner, the BAC Holders or the General
Partner.

National Tax Credit Funds









National Institutional Investments 
Since 1992, Boston Capital has been sponsoring multi-investor low income housing tax credit funds for institutional investors, who have invested in nearly $10 billion of equity. These investment funds allow the corporate investor to benefit from the reduced risk provided by national diversification of properties, developers and unique real estate markets.
The typical Fund profile exhibits the following attributes

$100 – $250 million Fund size
20 – 45 properties
Diversification over 10 – 20 states
Partnering with 20 – 30 developers

The Corporate Tax Credit Fund offers

A predictable benefit stream comprised of tax credits and passive tax losses
Enhanced GAAP earnings effect from federal tax credits
Excellent risk-adjusted returns; LIHTC investments have shown the lowest default rate against all other real estate classes
Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) credit for investors
A Socially responsible investment which can be used as a direct reduction against AMT (Alternative Minimum Tax)

The process

Federal tax credits are allocated to each state’s respective housing agency, which in turn award the credits to individual partnerships.
The funds provide equity investment to each of the properties after an extensive due diligence and underwriting process.
Once closed into a fund and leased to qualified tenants, the tax credits flow to the investors through a partnership structure.
Boston Capital’s experienced Asset Management Department then continues to monitor the portfolios through the compliance period.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Unaudited)

NOTE A - ORGANIZATION 

Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund II Limited Partnership (the "Partnership") was
formed under the laws of the State of Delaware as of September 28, 1989, for the purpose of acquiring, holding, and disposing of limited partnership interests in operating partnerships which will acquire, develop, rehabilitate, operate and own newly constructed, existing or rehabilitated low-income apartment complexes ("Operating Limited Partnerships"). Effective as of June 1, 2001 there was a restructuring, and as a result, the Fund's general partner was reorganized as follows.  The General Partner of the Partnerships continues to be Boston Capital Associates II Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership.  The general partner of the General Partner is BCA Associates Limited Partnership, a Massachusetts limited partnership, whose sole general partner is C&M Management, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation and whose limited partners are Herbert F. Collins and John
P. Manning.  Mr. Manning is the principal of Boston Capital Partners, Inc. The limited partner of the General Partner is Capital Investment Holdings, a general partnership whose partners are certain officers and employees of Boston Capital Partners, Inc., and its affiliates. The Assignor Limited Partner is BCTC II Assignor Corp., a Delaware corporation which is now wholly-owned by John P. Manning.  
Pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, the Partnership filed a Form S-11
Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, effective
October 25, 1989, which covered the offering (the "Public Offering") of the
Partnership's beneficial assignee certificates ("BACs") representing
assignments of units of the beneficial interest of the limited partnership
interest of the Assignor Limited Partner.  The Partnership registered
20,000,000 BACs at $10 per BAC for sale to the public in six series.  The
Partnership sold 1,036,100 of Series 7 BACs, 4,178,029 of Series 9 BACs,
2,428,925 of Series 10 BACs, 2,489,599 of Series 11 BACs, 2,972,795 of Series
12 BACs, and 5,574,290 of Series 14 BACs. The Partnership issued the
last BACs in Series 14 on January 27, 1992.  This concluded the Public
Offering of the Partnership.

NOTE B - ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING POLICIES 

The condensed financial statements included herein as of December 31, 2004
and for the three and nine months then ended have been prepared by the Partnership, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  No BACs with respect to Series 8 and Series 13 were offered.  The Partnership accounts for its investments in Operating Partnerships using the equity method, whereby the partnership adjusts its investment cost for its share of each Operating Partnership's results of operations and for any distributions received or accrued.

NOTE - B ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING POLICIES - CONTINUED 

  Costs incurred by the Partnership in acquiring the investments in 
Operating Partnerships are capitalized to the investment account.  The 
Partnership's accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and include adjustments in interim periods considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results of 
operations.  Such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.  Certain 
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements 
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been 
condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.  It is suggested 
that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the
financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Partnership Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

  On July 1, 1995, the Partnership began amortizing unallocated acquisition
costs over 330 months from April 1, 1995.  As of December 31, 2004, the
Partnership has accumulated unallocated acquisition amortization totaling
$473,476. The breakdown of accumulated unallocated acquisition amortization
within the Partnership as of December 31, 2004 for Series 9, Series 10,
Series 11, Series 12, and Series 14 is $8,481, $33,554, $17,007, $129,839, and
$284,595, respectively.

NOTE C - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

The Partnership has entered into several transactions with various affiliates of the general partner, including Boston Capital Holdings, LP., and Boston Capital Asset Management Limited Partnership as follows:

accrued general and administrative expenses, accrued partnership management fees, and advances from an affiliate of the general partner, which are payable to Boston Capital Holdings, LP., and Boston Capital Asset Management Limited
Partnership.	
  An annual partnership management fee based on .5 percent of the aggregate
cost of all apartment complexes owned by the Operating Partnerships has been
accrued to Boston Capital Asset Management Limited Partnership.  Since reporting fees collected by the series were added to reserves and not paid to Boston Capital Asset Management LP, the amounts accrued are not net of reporting fees received.

NOTE E - TAXABLE LOSS

The taxable loss for the year ended December 31, 2004 is expected to differ from its loss for financial reporting purposes. This is primarily due to accounting differences in depreciation incurred by the Operating Partnerships and also differences between the equity method of accounting and the IRS accounting methods. No provision or benefit for income taxes has been included in these financial statements since taxable income or loss passes through to, and is reportable by, the partners and assignees individually.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
  Condition and Results of Operations

Liquidity

The Partnership's primary source of funds was the proceeds of its Public Offering.  Other sources of liquidity include (i) interest earned on capital contributions unpaid as of December 31, 2004 or on working capital reserves and (ii) cash distributions from operations of the Operating Partnerships in which the Partnership has invested in.  These sources of liquidity, along with the Partnerships working capital reserve, are available to meet the obligations of the Partnership.  The Partnership does not anticipate significant cash distributions from operations of the Operating Partnerships.
The Partnership has recognized other income as of December 31, 2004 in the amount of $18,669. The balance represents distributions received from Operating Partnerships, which the Partnership normally records as a decrease in the Investment in Operating Partnerships. Due to the equity method of accounting, the Partnership has recorded these distributions as other income.

The Partnership's currently accruing the annual partnership management fee to enable each series to meet current and future third party obligations. Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, such liabilities will be deferred until the Partnership receives sales or refinancing proceeds from Operating Partnerships and at that time proceeds from such sales or refinancing will be used to satisfy such liabilities.  
The Partnership has recorded $652,439 as payable to affiliates, which represents advances to pay certain third party operating expenses, advances and/or loans to Operating Partnerships, and accrued overhead allocations.  The breakout between series is: $285,078 in Series 7, $4,960 in Series 9, $0 in Series 10, $15,401 in Series 11, $174,342 in Series 12, and $172,658 in Series 14.  These and any future advances or accruals will be paid, without interest, from available cash flow, reporting fees, or proceeds of sales or refinancing of the Partnership's interest in Operating Partnerships.  The Partnership anticipates that there will be sufficient cash to meet future third party obligations.


Capital Resources

The Partnership offered BACs in a Public offering declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 25, 1989.  The Partnership received and accepted subscriptions for $186,337,017 representing 18,679,738 BACs from investors admitted as BAC Holders in Series 7 through Series 14 of the Partnership.

Results of Operations

As of December 31, 2004 and 2003 the Partnership held limited partnership interests in 297 and 303 Operating Partnerships, respectively.  In each instance the Apartment Complex owned by the applicable Operating Partnership is eligible for the Federal Housing Tax Credit.  Initial occupancy of a unit in each Apartment Complex which initially complied with the Minimum Set-Aside Test (i.e., initial occupancy by tenants with incomes equal to no more than a certain percentage of area median income) and the Rent Restriction Test (i.e., gross rent charged tenants does not exceed 30% of the applicable income standards) is referred to hereinafter as "Qualified Occupancy."  Each of the Operating Partnerships and each of the respective Apartment Complexes are described more fully in the Prospectus or applicable report on Form 8-K.  The General Partner believes that there
is adequate casualty insurance on the properties.

The Partnership incurs a partnership management fee to Boston Capital Asset Management Limited Partnership in an amount equal to 0.5% of the aggregate cost of the apartment complexes owned by the Operating Partnerships, less the amount of certain asset management and reporting fees paid by the Operating Partnerships. The annual partnership management fee is currently being accrued.  It is anticipated that all outstanding fees will be repaid from sale or refinancing proceeds. The partnership management fees incurred, net of reporting fees received, for the quarters ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 were $601,965 and $495,450, respectively.  
The Partnership's investment objectives do not include receipt of significant cash distributions from the Operating Partnerships in which it has invested. 

The Partnership's investments in Operating Partnerships have been made principally with a view towards realization of Federal Housing Tax Credits for allocation to its partners and BAC holders.

The General Partner and its affiliate, Boston Capital Asset Management Limited Partnership, monitor the operations of all the properties in the Partnership.  The Operating Partnerships that are mentioned in the following discussion of each series' results of operations are being closely monitored so as to improve the overall results of each series' operations. 

(Series 7)  As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the average Qualified Occupancy for the series was 100%.  The series had a total of 12 properties, all of which were 100% at December 31, 2004. 

For the period ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, Series 7 reflects net loss from Operating Partnerships of $(132,794) and $(242,398), respectively, which includes depreciation and amortization of $518,729 and $504,300, respectively.
In December 2004, the Investment Partnership sold its interest in Buckner Properties, Limited Partnership to the Operating General Partner for his assumption of the outstanding mortgage balance of $607,514 and proceeds to the Investment Partnership of $18,225.  Of the total Investment Partnership proceeds $5,000 represents payment of outstanding reporting fees due to an affiliate of the Investment Partnership.  The remaining proceeds of $13,225 are anticipated to be paid to BCAMLP for fees and expenses related to the sale and partial reimbursement of amounts payable to affiliates.  The breakdown of the amounts to be paid to BCAMLP is as follows:  $182 represents a fee for overseeing and managing the disposition of the property; $11,043 represents partial reimbursement of outstanding advances and asset management fees; and $2,000 represents reimbursement for expenses incurred related to the sale, which includes but is not limited to legal  costs.  Annual losses generated
by the Operating Partnership which were applied against the Investment Partnership's investment in the Operating Partnership in accordance with the equity method of accounting had previously reduced the investment in the Operating Partnership to zero.  Accordingly, a gain on the sale of the Operating Partnership of the proceeds from the sale, net of the disposition fee, has been recorded in the amount of $13,043 as of December 31, 2004.
In December 2004, the Investment Partnership sold its interest in Winfield Properties II, Limited Partnership to the Operating General Partner for his assumption of the outstanding mortgage balance of $598,371 and proceeds to the Investment Partnership of $17,951.  Of the total Investment Partnership proceeds $5,000 represents payment of outstanding reporting fees due to an affiliate of the Investment Partnership.  The remaining proceeds of $12,951 are anticipated to be paid to BCAMLP for fees and expenses related to the sale and partial reimbursement of amounts payable to affiliates.  The breakdown of the amounts to be paid to BCAMLP is as follows:  The breakdown of the amounts to be paid to BCAMLP is as follows:  $180 represents a fee for overseeing and managing the disposition of the property; $10,771 represents partial reimbursement of outstanding advances and asset management fees; and $2,000 represents reimbursement for expenses incurred related to the sale,
which includes but is not limited to legal costs.  Annual losses generated by the Operating Partnership which were applied against the Investment Partnership's investment in the Operating Partnership in accordance with the equity method of accounting had previously reduced the investment in the Operating Partnership to zero.  Accordingly, a gain on the sale of the Operating Partnership of the proceeds from the sale, net of the disposition fee, has been recorded in the amount of $12,771 as of December 31, 2004.
In October 2004, while attempting to capitalize on the strong California real estate market, the Operating General Partner of Rosenberg Building Associates (Rosenberg Apartments) entered into an agreement to sell the property and the transaction is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2005.  As part of the purchase agreement, the buyer is required to maintain the property as affordable housing through the end of the tax credit compliance period, and to provide a recapture bond to avoid the recapture of the tax credits that have been taken.  After repayment of the outstanding mortgage balance of approximately $1,695,906, the proceeds are estimated to be $2,238,090.  Of the proceeds received: $120,086 represents re-payment of loans due to partners; $73,751 represents payment of outstanding investor services fees; $61,748 represents payment of outstanding coordination fees due to the non-profit Managing General Partner; $32,500 represents payment of outstanding
partnership management fees due to the Operating General Partner; and $168,000 represents payment of a sales preparation fee to the Operating General Partner.  The remaining proceeds of $1,782,005 are anticipated to be paid to the Investment Limited Partners, BCTC I Series 4 and Series 6 and BCTC II Series 7 and Series 14, in accordance with their contributions to the Operating Partnership and the terms of the Operating Partnership agreement.  Once the determination of the amount due to each Investment Partnership has been determined, a determination of the amounts to be distributed to the limited partners of each Investment Partnership will be made.
In December 2001, the Operating General Partner of King City Elderly Housing exercised its option to purchase King City Elderly Housing from BCTC II - Series 7.  In March 2003, the Investment General Partner entered into an agreement to sell the property to the Operating General Partner for his assumption of the outstanding mortgage balance of approximately $1,658,087 and anticipated proceeds to the Investment Partnership of $350,000.  Of this amount, it is estimated that the net distribution to the investors will be approximately $161,610.  The total returned to the investors will be distributed based on the number of BACs held by each investor at the time of the sale.  Provided that this is the actual amount distributed, the investor per BAC distribution will be $.156.  The remaining proceeds of $188,390 are anticipated to be paid to for fees and expenses related to the sale and partial reimbursement of amounts payable to affiliates.  The breakdown of the amount
to be paid to BCAMLP is as follows:  $15,000 represents a fee for overseeing and managing the disposition of the property; $169,390 represents partial reimbursement for outstanding asset management fees; and $4,000 represents reimbursement for expenses incurred related to the sale, which includes but is not limited to legal and mailing costs.
(Series 9)  As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the average Qualified Occupancy for the series was 99.7%.  The series had a total of 53 properties at December 31, 2004. Out of the total, 51 were at 100% Qualified Occupancy.  

For the period ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, Series 9 reflects net loss from Operating Partnerships of $(1,693,910) and $(1,836,518), respectively, which includes depreciation and amortization of $2,757,954 and $2,625,198, respectively.
Series 9 has invested in 3 Operating Partnerships (the "Calhoun Partnerships") in which the Operating General Partner initially was Riemer Calhoun,�Jr. or an entity, which was affiliated with or controlled by Riemer Calhoun (the "Riemer Calhoun group").  The Operating Partnerships are Big Lake Seniors Apts., Blanco Seniors Apts. Ltd. and Pleasanton, Ltd.  The affordable housing properties owned by the Calhoun Partnerships are located in Texas and consist of approximately 64 apartment units in total.  The low income housing tax credit available annually to Series 9 from the Calhoun Partnerships is approximately $75,331, which is approximately 9% of the total annual tax credit available to investors in Series 9.
In the summer of 2002, the US Attorney for the Western District of Louisiana notified the Investment General Partner that the Riemer Calhoun group was under investigation by several federal agencies for the alleged manipulation of property cost certifications.  In early 2003, the Investment General Partner learned that the US Attorney intended to bring criminal charges against certain members of the Riemer Calhoun group for falsifying the certified cost basis upon which the Louisiana Housing Finance Agency determined the tax credit calculation with respect to approximately 40 Operating Partnerships in which Series 9 is not an investor.  The Investment General Partner used these certifications in determining the tax credits investors would receive through their investment in the Calhoun Partnerships.  In effect, it appears that the contractor that built the apartment properties (an affiliate of Mr. Calhoun's) overbilled the respective Operating Partnerships, thereby
improperly inflating the cost certification and the amount of tax credit generated.
In late March, 2003, Reimer Calhoun, Jr. pleaded guilty to charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit equity skimming.  At that time, the Investment General Partner obtained $1,282,202, currently held in escrow, from Reimer Calhoun for the purpose of offsetting any potential losses to tax credits caused by Mr. Calhoun's fraud.
On September 25, 2003, judgment in a criminal case was entered against Reimer Calhoun, Jr. and TF Management, Inc.  On Count 1, alleging wire fraud, Reimer Calhoun, Jr. was sentenced to 60 months in the custody of the United States Bureau of Prisons.  On Count 2, Mr. Calhoun received a concurrent 60 month sentence.  Mr. Calhoun's prison sentence began on October 13, 2003.  Mr. Calhoun was further fined $500,000 and ordered to pay restitution of $4,363,683 to various parties.  The amount of restitution ordered paid to the Investment General Partner was $1,559,723.  This amount includes the monies previously paid by Mr. Calhoun. The additional $277,521 was received in December 2003.
 
The Investment General Partner has cooperated fully with the US Attorney in the investigation, and there has been no suggestion of any wrongdoing on the part of it or any of its affiliates.
In 2003, the Internal Revenue Service commenced an audit of the Calhoun partnerships in order to finally determine the amount of overstated tax credits.  The Investment General Partner has reached a resolution with the IRS whereby the adjustments to tax credits will be made only for the tax years 2004 and thereafter in order to avoid amending tax returns already filed for the years 2001, 2002 and 2003. It is anticipated that final Closing Agreements will be entered into with the IRS for each of the partnerships in the next two to three months. At this point, the Investment Partnerships have incurred substantial legal and accounting costs based upon Mr. Calhoun's fraud. It is anticipated that some of these costs will continue at least through completion of the Closing Agreements. It is further anticipated that the $1,559,723 will be sufficient to fully protect the investors and provide restitution to the Investment Partnerships affected.
With respect to each of the Calhoun Partnerships either (a) Reimer Calhoun's controlling interest in the Operating General Partner has been assigned to Murray Calhoun the son of Reimer Calhoun or (b) in some cases the Operating General Partner entity itself has been replaced with a new entity controlled by Murray Calhoun and in which Reimer Calhoun has no interest. Murray Calhoun is the principal of Calhoun Property Management, L.L.C., which has provided property level management services for the apartment properties owned by the Calhoun Partnerships.  Murray Calhoun also cooperated fully with the criminal investigation of his father, and the Investment General Partner and its affiliates have confirmed directly with the US Attorney that no evidence was found of any wrongdoing on the part of Murray Calhoun.
Murray Calhoun and the Investment General Partner and its affiliates have all undertaken discussions with the Rural Housing Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in its capacity as first mortgage lender for each of the Calhoun Partnerships, to make sure that all of the mortgage loans are and will continue to be in good standing notwithstanding the overstated credit and the criminal prosecution resulting therefrom.  RHS has also indicated that it will consent to the replacement of general partners noted above.

School Street II Limited Partnership (School Street Apts. II) is a 24-unit complex located in Marshall, Wisconsin.  Occupancy through the fourth quarter of 2004 is 83%. Occupancy at the property had dropped slightly. There has been very little traffic at the property over the last 60 days. The market here is slow with very few phone calls to the property. Average vacancies in the area are running 15-17%.  Management is currently running rental concessions since July. The current concession is "Move in and receive $1,500", which can be used any time during the lease term but not all up front, they must also fulfill the entire lease term or the credit will be removed from the account. Operations remain below breakeven due to high operating expenses and fluctuations in occupancy. The high operating expenses at the property are tied to an increase in advertising, unit turnover and higher utility cost.  The management company has increased advertising in an effort
to maintain high occupancy.  Due to the strong competition from other properties, the property is unable to raise rents to cover the additional operating costs.  Consequently, the Operating General Partner has examined alternatives to reduce utility usage and implement energy saving measures. The Operating General Partner continues to fund any operating cash deficits. The mortgage, taxes, insurance, and accounts payables are current.  The current mortgage for this property matures in December 2004.  The Operating General Partner obtained a one year extension from the lender so that alternative financing arrangements can be pursued.
Glennwood Hotel Investors (Glennwood Hotel) is 36-unit single room occupancy (SRO) development, located in Porterville, CA.

The management agent continues to market the available units to the housing authority as well as performing various outreach efforts to attract qualified residents.  The average occupancy during 2004 was 67%.  Because of the high vacancy rate, the property will not achieve breakeven operations in 2004. The Operating General Partner continues to support the Operating Partnership financially. The mortgage, insurance and payables are current. The Investment General Partner continues to monitor this situation to ensure the property reaches the end of the tax credit compliance period in 2005.
Surry Village II Limited Partnership, (Surry Village II) is a 24-unit development located in Spring Grove, Virginia.  Average occupancy was 86% in 2003.  The average occupancy for the fourth quarter of 2004 was 90%.  Due to low occupancy early in 2004, the property operated below breakeven through the fourth quarter of 2004.  The property struggles with tenant retention.  Management feels this is due to the lack of cable providers in the area and poor television reception. The property also is located in a very isolated rural area with little local employment.  The property does not have rental assistance and has difficulty finding qualified residents.  Management has contacted several cable providers to determine if bringing cable to the property is possible.  The on-site manager continues to organize resident functions and "block parties" in an effort to improve retention.  The Investment General Partner will continue to monitor the Operating Partnership
on a monthly basis until it is able to operate above breakeven.

In December Rural Development finally approved the use of funds from the Replacement Reserve to renovate 8 units, which will help to improve occupancy. Additionally, management is advertising daily in the local newspaper. The property reached the end of its compliance period on December 31, 2004.

Chuckatuck Square (Chuckatuck Square), a 42-unit complex located in Suffolk, Virginia, operated below breakeven in 2003 despite strong occupancy.  Due to the operating deficit the auditor issued a "going concern" opinion in the 2003 audit.

a monthly basis until it is able to reduce operating expenses and generate cash.
Lawton Apartments Company Limited Partnership (Village Commons) is a 58-unit, family property located in Lawton, MI. This property has historically had low occupancy, which has resulted in negative cash flow and delinquent taxes for the years 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003. Average physical occupancy through the third quarter of 2004 was 65% and it remained at 65% through the fourth quarter of 2004.

 
Low occupancy is attributed to deferred maintenance issues and lack of employment in Lawton, combined with a high level of affordable housing in the surrounding area. The management company projects that approximately $110,000 is needed to make necessary deferred maintenance repairs.  The Operating General Partner has not funded any capital improvements to date.  Because of the declining financial and physical conditions of this property, the operating reserve, replacement reserve, and tax and insurance escrow have not been properly funded.

In May of 2002, Rural Development vouchered mortgage funds to pay real estate taxes for 1998, 2000, and 2001. This amount was added to the mortgage as additional debt creating higher monthly payments.  However, the Operating Partnership was unable to support the higher debt payments and as result the mortgage payments have been delinquent for 12 months and the loan is in default.  In May of 2003, Rural Development sent a letter to the Operating General Partner citing the mortgage delinquencies and Rural Development submitted the Operating Partnership to the State Attorneys General office to begin foreclosure proceedings.  The General Partner has appealed the foreclosure actions and as of December 31, 2004 a court date has not been established.  The Compliance period ended December 31, 2004.

Despite the improvement in occupancy, the property still suffers from deferred maintenance. To make the necessary repairs, the management company has estimated that approximately $80,000 is needed. The Operating General Partner has not funded any capital improvements to date.  Because of the declining financial and physical conditions of this property, the operating reserve, replacement reserve, and tax and insurance escrow have not been properly funded.  
In May of 2002, Rural Development utilized mortgage funds to pay real estate taxes for 1998-2001. This amount was added to the mortgage as an additional debt resulting in higher monthly payments. Because the Operating Partnership was unable to support higher debt payments, the mortgage was in default.  In May of 2003, Rural Development sent a letter to the Operating General Partner citing the mortgage delinquencies. Rural Development submitted the Partnership to the State Attorneys General office to begin foreclosure proceedings. The partnership has gone through two court appeals to stop the foreclosure process and both have been denied. In November 2004, the Partnership filed a suite with the Federal District court to contest the foreclosure proceedings and as of December 31, 2004, a court date had not been established. The Compliance period ended on December 31, 2004.

approximately $192,286 will be distributed to the investors.  Provided that this is the actual amount distributed, the investor per BAC distributions will be $.079.  The total returned to the investors will be distributed based on the number of BACs held by each investor.  The remaining proceeds of $428,214 are anticipated to be paid to BCAMLP for fees and expenses related to the sale and partial reimbursement of amounts payable to affiliates. The breakdown of the amount to be paid to BCAMLP is as follows:  $5,550 represents a fee for overseeing and managing the disposition of the property; $12,500 represents a reimbursement of estimated expenses incurred in connection with the disposition and $410,164 represents a partial payment of outstanding Asset Management Fees due to BCAMLP.  The proceeds received as of December 31, 2004 were applied against the Investment Partnership's remaining investment in the Operating Partnership
in accordance with the equity method of accounting.  The Investment Partnership recorded a loss on the sale of the partial investment in the amount of $61,815 in the quarter ended December 31, 2004.

During the first quarter of 2004, additional funding by the Investment General Partner totaling $30,650 was required due to lower than expected occupancy. The poor operations resulted from a management agent transfer at the end of 2003. The replacement manager found the property to be in much worse condition than those reported by the departing management firm. An additional claim for out of pocket payroll expenses and accrued management fees totaling $20,375 was paid in April to the former manager to avoid legal action. At the end of March, only four units were vacant representing a significant improvement over the 14 vacant at the start of January.  At the end of September, only four apartments were vacant but at year end, eight apartments were vacant due to turnover and evictions. The new property manager remains
confident that a more hands on approach at the property will result in higher occupancy levels and lower turnover. The mortgage, taxes and insurance are all current. However the loan servicer, Midland Loan Services, put the mortgage in a technical default because they have not approved the new manager in writing pending receipt of a signed management agreement. A signed agreement will be forwarded for their review and written approval.

Any such sale will occur at the conclusion of the 15 year tax credit compliance periods.  
South Fork Heights, Limited (South Fork Heights Apartments), located in South Fork, Colorado is a 48 unit, Rural Development-financed, family site.  The property has suffered from low occupancy and high turnover due to its location in a small tourist town in the mountains.  The town recently lost two of its' largest employers; a mining company and a sawmill which resulted in a decrease in the property's occupancy from 77% in July of 2004 to 73% in December 2004.  In 2001, the General Partner passed away and the executor of the estate assumed General Partner duties.  Boston Capital is in the process of negotiating the executor's formal insertion as General Partner with Boston Capital receiving exit strategy amendments in return.  Management recently negotiated a 3.6% rent increase from Rural Development effective June 1, 2004.  Moreover, plans are being finalized to build a new golf course and housing development near
the property.  Management intends to market directly to these employers to generate qualified applicants.  
Harbour View Group Limited, Limited Partnership (Sandy Pines Manor), is located in Punta Gorda, Florida.  The property was hit by multiple hurricanes in the late Fall of 2004 resulting in the total loss of habitability to all 44 residential units. Due to the massive amount of insurance claims filed in this area, payment processing has been delayed. The General Partner is currently finalizing negotiations with the insurance carrier for final payment in order to re-build the development.  Several general contractors have been contacted and asked to submit bids. Construction is scheduled to commence in February or March of 2005. The compliance period ended in 2004.
Union Baptist Plaza, Limited Partnership (Union Baptist Plaza Apartments), located in Springfield, Illinois, suffers from below breakeven operations due to high operating expenses and a high interest rate on the first mortgage debt.  The property has a history of high occupancy.  However, high operating expenses particularly taxes and utilities, prevent the property from achieving breakeven.  Due to the lack of cash flow, the 2002 property taxes became delinquent and accrued in the amount of approximately $22,810 plus interest.  The lender and Investment General Partner are in the process of finalizing a refinance of the first mortgage which should be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2005.  This should stabilize the economic condition of the property.  As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2004, the property's average occupancy had significantly improved to 99% versus 96% for the same period in 2003.  As a result of increased stabilized occupancy the
property has also managed to reduce outstanding payables.  Currently the previously mentioned property taxes for 2002 and 2003 are the only outstanding payables of note.  It is anticipated that all payables will be brought current upon completion of the refinance of the first mortgage.
Dallas Apartments II, LP (Campbell Creek Apartments) is an 80-unit property located in Dallas, Georgia.  Average occupancy for the first three quarters of 2004 was 81% however this dropped to 77% during the fourth quarter and year-end cash flow was negative.  Over the past four months, almost 50% of the units were vacated with non-payment eviction being the primary cause (29 of 38 move-outs).  Residents in these non-payment evictions were given rent concessions at the beginning of their leases, then never paid rent for subsequent months.  Management has revisited their rent concession policy and has begun to aggressively market the property and improve curb appeal. The Investment General Partner will continue working with the management company to review their marketing strategies and tenant screening process.  The mortgage, taxes, and insurance are all current.  The compliance period will expire on December 31, 2004.
Newnan Apartments II, LP (Pines by the Creek Apartments II) is a 96-unit property located in Newnan, Georgia. Although, the property's occupancy increased from 67% at the end of the second quarter to 81% at the end of the third, this was due to generous rent concessions that created higher collection losses and flat cash flow.  At the end of the third quarter, the management company changed regional managers and the property has been consistently improving.  Throughout the fourth quarter, she has revised the property's marketing strategy, reviewed the practice of concessions, and retrained site staff. Occupancy has improved without increasing tenant receivables.  She has also begun to implement programs that will improve tenant retention.  The Investment General Partner will continue monitoring the operations of Pines by the Creek.  The mortgage, taxes, and insurance are all current.  The compliance period for this property will expire on December
31, 2005.
 
Lakeridge Apartments of Eufala, Ltd. (Lakeridge Apts.) is located in Eufala, AL and consists of 30 tax credit housing units. Eufala, AL is considered to be rural with a stagnant economy. Due to a lack of state funding, The Housing Authority of Eufala was unable to issue additional Section 8 vouchers, during 2003 and the first quarter of 2004.  As a result occupancy at Lakeridge Apartments suffered greatly from these conditions. The site reported an average occupancy of 66% for 2003 and 63% for the first quarter of 2004.  However, occupancy has averaged 91% for the second through fourth quarters.  The increase in occupancy is due to the local housing authority's ability to issue new Section 8 vouchers and Management's increased focus on marketing.  The site is currently operating slightly below breakeven due to the low first quarter occupancy.  Management expects that operations will continue to improve during 2005.

Windsor II Limited Partnership (Windsor Court II), a 24-unit development located in Windsor, Virginia.  The partnership operated below breakeven in 2003 and through the fourth quarter of 2004 due to low occupancy levels and high operating expenses. Due to poor performance, the on-site manager was replaced in June 2004.  The new manager has been able to improve the occupancy and occupancy averaged 93% for the fourth quarter of 2004. By the end of 2004, occupancy had reached 100%.  The property continues to operate below breakeven because of the low occupancy in the first half of 2004. The Investment General Partner will monitor this deal on a monthly basis until it is able to stabilize occupancy, reduce expenses, and generate cash.Corcoran Investment Group (Corcoran Garden Apartments) is a 38-unit, family property located in Corcoran, CA. This property has stabilized with an average occupancy of 99% and operations above breakeven through fourth quarter 2004.  The replacement
reserve is funded, and tax, insurance, and mortgage payments are all current.  As operations have improved and stabilized we will no longer provide special disclosure on this partnership.
Scott City Associates III, Limited Partnership (Oak Street Apartments) is a 24-unit family property located in Scott City, Missouri. The property has operated with occupancy of 95% through December 2004, and is generating cash. This property appears to have achieved stability through increased occupancy and reduced operational costs. As operations have stabilized we will no longer provide special disclosure on this partnership. Additionally, the property will reach the end of its compliance period on December 31, 2005 and the Investment Limited Partner in Scott City Associates III, Limited Partnership is currently negotiating the sale of its interest.
Springfield Housing Associates Limited Partnership (Pinewood Apartments) is a 168-unit property located in Springfield, Illinois. Despite an average occupancy of 84% through fourth quarter 2004, the property is operating above break-even. Low interest rates are allowing more people to buy in this area; however, management continues to market aggressively through cold calls, billboards, newspaper ads, and a rental incentive of one month of free rent. The Investment Limited Partner for Springfield Housing Associates is currently negotiating the sale of its interest, but will continue to monitor operations closely until the sale is complete or occupancy has increased and stabilized.
Fort Smith Housing Associates (Yorkshire Townhomes) is a 50 unit property located in Fort Smith, AR.  The property suffers from low occupancy and high turnover due higher rents and market competition.
 
In 2003, the property had an average occupancy of 84% and DCR of .67. The manager was replaced in 2004 and a Police sub-station was placed at the property.  In an effort to increase occupancy management has increased advertising, distributed flyers and visited all local employers for referrals.  
As of December 2004 the average occupancy was 75%. The property has maintained a 72% occupancy for November and December.  The rents have been lowered to attract potential residents, advertising has been increased however traffic in the area has slowed down considerably.  Management continues to work hard marketing the property but the lack of qualified tenants in the area has made it difficult to increase the occupancy.  The Operating General Partner funds the development for any shortfalls.  The property mortgage, taxes and insurance are all current.  A former resident has filed a lawsuit naming Yorkshire Townhomes and owners regarding a claim of civil rights violation.  The Plaintiff has demanded a trial by jury, which is expected to be heard in the first quarter of 2005.

In October 2004, while attempting to capitalize on the strong California real estate market, the Operating General Partner of California Investors VII (Summit Ridge Apartments/Longhorn Pavilion) entered into an agreement to sell the property and the transaction is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2005.  As part of the purchase agreement, the buyer is required to maintain the property as affordable housing through the end of the tax credit compliance period, and to provide a recapture bond to avoid the recapture of the tax credits that have been taken.  The estimated proceeds to the ILPs Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund II-Series 12 and Series 14 (BCTC II) and Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund III-Series 15 and Series 17 (BCTC III) which are expected to be received in the first quarter 2005 are $919,920, $312,959, $1,459,511, and $1,346,025, for Series 12, Series 14, Series 15, and Series 17, respectively.  Of the total expected to be received, $211,638 is for
payment of outstanding reporting fees due to an affiliate of the Investment Partnership, $183,283 is a reimbursement of funds previously advanced to the Operating Partnership by affiliates of the Investment Partnership and $3,643,494 is the estimated proceeds from the sale of the ILP's interests.  Of the estimated proceeds, it is expected that $700,257, $235,742, $1,074,778, and $989,026, for Series 12, Series 14, Series 15, and Series 17, respectively, will be distributed to the investors.  Provided this is the actual amount distributed, this represented a per BAC distribution of $.236, $.042, $.278, and $.198, for Series 12, Series 14, Series 15, and Series 17, respectively.  The remaining estimated proceeds of $643,691 are anticipated to be paid to BCAMLP for fees and expenses related to the sale and partial reimbursement for amounts owed to affiliates.  The breakdown of amounts expected to be paid to BCAMLP is as follows: $51,250 for overseeing and managing the disposition
of the property; $88,274 represents a reimbursement of estimated expenses incurred in connection with the disposition; $504,167 represents a partial payment of outstanding Asset Management Fees due to BCAMLP.  
(Series 14)  As of December 31, 2004 and 2003 the average Qualified Occupancy for the series was 100% and 99.9%.  The series had a total of 97 properties at December 31, 2004.  Out of the total, 97 were at 100% Qualified Occupancy.

For the period ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, Series 14 reflects net loss from Operating Partnerships of $(2,659,224) and $(2,025,812), respectively, which includes depreciation and amortization of $3,940,708 and $3,772,587 respectively.

Series 14 has invested in 4 Operating Partnerships (the "Calhoun Partnerships") in which the Operating General Partner initially was Riemer Calhoun,�Jr. or an entity, which was affiliated with or controlled by Riemer Calhoun (the "Riemer Calhoun Group").  The Operating Partnerships are Blanchard Senior Apartments, Colorado City Seniors, Cottonwood Apts. II A LP and Hughes Springs Seniors Apts. ALP.  The affordable housing properties owned by the Calhoun Partnerships are located in Louisiana or Texas and consist of approximately 104 apartment units in total.  The low income housing tax credit available annually to Series 14 from the Calhoun Partnerships is approximately $117,109, which is approximately 4% of the total annual tax credit available to investors in Series 14.In the summer of 2002, the US Attorney for the Western District of Louisiana notified the Investment General Partner that the Riemer Calhoun group was under investigation by several federal
agencies for the alleged manipulation of property cost certifications.  In early 2003, the Investment General Partner learned that the US Attorney intended to bring criminal charges against certain members of the Riemer Calhoun group for falsifying the certified cost basis upon which the Louisiana Housing Finance Agency determined the tax credit calculation with respect to approximately 40 Operating Partnerships in which Series 9 is not an investor.  The Investment General Partner used these certifications in determining the tax credits investors would receive through their investment in the Calhoun Partnerships.  In effect, it appears that the contractor that built the apartment properties (an affiliate of Mr. Calhoun's) overbilled the respective Operating Partnerships, thereby improperly inflating the cost certification and the amount of tax credit generated.
In late March 2003, Reimer Calhoun, Jr. pleaded guilty to charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit equity skimming.  At that time, the Investment General Partner obtained $1,282,202, currently held in escrow, from Reimer Calhoun for the purpose of offsetting any potential losses to tax credits caused by Mr. Calhoun's fraud.
On September 25, 2003, judgment in a criminal case was entered against Reimer Calhoun, Jr. and TF Management, Inc.  On Count 1, alleging wire fraud, Reimer Calhoun, Jr. was sentenced to 60 months in the custody of the United States Bureau of Prisons.  On Count 2, Mr. Calhoun received a concurrent 60 month sentence.  Mr. Calhoun's prison sentence began on October 13, 2003.  Mr. Calhoun was further fined $500,000 and ordered to pay restitution of $4,363,683 to various parties.  The amount of restitution ordered paid to the Investment General Partner was $1,559,723.  This amount includes the monies previously paid by Mr. Calhoun. The additional $277,521 was received in December 2003.
 
The Investment General Partner has cooperated fully with the US Attorney in the investigation, and there has been no suggestion of any wrongdoing on the part of it or any of its affiliates.
In 2003, the Internal Revenue Service commenced an audit of the Calhoun partnerships in order to finally determine the amount of overstated tax credits.  The Investment General Partner has reached a resolution with the IRS whereby the adjustments to tax credits will be made only for the tax years 2004 and thereafter in order to avoid amending tax returns already filed for the years 2001, 2002 and 2003. It is anticipated that final Closing Agreements will be entered into with the IRS for each of the partnerships in the next two to three months. At this point, the Investment Partnerships have incurred substantial legal and accounting costs based upon Mr. Calhoun's fraud. It is anticipated that some of these costs will continue at least through completion of the Closing Agreements. It is further anticipated that the $1,559,723 will be sufficient to fully protect the investors and provide restitution to the Investment Partnerships affected.
With respect to each of the Calhoun Partnerships where either (a) Reimer Calhoun's controlling interest in the Operating General Partner has been assigned to Murray Calhoun the son of Reimer Calhoun or (b) in some cases the Operating General Partner entity itself has been replaced with a new entity controlled by Murray Calhoun and in which Reimer Calhoun has no interest. Murray Calhoun is the principal of Calhoun Property Management, L.L.C., which has provided property level management services for the apartment properties owned by the Calhoun Partnerships.  Murray Calhoun also cooperated fully with the criminal investigation of his father, and the Investment General Partner and its affiliates have confirmed directly with the US Attorney that no evidence was found of any wrongdoing on the part of Murray Calhoun.
Murray Calhoun and the Investment General Partner and its affiliates have all undertaken discussions with the Rural Housing Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in its capacity as first mortgage lender for each of the Calhoun Partnerships, to make sure that all of the mortgage loans are and will continue to be in good standing notwithstanding the overstated credit and the criminal prosecution resulting therefrom.  RHS has also indicated that it will consent to the replacement of general partners noted above.
Finally, the Investment General Partner and its affiliates are reviewing their business dealings with the Calhoun Partnerships in general to attempt to determine if any other irregularities have occurred.

One Northridge, LTD., in Arlington Texas is located between Dallas and Fort Worth. The community consists of 126 units. The property continues to experience problems with high payables, low occupancy, and deferred maintenance.  As of June 29, 2004 the Operating General Partner reported outstanding payables of $235,847. The Operating General Partner has not provided financial reports since March.  The Operating General Partner is attempting to supervise the daily operation and is currently seeking a buyer for the asset. The Investment General Partner completed a complete file audit in June 2004.  The general condition of the asset, lack of marketing efforts, and the turnover of the staff continue to be contributing factors to the low occupancy. Lease percentages continue to lag in the market sector at 66% with the market area in the mid 90's. A replacement General Partner is being considered to turn around operations,
make improvements to the property, and re-initiate reporting. 
Summer Lane Limited Partnership (Summer Lane Apartments) is a 24 unit, family complex located in Santee, SC.  In the first quarter of 2003, the Operating General Partner applied through Rural Development to restructure their mortgage reducing their monthly mortgage payment and bringing the Replacement Reserve account current.  After nearly two years of negotiations, the plan was approved and the mortgage is scheduled to be re-amortized in the first quarter of 2005.  Once the re-amortization is complete, Rural Development will work towards clearing up the Replacement Reserve account and bringing it current.  The monthly mortgage payment will be reduced by approximately $2,000.  
The average occupancy for the fourth quarter was 100%, with year to date occupancy of 91.33%.  The property has shown six months of breakeven operations.  Once the mortgage re-amortization is finalized the property will further strengthen operations, and pay off overdue accounts payable.  The Operating General Partner's operating deficit guarantee is unlimited in time and amount.
Woodfield Commons Limited Partnership (Woodfield Commons Apartments) is a 46 unit development located in Marshfield, WI.  The property operated with an average occupancy of 87% for the year 2003. Based on the most recent information the average occupancy has improved to 89%. The operating expenses continue to stay below the state average. Although the occupancy increased, the low rental rates in the area prevented the property from achieving breakeven operations through the fourth quarter of 2004.  The management agent continues to market the available units by working closely with the housing authority and uses various marketing efforts to attract qualified residents. The Operating General Partner had historically supported the property financially but has recently stated they will no longer support this property. The property's compliance period ends in 2005.  The Investment General Partner will work with the Operating General Partner to insure the property remains
in compliance thru the compliance period.

Montague Place, LP (Montague Place Apartments) is a 28-unit, family complex located in Caro, MI. The property was originally designated a senior complex and it had a history of low occupancy because there was a shortage of eligible residents in the area. The Operating General Partner requested that the property be converted from a senior property to a family property in order to increase the number of qualified residents. Rural Development approved the property conversion effective September 1, 2002.  
The Operating Partnership suffered from low occupancy during 2003, which averaged 81%. Through the fourth quarter of 2004, this property was operating with average occupancy of 82%. To increase occupancy, the Regional Manager increased marketing efforts by offering rental concessions. However, due to poor market conditions in the region occupancy is not improving. The management company remains occupancy will improve in the first half of 2005. Kilmarnock Limited Partnership (Indian Creek Apts.) is a 20-unit development located in Kilmarnock, Virginia.  The property generated a small amount of cash in 2003, due to a workout plan with Rural Development.  Average occupancy was 90.42% in 2003 and 90% through the fourth quarter of 2004.  Occupancy has continued to strengthen and was 100% as of December 31, 2004.  The property is located in a very rural area and the property suffers from lack of qualified applicants.  The
property continues to operate above breakeven through the fourth quarter of 2004.  The Investment General Partner will continue to monitor this deal on a monthly basis. Due to the improved operations, the Investment General partner will no longer provide special disclosure on its operations.

As part of the purchase agreement, the buyer is required to maintain the property as affordable housing through the end of the tax credit compliance period, and to provide a recapture bond to avoid the recapture of the tax credits that have been taken.

In addition to the transfer of Operating General Partner interest, an exit strategy has been put in place that will allow for the sale of the Investment Limited Partner interest to the new Operating General Partner at the end of the 15-year tax credit compliance period, which expires in December 2006.  The proceeds to the Investment Partnership are $14,318.
Townview Apartments, a Limited Partnership (Townview Apartments) is a 26 unit property located in St. Mary's, Pennsylvania. The key issues affecting the property's operations are rent levels and decreased occupancy. Due to the decrease in occupancy and an increase in operating expenses, the property operated below breakeven in 2003. The site manager retired from this property mid year. Prior to the manager's retirement, lease-up activity became lax and the property's occupancy struggled as a result. The site's occupancy continues to struggle against the competition in the area in 2004. There are a number of HUD properties in the area that offer lower rent. A new site manager has since taken over at the property and is working diligently on returning occupancy to a level that will allow the property to breakeven. So far, through the fourth quarter, the property is operating with an average occupancy of 78%. The property received a rent increase of $12 per unit in 2004;
however the property is operating below breakeven through the fourth quarter as a result of decreased occupancy. The Investment General Partner will continue to monitor operations at this property.In February 2004, Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund I - Series 5 and Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund II - Series 14 negotiated a sale of their Investment Limited Partner interests in Glenhaven Park Partners (Glenhaven Park) to the Operating General Partner.

Of the proceeds $6,000 actually was for payment of outstanding reporting fees and $22,760 was proceeds from the sale of the interests.  The total sale proceeds received were used to repay subordinated loans that had been made by Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund II-Series 14.  Total outstanding subordinated loans and advances made by Series 5 and Series 14 exceeded the repayment by $10,742 and $156,940, respectively.  The
unpaid loans and advances were written off and included in the loss on the sale of the Operating Partnership for Series 5 and Series 14 as of March 31, 2004.

In February 2004, Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund I - Series 4 and Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund II-Series 14 negotiated a transfer of their Investment Limited Partner interest in Haven Park Partners II, A California LP (Glenhaven Park II) to the Operating General Partner for his assumption of the outstanding mortgage balance of $466,593 and proceeds to the ILP of $715,000.

Annual losses generated by the Operating Partnership, which were applied against the ILP's investment in the Operating Partnership in accordance with the equity method
of accounting, had previously reduced the ILPs investment in the Operating Partnership to zero.  Accordingly, a gain on the sale of the Investment Limited Partner Interest of $18,137 and $179,185 for Series 5 and Series 14, respectively, was realized in the quarter ended March 31, 2004.

Of the estimated proceeds, it is expected that $156,660 ($117,495 for Series 2 and $39,165 for Series
14) will be distributed to the investors.  Provided this is the actual amount distributed, this represented a per BAC distribution of $.142 and $.007 for Series 2 and 14, respectively.  The total returned to the investors will be distributed based on the number of BACs held by each investor.  The remaining estimated proceeds of $66,557 are anticipated to be paid to BCAMLP for fees and expenses related to the sale and partial reimbursement for amounts owed to affiliates.  The breakdown of amounts expected to be paid to BCAMLP is as follows: $21,600 for overseeing and managing the disposition of the property; $9,000 for reimbursement of estimated expenses incurred in connection with the disposition; and $35,957 for partial payment of outstanding Asset Management Fees due to BCAMLP.

Principal Accounting Policies and Estimates

The financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which requires the Partnership to make certain estimates and assumptions.  A summary of significant accounting policies is provided in Note 1 to the financial statements.  The following section is a summary of certain aspects of those accounting policies that may require subjective or complex judgments and are most important to the portrayal of Partnership's financial condition and results of operations.  The Partnership believes that there is a low probability that the use of different estimates or assumptions in making these judgments would result in materially different amounts being reported in the financial statements.


The Partnership is required to assess potential impairments to its long-lived assets, which is primarily investments in limited partnerships.  The Partnership accounts for its investment in limited partnerships in accordance with the equity method of accounting since the Partnership does not control the operations of the Operating Limited Partnership.
If the book value of the Partnership's investment in an Operating Partnership exceeds the estimated value derived by management, which generally consists of the remaining future Low-Income Housing Credits allocable to the Partnership and the estimated residual value to the Partnership, the Partnership reduces its investment in any such Operating Limited Partnership and includes such reduction in equity in loss of investment of limited partnerships.
