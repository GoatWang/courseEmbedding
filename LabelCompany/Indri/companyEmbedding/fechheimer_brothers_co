CELEBRATING 175 YEARS OF EXCELLENCE








 

An American Tradition Since 1842 









ABOUT US 


Celebrating 175 years Of Excellence 
 
Fechheimer Brothers Company, began the journey of manufacturing the world’s most trusted uniforms for public safety in 1842. Solomon “Samuel” Fechheimer, a German immigrant, opened a small dry goods store in Cincinnati, OH. Samuel combined adventure and passion, seeking out opportunities to grow his business and give back through his trade. With the beginning of the Civil War, Samuel honed his father’s legacy and craftsmanship of making clothing, to secure the United States government contract to supply uniforms for soldiers in the North and South. This feat marked the beginning of Fechheimers’ commitment to innovation by standardizing men’s uniform sizes for the first time ever in American history. Since that time, Fechheimer’s Flying Cross brand has been shaping the way uniforms are made and used within the military, law enforcement, fire and other markets beyond public safety. Taking on the name of one of America’s most honored medals, the Distinguished Flying Cross, Fechheimer has translated this history of heroism and extraordinary accomplishment to the many customers it serves today. 

 
 
For years the Flying Cross brand has connected generation after generation of customers who have helped to redefine key uniform attributes such as detailed quality craftsmanship, superior fit and harmony in function and comfort. Now, as the leading uniform manufacturer in public safety, Fechheimer continues its commitment of excellence with new product designs, advances in fabric technologies, customized solutions, and quite simply – time and care in the smallest of details. Flying Cross reflects the unwavering devotion to duty expressed and experienced by many customers every day. For 175 years, Fechheimer has been trusted to transform precision details of Flying Cross uniforms to the stories of courage and heroism, told and untold. The company continues to be INSPIRED BY TRADITION AND TRANSFORMED BY EXCELLENCE.

Fechheimer Brothers (Flying Cross)
 — December 01, 2007 

 While quality and service are critical to all apparel manufacturers, Fechheimer Brothers Co. takes them to a whole new level.
 
The company, founded in Cincinnati, OH, in 1842 and still based there, is the leader in uniforms and gear for public safety markets, such as police, fire and EMS, under the Flying Cross and Fechheimer brands. Owned by Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's investment company, it also makes uniforms for the military, postal workers, train conductors and even baseball umpires.
 
But its core business is providing shirts and pants for police officers, whose working conditions demand higher standards for quality and consistency than the average apparel customer.
 
"It's more like gear than apparel," says Bob Getto, Fechheimer's president and CEO. "You're really putting together a product that somebody's going have to look great in and perform in seven days a week, 52 weeks a year, and in four seasons. And for a number of years, that uniform has to look the same. So the quality with which we produce the garment is well above the standards of the commercial market."
 
Providing performance and consistency
Critical to the law enforcement business is the ability to present a consistent uniform appearance across the police force, in order to foster a level of respect with the public they serve, to help preserve their authority. This requires that a new recruit's uniform matches the seasoned veteran's.
 
"They have to look exactly like the people that have been working there five years," says Getto, who joined Fechheimer in February of this year after a 25-year career in the textile and apparel industry at Burlington Industries and Duro Textiles. "The color and the make of the shirt must be very consistent, or it will impact their image in the community."
 
In addition to its focus on quality, Fechheimer has to stay on the cutting edge of innovation, including in the area of performance fabrics, which are often more critical in the public safety arena.
 
"All the performance things that you hear about in fabrics really matter in the uniform business," says Getto. "It's not just a gimmick to sell something."
 
For Fechheimer, the needs of the public safety markets require that it not only stays on top of the latest innovations in moisture-wicking, anti-microbial, stretch and color-retention, but also keeps tabs on developments in niche areas of the market.
 
For EMS workers, for instance, Fechheimer employs fabrics that blood can't pass through. For the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, the company is working with Canadian outdoor apparel specialist Arc'teryx on fire-resistant, no-melt, no-drip uniforms to protect troops from incendiary devices, which have tended to melt regular fabric to a soldier's body.
 
For police officers, Fechheimer continually works to develop fabrics and new methods of general construction to meet the needs of a more demanding job.
 
"It used to be that when a law enforcement officer said 'Stop!,' people actually stopped. Now people run away, try to run over them with a car, shoot at them or tackle them," says Getto. "So the performance of the uniform in that environment is different than it was before."
 
Body armor - not very common 20 years ago - is now worn by almost all police officers. Some wear it under their shirts, and some wear it on the outside. Fechheimer also makes waistbands able to support a 40-to-45-pound duty belt containing an officer's gun, pepper-spray, billy club, radio and handcuffs. It also has to provide the right fits and styles for women, who comprise about 15 percent of the U.S. police force.
 
"You've got to bring solutions and the key word is 'solutions' in uniforms," notes Getto. "It really has to solve a problem."
 
Reliable service keeps officers focused on their jobs
Another cornerstone to Fechheimer's success in the public service sector has been reliable service. Fechheimer has become a trusted resource over the years not only because of its consistent quality but also because of its large in-stock program that enables it to fill orders quickly - frequently on next-day delivery. Chiefs of police and fire turn to Fechheimer and its 500 North American dealers for next-day shipments.
 
"Chiefs really don't want to worry about how they are going to get their guys in uniforms, and [whether or not] the uniforms are going to be good quality and look the same," says Getto.
 
"We're a very trusted source of supply for a program that is critical to their image and critical to their performance. We put that program in place and support it like we've always done, and they just forget about it and go do what they do well."
 
One way Fechheimer is making life easier for its customers is through its proprietary Quartermaster software program, which enables a department to manage its uniform distribution program to its officers.
 
Under a program recently set up for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), for instance, transit employees can walk up to computer terminals to order their sweater, outerwear, pants or shirts and the items are delivered to them.
 
"We're making it easy for a city to distribute its uniform program to their employees," says Getto. "It's one thing to get the uniform right, but it's another thing to deliver it to 5,000 people on a timely basis with the turnover they have to deal with."
 
Customers also count on Fechheimer for special orders. For instance, the company made a uniform for 7' 2" Miami Heat basketball star Shaquille O'Neil, also a reserve officer for the Orange County sheriff's department. And a super plus-size uniform was recently made for a sumo wrestler in Hawaii.
 
Manufacturing know-how spurs innovation
Partly to meet this demand for special orders, Fechheimer still manufactures close to 40 percent of its product at three plants in the United States. It also produces domestically because military and postal products by law must be made in the United States, and some law enforcement departments only use U.S.-made product as well.
 
Having some in-house manufacturing expertise also helps Fechheimer come up with solutions for its customers. It then works with its outside sourcing partners to push design and fabric innovations across the uniform marketplace, says Getto.
 
Fechheimer's ability to deliver consistency has been helped by having only three owners in its 165-year history. This includes the founding Fechheimer family, the Heldman family that ran it from 1941 to 1986 and Berkshire Hathaway, which acquired the company in 1986. Getto believes Fechheimer fits Berkshire Hathaway's focus of investing in companies that provide its customers with core underlying value.
 
"Berkshire likes to be in businesses where real value is provided," says Getto. "When you provide real value, it's not that easy to be replaced." v

CELEBRATING 175 YEARS OF EXCELLENCE








 

An American Tradition Since 1842 









ABOUT US 


Celebrating 175 years Of Excellence 
 
Fechheimer Brothers Company, began the journey of manufacturing the world’s most trusted uniforms for public safety in 1842. Solomon “Samuel” Fechheimer, a German immigrant, opened a small dry goods store in Cincinnati, OH. Samuel combined adventure and passion, seeking out opportunities to grow his business and give back through his trade. With the beginning of the Civil War, Samuel honed his father’s legacy and craftsmanship of making clothing, to secure the United States government contract to supply uniforms for soldiers in the North and South. This feat marked the beginning of Fechheimers’ commitment to innovation by standardizing men’s uniform sizes for the first time ever in American history. Since that time, Fechheimer’s Flying Cross brand has been shaping the way uniforms are made and used within the military, law enforcement, fire and other markets beyond public safety. Taking on the name of one of America’s most honored medals, the Distinguished Flying Cross, Fechheimer has translated this history of heroism and extraordinary accomplishment to the many customers it serves today. 

 
 
For years the Flying Cross brand has connected generation after generation of customers who have helped to redefine key uniform attributes such as detailed quality craftsmanship, superior fit and harmony in function and comfort. Now, as the leading uniform manufacturer in public safety, Fechheimer continues its commitment of excellence with new product designs, advances in fabric technologies, customized solutions, and quite simply – time and care in the smallest of details.

Since that time, Fechheimer’s Flying Cross brand has been shaping the way uniforms are made and used within the military, law enforcement, fire and other markets beyond public safety. Taking on the name of one of America’s most honored medals, the Distinguished Flying Cross, Fechheimer has translated this history of heroism and extraordinary accomplishment to the many customers it serves today. 

 
 
For years the Flying Cross brand has connected generation after generation of customers who have helped to redefine key uniform attributes such as detailed quality craftsmanship, superior fit and harmony in function and comfort. Now, as the leading uniform manufacturer in public safety, Fechheimer continues its commitment of excellence with new product designs, advances in fabric technologies, customized solutions, and quite simply – time and care in the smallest of details. Flying Cross reflects the unwavering devotion to duty expressed and experienced by many customers every day. For 175 years, Fechheimer has been trusted to transform precision details of Flying Cross uniforms to the stories of courage and heroism, told and untold. The company continues to be INSPIRED BY TRADITION AND TRANSFORMED BY EXCELLENCE.
