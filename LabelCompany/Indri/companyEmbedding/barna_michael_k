How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Massachusetts:













Does Michael K Barna carry a valid contracting license?



Any work that involves a building's structural elements in addition to other construction, must be performed by a licensed construction supervisor, issued by the Department of Public Safety. A home improvement contractor must be registered by the Office of Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation, to perform any nonstructural residential home improvement work.
Michael K Barna currently holds license CS-075636 (Construction Supervisor, Building Licenses), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Massachusetts?



Contractors in Massachusetts must prove continous work experience in their trade or a construction related degree from an accredited college, before they can take an exam to become a licensed contractor. Construction supervisor licenses must be renewed every 2 years, after taking the requisite continuing education requirements. 











Your liability risk when hiring Michael K Barna



Contractors in Massachusetts must carry general liability insurance and an active workers' compensation policy. Proof of a current workers compensation policy is required to file a building permit as a contractor in Massachusetts. Be sure to request a copy of certificates for each policy.











Financial recourse when hiring Michael K Barna



If a remodeling project has gone badly a homeowner can recoup up to $10,000 of actual losses through the Home Improvement Contractor Guaranty Fund. The property must be the owner's primary residence, and a claim must be filed within 6 months of the initial court judgement or the arbitration award date.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Massachusetts, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner,choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with.BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).Just click here to get started.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
