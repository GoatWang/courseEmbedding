Gulfstream G650
 
The Gulfstream G650 is a twin-engine business jet airplane. The G650 is Gulfstream's largest and fastest business jet with a top speed of Mach 0.925. With the G650’s long, unfettered wing, the aircraft has redefined how air flows over an aircraft wing, creating a highly efficient airfoil that delivers speed and an incredibly smooth ride.

CPI was founded in 1980 by Arthur August, a 25-year veteran of Grumman Corporation.





Conceived and started as a technical consulting firm, within a few short years, CPI was manufacturing aircraft structural components for U.S. military aircraft under contract to the U.S. Government. By the late 1980’s CPI was also providing structural components for civil aircraft in the commercial.
 
In the 1990’s, CPI became a publicly traded company listed on the Nasdaq Market and changed its name to CPI Aerostructures, Inc. The company continued to grow, both in size and in its business. Government contracts continued to be CPI Aero’s mainstay of business, but the company was beginning to enter the commercial market as well. Commitment to customer satisfaction and pride in a job well done propelled CPI Aero to the forefront as a reputable and hardworking supplier to OEMs.
 
By the 2000’s, CPI Aero shares migrated from the Nasdaq Market to the New York Stock Exchange. It also started to focus on diversifying its business model to pursue more commercial contracts. In 2007, the company won three major contracts within a short time and the company experienced great growth and expansion during that time.
 
Today, CPI Aero continues to engage in traditional high quality structural assembly manufacturing while incorporating the latest in technology to improve quality and streamline production. Our growth and success is rooted in our core company values and the dedication and skill of our employees, and we remain committed to providing our customers the full-service solution they require.








“The idea was to create a company with the technical expertise of a prime contractor with the flexibility and attention to customer satisfaction of a much smaller organization.”
 
Art August
1935-2014

Supplier Management











Responsibilities and Authorities
The CPI Aero Procurement Dept. has the responsibility and authority to contract for raw material, parts, processing, logistics, subcontract needs, shop and office suppliers, and services in a manner consistent with the needs of CPI Aero.
The responsibilities and authorities include determination of source of supplies, commitments, negotiation of purchases and delivery schedules. These decisions are made in consultation with Quality and Program Management to ensure product and services are of the correct quality, quantity and price, and are provided from the appropriate source of supply.





Supplier Relations
CPI Aero itself does not manufacture detail parts so we value our supplier base. It is vital to our success to develop a strong supplier base. We treat all suppliers fairly and impartially while seeking to develop long term relationships that benefit both the buying and selling organization. In addition to competitive bidding, the supplier evaluation and selection process shall consider supplier ability, quality, delivery performance, capacity, financial status, location, integrity and other factors as may be appropriate.






Supplier Quality
All suppliers providing raw materials, subcontracting, or processing services used in the manufacture of the finished product provided to CPI Aero customers are required to maintain a quality system based on AS 9100 or equivalent. OEM granted approvals may also be required. All suppliers evaluated by CPI Aero for inclusion to the Approved Supplier List are required to adequately complete and sign a Supplier Quality System Questionnaire. Suppliers added to our “Approved Supplier List” are subjected to continuous monitoring for quality performance and must maintain minimum quality performance standards to retain approval status.




Download the Supplier Quality System Questionnaire (Microsoft Word DOCX)




Supplier Quality Assurance Requirements (SQAR)
The SQAR document is the Supplier’s guide to understanding CPI Aero’s quality requirements and expectations. The SQAR forms a part of CPI Aero’s purchase order unless otherwise specified.




Download Supplier Quality Requirements Manual (Adobe Acrobat PDF)






Boeing Quality Clauses (BQC)
All Boeing A-10 Program Suppliers: CPI QUALITY CODE “BQC” (QMF 08B Revision D dated 6/10/2015) is applicable if called out on your CPI Aero Purchase Order (Job 2216).

CPI Aero Signs $21 Million, Five-Year Supply Agreement With SikorskyBack to CVU Snapshot

Share Story8:00AM ET 7/17/2017 Globe NewswireEDGEWOOD, N.Y., July  17, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CPI Aerostructures, Inc. ("CPI Aero®") (NYSE MKT: CVU) announced today that it has signed a long-term supply agreement with Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin company (NYSE:LMT), to manufacture fuel panel assemblies for the UH-60M Black Hawk helicopter. This long-term agreement is valued at up to approximately $21 million for a period of five years, beginning in 2018 and ending in 2022 per Sikorsky and the U.S. Army's recent signing of the Multi-Year IX contract.
CPI Aero has been producing fuel panel assemblies for the UH-60M since 2010.  Since that time, CPI Aero has delivered more than 900 units to support the aircraft's production line.  Under the terms of the new agreement, CPI Aero will perform all manufacturing tasks for these assemblies, including purchasing and managing the supply chain for all detail parts and system components such as fuel valves, flexible hosing and tubing.
Douglas J. McCrosson, president and chief executive officer of CPI Aero, commented, "The fuel panel assembly is a key product within our aerosystems segment and is an excellent example of our capabilities outside of our traditional aerostructures market. The Black Hawk helicopter has been one of the most important aircraft systems to CPI Aero for the past 10 years, and it is gratifying that it will continue to be so for at least the next five years."
The Black Hawk helicopter has become the leader in multi-mission-type aircraft. Among the mission configurations it serves are troop transport, medical evacuation, electronic warfare, attack, assault support and special operations.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
