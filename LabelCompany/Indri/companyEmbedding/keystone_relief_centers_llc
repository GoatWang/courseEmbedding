The Pennsylvania Department of Health on Thursday announced the names of 27 companies that will be permitted to sell medical marijuana across the state next year, reaching another milestone in a program that could lead to cannabis being available by 2018.



The announcement also set off another round of consternation about whether the cannabis dispensaries were being distributed fairly and put in places where they would serve the most patients.
In suburban Philadelphia, six are to open in Montgomery County, three in Bucks County, and two each in Chester and Delaware Counties.

In Philadelphia. the state approved four locations, three across the northernmost tier of the city, with one in East Mount Airy and two in Northeast Philadelphia. The fourth is in Fishtown near the SugarHouse Casino.



 


“There’s not one in Center City, not one in West Philadelphia, not one by the airport, or in Old City,” said Andrew B. Sacks, a lawyer and chairman of the medical marijuana and hemp department at Sacks, Weston, Diamond LLC. “There should have been one on Walnut Street. Period. This is just asinine.”
Each of the 27 winners has the right to operate three storefronts. Though 81 dispensaries are allowed by law, many applicants chose not to ask for additional outlets.
Just 52 are expected to open sometime next year.
“It’s hard to see if there was much consideration for access by patients, given these locations,” said Alva Mather, one of three partners at the Pepper Hamilton LLP law firm leading a new cannabis industry group. “Being able to get to health-care facilities is always an issue. It’s not set up with that framework in mind.”






 

“A lot of these patients are terminal,” said Chris Goldstein, a marijuana and patient advocate who writes the Philly420 column for Philly.com. “Dispensaries should be as convenient as a CVS or a Rite Aid.”
But that could change.
The winners who have not committed themselves to opening all three of their allotted dispensaries “have the ability to put in for their second or third locations after their first is up and running,” said April Hutcheson, a spokeswoman for the state Health Department.
Hutcheson said the locations were businesses that scored the highest on their applications.



 

“This is only the start of the program, and we’re moving quickly to getting medication to the public,” Hutcheson said. “As we need to grow, we can. They still have the ability to open up more locations.”
The city zoning office is ready to expand the number of sites. It has cleared the way for 10 dispensary locations, granting zoning permits for real estate in neighborhoods that include Northern Liberties, Old City, and Center City. There is a variance for 12th and Walnut Streets. It is up to a permit winner to arrange with the building owner to open at one of those sites.
All applicants were required to pay $5,000 to apply for a dispensary permit. The companies also had to post a $30,000 deposit — refundable only to failed bidders — for each storefront. Each of the winners’ three shops is required to be in a different county.
Dispensaries will operate like pharmacies that sell only one product: medicinal cannabis oils, which can be vaporized or consumed in a solution. They will be forbidden to sell whole-plant, flower, or edible products. Each permit, according to industry experts, is worth $10 million to $20 million, depending on the location and the number of customers each serves.



 

The dispensaries will be the only point where patients will encounter medical marijuana. To get it, they will be required to see a doctor who is certified and registered with the state Department of Health. The doctor will write a letter stating that the patient suffers from one or more of 17 qualifying conditions. It is up to the patient to submit the letter to the state and receive an ID card. Only card holders will be allowed to enter, and they will be able to buy medical cannabis from any dispensary in the state.
In Southeastern Pennsylvania, dispensaries are slated for Abington, Bensalem, Bristol, Devon, Elkins Park, Fort Washington, King of Prussia, Phoenixville, Plymouth Meeting, Philadelphia (4), Sellersville, Upper Darby, West Norriton,  and Yeadon,
Last week, the state announced the winners of 12 permits to grow legal cannabis in the state and process it into medicine.
Though industry experts have called the Health Department’s efforts cautious and fair, many losing applicants have called the process opaque and biased. They have until Friday to file appeals. Several have threatened lawsuits. Litigation filed by failed applicants in Maryland and Florida has stalled the introduction of medical marijuana programs in those states for years.



 

The Health Department on Wednesday said it remained on track to provide cannabis oil to patients in 2018.

Medical Marijuana Dispensaries in Pennsylvania

Pennsylvania’s Department of Health on Thursday awarded 27 companies licenses to open medical-marijuana dispensaries. The companies can operate three storefronts, and 52 are scheduled to open next year. Four dispensaries were awarded licenses in Philadelphia and 20 in the Southeastern region, one of the six medical-marijuana regions established by the state.

 Medical marijuana dispensaries are coming to Greensburg, Squirrel Hill and Oakland among other places in Pennsylvania, the state department of health announced Thursday. 
 The department released the names of 27 statewide medical marijuana dispensaries, which include two in Allegheny County and one in Westmoreland. 
 Each of the 27 dispensary permit holders is eligible to open three locations, the state said in a news release. Some have opted not to have additional locations, which will bring the total up to 52. 
 In Allegheny County, both primary dispensary locations are in Pittsburgh: Keystone Relief Centers LLC lists a Squirrel Hill address and Maitri Medicinals LLC lists an Oakland address. 
 The Westmoreland County dispensary, Keystone Integrated Care LLC, lists a Greensburg address of 303 East Pittsburgh Street.   
 Keystone Integrated lists a secondary location in Lawrenceville and a third location in Cranberry. 
 Maitri lists a secondary location in Uniontown. 
 Keystone Relief lists a secondary location in Zelienople.  
 Allegheny County's first county executive, Jim Roddey, and Nicholas Geanopulos, owner of Nicky's restaurant on Grant Street, were listed on a November SEC filing for Keystone Relief Centers LLC. Its CEO, Mary Del Brady, said both are still involved and Roddey is a co-founder. 
 "It feels really good to get this news," Brady told the Tribune-Review. "But we have to get going." 
  Each approved dispensary is allowed two secondary locations. The locations cannot be in the same county as the main dispensary but they must remain in the same state-designated geographical region as the primary dispensary.  
  "This has been a highly competitive process, and the department received hundreds of quality applications," said John Collins, director of the Office of Medical Marijuana. "Once this program is fully operational, patients with serious medical conditions will have locations throughout the commonwealth where they can purchase medication to help in their treatment. We remain on track to provide medication to patients in 2018." 
 Keystone Relief's Squirrel Hill location, at 3885 Forward Ave., is a vacant building near the Greenfield border. Pittsburgh City Councilman Corey O'Connor, who represents the district housing the site, said Keystone Relief should make a good community neighbor. 
 Part of its exterior design includes adding a walking trail that would connect Squirrel Hill to Greenfield, O'Connor said. 
 "Medical marijuana is something that is legal in the state, and I support it," O'Connor said. "They met with community groups and worked through all the questions people have. I understand that not everybody is going to be in favor of this." 
 O'Connor said Keystone Relief has promised to be safe and secure. 
 "They'll be getting people needed relief for their health issues, and I think that is really important," he said. 
 Brady said 10 small investor groups include doctors, pharmacists, researchers and people from the nursing field. She anticipated 10 to 12 jobs at the Squirrel Hill location and fewer in Zelienople.  
 "We took the time to make sure the neighborhood understands who ware are and what we are doing and that we want to be a part of the community and its story," she said. "We plan to bring relief to the many chronic diseases that medical marijuana can help ease." 
 Last week, the   state announced permits Tuesday to 12 companies   that applied to grow and process medical marijuana. 
  The   state will not set prices for soon-to-be unveiled dispensaries,   but it has the right to cap pricing. 
  Under state law, patients can apply for a state-issued medical marijuana card if a doctor certifies they have one of 17 qualified medical conditions, including epilepsy, cancer, multiple sclerosis and seizure disorders. 
 Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf signed a medical marijuana bill into law in April 2016. 
 Medical marijuana in Pennsylvania will be available in pills, oils, tinctures and ointments. The health department is regulating the program, which forbids smoking marijuana in dry leaf form. 
 The state Office of Medical Marijuana received 457 applications — 177 for growers and processors and 280 for dispensaries.

Published: Jun 29, 2017, 3:20 pm • Updated: Jul 18, 2017, 1:38 pm  By Mark Scolforo,  The Associated Press HARRISBURG, Pa. — State regulators on Thursday announced the 27 entities that have been selected to operate medical marijuana dispensaries under Pennsylvania’s program, expected to be up and running next year.
The Health Department said not all of them are currently opting to run three locations, so for now there will be 52 dispensaries scattered around the state.
Pennsylvania medical marijuana dispensary locations (Pennsylvania Department of Health)
The agency posted online the winners’ applications and the locations where they will operate.
Office of Medical Marijuana director John Collins said the process was competitive, with hundreds of quality applicants.
The entities that were issued permits will have six months to become operational and can begin providing the drug to patients.

A Health Department spokeswoman said they will start to implement the business plans they outlined in their applications, addressing aspects of operations such as security, transportation and employee background checks.
The state government will conduct inspections.
Last week, the state awarded permits to 12 applicants to grow and process medical marijuana.
The Pennsylvania medical marijuana law allows people who suffer from a list of conditions to obtain the drug as pills, vapor, ointment or liquid, but not in smokeable form.
The state expects patients and caregivers to be able to register in September.
All but six of the businesses are based in Pennsylvania. Two are from Arizona, three from Illinois, and one from New York.

State Health Department grants 27 medical marijuana dispensary permits

 of 










































HARRISBURG, Pa. - The Pennsylvania Department of Health announced Thursday it has granted 27 dispensary permits for medical marijuana.
The permit recipients will have six months to prepare their operations before they can begin dispensing medical marijuana, the department said.
There will be a total of 52 dispensaries located throughout the commonwealth. Each of the 27 dispensary permit holders is eligible to open a total of three locations, though some have opted not to open all eligible locations.

In southwestern Pennsylvania, permits were issued to the following businesses:


		Maitri Medicinals LCC (Allegheny County)

		Keystone Relief Centers LLC (Allegheny County)

		Cresco Yeltrah LLC (Butler County)

		The Healing Center LLC (Washington County)

		Keystone Integrated Care LLC (Westmoreland County)

Keystone Relief Centers LLC is slated to open on Forward Avenue in Squirrel Hill, near the Squirrel Hill Tunnel. The group also plans to open another location in Zelienople. 
"Think of us as a highly specialized pharmacy," said Mary DelBrady, of Keystone Relief Centers. "We're dealing with pills, creams, and when you walk in here, it's going to look like a pharmacy." 
The groups have six months to renovate and become operational. Then they will have to pass an inspection before they can start providing the drug to patients, something the Health Department hopes will begin next year. 
DelBrady said there are a number of security measures the groups are required by the state to meet. 
RELATED: New medical marijuana dispensaries will have strict security
"We have security systems that we are required to put in place, but that we will very seriously put in place. And we're very serious in terms of who the investors are that want to see this happen," she said. 
Pittsburgh City Councilman Corey O'Connor said the company is a good fit for the location, which has been vacant for years. 
"They're going to (have) their own private security, and then when the product is dropped off, as well as when the money is taken out, there will be two armed guards through that process. It's all going to be protected in the garage with a safe and it is going to be locked. There's going to be security cameras all around," O Connor said.

PoliticsPennsylvania Grants 27 Medical Marijuana Dispensary PermitsGage PeakeJune 30, 2017(Pgiam/iStock)Pennsylvania’s Department of Health announced the winners of 27 medical cannabis dispensary permits on Thursday. The licensees now have six months to become fully operational, with medical marijuana sales expected to begin in the state sometime next year.

“This has been a highly competitive process and the department received hundreds of quality applications,” John Collins, director of the state’s Office of Medical Marijuana, said in a statement. “Once this program is fully operational, patients with serious medical conditions will have locations throughout the commonwealth where they can purchase medication to help in their treatment. We remain on track to provide medication to patients in 2018.”
The state received 280 applications for dispensary licenses, which then were scored by a panel of subject-area experts. Companies that applied to get a dispensary license could apply for one main facility and up to two satellite dispensaries.
Those in the Philadelphia area will initially have three dispensaries to choose from, although PhillyVoice reports that eventually a fourth will open, to be operated by Montgomery County permit holder TerraVida Holistic Centers.
In addition to the 27 dispensary permits, the state granted 12 grower licenses and selected MJ Freeway to implement the state’s electronic seed-to-sale tracking system.

Pennsylvania’s Medical Marijuana Act became effective on May 17, 2016, but has run into a number of delays. The program is expected to be fully up and running in early 2018.
