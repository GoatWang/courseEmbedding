CapRocq Core Marketing Disclaimer

This Presentation (the “Presentation”) has been prepared solely for informational purposes by CapRocq Core REIT, Inc (“CapRocq”) and is being furnished through Boustead Securities, LLC (“Boustead Securities”) solely for use by prospective investors and other third parties in connection with their consideration of an investment in CapRocq. This presentation is not, and should not be assumed to be, complete. This presentation has been prepared to assist interested parties in making an evaluation of CapRocq and does not purport to contain all of the information that may be relevant. In all cases, interested parties should conduct their own investigation and analysis of CapRocq and the data set forth in this presentation and other information provided by or on behalf of CapRocq. In addition, certain of the information contained herein may be derived from information provided by industry sources. CapRocq believes that such information is accurate and that the sources from which it has been obtained are reliable. CapRocq cannot guarantee the accuracy of such information, however, and has not independently verified such information. The information presented herein remains subject to change. Statements in this presentation are made as of the date of this presentation unless stated otherwise.
This presentation also contains statements that, to the extent they are not recitations of historical fact, constitute “forward-looking statements.” Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of terms such as “may,” “should,” “expect,” “could,” “intend,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “continue,” “predict,” and/or “potential.” The forward-looking statements included herein are based upon CapRocq’s current expectations, plans, estimates, assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond CapRocq’s control. Although CapRocq believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, CapRocq’s actual results and performance and the value of its securities could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements due to the impact of many factors including, but not limited to, risks and uncertainties detailed in the “Risk Factors” in the Risk Factors section of CapRocq’s Final Offering Circular on Form 253G2 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, dated March 17, 2017, and other discussions of risk factors contained in CapRocq’s periodic filings or supplements to the offering circular. CapRocq claims the safe harbor protection for forward looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. CapRocq undertakes no obligation to update or revise any such information for any reason after the date of this presentation, unless required by law.
In addition, in considering any prior performance information, prospective investors should bear in mind that past results are not necessarily indicative of future results, and there can be no assurance that results comparable to those discussed herein will be achieved. This presentation is not an Offering Circular for CapRocq. Investors must review the Offering Circular for CapRocq and sign a subscription agreement attesting that they reviewed the Offering Circular before making an investment in CapRocq.




CapRocq Core Risk Factors

Prospective  investors should be aware that an investment in shares of the Company's common  stock involves a high, and sometimes speculative, degree  of risk, and is suitable only for persons or entities that are able to evaluate  the risks of the investment. An investment in  our shares should be made only by persons or entities able to bear the risk of  and to withstand the total loss of their investment. Prospective investors  should carefully read this offering circular prior to making a decision to  purchase shares. 
It is impossible  to accurately predict the results to an investor from an investment in shares  of the Company's common stock because of  general risks associated with the ownership and operation of real estate, the  risks associated with the types of properties the Company intends to acquire,  and certain tax risks, among other risks. These risks may be exacerbated by the  additional risks associated with the specific properties that the Company  acquires and the ownership structure of the Investment. Such specific risks  include, but are not limited to, high vacancy rates, tenants in possession but  not paying rent, tenants paying rent but who have "gone dark," properties that  need substantial capital improvements and/or repositioning in their local  markets, properties that are not generating income, and risks relating to joint  venture and co-investor structures. In addition, prospective investors must  rely solely upon the Advisor to identify Investment opportunities and to  negotiate any debt financing. Prospective investors who are unwilling to rely  solely on the Advisor should not invest in our shares. 
Each prospective  investor should consider carefully the risk involved in this offering, and  should consult with his own legal, tax, and financial advisors with respect  thereto prior to investing in shares of the Company's common stock. Examples of  a few risks in this offering are the following:
• Upon raising the minimum  offering amount, we will only own one Investment
• Our Advisor may not be  successful in identifying and consummating suitable investment opportunities.
• Investments in real  estate-related assets can be speculative.
• Adverse economic  conditions may negatively affect our results of operations and, as a result,  our ability to make distributions to our stockholders or to realize  appreciation in the value of our Investments.
• REIT distribution  requirements could adversely affect our liquidity.
• We may have conflicts of  interest with our Advisor and other affiliates, which could result in investment  decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders.
• We have used and may  continue to use mortgage and other debt financing to acquire properties or  interests in properties and otherwise incur other indebtedness, which increases  our expenses and could subject us to the risk of losing properties in  foreclosure if our cash flow is insufficient to make loan payments.
• A limit on the percentage  of our securities a person may own may discourage a takeover or business  combination, which could prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium  price for their stock.
• The price of our common  stock may fluctuate significantly.
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for CapRocq Core REIT, Inc.'s Common Stock, therefore our  Company cannot predict the extent to which an active market for its Common  Stock will develop or be sustained after this offering, or how the development  of such a market might affect the market price of its common stock. For a  complete discussion of risks, please refer to the Form 1-A. A Form 1-A offering  circular relating to these securities has been qualified by the Securities and  Exchange Commission. You may obtain a copy of the final offering circular here: https://www.theasmx.com/investment/caprocqcorereit The Form-1-A contains  forward-looking statements reflecting current expectations that involve risks  and uncertainties. These forward looking statements include statements  regarding commercialization plans, projected timelines, etc. Actual results and  the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these  forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those  discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in the  offering circular. This document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the  solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these  securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or  sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the  securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. No money or other  consideration is being solicited in connection with this document, and if sent  in response, will not be accepted. Any person's indication of interest involves  no obligation or commitment of any kind.

Stocosil Risk Factors

Investing in our Common Stock involves a high degree of risk. Some examples of certain risks that you should consider in connection with an investment in our Common Stock are the following:
•	We are a development-stage company subject to all of the risks and uncertainties of a new business, including the risk that we may never develop, complete development or market any of our products or generate product related revenues.

•	We are heavily dependent on the success of ST-101, ST-102 and ST-103, and we cannot give assurance that our products will receive regulatory approval, which is necessary before the products can be commercialized.
•	Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights will be critically important to the success of our business, and we may not be able to protect these rights in the U.S. or abroad.

•	Teraphysics is a development stage company and has commenced limited operations in our business, making our prospects for revenues, profitability and growth highly uncertain.
•	Our core mmw source device technology is still in the early stages of development and its technical and commercial feasibility and viability is unproven and uncertain.

•	Market acceptance of the mmw technology and products based thereon is uncertain.

CapRocq Core Risk Factors

Prospective  investors should be aware that an investment in shares of the Company's common  stock involves a high, and sometimes speculative, degree  of risk, and is suitable only for persons or entities that are able to evaluate  the risks of the investment. An investment in  our shares should be made only by persons or entities able to bear the risk of  and to withstand the total loss of their investment. Prospective investors  should carefully read this offering circular prior to making a decision to  purchase shares. 
It is impossible  to accurately predict the results to an investor from an investment in shares  of the Company's common stock because of  general risks associated with the ownership and operation of real estate, the  risks associated with the types of properties the Company intends to acquire,  and certain tax risks, among other risks. These risks may be exacerbated by the  additional risks associated with the specific properties that the Company  acquires and the ownership structure of the Investment. Such specific risks  include, but are not limited to, high vacancy rates, tenants in possession but  not paying rent, tenants paying rent but who have "gone dark," properties that  need substantial capital improvements and/or repositioning in their local  markets, properties that are not generating income, and risks relating to joint  venture and co-investor structures. In addition, prospective investors must  rely solely upon the Advisor to identify Investment opportunities and to  negotiate any debt financing. Prospective investors who are unwilling to rely  solely on the Advisor should not invest in our shares. 
Each prospective  investor should consider carefully the risk involved in this offering, and  should consult with his own legal, tax, and financial advisors with respect  thereto prior to investing in shares of the Company's common stock. Examples of  a few risks in this offering are the following:
• Upon raising the minimum  offering amount, we will only own one Investment
• Our Advisor may not be  successful in identifying and consummating suitable investment opportunities.
• Investments in real  estate-related assets can be speculative.
• Adverse economic  conditions may negatively affect our results of operations and, as a result,  our ability to make distributions to our stockholders or to realize  appreciation in the value of our Investments.
• REIT distribution  requirements could adversely affect our liquidity.
• We may have conflicts of  interest with our Advisor and other affiliates, which could result in investment  decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders.
• We have used and may  continue to use mortgage and other debt financing to acquire properties or  interests in properties and otherwise incur other indebtedness, which increases  our expenses and could subject us to the risk of losing properties in  foreclosure if our cash flow is insufficient to make loan payments.
• A limit on the percentage  of our securities a person may own may discourage a takeover or business  combination, which could prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium  price for their stock.
• The price of our common  stock may fluctuate significantly.
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for CapRocq Core REIT, Inc.'s Common Stock, therefore our  Company cannot predict the extent to which an active market for its Common  Stock will develop or be sustained after this offering, or how the development  of such a market might affect the market price of its common stock.

You may obtain a copy of the final offering circular here: https://www.theasmx.com/investment/caprocqcorereit The Form-1-A contains  forward-looking statements reflecting current expectations that involve risks  and uncertainties.

Stocosil Risk Factors

Investing in our Common Stock involves a high degree of risk. Some examples of certain risks that you should consider in connection with an investment in our Common Stock are the following:
•	We are a development-stage company subject to all of the risks and uncertainties of a new business, including the risk that we may never develop, complete development or market any of our products or generate product related revenues.
•	We do not have any products that are approved for commercial sale and therefore do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales in the foreseeable future, if ever.
•	We are heavily dependent on the success of ST-101, ST-102 and ST-103, and we cannot give assurance that our products will receive regulatory approval, which is necessary before the products can be commercialized.
•	Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights will be critically important to the success of our business, and we may not be able to protect these rights in the U.S. or abroad.
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for Stocosil’s Common Stock, therefore our company cannot predict the extent to which an active market for its Common Stock will develop or be sustained after this offering, or how the development of such a market might affect the market price of its common stock.

This document contains forward-looking statements reflecting current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. These forward looking statements include statements regarding commercialization plans, projected timelines, etc. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in the offering circular. This document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.

Issuer
Federal securities law requires securities sold  in the United States to be registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange  Commission ("SEC"), unless the sale qualifies for an exemption. The  securities offered on the Site for U.S. investments have not been registered  under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), in  reliance on the exemption promulgated under Regulation A, as amended by Title  IV of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, known as "Reg A+". In a  Reg A+ offering, Issuers may advertise or market their offerings via "testing  the waters" communications to the general public, or pay third parties to do  so, subject to certain conditions. Federal law requires that Issuers sell  securities to Accredited Investors or Qualified Purchasers who represent they  satisfy the investment status before accepting subscriptions, among other  requirements. Users, whether Accredited Investors or Qualified Purchasers,  agree to cooperate with any requests for additional information or  documentation.
Each Issuer is solely responsible for ensuring  that its securities offering, including without limitation the use of the Site  to offer and sell securities, the determination of whether an investor is an  Accredited Investor and whether any investment complies with applicable state  and Federal securities laws, rules and regulations. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, each Issuer is responsible for ensuring that any information it  posts on the Site is complete, accurate and not otherwise misleading. Users of  the Site acknowledge that ASMX is not liable to and will not verify or  investigate the accuracy and completeness of the offering material and other  information posted on the Site. Users understand, acknowledge and agree that  other parties are relying on the statements made herein and that any willfully  false statement is sufficient cause for removal from the Site, rejection of  eligible investor status, along with other legal causes of action. All Issuers  utilizing the Platform hereby agree that they (and not the Site) are  responsible for determining and verifying whether a User is an Accredited  Investor or Qualified Purchaser prior to accepting subscriptions. You are  strongly encouraged to contact each Issuer directly to discuss any questions  regarding an offering or the business prospects of the Issuer. All subscription  funds are held by an escrow agent pending completion or termination of an  offering. The use of escrow services is subject to their terms of use and  privacy policy. ASMX shall have the right but not the obligation to  remove, cancel or reject the posting of any securities offerings. Failure to  remove, cancel or reject securities offerings suspected of violating the  securities laws does not constitute an endorsement or approval of said  securities offerings by ASMX. The information provided herein shall not be  deemed legal advice. You should obtain advice of your own counsel before  proceeding with any investments.
No Disqualifying Events
Each Issuer warrants and represents that none of  its predecessors, any affiliated issuer, any director, executive officer, other  officer of the Issuer participating in the Offering, any investment managers and  their principals, any beneficial owner of 20% or more of the Issuer's  outstanding voting equity securities, calculated on the basis of voting power,  any promoter (as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act) connected with the  Issuer in any capacity at the time of sale nor any compensated solicitor or any  director, executive officer, other officer of the compensated solicitor  participating in the Offering (each, an "Issuer Covered Person" and  collectively, "Issuer Covered Persons") is subject to any of the "Bad Actor"  disqualifying events described in Rule 262 under the Securities Act (a  "Disqualifying Event"). Each Issuer warrants and represents that it has  exercised reasonable care to determine whether any Issuer Covered Person is  subject to a Disqualifying Event and will promptly notify subscribed investors  in writing should any Disqualifying Events occur or prior Disqualifying Events  come to the Issuer's notice despite its reasonable efforts to discover and  immediately consult their legal counsel.
Securities Products
ASMX is not a registered broker-dealer or funding portal, and does not  offer investment advice. ASMX does not recommend or otherwise suggest that any  investor make an investment in any offerings on the Site.
The securities offered on the Site are only  suitable for prospective investors who are familiar with and willing to accept  the high risks associated with private investments, including the risk of  complete loss of your investment. Securities sold through private placements  are not publicly traded and, therefore, are illiquid unless registered with the  SEC. Securities will be subject to restrictions on resale or transfer including  holding period requirements. Investing in private placements requires high risk  tolerance, low liquidity need, and long-term commitments. Users must be able to  afford to lose their entire investment. Investment products are not FDIC  insured, may lose value, and there is no bank guarantee.
User Conduct Guidelines
You represent and warrant that all information  that you provide to ASMX or through the Site is accurate, complete and  truthful. 
The Site permits Users to independently connect  with Issuers and subscribe in securities offerings. However, you are expressly  prohibited from doing the following acts: (a) using the Site, or any services  and or tools if you are temporarily, or indefinitely, suspended from using the  Site, services or any tools; (b) collecting personal information about other  Users; (c) interfering with other Users' listings; or (d) posting false,  inaccurate, misleading, defamatory, or libelous content on the Site. We reserve  the right to terminate or limit your access to the Site and/or the licenses  granted herein for any reason and in our sole discretion. You agree not to  modify, damage, disrupt, disable, or interfere with the functionality of the  site, or the security of the site and/or its users.
Posting illegal, profane, or illicit content on the Site is  prohibited, and ASMX will fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities  or court order requesting or directing ASMX to disclose the identity of anyone  posting any such information or materials on the Site.

CapRocq Core Marketing Disclaimer

This Presentation (the “Presentation”) has been prepared solely for informational purposes by CapRocq Core REIT, Inc (“CapRocq”) and is being furnished through Boustead Securities, LLC (“Boustead Securities”) solely for use by prospective investors and other third parties in connection with their consideration of an investment in CapRocq. This presentation is not, and should not be assumed to be, complete. This presentation has been prepared to assist interested parties in making an evaluation of CapRocq and does not purport to contain all of the information that may be relevant. In all cases, interested parties should conduct their own investigation and analysis of CapRocq and the data set forth in this presentation and other information provided by or on behalf of CapRocq. In addition, certain of the information contained herein may be derived from information provided by industry sources. CapRocq believes that such information is accurate and that the sources from which it has been obtained are reliable. CapRocq cannot guarantee the accuracy of such information, however, and has not independently verified such information. The information presented herein remains subject to change. Statements in this presentation are made as of the date of this presentation unless stated otherwise.
This presentation also contains statements that, to the extent they are not recitations of historical fact, constitute “forward-looking statements.” Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of terms such as “may,” “should,” “expect,” “could,” “intend,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “continue,” “predict,” and/or “potential.” The forward-looking statements included herein are based upon CapRocq’s current expectations, plans, estimates, assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond CapRocq’s control. Although CapRocq believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, CapRocq’s actual results and performance and the value of its securities could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements due to the impact of many factors including, but not limited to, risks and uncertainties detailed in the “Risk Factors” in the Risk Factors section of CapRocq’s Final Offering Circular on Form 253G2 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, dated March 17, 2017, and other discussions of risk factors contained in CapRocq’s periodic filings or supplements to the offering circular. CapRocq claims the safe harbor protection for forward looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. CapRocq undertakes no obligation to update or revise any such information for any reason after the date of this presentation, unless required by law.
In addition, in considering any prior performance information, prospective investors should bear in mind that past results are not necessarily indicative of future results, and there can be no assurance that results comparable to those discussed herein will be achieved. This presentation is not an Offering Circular for CapRocq. Investors must review the Offering Circular for CapRocq and sign a subscription agreement attesting that they reviewed the Offering Circular before making an investment in CapRocq.




CapRocq Core Risk Factors

Prospective  investors should be aware that an investment in shares of the Company's common  stock involves a high, and sometimes speculative, degree  of risk, and is suitable only for persons or entities that are able to evaluate  the risks of the investment. An investment in  our shares should be made only by persons or entities able to bear the risk of  and to withstand the total loss of their investment. Prospective investors  should carefully read this offering circular prior to making a decision to  purchase shares. 
It is impossible  to accurately predict the results to an investor from an investment in shares  of the Company's common stock because of  general risks associated with the ownership and operation of real estate, the  risks associated with the types of properties the Company intends to acquire,  and certain tax risks, among other risks. These risks may be exacerbated by the  additional risks associated with the specific properties that the Company  acquires and the ownership structure of the Investment. Such specific risks  include, but are not limited to, high vacancy rates, tenants in possession but  not paying rent, tenants paying rent but who have "gone dark," properties that  need substantial capital improvements and/or repositioning in their local  markets, properties that are not generating income, and risks relating to joint  venture and co-investor structures. In addition, prospective investors must  rely solely upon the Advisor to identify Investment opportunities and to  negotiate any debt financing. Prospective investors who are unwilling to rely  solely on the Advisor should not invest in our shares. 
Each prospective  investor should consider carefully the risk involved in this offering, and  should consult with his own legal, tax, and financial advisors with respect  thereto prior to investing in shares of the Company's common stock. Examples of  a few risks in this offering are the following:
• Upon raising the minimum  offering amount, we will only own one Investment
• Our Advisor may not be  successful in identifying and consummating suitable investment opportunities.
• Investments in real  estate-related assets can be speculative.
• Adverse economic  conditions may negatively affect our results of operations and, as a result,  our ability to make distributions to our stockholders or to realize  appreciation in the value of our Investments.
• REIT distribution  requirements could adversely affect our liquidity.
• We may have conflicts of  interest with our Advisor and other affiliates, which could result in investment  decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders.
• We have used and may  continue to use mortgage and other debt financing to acquire properties or  interests in properties and otherwise incur other indebtedness, which increases  our expenses and could subject us to the risk of losing properties in  foreclosure if our cash flow is insufficient to make loan payments.
• A limit on the percentage  of our securities a person may own may discourage a takeover or business  combination, which could prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium  price for their stock.
• The price of our common  stock may fluctuate significantly.
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for CapRocq Core REIT, Inc.'s Common Stock, therefore our  Company cannot predict the extent to which an active market for its Common  Stock will develop or be sustained after this offering, or how the development  of such a market might affect the market price of its common stock. For a  complete discussion of risks, please refer to the Form 1-A. A Form 1-A offering  circular relating to these securities has been qualified by the Securities and  Exchange Commission. You may obtain a copy of the final offering circular here: https://www.theasmx.com/investment/caprocqcorereit The Form-1-A contains  forward-looking statements reflecting current expectations that involve risks  and uncertainties. These forward looking statements include statements  regarding commercialization plans, projected timelines, etc. Actual results and  the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these  forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those  discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in the  offering circular. This document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the  solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these  securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or  sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the  securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. No money or other  consideration is being solicited in connection with this document, and if sent  in response, will not be accepted. Any person's indication of interest involves  no obligation or commitment of any kind.

CapRocq Core Marketing Disclaimer

This Presentation (the “Presentation”) has been prepared solely for informational purposes by CapRocq Core REIT, Inc (“CapRocq”) and is being furnished through Boustead Securities, LLC (“Boustead Securities”) solely for use by prospective investors and other third parties in connection with their consideration of an investment in CapRocq. This presentation is not, and should not be assumed to be, complete. This presentation has been prepared to assist interested parties in making an evaluation of CapRocq and does not purport to contain all of the information that may be relevant. In all cases, interested parties should conduct their own investigation and analysis of CapRocq and the data set forth in this presentation and other information provided by or on behalf of CapRocq. In addition, certain of the information contained herein may be derived from information provided by industry sources. CapRocq believes that such information is accurate and that the sources from which it has been obtained are reliable. CapRocq cannot guarantee the accuracy of such information, however, and has not independently verified such information. The information presented herein remains subject to change. Statements in this presentation are made as of the date of this presentation unless stated otherwise.
This presentation also contains statements that, to the extent they are not recitations of historical fact, constitute “forward-looking statements.” Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of terms such as “may,” “should,” “expect,” “could,” “intend,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “continue,” “predict,” and/or “potential.” The forward-looking statements included herein are based upon CapRocq’s current expectations, plans, estimates, assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond CapRocq’s control. Although CapRocq believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, CapRocq’s actual results and performance and the value of its securities could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements due to the impact of many factors including, but not limited to, risks and uncertainties detailed in the “Risk Factors” in the Risk Factors section of CapRocq’s Final Offering Circular on Form 253G2 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, dated March 17, 2017, and other discussions of risk factors contained in CapRocq’s periodic filings or supplements to the offering circular. CapRocq claims the safe harbor protection for forward looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. CapRocq undertakes no obligation to update or revise any such information for any reason after the date of this presentation, unless required by law.
In addition, in considering any prior performance information, prospective investors should bear in mind that past results are not necessarily indicative of future results, and there can be no assurance that results comparable to those discussed herein will be achieved. This presentation is not an Offering Circular for CapRocq. Investors must review the Offering Circular for CapRocq and sign a subscription agreement attesting that they reviewed the Offering Circular before making an investment in CapRocq.




CapRocq Core Risk Factors

Prospective  investors should be aware that an investment in shares of the Company's common  stock involves a high, and sometimes speculative, degree  of risk, and is suitable only for persons or entities that are able to evaluate  the risks of the investment. An investment in  our shares should be made only by persons or entities able to bear the risk of  and to withstand the total loss of their investment. Prospective investors  should carefully read this offering circular prior to making a decision to  purchase shares. 
It is impossible  to accurately predict the results to an investor from an investment in shares  of the Company's common stock because of  general risks associated with the ownership and operation of real estate, the  risks associated with the types of properties the Company intends to acquire,  and certain tax risks, among other risks. These risks may be exacerbated by the  additional risks associated with the specific properties that the Company  acquires and the ownership structure of the Investment. Such specific risks  include, but are not limited to, high vacancy rates, tenants in possession but  not paying rent, tenants paying rent but who have "gone dark," properties that  need substantial capital improvements and/or repositioning in their local  markets, properties that are not generating income, and risks relating to joint  venture and co-investor structures. In addition, prospective investors must  rely solely upon the Advisor to identify Investment opportunities and to  negotiate any debt financing. Prospective investors who are unwilling to rely  solely on the Advisor should not invest in our shares. 
Each prospective  investor should consider carefully the risk involved in this offering, and  should consult with his own legal, tax, and financial advisors with respect  thereto prior to investing in shares of the Company's common stock. Examples of  a few risks in this offering are the following:
• Upon raising the minimum  offering amount, we will only own one Investment
• Our Advisor may not be  successful in identifying and consummating suitable investment opportunities.
• Investments in real  estate-related assets can be speculative.
• Adverse economic  conditions may negatively affect our results of operations and, as a result,  our ability to make distributions to our stockholders or to realize  appreciation in the value of our Investments.
• REIT distribution  requirements could adversely affect our liquidity.
• We may have conflicts of  interest with our Advisor and other affiliates, which could result in investment  decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders.
• We have used and may  continue to use mortgage and other debt financing to acquire properties or  interests in properties and otherwise incur other indebtedness, which increases  our expenses and could subject us to the risk of losing properties in  foreclosure if our cash flow is insufficient to make loan payments.
• A limit on the percentage  of our securities a person may own may discourage a takeover or business  combination, which could prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium  price for their stock.
• The price of our common  stock may fluctuate significantly.
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for CapRocq Core REIT, Inc.'s Common Stock, therefore our  Company cannot predict the extent to which an active market for its Common  Stock will develop or be sustained after this offering, or how the development  of such a market might affect the market price of its common stock. For a  complete discussion of risks, please refer to the Form 1-A. A Form 1-A offering  circular relating to these securities has been qualified by the Securities and  Exchange Commission. You may obtain a copy of the final offering circular here: https://www.theasmx.com/investment/caprocqcorereit The Form-1-A contains  forward-looking statements reflecting current expectations that involve risks  and uncertainties. These forward looking statements include statements  regarding commercialization plans, projected timelines, etc. Actual results and  the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these  forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those  discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in the  offering circular. This document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the  solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these  securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or  sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the  securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. No money or other  consideration is being solicited in connection with this document, and if sent  in response, will not be accepted. Any person's indication of interest involves  no obligation or commitment of any kind.

CapRocq Core Risk Factors

Prospective  investors should be aware that an investment in shares of the Company's common  stock involves a high, and sometimes speculative, degree  of risk, and is suitable only for persons or entities that are able to evaluate  the risks of the investment. An investment in  our shares should be made only by persons or entities able to bear the risk of  and to withstand the total loss of their investment. Prospective investors  should carefully read this offering circular prior to making a decision to  purchase shares. 
It is impossible  to accurately predict the results to an investor from an investment in shares  of the Company's common stock because of  general risks associated with the ownership and operation of real estate, the  risks associated with the types of properties the Company intends to acquire,  and certain tax risks, among other risks. These risks may be exacerbated by the  additional risks associated with the specific properties that the Company  acquires and the ownership structure of the Investment. Such specific risks  include, but are not limited to, high vacancy rates, tenants in possession but  not paying rent, tenants paying rent but who have "gone dark," properties that  need substantial capital improvements and/or repositioning in their local  markets, properties that are not generating income, and risks relating to joint  venture and co-investor structures. In addition, prospective investors must  rely solely upon the Advisor to identify Investment opportunities and to  negotiate any debt financing. Prospective investors who are unwilling to rely  solely on the Advisor should not invest in our shares. 
Each prospective  investor should consider carefully the risk involved in this offering, and  should consult with his own legal, tax, and financial advisors with respect  thereto prior to investing in shares of the Company's common stock. Examples of  a few risks in this offering are the following:
• Upon raising the minimum  offering amount, we will only own one Investment
• Our Advisor may not be  successful in identifying and consummating suitable investment opportunities.
• Investments in real  estate-related assets can be speculative.
• Adverse economic  conditions may negatively affect our results of operations and, as a result,  our ability to make distributions to our stockholders or to realize  appreciation in the value of our Investments.
• REIT distribution  requirements could adversely affect our liquidity.
• We may have conflicts of  interest with our Advisor and other affiliates, which could result in investment  decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders.
• We have used and may  continue to use mortgage and other debt financing to acquire properties or  interests in properties and otherwise incur other indebtedness, which increases  our expenses and could subject us to the risk of losing properties in  foreclosure if our cash flow is insufficient to make loan payments.
• A limit on the percentage  of our securities a person may own may discourage a takeover or business  combination, which could prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium  price for their stock.
• The price of our common  stock may fluctuate significantly.
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for CapRocq Core REIT, Inc.'s Common Stock, therefore our  Company cannot predict the extent to which an active market for its Common  Stock will develop or be sustained after this offering, or how the development  of such a market might affect the market price of its common stock.

You may obtain a copy of the final offering circular here: https://www.theasmx.com/investment/caprocqcorereit The Form-1-A contains  forward-looking statements reflecting current expectations that involve risks  and uncertainties. These forward looking statements include statements  regarding commercialization plans, projected timelines, etc. Actual results and  the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these  forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those  discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in the  offering circular. This document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the  solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these  securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or  sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the  securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.

Although Stocosil believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Stocosil’s actual results and performance and the value of its securities could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements due to the impact of many factors including, but not limited to, risks and uncertainties detailed in the “Risk Factors” in the Risk Factors section of Stocosil’s Offering Circular on Form 1-A, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other discussions of risk factors contained in Stocosil’s periodic filings or supplements to the offering circular. Stocosil Offering Circular on Form 1-A can be found at https://www.theasmx.com/investment/stocosil. Stocosil claims the safe harbor protection for forward looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Stocosil undertakes no obligation to update or revise any such information for any reason after the date of this presentation, unless required by law.
Investment in Stocosil’s securities involves significant risks. You should purchase these securities only if you can afford a complete loss of your investment.




Stocosil Risk Factors

Investing in our Common Stock involves a high degree of risk. Some examples of certain risks that you should consider in connection with an investment in our Common Stock are the following:
•	We are a development-stage company subject to all of the risks and uncertainties of a new business, including the risk that we may never develop, complete development or market any of our products or generate product related revenues.
•	We do not have any products that are approved for commercial sale and therefore do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales in the foreseeable future, if ever.
•	We are heavily dependent on the success of ST-101, ST-102 and ST-103, and we cannot give assurance that our products will receive regulatory approval, which is necessary before the products can be commercialized.
•	Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights will be critically important to the success of our business, and we may not be able to protect these rights in the U.S. or abroad.
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for Stocosil’s Common Stock, therefore our company cannot predict the extent to which an active market for its Common Stock will develop or be sustained after this offering, or how the development of such a market might affect the market price of its common stock. Investors in this offering will experience immediate and substantial dilution and market price of our company’s common stock may fluctuate. For a complete discussion of risks, please refer to the Form 1-A. The offering is being made only by means of an offering circular. An offering statement on Form 1-A relating to these securities has been qualified by the Securities and Exchange Commission. You may obtain a copy of our final offering circular here: https://www.theasmx.com/investment/stocosil.  This document contains forward-looking statements reflecting current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. These forward looking statements include statements regarding commercialization plans, projected timelines, etc. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in the offering circular. This document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.

Teraphysics Risk Factors

Investing in our Common Stock involves a high degree of risk. Some examples of certain risks that you should consider in connection with an investment in our Common Stock are the following:
•	Teraphysics is a development stage company and has commenced limited operations in our business, making our prospects for revenues, profitability and growth highly uncertain.
•	Our core mmw source device technology is still in the early stages of development and its technical and commercial feasibility and viability is unproven and uncertain.

•	We believe it is probable that we will require additional capital in order to fund our contemplated technology development and business operations activities.
•	Market acceptance of the mmw technology and products based thereon is uncertain.

Alternative Securities Markets Group to Release the “Alternative Securities Market Rule Book” on Monday, January 19th.

January 12, 2015 alternativesecuritiesmarketsgroup 


The Alternative Securities Markets Group announced today that it will publicly release the Alternative Securities Market Rule Book on Monday, January 19th, 2015, one day prior to the Firm Registering SEC Form 1 with the SEC, the first step in making the Alternative Securities Market a Nationally Registered Stock Exchange.
Monday, January 12th, 2015 (Beverly Hills, California) – The Alternative Securities Markets Group Corporation today announced today that it will be releasing to the public, on Monday, January 19th, 2015,  the entire “Alternative Securities Market Rule Book”, one full day prior to the Firm’s long anticipated filing of SEC Form 1 to the United States Securities & Exchange Commission, which will be the first step in the process of having the “Alternative Securities Market” becoming recognized as a National Stock Exchange, and also the first Public CrowdFunding Stock Exchange. 
The Alternative Securities Markets Group Corporation also announced last week that it has met all the requirements for its Broker Dealer (Alternative Securities Market, LLC, a wholly owned Subsidiary of Alternative Securities Markets Group Corporation) and Registered Investment Advisor (Alternative Securities Markets Group Corporation) Filings, and those are expected in the States of California, New York and Florida in the next week. The Alternative Securities Market (http://www.ASMGCorp.com) is owned by Alternative Securities Market, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Alternative Securities Markets Group Corporation. 
Mr. Steven J. Muehler, Chief Executive Officer of the Alternative Securities Markets Group Corporation, “In the opinion of the Alternative Securities Markets Group Corporation management and legal advisors, every CrowdFunding Website that in any way provides any type of investment information about an issuer in regards to the issuers intentions to raise any type of investment capital, where an investor is expected to advance a cash investment to the issuer, where the investor has a reasonable expectation of a financial return, and where the issuer in return for the cash investment, gives the investor securities, these “Equity CrowdFunding Platforms” need to be either a Registered Broker-Dealer as defined by the Securities Act of 1933, or a Registered Stock Exchange with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, as defined in the Exchange Act of 1934.” 
“Every techy who has built a website for Crowdfunding, or any unlicensed capital broker can jump up and down about this all day long, but the rules today are very clear about this matter. May they change in the future, maybe…. But, Probably not. The grand illusion that the SEC is going to allow every Tom, Dick and Harry without proper industry experience, knowledge, examination and license just go runaround as pseudo-stock brokers and pseudo-stock exchanges is just plain crazy. We have spent the better part of a year working directly with the United States Securities & Exchange Commission in opening what is today the Alternative Securities Market, and I can provide you about five hundred pages of written responses from the SEC that details this very point, and though I do not have much respect for the Commission ‘s handling of enforcing the rules set forth by the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act of 1934, we know that the “D-Day” is coming in the next few months, and we are certain that the mandate for all EquityCrowd Funding Sites to either become Registered-Broker Dealers or Registered Stock Exchanges is on the not so distant horizon. This is not a big deal now since most CrowdFunding sites are restricted to Accredited Investors, but for Sites like the Alternative Securities Market, it is a big deal since the Market specializes in Regulation A Securities, it is open to all investors, Accredited and Non-Accredited”.

Equity CrowdFunding for Oil & Natural Gas Ventures opens January 5th, 2015 to ALL INVESTORS

December 11, 2014 alternativesecuritiesmarketsgroup 


The Alternative Securities Market, the only “Equity CrowdFunding Webportal” that that is open to Accredited and Non-Accredited Investors, is launching “ASM Oil & Gas Market” on January 5th, 2015
Thursday, December 11th, 2014 (Marina Del Rey, California) – The Alternative Securities Markets Group Corporation today announced that it is launching the ASM Oil & Natural Gas Market Segment to ALL INVESTORS on January 5th, 2015. The Alternative Securities Markets Group Corporation is the First and Only Equity CrowdFunding Company that is currently open to All Investors (accredited and non-accredited) due to the fact that all issuers on the Alternative Securities Market issue Regulation A Securities, not the highly restricted Regulation D Securities that are commonly associated with “equity CrowdFunding”.
The Alternative Securities Market was formed in November of 2014 to; (1) operate as both an independent Private Primary and Secondary Market for both Issuer Direct Initial Public Offerings of Securities to the Investing Public and for the Establishment of a Secondary Market for the Resale of Securities for Companies Listed on the Alternative Securities Market, and (2) to act as a Private Equity Capital Partner to early stage and growth stage companies of one of the Alternative Securities Market’s TWENTY “Market Segments”. 
The Alternative Securities Markets Group expects the securities of Companies listed on the Alternative Securities Market to become quoted on the OTCQB, OTCQX or the NASDAQ Capital Markets within approximately one to four years of Issuer Direct Initial Public Offering or Listing on the Alternative Securities Market.
Mr. Steven J. Muehler, Founder and CEO of the Alternative Securities Markets Group said, “In December of 2014, we are reaching a milestone by getting the very first Post Jobs Act Regulation A Securities Offering qualified by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in the Oil & Natural Gas Industry, and January 5th will mark a another tremendous milestone not only for us, but also for the SEC and for the CrowdFunding Industry, as it will be the very first time that All Investors will be able to participate in the investment of  Oil & Natural Gas Alternative Securities investments. These investment types, up until recently, have been reserved for the top 8% of Americans and institutional investors only. The added benefit of the Alternative Securities Market, is these investment opportunities will be brought out of the ‘dark’ and made available on a true securities market, not some shady fly-by night CrowdFunding web-portal founded by someone with no investment backing knowledge or background.  The Alternative Securities Market is a Private market that gives true transparency to a securities market through strenuous public reporting, much like the Regulated Markets of the NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchange, something that goes above and beyond what was encompassed in the 2012 passage of the JOBS Act. All this, topped with the announcement that CrowdFunding Title III and Title IV have been tabled until October of 2015, this will make ASMG the only Equity CrowdFunding Company open to accredited and non-accredited investors for the better part of the next year!”
Twenty Other Market Segment will be opening to all investors in January of 2015

Will the Alternative Securities Market and Regulation A Reform replace the Traditional Small Cap IPO Market?

November 30, 2014 alternativesecuritiesmarketsgroup 


There has been very little attention drawn to Title IV of the JOBS Act which, as proposed, would raise the Reg A threshold to $50 million and exempt these offerings from state blue sky laws.
With the SEC comment period for Title IV long since passed, I wanted to discuss how the Alternative Securities Markets Group and “Crowdfunding Regulation A Plus”, when combined, will transform the small cap equity markets in 2015, and essentially lay waste to the current Small Cap IPO landscape as we currently know it..
Point One: The SEC issued proposed regulations for Regulation A+, Title IV of the JOBS Act, on December 18, 2014, way ahead of the Title III regulations that are still pending. 
Probably the biggest surprise was that the SEC came out with proposed rules when they did, given all the blogging and CrowdFunding news today seems to be focused on Title II. The oddest part of Title IV of the JOBS Act is that is the only part of the JOBS Act dependent on SEC rulemaking which did not have any deadline set for the SEC to issue rules. Given the near two plus year delay in Title III crowdfunding rules, and the enormous backlog of Dodd Frank rulemaking going back to 2010, the proposed Regulation A+ rules came as a welcome surprise.
First, to catch up those of you unfamiliar with Title IV, and the Regulation A Reform, there were two major changes (both surprises) in the new proposed new rules…..
The first surprise, the content of the proposed rules!  This was the biggest surprise, but in a very positive way! The position the SEC has taken on blue sky pre-emption for offerings between $5 million and $50 million (the so-called “Regulation A Tier 2”). Essentially, it has taken the position that ALL INVESTORS in a Tier 2 offering, both accredited and unaccredited, are “qualified purchasers” – effectively meaning that  a company can open up its offering to ALL INVESTORS in a Tier 2 offering and still be exempt from state blue sky review.
The other surprise also involved blue sky pre-emption. For Tier 1 offerings (capped at $5 million) the SEC has requested comment on whether Tier 1 should also be pre-empted from all blue sky review.  The issue of pre-empting blue sky review for raises below $5 million, the original ceiling for “old” Regulation A, was never directly addressed by Congress in the JOBS Act – the focus of Congress was on pushing the ceiling up to $50 million and allowing for blue sky pre-emption for the higher amounts – but adding in ongoing reporting requirements.
 
Point Two; Biggest Unknowns Faced by Companies under the Regulation A+ Rules, in their Proposed Form?
The Alternative Securities Market when coupled with Regulation A+ have a huge potential for revitalizing the smaller IPO market — provided Regulation A+ operates as proposed — a disclosure regime which is lighter than required by fully reporting companies, and an “alleged streamlined” SEC registration review process. This is NOT currently the case with current Regulation A Submissions to the SEC. Currently, companies daring to do Regulation A Registrations with the SEC are experiencing review times equal, if not greater than S1 IPO Registration Statements.
A big unknown, regardless of how final rules look, is what we can expect from the SEC in the Regulation A+ review process in the future when the new regulations go live. Currently in 2014, the average time spent in registration at the SEC for Regulation A Securities Registration was about nine months.  Some of this may have been part of a retooling process by us at the Alternative Securities Market and at the SEC, who was not equipped to handle the surge of new Regulation A Filings. Currently, the Alternative Securities Markets Group is experiencing roughly 20-30 days in initial Regulation A submission responses, and about 15 days for amended filings. Qualification timelines can vary upon multiple factors, but a standard expectation should be 60-120 days.
Given our almost six months of operations in working with the SEC on Regulation A Public Offering Submissions, the public statements by the Commission and the overall tenor of the proposed rules is that the SEC is expecting the new Regulation A+ to be a robust method of funding.  It is the expectation of the Alternative Securities Markets Group, that with proper representation by SEC and what appears to be strong SEC support for this new $50 million exemption, issuers can reasonably expect Regulation A+ to ultimately perform as advertised – as a streamlined mini-IPO.
Point 3: With Regulation A being open to all Investors, what can be done to make Regulation A Offerings more competitive against the Traditional Small Cap IPO?
I came up with a few things. Tier 1 offerings cannot be competitive with other alternatives unless and until blue sky regulations are pre-empted.  In previous postings, I have debated the other side of the coin on this point, and I may be on the other side of the fence on this tomorrow. The simple fact is, for ME at the Alternative Securities Market, the pre-empted scenario works best for me. But Investment Banking Organizations, FINRA and the NASAA are all weighing in on this matter, and the the SEC has asked for comment on this, so presumably they believe they have the power to do this through rulemaking, but even the SEC is not sure of what their stance is on this point.
The second thing the SEC needs to do in final rulemaking, is raise the ceiling on Tier 1 offerings, from $5 million to perhaps $10 million. When Regulation A was enacted, the $5 Million cap was reasonable, in 2015, there are just not many small cap companies that Tier 1 Offerings make sense for.
And finally, a point I rarely speak on as Companies on the Alternative Securities Market already agree to Public Reporting that generally exceeds the public reporting required under Regulation A+. With that said, with Tier 2 offerings, the limit on the number of shareholders before full reporting requirements are triggered ought to be modified.
The current ongoing reporting requirement for Tier 2 semi- annual or quarterly, versus full reporting, only remains in effect until a company exceeds the caps currently set for the number of total shareholders – 500 unaccredited investors, or 2,000 accredited investors.  Unless the SEC modifies its proposed rules, companies will face difficulties including a significant number of persons who wish to invest smaller amounts of money – those more likely to be unaccredited investors.  This defeats one of the purposes of Regulation A+ – allowing a company to do a mini-IPO by going out to a large group of investors.
Let’s do some math:  500 unaccredited investors, each investing an average of $10,000 – that’s $5 million to the company – and they have already hit the 500 shareholder cap. And that’s on the low end of an exemption available for up to $50 million.  Something needs to give here. Unfortunately this is not an item being debated by the SEC currently, and does not seem to be an item to be addressed before enactment for Regulation A+ (whenever that may be).
Point 3: Is the Alternative Securities Market the new Competition for the OTC Markets Group, given the pending closure of the OTCBB?
If the SEC were to exempt Tier 1 offerings from blue sky regulations (like with the proposed Tier 2), and modify the shareholder caps, both of which were already done by Congress in Title III of the JOBS Act, and combine that with a vehicle like the Alternative Securities Market, we have the potential for investment crowdfunding in Overdrive. If an Direct Initial Public Offering up to $50 Million on the Alternative Securities Market with a Regulation A Offering is: (1) much less complex than and OTC Market Listing, (2) Tens of Thousands of Dollars cheaper than an OTC Market Listing, and (3) gives the shareholder the same liquidity in the securities being issued to investors, why would an issuer ever go to the OTC Markets for a Small Cap IPO? The only answer is “market liquidity”.
The major drawback of Regulation A offerings in the current CrowdFunding Landscape is “barrier of entry” for CrowdFunding Websites or CrowdFunding Securities Markets. The OTC Markets group today rules the OTC Market landscape, and will only grow its stranglehold on the Market given FINRA’s recent announcement that it will be closing the OTCBB, leaving the OTC Markets Group to rule unchallenged.
Mr. Cromwell Coulson, President and CEO of the OTC Markets Group obviously becomes a focal point of this whole Equity Crowdfunding landscape, as one of the biggest issues that may “investment market industry professionals” have with both Regulation A+ and Title III of the JOBS Act is the fact that the proposed legislation did not have a clearly spelled out mechanism for how there would be a freely traded exchange of the Regulation A and Title III equity securities. The current rules for Regulation A Securities, is that once an issuer sells a Regulation A Security to an Investor, the shares are issues unrestricted and able to be immediately sold, traded or transferred (unless restricted due to the issuer being a Rule 144 Shell Company by definition), and the proposed rules for Title III state that once an investor invests in Title III securities, they must hold on to them for one year before they can sell. Once the year is up however, there is no clear guidance on how the sale to a new buyer will take place.
So, up and to the evolution of the Alternative Securities Market, this came down to the OTC Markets Group. The OTC Markets Group has it three tiers to choose from, the OTCQX, the OTCQB and the OTC Pink (you can get more information at www.OTCMarkets.com)
Out of the three options, the OTC Pink Marketplace is going to generally be the most popular choice for most Regulation A+ and Title III Issuers. This option is the “least costly” (in terms of OTC Market listings) to issuers of CrowdFunded Securitiies to comply with. Of course, regardless of if a company becomes capitalized through CrowdFunding or intends to do a small cap IPO in order to gain capitalization on the OTC Market, there are the dreaded OTC Listing Steps a company must complete In order to list on the OTC Marketplace.
To become an OTCQX, OTCQB or OTC Pink company, at least one broker-dealer must quote the company’s securities on OTC Link® ATS. OTC Link® ATS is operated by OTC Link LLC, an SEC-registered Alternative Trading System (ATS) and FINRA member broker-dealer wholly owned by OTC Markets Group. Unlike on stock exchanges (or the Alternative Securities Market for that matter), companies do not list their own stock for trading. Rather, broker-dealers begin quoting new securities on OTC Link® ATS by submitting a Form 211 with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). In some cases, there may be an exemption available that permits a broker-dealer to begin quoting a stock without filing a Form 211. Generally, this happens when the broker-dealer is already quoting the stock on another platform or if the broker-dealer is only representing an unsolicited customer order, not making a market.
Of course there are the dreaded costs of filing an S-1 or a Form 10 Registration Statement, Costs of the required financial audit, costs of retaining a stock transfer agent and clearing “DTC”, and then you get the OTC Market upfront application cost of $2,500 with an annual fee to be on the market of $10,000 (for OTCQB, the costs for the OTCQX is a $5,000 Application fee and $15,000 Annual Fee). Most companies can expect to have a total out of pocket expense in the range of $35,000 to $50,000
So, why all of this information? The answer is a simple one, Alternative Securities Market Listed Companies can enjoy all the comforts of doing an IPO of free-trading shares without all the costs, and without all of the mind-numbing paperwork required for an OTC Market Listing! Investors get the same market transparency and liquidity in their holdings as they would have on the OTC Market. Can this spell the end of the OTC Markets Group?
Lets do the math:
OTC Market IPO of Free Trading Shares (below are just estimates, for exact number you will need to contact industry professionals working in the below related fields):

Legal Preparation and Filing of an SC S-1 or SEC Form 10 = $15,000
Stock Transfer Agent Retainer = $5,000
Clearing DTC = $5,000
Financial Audit = $5,000
OTC Application (OTCQB) = $2,000
OTC First Year Listing = $10,000

BARE BONES MINIMUM (100% upfront and out of pocket)  =  $42,000
Alternative Securities Market Listing:

SEC Form 1-A Submission to the SEC = $2,750
Financial Audit (None Required a this time) = $0.00
Legal Opinion Letter = $1,000
State Registrations = $10,000

Total =  $13,750
Total Out-of-Pocket  = $1,000
Financed by the Alternative Securities Market   =  $12,750
It is this fact, with strong financial backing from Investors, the Alternative Securities Market in 2015 will quickly become a fierce competitor for the OTC Markets Group.
 
Closing Point:
With what we believe is the last legal opinion / legal comment letter from the SEC issued last week, we are assured we will be open to all private and institutional investors on January 5th, 2015. This might be six months later than anticipated, but we delayed our opening six months to continue coordinated efforts in working with the SEC to be the very first “Legal Equity CrowdFunding Marketplace” that provides the very best products and services to both issuers and to investors.
The small businesses in America need the Alternative Securities Market as a “source of capital formation”. The future economy stands to gain significantly from CrowdFunding and Companies like the Alternative Securities Markets Group Corporation, and those that will copy us, and potentially improve upon our processes in the future.
I am happy to announce that on January 5th, 2015, when the Alternative Securities Market opens its doors to Investors, we will only then begin to see economic prosperity spread to ALL DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE GLOBAL POPULATION, and have it done in one of the most transparent marketplaces available.

NASDAQ Private Market Launches New Marketplace for Private Companies




















March 05, 2014 09:00 ET

 | Source: NASDAQ Private Market, LLC





SAN FRANCISCO and NEW YORK, March 5, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The NASDAQ Private Market, LLC announced today the launch of its new capital marketplace for private companies. Built as a company-first platform on industry-leading technology, NASDAQ Private Market will provide qualifying private companies the tools and resources to efficiently raise capital, control secondary transactions, and manage their equity-related functions. Securities-related services will be offered through a wholly-owned broker-dealer and SEC registered alternative trading system, NPM Securities, LLC, member FINRA/SIPC. Member Companies on NASDAQ Private Market will also have the ability to connect with its global network of registered broker-dealers representing qualified institutional buyers as well as family offices and other accredited investors.

	"We are excited to officially open NASDAQ Private Market for business," said Greg Brogger, President of NASDAQ Private Market. "We listened to the needs of private growth companies and developed NASDAQ Private Market to serve as a fully integrated end-to-end solution for managing their equity functions. NASDAQ Private Market will bring liquidity, efficiency and control to private companies. Member broker-dealers and their investor clients will benefit from greater access to financial information, transaction flow and liquidity."

	"A critical component of the NASDAQ OMX mission is providing support to the innovators and entrepreneurs in today's marketplace," said Bob Greifeld, CEO of NASDAQ OMX. "For over 40 years, NASDAQ OMX has been committed to serving the needs of companies for their entire life cycle – whether emerging growth companies or mature corporations. We are excited to support the launch of NASDAQ Private Market and to extend our product offering to private companies with this new efficient and transparent market."

A Platform for Controlled Liquidity

	To assure a community of quality private companies, member companies must meet NASDAQ Private Market's membership requirements.

	Companies can use the NASDAQ Private Market platform to manage liquidity programs for employees and other shareholders. These liquidity programs have become an increasingly common tool used by leading private companies to recruit and retain the most talented employees. NASDAQ Private Market supports such programs by enabling companies to identify a pool of potential buyers and set parameters on the percentage of holdings that shareholders can sell. Participating shareholders gain liquidity, and the company is able to facilitate the transition of ownership into the hands of long-term institutional holders.

	Compliance with regulatory requirements is critical to the success of these liquidity programs. "The NASDAQ Private Market has been designed to reflect industry best practices and to hardwire tools to assist with securities law compliance into the system," said Steve Bochner, partner and former CEO of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati and Chair of NASDAQ Private Market's Board of Advisors. All investors will be accredited by NASDAQ Private Market Member Broker-Dealers. In addition, to ensure investors have appropriate financial information, a Member Company will agree to make certain limited disclosures to those that transact in its shares. 

Optimizing the Transition to Public Markets

	In addition, NASDAQ Private Market will enable private companies to improve their transition to the public markets by facilitating engagement with long-term institutional investors well in advance of a public offering. By establishing a regular dialogue with investors over the platform, private companies can efficiently build relationships over time with those institutions they are targeting as purchasers in their eventual IPO. Private companies can also enhance their IPO operational preparedness by migrating to the integrated equity management solutions they will need as a public company.

	"NASDAQ Private Market gives entrepreneurs more flexibility in deciding if and when to go public," said Bruce Aust, Executive Vice President at NASDAQ OMX and Chairman of the NASDAQ Private Market Board. "By obtaining interim liquidity relief, companies can choose to enter the public markets based on the needs of their business and with the proper corporate solutions and institutional investor relationships in place for a seamless transition." 

	The NASDAQ Private Market platform combines a capital marketplace with an efficient end-to-end solution for controlling secondary transactions, disclosure management, capitalization table management, and stock plan administration. From a secure online portal, private companies can consolidate the management of all of their equity functions, saving time and money and reducing the potential for errors.

About NASDAQ Private Market: 

	The NASDAQ Private Market, LLC is the new capital market for leading private companies. Through its broker-dealer network and partners, NASDAQ Private Market connects companies with a global community of investors, and provides an integrated equity solution for managing everything from cap table management to stock plan administration. Whether a company seeks to optimize an eventual IPO or remain private permanently, NASDAQ Private Market provides complete capital market support to meet its needs. For certain eligible investors and shareholders, NASDAQ Private Market is a place to discover and engage with some of the most exciting private companies.

	NASDAQ Private Market was formed in March of 2013 as a joint venture between The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. and SharesPost, Inc. Securities-related services will be offered through NPM Securities, LLC, a registered broker-dealer and alternative trading system, which is a member FINRA/SIPC and a wholly-owned subsidiary of The NASDAQ Private Market, LLC. Securities offered through NPM Securities, LLC are not listed or traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, nor are the securities subject to the same listing or qualification standards applicable to securities listed or traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC.

CrowdFunding, Investment, Investment Banking, Stock Market

What is the Purpose of a Stock Market, and how did we lose our way!

November 30, 2014 alternativesecuritiesmarketsgroup 


Contrary to popular belief, or even as portrayed on T.V. or in the Movies, the Stock markets are NOT the nerve center of capitalism. They are nothing more than tools to facilitate the buying and selling of shares.
Today’s stock markets are primarily about speculating on the future prices of those shares, largely disconnected from real investment or what goes on in the real economy of goods and services. It’s time for all investors, from private individual investors to large pension funds, to reconnect with businesses in a long-term relationship through a new investment architecture.
Stock exchanges were originally conceived for the public interest and had a clear public purpose:
“To allow companies to raise equity from a large pool of investors and to provide 
a market for investors to later sell their shares in those companies”.
 
The promise of a liquid market lowered the cost of that equity to enterprise, thereby increasing economic growth and, theoretically at least, shared prosperity.
But capital formation is only a small part of what happens on stock markets today. Yes, successful stock offerings provide the avenue for venture capitalists to recycle investments made in private markets back into new, innovative young enterprises. But it is short-term speculation in stocks, aided by the increased speed of information flow, that has grown like a cancer into a big business of little real value and now dominates stock market activity.
Most investors (especially those large institutional investors) who sing the praises of market liquidity, are more often than not just self-interested speculators. Indeed, recent history has shown that our world-leading liquid markets are also the source of extreme global instability, with dire and ongoing consequences. Nonetheless, this trader ideology remains stubbornly at the heart of our short-term-obsessed finance capitalism, which, left unchecked, surely will lead us to economic, social, and ecological collapse.
Six factors have combined to make our equity capital markets no longer fit for purpose:

The privatization of large national stock exchanges, destroying their public purpose mandate and instead making the growth of trading volume their single-minded goal and high-frequency traders (computers programmed to trade) their preferred customers.
The unrestrained technology arms race in computing power combined with the adoption of technology-driven information flow spurring the rapid acceleration of trading volume, which at critical times can be highly destabilizing.
The misguided ascent of “shareholder wealth maximization” (at the expense of all other stakeholder interests) in our business schools, board rooms, and the corporate finance departments on Wall Street.
The well-intended but equally misguided practice of using stock-based incentives, and stock options in particular, as the dominant form of senior management compensation, which incentivizes them to focus only on short-term results at the expense of the long-term health of the enterprise, people and planet.
The misalignment of interests between short-term focused intermediaries and real investors such as pension funds whose timeframe should be measured in decades.
Regulators’ lack of courage and confidence to counter the trader-driven paradigm and institute substantive structural reform such as a Financial Transaction Tax and other reforms that would penalize excessive speculation while incentivizing long-term productive investment.

Rather than limit themselves to this deeply flawed system, Alternative Securities Market Investors (aka, “real investors”) can build direct relationships with enterprise in negotiated, innovative, mutually beneficial partnerships that are truly aligned with both parties’ long-term goals including the harmonization of financial, environmental, social, and governance imperatives.
Alternative Securities Market Investors are able to target mature early stage and growth stage micro-cap and small-cap companies that are often unappreciated by growth-obsessed equity capital markets. They can disprove the myth that growth at the expense of the environment or employees is the only path to adequate financial returns. The cash flows of these businesses may not exhibit the (in our view often unsustainable) growth characteristics equity investors have been trained to desire, but they are far more dependable sources of financial return than speculation-driven capital markets. That resiliency is what Alternative Securities Market Investors will value most in an increasingly uncertain future with growing resource and fiscal constraints hampering economic growth, particularly in the developed economies.
The burning question is whether the Alternative Securities Market Investment methodology detailed here can be scaled up as an alternative vehicle for investment in large, mature businesses of the mainstream (or just for Micro-Cap and Small-Cap Companies), while also providing a more effective way to embed environmental, social and corporate governance values into investments and the economy in aggregate. To do so, it will require a fresh look with a critical eye at the failed promise of modern portfolio theory, and the self-serving interests of our short-term driven trading paradigm.

Alternative Securities Market will be open to all Investors on November 1st, 2014

October 9, 2014 alternativesecuritiesmarketsgroup Leave a comment



The Alternative Securities Markets Group Corporation today announced that its “Alternative Securities Market” will be open to all investors beginning November 1st, 2014.
Thursday, October 9th, 2014 (Marina Del Rey, California) – The Alternative Securities Markets Group Corporation today announced that it is launching the Investor Portal for the Alternative Securities Market on November 1st, 2014.
The Alternative Securities Market was formed in July of 2014 to; (1) operate as both an independent Private Primary and Secondary Market for both Issuer Direct Initial Public Offerings of Securities to the Investing Public and for the Establishment of a Secondary Market for the Resale of Securities for Companies Listed on the Alternative Securities Market, and (2) to act as a Private Equity Capital Partner to early stage and growth stage companies of one of the Alternative Securities Market’s TWENTY “Market Segments”.
The Alternative Securities Markets Group expects the securities of Companies listed on the Alternative Securities Market to become quoted on the OTCQB, OTCQX or the NASDAQ Capital Markets within approximately one to four years of IPO or Listing on the Alternative Securities Market.
Alternative Securities Market Investor Benefits:
•	True Global Alternative Securities Market, Open to all U.S. Citizens and Non-U.S. Citizens
•	Unlike “CrowdFudning Portals”, the Alternative Securities Market is OPEN TO ALL INVESTORS (accredited, non-accredited, U.S. Citizen, Non-U.S. Citizen, Private Person and Institutional Investors and Advisors).
•	No Day Trading
•	No Short Selling
•	Highest Transparency of all markets (see Public Reporting Requirement of companies listed on the Alternative Securities Market below).
•	All securities are immediately “free trading” or have “limited trade restrictions” of 6 to 12 months. (Note: All resales of securities are transactions between  a “seller” and a “buyer” on an “ask” and “bid” system, much like an “Ebay for the resale of securities”, no intermediaries or brokers).
•	Shortened “trade windows” to help drive “weekly concentrated volume”
•	Invest online without ever having to: Print, Scan, Fax, Email, Mail or Wire Funds (invest online up to $10,000 USD) – restrictions apply.
Corporate Issuer Benefits:
•	Go Public on the Alternative Securities Market without the need for Audited Financials (Regulation A Securities Offerings)
•	Go Public on the Alternative Securities Market at a fraction of the cost of an OTC Market or Regulated Market IPO or Listing (currently the Alternative Securities Markets Group Corporation  is incurring 100% of all SEC and NASAA costs associated with all Regulation A Registrations and Direct Public Offering related costs)
•	Go Public on the Alternative Securities Market in as short of 30-60 days without the need to do a “reverse merger”
•	Ability for all investors to invest in your Company, not just accredited investors (like with “CrowdFunding”)
Mr. Steven J. Muehler, Founder and CEO of the Alternative Securities Markets Group said, “November 1st will mark a tremendous milestone not only for us, but also for the SEC and for the CrowdFunding Industry, as it will be the very first time that All Investors will be able to participate in the investment of Alternative Securities investments. These investment types, up until recently, have been reserved for the top 8% of Americans and institutional investors only. The added benefit of the Alternative Securities Market, is these investment opportunities will be brought out of the ‘dark’ and made available on a true securities market, not some shady fly-by night CrowdFunding web-portal founded by someone with no investment backing knowledge or background.  The Alternative Securities Market is a Private market that gives true transparency to a securities market through strenuous public reporting, much like the Regulated Markets of the NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchange, something that goes above and beyond what was encompassed in the 2012 passage of the JOBS Act.”

Alternative Securities Markets Group Welcomes Remington Energy Group Corporation

August 26, 2014 alternativesecuritiesmarketsgroup Leave a comment

Mr. Steven J. Muehler, Founder and CEO of Alternative Securities Market, writes open letter to the SEC regarding CrowdFunding Reform

August 20, 2014 alternativesecuritiesmarketsgroup Leave a comment



Mr. Steven J. Muehler, Founder and CEO of the Alternative Securities Markets Group, writes and open letter to the United States Securities & Exchange Commission regarding CrowdFunding Reform and the Repeal of the proposed rules for CrowdFunding Title III.
Tuesday, August 19th, 2014 (Beverly Hills, California) – In an email released to the Public Today, a letter written on August 11th, 2014 by Alternative Securities Markets Group Founder and Chief Executive Officer Mr. Steven J. Muehler, to the United States Securities & Exchange Commission, echoes the call for changes to both the current and proposed rules and regulations that encompass what is commonly referred to as “CrowdFunding”.
In the letter, Mr. Muehler has taken a position of great concern to the “average Joe investors”, and those concerns are similar to the concerns voiced my members of the NASAA, FINRA and many Investment Banking Firms and Associations nationwide. In the letter below, Mr. Muehler calls for four very specific rule changes that are required to allow the CrowdFunding Industry to both flourish, but under the proper regulation of securities regulators. One major point of emphasis is the total REPEAL of CrowdFunding Title III.
The letter, dated August 11th, 2014 is below in its entirety, and is also able to be viewed with additional information athttp://www.SteveMuehler.com and http://www.AlternativeSecuritiesMarket.com
To:
United States Securities and Exchange Commission
100 F Street NorthEast
Washington, D.C. 20549
and
United States Securities and Exchange Commission
Los Angeles Regional Office
5670 Wilshire Blvd., 11th Floor
Los Angeles, California 90036
Dear United States Securities and Exchange Commission Members:
I wanted to write this brief letter to you, first thanking you for taking the time to meet and speak with me this coming Tuesday (August 12th, 2014) about the operations of the Alternative Securities Markets Group and about the current CrowdFunding marketplace. I also want to thank you for taking the time to review our Company’s website at http://www.AlternativeSecuritiesMarket.com and for taking the time to speak with a large number of the Company’s on the Alternative Securities Market Venture Market, the Alternative Securities Market Main Market and the Alternative Securities Market Global Private Market. Along with all of this information you gathered about the operations of the Alternative Securities Market and the companies associated with our market, I also wanted to take a brief moment to write about our Company’s position on the current “CrowdFunding Industry”.
The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”) directed the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to come up with regulations to help revitalize the SEC’s Regulation A registration exemption under the Securities Act of 1933, mainly to increase the maximum offering from the current $5,000,000 USD to $50,000,000 USD, without going through the SEC’s securities registration process.
Using Regulation A, especially for local real estate investments, is now becoming a trend in the “real estate crowdfunding” industry with groups like Fundrise (who did three total applications in 2013) and Groundfloor (who did less than Fundrise), but are expected to each increase their number of Regulation A Filings in 2014. The current ‘gripe’ for years about the lack of use of Regulation A, is that State Approval is needed to be able to take advantage of this regulation in its current capacity, and the costs associated with state regulations (generally ranging from a couple hundred to a couple thousand dollars per State), hence ONLY 11 Regulation A registrations were filed in all of 2013. Since April 1st, 2014 to August 11th, 2014, I have personally authored and submitted the the SEC more than 40 Regulation A Securities Registration Statements for review, comment and qualification.
The proposed regulations for Regulation A “Plus” offerings released in December of 2013 by the United States Securities & Exchange Commission, was at much disappointment to myself, as well as the NASAA (“North American Securities Administrators Association”). The proposed framework included a provision where State Regulators would retain registration authority only for Regulation A filings under the current Regulation A of $5 Million or less (to be known as Regulation A Tier I), and where State Regulators would not retain authority for Regulation A filings of $5,000,001 to $50 Million.
Since the passage of the JOBS Act, the State Regulators have reworked a “Coordinated Review and Registration System” among its members to collectively register Regulation A offerings so that the registration statements can be reviewed and approved by state regulators in a timely fashion. It was this extra step after SEC review and qualification (and the costs associated with it), comment and qualification that steered many companies away from Regulation A. These extra time delays and extra costs of Regulation A is the chief reason for the popular use by issuers of private placement offering exemptions under Regulation D, was to avoid both state and fedearl registrations, reviews, and the extra time and costs associated with it.
Because of my role with the Alternative Securities Markets Group and on air with “Steve Muehler, on the Corner of Main Street and Wall Street”, I find myself at the literal epi-center of the whole CrowdFunding Industry. I have been literally over-run with calls and emails from small business owner / entrepreneurs, and absolutely overwhelmed with countless business plans and private placement memorandums from companies that have been “Crowdfunding” under Regulation D with no success (for many various reasons) that have conacted myself about conducting a Regulation A Securities Offering. To date, I have only engaged with about 1% of the companies that have contacted me, both from a capacity of being able to do the work required in a time frame that is acceptable to the client, and also I was not 100% in support of the Company or its business plan.
It is because of my unique position in this whole CrowdFunding Space that I make the following suggestings about “reform” to the CrowdFunding Industry as it relates to current and proposed changes to the aspects of Regulation A and Regulation D:
INCREASED BARRIERS OF ENTRY FOR COMPANIES SEEKING TO SOLICIT INVESTMENTS PUBLICLY FOR REGULATION D SECURITIES UNDER RULES 504 AND 506
Because of the escalated risks associated with public solicitation, especially given the rise of non-industry related participants launching “crowdfunding” and “capital raising” websites that provide absolutely no due diligence in the companies that are soliciting for investment through these websites, it is suggested that all companies seeking to sell Regulation D Securities in a Public Solicitation format under rules 504 and 506, need to be required to submit a registration statement to the SEC on SEC Form 1-A (or an alternate form to be created) for a complete merit review by an examiner with the SEC, and that all State Blue Sky Registrations be completed by the company prior to starting any public solicitation for the sale of the securities. Because this is a simple process and requires minimum capital expenditures on the part of the company, there should be no “test the waters” periods prior to the registration of the Regulation D to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Because it is my belief that the barrier of entry for companies seeking to sell securities publicly under Regulation D rules 504 and 506 to accredited investors only should be less than those seeking to publicly sell securities to all investors (accredited and non-accredited) under Regulation A, it is suggested that the filing of un-audited or audited financial statements to the SEC at the time of registration should not apply to Regulation D filings. This merit review should be only to ensure that all necessary information required to be given to any potential investor under Regulation D has been properly disclosed, and that all members of the Company’s management are not part of the “bad actors” definition, and that if they are, that proper public disclosure is given.
As part of this, all “CrowdFunding” websites that market and advertise companies selling securities under Regulation D, Regulation S and/or Regulation A need to be required to ensure that all Federal and State approvals are complete PRIOR to allowing any public solicitations. Each of the “CrowdFunding” websites should also be required to provide links to the SEC Edgar Page that shows all filings of the Company that is soliciting for investment.
It is felt that this change is necessary, and should be made in the best interest of the general investing public.
 .
INCREASED REGULATION OF UNLICENSED BROKERS SOLICITING INVESTMENTS ON BEHALF OF COMPANIES FOR WHICH THE BROKER IS NOT A MEMBER OF, AND SOLICITING INVESTORS ON A PERFORMANCE BASED COMMISSION AGREEMENT (ILLEGAL UNDER CURRENT RULES AND REGULATIONS) NEEDS DRAMATIC REFORM
Since the fallout of the Mortgage and Real Estate Markets, the “venture capital brokerage” industry has become oversaturated with unlicensed “Regulation D Stock Brokers” soliciting investments for companies seeking capital under Regulation D. Most of these unlicensed “venture capital brokers” have very limited knowledge of the basic rules, regulations and securities markets place (private or public), and are soliciting these highly speculative and highly risky securities to all forms of investors as safe investments.
In my view, the current standard for marketing securities for sale under Regulation D, Regulation S and/or “CrowdFunding” is “to high” of a standard to state that only “licensed broker dealers” can sell securities of a Company, and that the standard for someone wanting to sell securities pursuant to Regulation D, Regulation S, and/or “CrowdFunding”, and said broker is not part of a licensed broker dealer, is to high of a standard for a broker seeking to gain entry into the industry.
As part of a suggestion to introduce both control and regulation into this aspect of a fast growing marketplace, it is suggested that a ‘limited broker’s license’ or a smiliar designation be created. Under this ‘limited broker’s license’, a broker seeking to sell securities for a SINGLE COMPANY on a performance (commission) basis, can file for this ‘limited broker’s license’ through FINRA or the SEC (or through a State Securities Regulator). As part of the filing, the broker will submit a copy of the SEC approved Regulation D or Regulation S investment prospectus (as discussed in the point above) along with the application for the ‘limited broker license’ (along with any fees that may apply for this limited broker’s license). As long as the broker applying for license meets the minimum background check standards that will be applied for approval of a ‘limited broker licenses’, and the broker or the company issuing the scurities submits and bonds or assurances that may be required, the broker will then be able to publicly market and solicit investment for that single company per the terms and conditions represented in the filed and approved securities registration statement and per the terms of the limited broker’s license. This simple change will both bring regulation to a segment of the market that is over-run with unlicensed brokers marketing and attempting to sell securities without proper license and in violation of both Federal and State Laws, and also give a lower barrier of entry to those seeking to work in this industry and cannot either gain employment with a licensed broker dealer or cannot take the time necessary to go through months of exams to become a licensed securities professional.
It is felt that this change is necessary to give entry to a new group of industry professionals wanting to work in an industry that may not currently be accessible to them, and should be made in the best interest of the general investing public.
THE STATES MUST RETAIN REGISTRATION AUTHORITY FOR BOTH PROPOSED TIER I AND TIER II REGULATION A OFFERINGS
With the implementation of the NASAA Coordinated Review and Registration program, the State Regulators have collectively introduced a time effective and hassle free State Registration process where each issuer’s Regulation A Registration Statement will be reviewed and approved by State Regulators in a timely fashion. There has been reports that the NASAA and the SEC Commissioners have been in contact on this new Coordinated Review and Registration process, and it is possible at this time that the final regulations will not include the preemption of state securities registration requirements for Regulation A Plus (Tier II) Offerings (i.e., those Regulation A offerings from $5,000,001 to the new proposed maximum $50 million).
CROWDFUNDING TITLE III (3) OF THE JOBS ACT MUST NEVER BE ENACTED:
CrowdFunding Title iii of the Jobs Act Must never be enacted. Any company engaging in public solicitation for the sale of securities to the general invsting public (accredited and non-accredited Investors) MUST go through the same registration, review, comment and approval process like that associated with a Regualtion A Securities Offering. In Regulation A, CrowdFunding Title III is already essentially in action, those not wishing to go through the registration, review, comment and qualification process should not be allowed to publicly solicit investments from non-accredited investors, it is just that simple. This is simple common sense and in the best interest of the the general investing public.
Again, I thank you for taking the time to review this information, and I look forward to speaking with you on Tuesday.

Reg A+ Title IV
Reg D
Our Team







ASMX Capital Advisors specializes in Reg A+ securities, a new streamlined way for companies to raise up to $50mm. Reg A+ is commonly considered IPO Light. It is a faster, less costly, lower regulatory and compliance SEC registration process that allows for companies to raise capital from the public. It is great for early and growth stage companies.
Find out if RegA+ is right for you contact us.
RegA+ General requirements:
Issuers can raise up to $50 million in a 12-month  period, with not more than $15 million in offers by selling security-holders  that are affiliates of the issuer.
In addition to the limits on secondary sales by  affiliates, the rules also limit sales by all selling security-holders to no  more than 30 percent of a particular offering in the issuer’s initial  Regulation A offering and subsequent Regulation A offerings for the first  12 months following the initial offering.
Issuers must provide audited financial statements  and file annual, semiannual and current event reports.
Non-accredited investors are allowed to invest a  maximum of 10 percent of the greater of the investor’s annual income or net  worth in any RegA+ transaction.
Eligibility
All companies organized in and with their principal  place of business in the United States or Canada can file a RegA+.
RegA+ is not available to companies that:

Have no specific business plan or purpose or have  indicated their business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition with an  unidentified company.
Are seeking to offer and sell asset-backed  securities or fractional undivided interests in oil, gas or other mineral  rights.
Have been subject to any order of the Commission  under Exchange Act Section 12(j) entered within the past five years.
Have not filed ongoing reports required by the  rules during the preceding two years.
Are disqualified under the “bad actor”  disqualification rules.

The rules exempt securities in a Tier 2 offering  from the mandatory registration requirements of Exchange Act Section 12(g) if  the issuer meets all of the following conditions:

Engages services from a transfer agent registered  with the Commission.
Remains subject to a Tier 2 reporting obligation.
Is current in its annual and semiannual reporting  at fiscal year-end.
Has a public float of less than $75 million as of  the last business day of its most recently completed semiannual period, or, in  the absence of a public float, had annual revenues of less than $50 million as  of its most recently completed fiscal year.

An issuer that exceeds the dollar and Section 12(g)  registration thresholds would have a two-year transition period before it must  register its class of securities, provided it timely files all of its ongoing  reports required under Regulation A.
Preemption of Blue Sky Law
In light of the total package of investor  protections included in amended Regulation A, the rules provide for the  preemption of state securities law registration and qualification requirements  for securities offered or sold to “qualified purchasers,” defined to be any person  to whom securities are offered or sold under a Tier 2 offering.
Background
Under the Securities Act of 1933, when a company  offers or sells securities to potential investors, it must either register the  offer and sale or rely on an exemption from registration. Regulation A is  a longstanding exemption from registration that permits unregistered public  offerings of up to $5 million of securities in any 12-month period, including  no more than $1.5 million of securities offered by security-holders of the  company. In recent years, Regulation A offerings have been relatively  rare in comparison to offerings conducted in reliance on other Securities Act  exemptions or on a registered basis.
The JOBS Act amended the Securities Act to require  the Commission to update and expand the Regulation A exemption. In  particular, the JOBS Act directed the Commission to:

Adopt rules that would allow offerings of up to $50  million of securities within a 12-month period.
Require companies conducting such offerings to file  annual audited financial statements with the SEC.
Adopt additional requirements and conditions that  the Commission determines necessary.










ASMX Capital Advisors also offers advisory services for Regulation D capital raises.
We’ve been advising many clients who seek to raise capital via Regulation A+, and after a year of working exclusively in this space, know there is the need to simultaneously raise via a Reg D (to meet payroll, to cover overhead, to pay for the audits and legal fees associated with filing an A+).
 ASMX Capital Advisors offers our consulting and advisory services to our clients who are filing an A+, to also manage their D raise, making this a true one-stop shop for your capital raise needs.
Much of the marketing needed to raise capital for a Reg A+, can be created for your D or PPM.  This helps reduce the cost later, and will give you the same, professional, top of the line, marketing campaign you find with Reg A’s.  One of the most important aspects of raising capital is communicating to the market, whether it’s the private investor, or the syndicated Broker. 
ASMX Capital Advisors creates not only the expert offering circular that gets you noticed, but the website, investor deck, and campaign can be created at these early stages of your capital raise.  The Website and Deck are two of the most important calling cards you have to give investors, doing it correctly the first time, with the same company team who work with you when you’re ready for your larger raise with Regulation A+, saves time and money.
Regulation D (Reg D) is a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulation governing private placement exemptions. Reg D allows usually smaller companies to raise capital through the sale of equity or debt securities without having to register their securities with the SEC.
There are several programs that are available under the Regulation D Exemption. The JOBS Act 506(c) program allows general advertising and solicitation of the offering and also benefits from some compliance efficiencies with State “Blue Sky” filings.






ASMX Capital Advisors, LLC. is an investment advisory and consulting company for companies interested in raising capital via the JOBS Act. We are your solution to Reg A+ funding, and guide you through the entire filing process, from Due Diligence, to Drafting your Offering, Filing with the SEC, and preparing a bespoke marketing campaign targeted to both the investment community and investor at large.

Prospective investors  should carefully read this offering circular prior to making a decision to  purchase shares. 
It is impossible  to accurately predict the results to an investor from an investment in shares  of the Company's common stock because of  general risks associated with the ownership and operation of real estate, the  risks associated with the types of properties the Company intends to acquire,  and certain tax risks, among other risks. These risks may be exacerbated by the  additional risks associated with the specific properties that the Company  acquires and the ownership structure of the Investment. Such specific risks  include, but are not limited to, high vacancy rates, tenants in possession but  not paying rent, tenants paying rent but who have "gone dark," properties that  need substantial capital improvements and/or repositioning in their local  markets, properties that are not generating income, and risks relating to joint  venture and co-investor structures. In addition, prospective investors must  rely solely upon the Advisor to identify Investment opportunities and to  negotiate any debt financing. Prospective investors who are unwilling to rely  solely on the Advisor should not invest in our shares. 
Each prospective  investor should consider carefully the risk involved in this offering, and  should consult with his own legal, tax, and financial advisors with respect  thereto prior to investing in shares of the Company's common stock. Examples of  a few risks in this offering are the following:
• Upon raising the minimum  offering amount, we will only own one Investment
• Our Advisor may not be  successful in identifying and consummating suitable investment opportunities.
• Investments in real  estate-related assets can be speculative.
• Adverse economic  conditions may negatively affect our results of operations and, as a result,  our ability to make distributions to our stockholders or to realize  appreciation in the value of our Investments.
• REIT distribution  requirements could adversely affect our liquidity.
• We may have conflicts of  interest with our Advisor and other affiliates, which could result in investment  decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders.
• We have used and may  continue to use mortgage and other debt financing to acquire properties or  interests in properties and otherwise incur other indebtedness, which increases  our expenses and could subject us to the risk of losing properties in  foreclosure if our cash flow is insufficient to make loan payments.
• A limit on the percentage  of our securities a person may own may discourage a takeover or business  combination, which could prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium  price for their stock.
• The price of our common  stock may fluctuate significantly.
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for CapRocq Core REIT, Inc.'s Common Stock, therefore our  Company cannot predict the extent to which an active market for its Common  Stock will develop or be sustained after this offering, or how the development  of such a market might affect the market price of its common stock. For a  complete discussion of risks, please refer to the Form 1-A. A Form 1-A offering  circular relating to these securities has been qualified by the Securities and  Exchange Commission. You may obtain a copy of the final offering circular here: https://www.theasmx.com/investment/caprocqcorereit The Form-1-A contains  forward-looking statements reflecting current expectations that involve risks  and uncertainties. These forward looking statements include statements  regarding commercialization plans, projected timelines, etc. Actual results and  the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these  forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those  discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in the  offering circular. This document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the  solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these  securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or  sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the  securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. No money or other  consideration is being solicited in connection with this document, and if sent  in response, will not be accepted. Any person's indication of interest involves  no obligation or commitment of any kind.

•	We are heavily dependent on the success of ST-101, ST-102 and ST-103, and we cannot give assurance that our products will receive regulatory approval, which is necessary before the products can be commercialized.
•	Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights will be critically important to the success of our business, and we may not be able to protect these rights in the U.S. or abroad.
