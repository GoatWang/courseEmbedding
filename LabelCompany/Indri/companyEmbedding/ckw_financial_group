Helping good people and institutions to be financially better
CKW Financial is an independent wealth advisory and investment consulting firm that balances global investment leadership and resources with a client focus. This perspective offers the freedom to grow assets by establishing customized portfolios managed in the client‘s best interest.

Our Philosophy

 
 



 
 


 
*Disclosure located at the bottom of this webpage
 
 
 
 



Our Philosophy
CKW Financial Group specializes in discretionary strategic balanced portfolio management and investment consulting services. We believe a well-diversified global portfolio, enhanced by a dynamic asset allocation process can offer investors (Individuals, Financial Advisors, Institutional Investors) the most consistent risk adjusted returns. Our goal is to protect capital during volatile markets while being prepared to capture incremental returns over time.
 
 
 





Hawaii Traditionalists
						 CKW captures the Hawaiian concept of “ahupua’a” which means “a parcel of land usually extending from the mountains to the sea”. Hawaiians understand that a holistic approach to the use of resources is necessary to survive and prosper. An understanding of the entire system of nature- water and air, mountains and fields – creates a community of mutual benefit. This holistic diversified concept of integrating natural resources is analogous to CKW’s philosophy of how understanding asset classes and effective balanced allocation of resources and diversification can enhance returns over time. 
					
 
 
 




Forward Thinkers
						 While we value tradition in proven practices, we also believe in the strength and necessity of innovation. We look at the present and future outlook for investment opportunities and base our strategies on global investment acumen. We focus on meeting client objectives, not chasing returns. As a Minority and Women owned firm, we provide a diverse set of viewpoints for our clients. 
					
 
 
 




Independent Advisor
						 CKW is an experienced independent RIA that serves private individuals, financial advisors and institutional clients. Independence gives us freedom to be completely objective in our approach and choice of resources that promotes doing what’s right for our investors over the long term. As an independent investment management firm, CKW has no affiliation with banks, brokerages or mutual fund companies. We take full fiduciary responsibility for the financial advice we provide. 
					
 
 
 




Comprehensive Consultative Wealth Manager
						 Whether you are an Individual looking to fund a college education, set up a charitable foundation, create an estate plan or a Financial Advisor looking to outsource your asset allocation or an Institutional Investor, we can develop an investment portfolio for your specific situation. We will help you prioritize your goals and objectives and then align a current investment strategy to help meet them. 
					
 
 
 
 
 




Innovative Solutions – Global ETF Strategic Portfolios
CKW manages several balanced global portfolios with different risk characteristics and time horizons. Employing a fundamental approach to research and investing in ETFs and Mutual Funds, the strategy is first to underweight low probability assets then to capture various sources of return among traditional and non-traditional asset classes over time.
 
 
 


Individual Investors
 
Sit down with us to let us know your goals and future plans, then we will develop the right plan for your needs and your family. We will make use of our globally diversified risk adjusted balanced ETF portfolios that have a relatively low-cost. They are included as part of most client investment plans where investors seek consistent, incremental returns over time.
 
 

Financial Advisors
 
Your clients rely on your advice, not only for your financial insight but also for their financial solutions to help them reach their goals. Make use of our globally diversified, risk adjusted balanced ETF portfolios that have a low cost for your client (basis points –inquire here) and that have achieved consistent top-tier returns for 3–5–10 years, as reported by Morningstar. For your clients, you can focus more of your time on better understanding their financial goals by spending more time with them and cultivating referrals to grow your business.
 
 

Institutional Investors
 
Pensions and Endowments fund, we will work with your board and finance committee to build the right asset allocation for your needs. Make use of our Institutional Investment Consulting experience through our globally diversified and balanced portfolio which is representative of our asset allocation and manager selection performance for over a decade. As Consultants, we believe asset allocation and manager selection determines long-term rates of return. CKW is a Fiduciary and our performance numbers, which have been verified by an independent third party, allows Institutional Fiduciaries to evaluate our track record for asset allocation and manager selection.
 
 
 


CKW’s business model is aligned to compliment these challenges and is capable of adjusting to the volatility of the markets and the evolving circumstances of our clients. To find out more about CKW, please call: +1 (808) 629-7600.

Advantages of Asset Allocation
 
 
 


There is no single investment principle that has more impact on a portfolio‘s performance than proper and balanced allocation among different asset classes. Investing across stocks, bonds and cash—your asset allocation—is one of the keys to long-term success. Therefore, when you select an advisor or investment consultant, ask for their independently verified performance numbers in order to help determine their asset allocation track record. Many Institutional investors delegate discretion to a Fiduciary Investment Consultant for asset allocation, manager selection, and manager due diligence. CKW is positioned to be responsible and accountable for its own asset allocation advice and implementation.
There are many investment vehicles at different costs that access both Equity (stocks) and Fixed Income (bonds). CKW currently uses low cost ETFs and Mutual Funds to capture the best ”Net of Fee“ rate of return for our client‘s asset allocation. Broad based ETFs also reduce manager interaction risk, producing and allowing intended allocations to capture incremental returns over time.
Minimizing risk while maximizing return is any investor’s prime goal. Asset allocation is an excellent tool for managing volatility of investments and controlling risks. While two of the Principals, who act as the Portfolio Managers, received their CIMA certification at Wharton, one of them also taught “Asset Allocation, Manager Selection and Due Diligence” as an Adjunct Professor for IMCAs CIMA certification at the University of Pennsylvania, Wharton School of Business.

How to Evaluate ETFs An efficient ETF produces maximum results with minimal input.

What is an ETN Investors typically use the term “ETF” to mean a lot of things that aren’t technically “exchange-traded funds”: commodity pools, grantor trusts and debt securities.

Why Are ETF’s So Tax Efficient? ETFs are vastly more tax efficient than competing mutual funds.

*FT 300 Disclosure: The 2015 Financial Times Top 300 Registered Investment Advisors is an independent listing produced by the Financial Times (June, 2015). The FT 300 is based on data gathered from RIA firms, regulatory disclosures, and the FT’s research. As identified by the FT, the listing reflected each practice’s performance in six primary areas, including assets under management, asset growth, compliance record, years in existence, credentials and accessibility. Neither the RIA firms nor their employees pay a fee to The Financial Times in exchange for inclusion in the FT 300. For 2015, 630 RIA firms that applied were then graded six criteria: AUM; AUM growth rate; years in existence; advanced industry credentials; online accessibility; and compliance records. FT augmented that information with their own research into the practices, including data from regulatory filings. The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviser. Areas of consideration include adviser assets under management, asset growth, the firm’s years in existence, industry certifications of key employees at the firms, SEC compliance record and online accessibility.

‘Top’ Financial Guidance - CKW Financial Group - MidWeek

















































































































































‘Top’ Financial Guidance

MidWeek Staff  on July 30, 2014 at 12:01 am

By Carl Choy 
Principal of CKW Financial Group
The inaugural edition of the Financial Times 300 Top Registered Investment Advisors (June 26, 2014, issue) begins by asking what makes a top quality adviser. With a methodology that includes assets under management, growth rate, compliance record, industry certifications and online accessibility, the question that follows is, “why publish this now?”

Carl Choy



As baby boomers retire and the financial landscape becomes increasingly complicated, the demand for top-quality advice has accelerated.
That trend has helped to propel the growth of the segment of the investment industry that, by definition, makes their living selling advice: registered investment advisors, or RIAs. One indication of how the RIA sector has grown is that they now sell more in combined mutual fund and exchange traded fund assets than the Big Four brokerages.
While many financial advisers in big brokerages have evolved to where they now spend more time providing advice than carrying out “buy” and “sell” transactions, RIAs always have been advisers first. As a group, RIAs have shown tremendous growth in the past 10-15 years and a large part of that stems from advances in technology, which allow a small office to offer the same financial reporting, tax accounting and market analysis as the big brokerages.
CKW Financial Group is honored to be the only RIA firm from Hawaii on the Top 300 list. CKW’s mission always has been to help good people and institutions be financially better, and we continue to take a holistic approach to managing investments toward achieving clients’ goals. While we value tradition in proven practices, we also believe in the strength and necessity of innovation — finding new solutions using the latest technology.
As a RIA, we have the freedom to research, select, invest and trade anywhere, unbound by corporate, institutional and market parameters. In that way we are able to act in the best financial interests of our clients. In addition, we operate as a fiduciary and take full fiduciary responsibility, in writing, for financial advice we provide.
Thanks to our clients’ faith and confidence in us, we received this nice recognition.

Helping good people and institutions to be financially better
CKW Financial is an independent wealth advisory and investment consulting firm that balances global investment leadership and resources with a client focus. This perspective offers the freedom to grow assets by establishing customized portfolios managed in the client‘s best interest.

Our Philosophy

 
 



 
 


 
*Disclosure located at the bottom of this webpage
 
 
 
 



Our Philosophy
CKW Financial Group specializes in discretionary strategic balanced portfolio management and investment consulting services. We believe a well-diversified global portfolio, enhanced by a dynamic asset allocation process can offer investors (Individuals, Financial Advisors, Institutional Investors) the most consistent risk adjusted returns. Our goal is to protect capital during volatile markets while being prepared to capture incremental returns over time.
 
 
 





Hawaii Traditionalists
						 CKW captures the Hawaiian concept of “ahupua’a” which means “a parcel of land usually extending from the mountains to the sea”. Hawaiians understand that a holistic approach to the use of resources is necessary to survive and prosper. An understanding of the entire system of nature- water and air, mountains and fields – creates a community of mutual benefit. This holistic diversified concept of integrating natural resources is analogous to CKW’s philosophy of how understanding asset classes and effective balanced allocation of resources and diversification can enhance returns over time. 
					
 
 
 




Forward Thinkers
						 While we value tradition in proven practices, we also believe in the strength and necessity of innovation. We look at the present and future outlook for investment opportunities and base our strategies on global investment acumen. We focus on meeting client objectives, not chasing returns. As a Minority and Women owned firm, we provide a diverse set of viewpoints for our clients. 
					
 
 
 




Independent Advisor
						 CKW is an experienced independent RIA that serves private individuals, financial advisors and institutional clients. Independence gives us freedom to be completely objective in our approach and choice of resources that promotes doing what’s right for our investors over the long term. As an independent investment management firm, CKW has no affiliation with banks, brokerages or mutual fund companies. We take full fiduciary responsibility for the financial advice we provide. 
					
 
 
 




Comprehensive Consultative Wealth Manager
						 Whether you are an Individual looking to fund a college education, set up a charitable foundation, create an estate plan or a Financial Advisor looking to outsource your asset allocation or an Institutional Investor, we can develop an investment portfolio for your specific situation. We will help you prioritize your goals and objectives and then align a current investment strategy to help meet them. 
					
 
 
 
 
 




Innovative Solutions – Global ETF Strategic Portfolios
CKW manages several balanced global portfolios with different risk characteristics and time horizons. Employing a fundamental approach to research and investing in ETFs and Mutual Funds, the strategy is first to underweight low probability assets then to capture various sources of return among traditional and non-traditional asset classes over time.
 
 
 


Individual Investors
 
Sit down with us to let us know your goals and future plans, then we will develop the right plan for your needs and your family. We will make use of our globally diversified risk adjusted balanced ETF portfolios that have a relatively low-cost. They are included as part of most client investment plans where investors seek consistent, incremental returns over time.
 
 

Financial Advisors
 
Your clients rely on your advice, not only for your financial insight but also for their financial solutions to help them reach their goals. Make use of our globally diversified, risk adjusted balanced ETF portfolios that have a low cost for your client (basis points –inquire here) and that have achieved consistent top-tier returns for 3–5–10 years, as reported by Morningstar. For your clients, you can focus more of your time on better understanding their financial goals by spending more time with them and cultivating referrals to grow your business.
 
 

Institutional Investors
 
Pensions and Endowments fund, we will work with your board and finance committee to build the right asset allocation for your needs.

Advantages of Asset Allocation
 
 
 


There is no single investment principle that has more impact on a portfolio‘s performance than proper and balanced allocation among different asset classes. Investing across stocks, bonds and cash—your asset allocation—is one of the keys to long-term success. Therefore, when you select an advisor or investment consultant, ask for their independently verified performance numbers in order to help determine their asset allocation track record. Many Institutional investors delegate discretion to a Fiduciary Investment Consultant for asset allocation, manager selection, and manager due diligence. CKW is positioned to be responsible and accountable for its own asset allocation advice and implementation.
There are many investment vehicles at different costs that access both Equity (stocks) and Fixed Income (bonds). CKW currently uses low cost ETFs and Mutual Funds to capture the best ”Net of Fee“ rate of return for our client‘s asset allocation. Broad based ETFs also reduce manager interaction risk, producing and allowing intended allocations to capture incremental returns over time.
Minimizing risk while maximizing return is any investor’s prime goal. Asset allocation is an excellent tool for managing volatility of investments and controlling risks. While two of the Principals, who act as the Portfolio Managers, received their CIMA certification at Wharton, one of them also taught “Asset Allocation, Manager Selection and Due Diligence” as an Adjunct Professor for IMCAs CIMA certification at the University of Pennsylvania, Wharton School of Business.

*FT 300 Disclosure: The 2015 Financial Times Top 300 Registered Investment Advisors is an independent listing produced by the Financial Times (June, 2015). The FT 300 is based on data gathered from RIA firms, regulatory disclosures, and the FT’s research. As identified by the FT, the listing reflected each practice’s performance in six primary areas, including assets under management, asset growth, compliance record, years in existence, credentials and accessibility. Neither the RIA firms nor their employees pay a fee to The Financial Times in exchange for inclusion in the FT 300. For 2015, 630 RIA firms that applied were then graded six criteria: AUM; AUM growth rate; years in existence; advanced industry credentials; online accessibility; and compliance records. FT augmented that information with their own research into the practices, including data from regulatory filings. The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviser. Areas of consideration include adviser assets under management, asset growth, the firm’s years in existence, industry certifications of key employees at the firms, SEC compliance record and online accessibility.
