  Can You Say This About Your Bank?

"First National Bank of Northern California has been with us all the way!"

– Customer, Dee Harley, of Harley Farms Goat Dairy


FNB Bancorp
FNB Bancorp is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of California on February 23, 2001. As a bank holding company, the Company is authorized to engage in the activities permitted under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and regulations there under. Our principle office is located at 975 El Camino Real, South San Francisco, California, 94080, and our telephone number is (650) 588-6800.

FNB Bancorp is a single bank holding company that owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of First National Bank of Northern California, a national banking association ("First National Bank" or the "Bank"). FNB Bancorp was formed at the direction of the Board of Directors of the Bank in order to reorganize the Bank into a holding company structure, with the approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The Bank and FNB Bancorp entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated November 1, 2001. (The "Plan of Reorganization") for this purpose, and the shareholders of the Bank approved the Plan of Reorganization at a Special Meeting of the shareholders of the Bank held February 27, 2002. The Plan of Reorganization was consummated on March 15, 2002. Each outstanding share of the common stock, par value $1.25 per share, of the Bank (other than any shares as to which dissenters' rights of appraisal have been properly exercised) was converted into one share of the
common stock of the Company, and the former holders of Bank common stock became the holders of all of the Company common stock. The purpose of forming FNB Bancorp was to provide our shareholders the ability to own shares of bank acquisition targets or financial services companies, if such acquisition opportunities arose. Commencing on March 18, 2002, the common stock of the company has been quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol "FNBG".

Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

I Agree

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).

CEO Message
Much of the new technology being applied to the banking industry is designed for the convenience of the customer, making it increasingly unnecessary to visit a branch.  Online banking, billpay, remote deposit capture...these are pretty nice advances, but we also believe in face to face banking.  Having a choice is what's important.

Take Steps to Avoid Foreclosure


Home Loan Financial Difficulties?
                                    If you are unable to afford your mortgage payments and wish to avoid foreclosure, the options available to you
                                    depend largely on the type of loan you have and the condition and value of your property. Those options may include
                                    a refinance or new financing depending on your circumstances, the value and condition of your property, your
                                    current income, whether to consider a sale of your property, and sometimes other factors. In some cases we'll
                                    consider a loan "workout" or modification if it makes economic sense for both of us. You will need to contact
                                    us at the number below to explore whether any of these options might be possible for you. Each loan must be
                                    reviewed individually to determine the best option for you. If you decide to contact us to explore options to
                                    foreclosure, we will need you to provide us with current financial information, including a statement of your
                                    current monthly income and expenses, pay stubs, a list of balances owed to other creditors (e.g., credit cards),
                                    balance and payment information on any other loans secured by your home, your most recent tax return, and
                                    information regarding the condition of your property along with any other property information you may wish
                                    to provide us that will help us determine the value of your property. To obtain further information or discuss
                                    your loan with a mortgage loan specialist, please contact Randy Brugioni by calling 1-800-227-4962 or
                                    1-650-875-4848.
                                

                                    Housing and Urban Development (HUD) can help you too.
                                    HUD is a U.S. Government agency the increases home ownership and supports home buyers. HUD offers free or
                                    low-cost counseling throughout the country. To find out where the nearest counseling agency is in your area,
                                    please call 1-800-569-4287 or view the HUD website at: http://www.hud.gov.
                                

A Safe and Solid Bank


WHO ARE WE?
                                    First National Bank of Northern California opened in 1963 to serve the credit and deposit needs of Daly City.
                                    The large nationwide banks present at that time, were doing what they continue to do today, taking local
                                    deposits out of the local community and shifting that capital across the state and the country. Our business
                                    model, however, hasn't changed since 1963, using the same philosophy that drove the bank in 1963; quality
                                    banking products that offer real value to our customers, a safe and sound depository for their funds and
                                    conservative lending to local businesses and consumers. First National Bank of Northern California has become
                                    a vital resource for the communities we serve over the years, through donations, volunteer work and advocacy,
                                    helping to create a higher quality of life in every community we serve. Today, the true test of a bank is how
                                    well we can weather difficult economic times; and today's economic environment is unlike any we have seen in
                                    our lifetime. That said, we continue to make loans; we're well capitalized and have plenty of liquidity.
                                    We are profitable and continue to pay a quarterly dividend to our shareholders.
                                

WHO WATCHES OVER US?
                                    We are closely regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, The Federal Reserve, the FDIC
                                    and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Many of the financial services companies and some banks who
                                    played fast and loose with the rules that contributed to the current economic mess are no longer in existence!
                                    You can access our financial reports by going to our Investor Relations web page and clicking on the SEC
                                    Information link. There you will find our financial reports along with other press releases.
                                

WHY BANK WITH US?
                                    There are many banks to choose from and technologies that allow for internet banking with banks that have
                                    no branches. But what if your business needs a loan or advice? Where do you go? Do you want an impersonal
                                    credit score formula to determine whether you are "worthy" for a loan? At First National Bank of Northern
                                    California you can discuss your needs with a professional banker who takes a real interest in your success
                                    and the success of your business. We have been doing that for 46 years and have remained independent, making
                                    our credit decisions locally based upon your individual needs. If your preference is to bank via the internet
                                    we can offer you safe and secure online banking; if you prefer traditional face to face banking, we have 13
                                    convenient locations on the San Francisco peninsula and we welcome your presence. We know you have many
                                    choices in banks today and we believe you should have choices in how you bank; either on line or in person.
                                    Finally, First National Bank of Northern California's CEO was quoted in a recent San Francisco Chronicle
                                    article concerning the banking "crisis" Tom McGraw, chief executive of First National Bank in Northern
                                    California, said these smaller (banks) institutions are less affected by the national and global shocks
                                    because they tend to take deposits from and loan money into the same communities. "They used to say,
                                    'Too big to fail,' but now we're saying, 'Too small to fail,' " McGraw said. At First National Bank of
                                    Northern California you'll find banking professionals, common sense and a focus on you and your needs,
                                    not the needs of Wall St.
