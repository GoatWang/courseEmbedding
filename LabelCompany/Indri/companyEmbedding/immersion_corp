Nothing Thrills Like Touch
Billions of devices. One compelling experience. 





The Haptic Experience
Way back in 1993, when personal computing was still new, we envisioned taking it one step further. Our deep research into the then-experimental field of sensory technology paid off just two years later. The resulting touch feedback, which we dubbed “haptics,” delighted console gamers everywhere, and we haven’t stopped since. If you’re looking to transform your next digital experience into one consumers can literally feel, you’ve come to the right place.
Learn About Our Technology




Business Plus Haptics: It Just Feels Right
We’re touched by the dedication and enthusiasm of our world-famous clients in the mobile, wearable, content, advertising, and gaming spaces. They know that integrating haptics into their next big releases means real differentiation. Consumers get the memorable, immersive experiences they’re always looking for. And for businesses, that translates into clicks, sales, and unshakeable brand loyalty.

Our leadership team: touching what’s next.
We’ve always been a company of pioneers, and that’s especially true of the folks calling the shots. They know haptics is a fast-changing field, where new technologies and potentials open up daily. Understanding and using that information takes their special blend of insight, foresight, and a bold new outlook. That’s why we’re pleased to put our future directly in their hands.

Shake things up with us.
Work with great people, and make a true difference. If you live to create memorable experiences that amaze, surprise and delight, we need you. Your vision, passion, and collaboration can bring the magic of haptics to even more of the digital world. Fresh fruit, stocked break rooms, an onsite gym, and yoga classes are just a few of the ways we’ll show our appreciation, along with the usual health coverage, stock options and 401k matching. Welcome.

IMMERSION CORPORATION PRIVACY POLICY
This Privacy Policy is made available to you in order to make you aware of how Immersion collects and uses personally identifiable information you provide to us or that is collected via your visit to the Immersion.com website (the “Site”), and other information collected via use of Immersion products (“Products”).  By accessing the Site, you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this privacy statement.  Immersion is committed to data security, and protects your personally identifiable information.  Your “personally identifiable information” is information that enables us to identify you, such as your email address, name and mailing address.  In order to serve you better, Immersion may use your personally identifiable information to personalize your experience on our Site, or to send you communications that may be of interest, electronically or otherwise.

Collection of Personally Identifiable Information. You may browse Immersion.com without giving us any personally identifiable information.  You may choose to volunteer information, such as survey information, email address or site registrations, and your preferred means of communication.  Generally, this information is requested when you sign up for our ROI model, product inquiries, newsletters or download software.  If you tell us that you do not wish to have this information used as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes.  Immersion also collects information of visitors and aggregate web traffic information, to our Site including: domain name, referring website address, information regarding pages accessed, number of unique visitors, the top paths through the Site, entry pages and exit pages, etc.  This information is collected through the use of “web bugs” – transparent images placed on a web page to collect information about the page and how it is used.
Your Control over Personally Identifiable Information.  When you sign up for an email list, you will be given instructions at that time on how to remove yourself from that list.  Access to certain of Immersion’s webpages require a login and password. The use of those webpages and the information or programs downloadable from those pages are governed by a written agreement between you and Immersion.  Your personally identifiable information may be retained by Immersion to verify compliance with the agreement, log software licenses granted, track software downloaded from those pages, and track use of other applications available on the Immersion Site.
Security of Your Personally Identifiable Information.  Immersion is committed to taking reasonable steps to protect the personally identifiable information that you provide to us.
Corrections to Your Personally Identifiable Information.  The accuracy of your personally identifiable information is important to Immersion.

Use of Personally Identifiable Information.  Immersion will not trade, sell or rent your personally identifiable information.  Immersion will not share your personally identifiable information with third parties without your permission, other than for the limited exceptions listed below. Immersion may use personally identifiable information to contact you or your company for marketing purposes.  Immersion also may make personally identifiable information available to third parties, including trusted business partners, for marketing purposes.  In some cases, we use other companies to provide limited services on our behalf.  We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using the information for any other purpose.  Immersion may store and disclose personally identifiable information as allowed or required by applicable law, including making disclosures that are necessary or advisable to: (a) protect the rights, safety or property of users of our Site, the public, or Immersion or our Site suppliers; and (b) conform to legal or regulatory requirements.  Also, Immersion.com may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related Site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will not include any personally identifiable information.

Product Analytic Data.  Immersion may collect certain data when you use a Product (“Product Analytic Data”), including a Product incorporated into a third-party application, product or service (a “Third Party App”). Product Analytic Data may include information about your device (such as brand, model, operating system and component types), the Product used (such as name, version and settings of the Product), the Third-Party App running the Product, usage of the Product (such as which Product content was played, how much of the Product content was played, whether that Product content was downloaded/streamed or resided in the device, and whether the Product functionality was muted), and the date and time that such information was gathered.  Immersion also may assign a number to identify your device, derived from one or more unique device identifiers.  This identification number is different from any built-in identification number for your device (such as your IMEI) and does not reveal to Immersion any such built-in identification number.  We may use and disclose the information we collect for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.

Immersion Logo

Immersion’s brands, marks, names, and logos are among the company’s most important and valuable corporate assets. Please refer to our list of Trademarks and Patent Markings.
This Immersion Trademark and Logo Usage Policy is applicable to Immersion Corporation, and all Immersion organizations worldwide (collectively, “Immersion”), and to Immersion resellers, developers, customers, advertising agencies, consultants, professional writers and editors, licensees and to third parties making reference to Immersion Trademarks.
The Immersion Trademark and Logo Usage Policy sets forth the authorized policies for using or referring to Immersion brands, trademarks, product and service names, logos and slogans.
IMMERSION’S TRADEMARK RIGHTS
As the owner of its trademarks, Immersion has the exclusive right to use its trademarks, as well as the right to stop others from using its trademarks improperly or without authorization.
Identification of Immersion products or services is the sole permissible use of Immersion trademarks and logos.  The following is a non-exhaustive list of impermissible uses of Immersion trademarks and logos:

No Immersion trademark or logo may be incorporated into or used as part of a third party’s own logo, company name, product logo or otherwise.
No Immersion trademark or logo may be used in any way that is likely to be confusing, misleading or deceptive as to the true identity or source of products, services, materials, courses or programs.
No mark that is misleadingly similar in design or appearance to any Immersion mark or infringes on Immersion trademark rights may be used.
No Immersion trademark or logo may be used in any manner that is likely to disparage, dilute or negatively affect Immersion’s reputation.
No Immersion trademark or logo may be used in a way that is likely to imply that the user, its products, or its services are endorsed by, sponsored or affiliated with Immersion, without written permission from Immersion.

Immersion will pursue its legal rights against those who engage in any of the aforementioned activities or any other activities that infringe on Immersion trademark rights.
PROPER USE OF TRADEMARKS AND SYMBOLS
You may refer to Immersion products and services by their associated Immersion trademarks and service marks, so long as such references (a) are truthful, fair, and not misleading, and (b) comply with this Policy.

When referencing Immersion as a company, the Immersion name may be used as a proper noun.  An exception to the “use as an adjective only” rule exists where the reference to Immersion is a reference to the company.  The Immersion name may, in that instance, be used as a trade name; no trademark symbol is needed when referring to the company.

Correct: The TouchSense® product is an application …
Incorrect: TouchSense®’s product …
Immersion trademarks may not be shortened, abbreviated or made into acronyms.

Incorrect: “TS.” and “TchSne.”

PROPER TRADEMARK ATTRIBUTION
Include a trademark notice when referring to a trademark.  Place an appropriate trademark notice symbol (® or ™) adjacent to the first and most prominent reference to the trademark.  Do not add a space between the trademark name and the symbol.  The symbol should be in superscript or subscript. In the absence of those symbols, a parenthetical notation such as (TM) is acceptable.
Correct: Immersion TouchSense® Haptic Enabling Kit for Mobile OEMS

Invest in the Future.


	As an investor, you have a unique opportunity to get behind a technology that is just beginning to reach its full potential. Just as touch input changed the way that billions of devices receive input from humans, touch feedback will change the way devices convey information back to us.  From mobile phones to wearables, game consoles to automobiles, haptic feedback is enriching the way that people interact with digital technology.  And the best is yet to come as content on mobile, video, games and social networks, become richer, more realistic and more personal with haptics.  At Immersion, we’re changing the digital world.

The Best Haptic Experiences Start
with Immersion








It’s not hard to make a phone buzz. But the world? That’s different.
It’s the subtle difference you feel as you downshift into a corner. The heart-gripping sensation of tires at the edge of traction. The exhilaration of accelerating out of the apex.
It’s mobile gamers who play longer and make more in-app purchases. It’s videos that get shared, over and over. And advertising that finally converts the way it should.
That’s the difference Immersion makes, in billions of devices around the world.

					Full Description



Immersion Corporation, incorporated on August 26, 1999, is a licensing company focused on the creation, design, development and licensing of haptic technologies that allow people to use their sense of touch more when operating a range of digital devices. The Company develops, licenses and supports a range of software and intellectual property (IP). The Company is focused on the target markets, including mobile devices, wearables, consumer, mobile entertainment and other content; console gaming; automotive; medical, and commercial. The Company has adopted a hybrid business model, under which the Company provides advanced tactile software, related tools and technical assistance to certain customers, and offers licenses to its patented IP to other customers. Its licenses enable its customers to deploy haptically-enabled devices, content and other offerings, which they typically sell under their own brand names. The Company and its subsidiaries hold patents, covering a range of digital technologies and including many of the ways in which touch-related technology can be incorporated into and between hardware products and components, systems software, application software, and digital content.The Company provides software, IP and haptic expertise to its customers through a range of different offerings, including software licenses, patent licenses, and combined licenses that cover both software and patents. In most cases, its software licenses include services, design tools and software development kits (SDKs), as well as licenses to its patents to the extent necessary to implement the licensed software, with the specific rights and restrictions to the applicable patents described in the license agreements. When the Company offers patent licenses, the Company provides the customer with a defined right to use its patented innovations in its own products by allowing them to use specified aspects of its international patent portfolio, subject to limitations by specific field of use and other restrictions. In certain cases, the Company also provides its patent licensees with enablement tools, such as reference designs and prototypes, technical and design services, as well as other assistance and support.Software OfferingsThe Company generally licenses its software as part of Immersion TouchSense-branded offerings that are intended to address the needs of its target markets. Its TouchSense offerings include haptic creation, deployment and playback software, SDKs, developer and enablement tools and documentation, technical and design services, as well as support. Targeted to the mobile device, wearables, and consumer electronics markets, TouchSense Haptic Enabling Kits consist of solutions enabling the design of tactile effects used in device interfaces and applications. Its toolkits enable original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and their suppliers to add customized haptic experiences to their own branded devices and other products. Its offerings include TouchSense Haptic Enabling Kit for Mobile OEMs and TouchSense Haptic Enabling Kit for Wearable OEMs. Targeted to mobile developers, platform providers, advertisers and content creators, TouchSense Haptic Development Kits consist of design tools, integration software and effect libraries that allow for the design, encoding and playback of tactile effects in mobile content, including games, advertisements and video.Patent LicensesThe Company has built a portfolio of patents covering various foundational aspects and commercial applications of haptic technology. Its portfolio includes over 2,100 issued or pending patents across the world, which support its TouchSense offerings.Haptic ExpertiseThe Company offers its services to licensees to enable them design and integrate touch effects into their products. This expertise includes engineering and integration services, design kits for prototyping, authoring tools, and application programming interfaces (APIs). The Company offers engineering assistance, including technical and design assistance and integration services that allow its licensees to incorporate its touch-enabling solutions and technologies into their products. The Company offers product development solutions, including software libraries, design, prototype creation, technology transfer, actuator selection, component sourcing, SDKs, sample source code, comprehensive documentation, and other engineering services. In addition, the Company offers testing and certification services to licensees and ecosystem participants, such as actuator vendors.The Company offers several design kits for customers to use for technology evaluation, internal evaluation, usability testing, and focus group testing. The kits include components and documentation that designers, engineers, and system integrators need for prototyping tactile effects into existing or sample products and applications. In addition to TouchSense Haptic Development Kits, the Company licenses authoring tools that enable haptic designers and software developers in other markets, such as console gaming, to quickly design and incorporate customized touch feedback into their applications. Authoring tools allow designers to create, modify, experience, and save or restore haptic effects for a haptically-enabled device. Its APIs provide haptic-effect generation capability. Some of its haptic APIs are device independent (they work with scroll wheels, rotary knobs, joysticks, and other devices). Its software driver and API technologies can be ported to a range of operating systems, including Android, Tizen, Linux and Windows.MarketsThe Company offers TouchSense Haptic Enabling Kits and patent licenses, as well as haptic expertise, to OEMs in the mobile device, wearables, and consumer electronics markets. In addition, certain of its integrated circuit partners preload their integrated circuits with certain of its less fully-featured TouchSense software and offer these integrated circuits to OEMs in the mobile device market. Its licensees include makers of mobile devices, including Fujitsu, Gionee, HTC, Huawei, Kyocera, LG Electronics, Meizu, and Toshiba, as well as integrated circuit manufacturers, such as Texas Instruments. In addition to working with device manufacturers, the Company provides its TouchSense Haptic Development Kits to application developers, advertising networks and other content ecosystem participants to enable them to incorporate tactile effects into mobile games, advertisements and other content.The Company has licensed its patents directly to Microsoft and Sony Computer Entertainment for use in their console gaming products. Additionally, the Company has licensed its patents to third party gaming peripheral manufacturers and distributors for use in spinning mass and force feedback devices, such as controllers, steering wheels and joysticks, to be used with personal computer (PC) platforms running on Microsoft Windows and other operating systems, as well as in connection with video game consoles made by Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo and others. The Company offers patent licenses and assistance, such as reference designs, prototypes and enablement services to automotive makers and suppliers. The Company offers patent licenses to the medical market. Its licensees include CAE Healthcare, Laerdal Medical A/S, Simbionix, Stryker Medical and SOFAR.

					Full Description



Immersion Corporation, incorporated on August 26, 1999, is a licensing company focused on the creation, design, development and licensing of haptic technologies that allow people to use their sense of touch more when operating a range of digital devices. The Company develops, licenses and supports a range of software and intellectual property (IP). The Company is focused on the target markets, including mobile devices, wearables, consumer, mobile entertainment and other content; console gaming; automotive; medical, and commercial. The Company has adopted a hybrid business model, under which the Company provides advanced tactile software, related tools and technical assistance to certain customers, and offers licenses to its patented IP to other customers. Its licenses enable its customers to deploy haptically-enabled devices, content and other offerings, which they typically sell under their own brand names. The Company and its subsidiaries hold patents, covering a range of digital technologies and including many of the ways in which touch-related technology can be incorporated into and between hardware products and components, systems software, application software, and digital content.The Company provides software, IP and haptic expertise to its customers through a range of different offerings, including software licenses, patent licenses, and combined licenses that cover both software and patents. In most cases, its software licenses include services, design tools and software development kits (SDKs), as well as licenses to its patents to the extent necessary to implement the licensed software, with the specific rights and restrictions to the applicable patents described in the license agreements. When the Company offers patent licenses, the Company provides the customer with a defined right to use its patented innovations in its own products by allowing them to use specified aspects of its international patent portfolio, subject to limitations by specific field of use and other restrictions. In certain cases, the Company also provides its patent licensees with enablement tools, such as reference designs and prototypes, technical and design services, as well as other assistance and support.Software OfferingsThe Company generally licenses its software as part of Immersion TouchSense-branded offerings that are intended to address the needs of its target markets. Its TouchSense offerings include haptic creation, deployment and playback software, SDKs, developer and enablement tools and documentation, technical and design services, as well as support. Targeted to the mobile device, wearables, and consumer electronics markets, TouchSense Haptic Enabling Kits consist of solutions enabling the design of tactile effects used in device interfaces and applications. Its toolkits enable original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and their suppliers to add customized haptic experiences to their own branded devices and other products. Its offerings include TouchSense Haptic Enabling Kit for Mobile OEMs and TouchSense Haptic Enabling Kit for Wearable OEMs. Targeted to mobile developers, platform providers, advertisers and content creators, TouchSense Haptic Development Kits consist of design tools, integration software and effect libraries that allow for the design, encoding and playback of tactile effects in mobile content, including games, advertisements and video.Patent LicensesThe Company has built a portfolio of patents covering various foundational aspects and commercial applications of haptic technology. Its portfolio includes over 2,100 issued or pending patents across the world, which support its TouchSense offerings.Haptic ExpertiseThe Company offers its services to licensees to enable them design and integrate touch effects into their products. This expertise includes engineering and integration services, design kits for prototyping, authoring tools, and application programming interfaces (APIs). The Company offers engineering assistance, including technical and design assistance and integration services that allow its licensees to incorporate its touch-enabling solutions and technologies into their products. The Company offers product development solutions, including software libraries, design, prototype creation, technology transfer, actuator selection, component sourcing, SDKs, sample source code, comprehensive documentation, and other engineering services. In addition, the Company offers testing and certification services to licensees and ecosystem participants, such as actuator vendors.The Company offers several design kits for customers to use for technology evaluation, internal evaluation, usability testing, and focus group testing. The kits include components and documentation that designers, engineers, and system integrators need for prototyping tactile effects into existing or sample products and applications. In addition to TouchSense Haptic Development Kits, the Company licenses authoring tools that enable haptic designers and software developers in other markets, such as console gaming, to quickly design and incorporate customized touch feedback into their applications. Authoring tools allow designers to create, modify, experience, and save or restore haptic effects for a haptically-enabled device. Its APIs provide haptic-effect generation capability. Some of its haptic APIs are device independent (they work with scroll wheels, rotary knobs, joysticks, and other devices). Its software driver and API technologies can be ported to a range of operating systems, including Android, Tizen, Linux and Windows.MarketsThe Company offers TouchSense Haptic Enabling Kits and patent licenses, as well as haptic expertise, to OEMs in the mobile device, wearables, and consumer electronics markets. In addition, certain of its integrated circuit partners preload their integrated circuits with certain of its less fully-featured TouchSense software and offer these integrated circuits to OEMs in the mobile device market. Its licensees include makers of mobile devices, including Fujitsu, Gionee, HTC, Huawei, Kyocera, LG Electronics, Meizu, and Toshiba, as well as integrated circuit manufacturers, such as Texas Instruments. In addition to working with device manufacturers, the Company provides its TouchSense Haptic Development Kits to application developers, advertising networks and other content ecosystem participants to enable them to incorporate tactile effects into mobile games, advertisements and other content.The Company has licensed its patents directly to Microsoft and Sony Computer Entertainment for use in their console gaming products. Additionally, the Company has licensed its patents to third party gaming peripheral manufacturers and distributors for use in spinning mass and force feedback devices, such as controllers, steering wheels and joysticks, to be used with personal computer (PC) platforms running on Microsoft Windows and other operating systems, as well as in connection with video game consoles made by Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo and others. The Company offers patent licenses and assistance, such as reference designs, prototypes and enablement services to automotive makers and suppliers. The Company offers patent licenses to the medical market. Its licensees include CAE Healthcare, Laerdal Medical A/S, Simbionix, Stryker Medical and SOFAR.
