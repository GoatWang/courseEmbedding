A Unique Opportunity

Archean Capital Partners (Archean) is a joint venture between Veritable, L.P. and Moelis Asset Management LP.  Archean is a private market investment platform that seeks to deploy capital with highly qualified portfolio managers who are interested in starting their own firms.  Archean is focused on opportunities in such specialties as buyout, growth, restructuring/turnaround, direct lending, and real estate.


Veritable’s primary objective with regard to Archean is to generate enhanced returns for its clients through careful fund manager selection and thoughtful investment structuring.







“Investments by Archean will give managers the certainty of a large, initial source of capital for an early first close.” 


Archean is able to provide portfolio managers with the initial investment capital, advice and infrastructure necessary to launch new, independent firms.  Archean’s involvement should also enhance the manager’s ability to secure additional capital commitments from other investors.
The complexities of researching and successfully investing with emergent private market firms require special skills. Veritable has made dozens of substantial investments with a variety of early-stage alternative strategy managers over the past two decades.  We believe this experience contributes to our firm’s deep knowledge and extensive context as it relates to alternative market investing.
