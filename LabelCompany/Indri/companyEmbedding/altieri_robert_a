Robert A. Altieri to Join Howard Bank | Business Wire
























































Robert A. Altieri to Join Howard Bank






April 22, 2013 12:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time



ELLICOTT CITY, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Howard Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq: HBMD), the parent company of Howard Bank 
      (the “Bank”), reported that Howard Bank is very pleased to announce that 
      25 year banking veteran Robert A. Altieri will join the bank as 
      President of the Mortgage Division, Executive Vice President of Howard 
      Bank and Head of Specialty Lending.
    

      Mr. Altieri will join the Howard Bank team in late April. He was most 
      recently Chief Executive Officer and President of Carrollton Bancorp, 
      Carrollton Bank, Carrollton Mortgage Services, Inc. and Carrollton 
      Community Development Corporation where he led each entity over a 
      twelve-year period, prior to the recent acquisition of Carrollton Bank.
    

      Mary Ann Scully, Howard Bank CEO and President stated "Howard Bank has 
      consistently and successfully focused on profitable growth. We continue 
      to gain share in the southern portion of Greater Baltimore in Howard and 
      Anne Arundel counties and are in the midst of a physical and team 
      expansion into Baltimore city, and Baltimore County, where we expect to 
      open a branch in downtown Towson later this year. We most recently 
      announced an agreement, subject to regulatory approval, to purchase a 
      branch in Harford County from Cecil Bank. Bob’s deep 
      executive experience, his unique understanding of the mortgage market 
      from both a banking and a mortgage company perspective and his broad and 
      deep connections to the Greater Baltimore area will make him an 
      invaluable asset to Howard Bank. We are very fortunate to 
      have someone with his knowledge and experience on board. The combination 
      of the existing team at Howard Bank, the addition of Bob Altieri, along 
      with our recent addition of Frank Turner, another long time and well 
      respected Baltimore banker positions us very well to not only continue 
      our growth, and to accelerate the pace of our expansion in both size and 
      into new geographic areas but to significantly broaden our product set 
      and diversify our revenue stream. We are all excited by the 
      opportunities ahead of us.”
    

      Mr. Altieri commented “I am excited about joining Howard Bank and their 
      management team. Over a short time, they have demonstrated their ability 
      to carry out a strategic plan to build the premier community bank in the 
      Baltimore Metropolitan Area and the future is bright for continued 
      organic growth and strategic acquisitions. I have no doubt Howard Bank 
      will be viewed as the premier community bank in our marketplace."
    

      This statements in this press release regarding our anticipated opening 
      of a branch in Towson, the Bank’s anticipated growth, potential 
      acquisitions and expansion, including into new geographic areas, and 
      broadening the Bank’s product set and diversifying its revenue stream, 
      are forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities 
      Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or the Securities and Exchange Commission 
      in its rules, regulations, and releases. We intend that such 
      forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created 
      thereby. Such statements are based on our current beliefs and 
      expectations and are inherently subject to significant business, 
      economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which 
      are beyond our control. In addition, such forward-looking statements are 
      subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and 
      decisions that are subject to change. Potential risks and uncertainties 
      include, but are not limited to, the risk of not receiving any required 
      regulatory approvals, unexpected changes in real estate values and local 
      and national economic conditions, unexpected changes in interest rates, 
      and changes in laws or government regulations or policies affecting 
      financial institutions. Accordingly, actual results may differ from 
      those expressed in the forward-looking statements, and the making of 
      such statements should not be regarded as a representation by the Bank 
      or Howard Bancorp, Inc. that results expressed therein will be achieved. 
      We do not undertake, and specifically disclaim any obligation, to 
      publicly release the result of any revisions that may be made to any 
      forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the 
      date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or 
      unanticipated events.
