These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection1. Baden Kramer Huffman Brodsky & Co PC20 Broad StNew York, NY 10005(212) 363-7020AttorneysWebsiteFrom Business: Fox Horan & Camerini is an international law firm that represents public and private companies and provides assistance with legal matters.

TESTIMONIALS




Thank you for the spreadsheet webinar. The webinar was informative and helpful. Although many of the concepts are known and understood by Industrial and Process Engineers, it is always helpful to have a straightforward review. The spreadsheet will be beneficial in being able to help identify areas of risk and areas that may require some attention.


Benchmark Electronics , ******** Engineer 





This was a very informative session, it did help my company by raising awareness in areas we lack policies.  The only thing I would suggest get added to the session is direct information relating to Accounting, ex. Taxation rules for record retention as they are some records which a company is required to keep indefinitely. 

First MCO, ***** Manager





Overall I found the video conference well organized and very informative.  The presenter, Ronald Adler, was certainly extremely knowledgeable and presented the subject matter in a well organized, direct and succinct manner.  Afford the attendee the ability to track and record paid attendance/activity without a lot of tracking and follow up in order to gather the necessary information required to record the CPEs earned and paid for.

Dynamic Marketing Systems, VP Finance & Human Resources





As this was our first experience, we did not know what to expect. I believe the webinar was informative and to the point, and explained to us the purpose of the I-9, and how the company can be  affected by an audit. It really motivated us to review our files and bring them up to date.



Young Transportation, ****Coach****





I have participated in several webinars hosted by Compliance Global on various H&S topics. They are always precise, technologically-oriented, and easy to use and partake in to further my knowledge of current Health and Safety regulations and topics.

Equistar Chemicals, LP, Senior Health and Safety Engineer
