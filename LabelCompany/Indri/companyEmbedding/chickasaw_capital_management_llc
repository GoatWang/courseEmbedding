MLP Background

 









A Master Limited Partnership ("MLP") is a publicly traded entity that is listed on the major U.S. stock exchanges and conforms to the same accounting, reporting and regulations as any publicly traded corporation. MLPs are significant owners of America’s energy infrastructure, controlling substantial assets involved in the transportation, processing and storage of the nation’s energy resources. These assets include major pipeline systems that deliver products such as natural gas, crude oil and refined fuels to end markets. Subsequently, nearly all other critical infrastructure is directly dependent upon the products that MLPs deliver.
MLPs offer many important attributes that make them a compelling infrastructure investment class. First, they have historically exhibited strong performance compared to the broader equity markets, with lower risk and lower correlation to other asset classes (see Figures MLP-1 and MLP-2). Second, MLPs pay quarterly cash distributions, providing the potential for attractive current yields. Typically, these distributions have been relatively stable and predictable because MLP business models have been dominated by fee-based, tariff-oriented revenues from businesses that are supported by inelastic U.S. energy demand. Lastly, MLPs offer the liquidity and flexibility of being publicly traded.
An MLP may be organized as either a limited partnership or a limited liability company. It enjoys the tax treatment of a partnership in which all tax items, including depreciation, pass fully to the unit holders through an annual Schedule K-1. Due to this partnership tax status, MLP investors avoid the double taxation experienced by shareholders of regular corporations. A partnership that does not generate 90% or more of its gross income from qualifying sources is treated as a corporation for tax purposes.
The strong returns that many MLP investors have historically enjoyed are based on two primary factors — yield and growth. MLPs have consistently traded in the public market with distribution yields that average almost 6% over the last thirteen years (see Figure MLP-3). Through modest growth in energy demand, along with an attractive rate structure, MLPs delivered an average growth of 4-8% annually during the period 1998-2008 (Source: Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC, MLP Primer – Third Edition, 2008).
MLPs appear well positioned to grow due to their significant participation in the build-out and consolidation of the U.S. energy infrastructure — an infrastructure that is forecast to require hundreds of billions of dollars in new development over the next decade. MLPs are also a likely buyer of many midstream energy infrastructure assets currently owned in both private and public corporate entities. Additionally, the MLP market is poised to potentially receive vast additional assets in new forms of energy infrastructure introduced by technological advancements. These assets include liquefied natural gas terminals, gas-to-liquids technology, bio-fuel assets, renewable energy assets, and coal gasification projects.
Midstream energy MLPs bear a close resemblance to a toll-road business model as most do not take ownership of the commodities transported and thus are minimally influenced by fluctuations in commodity prices. Many midstream MLPs receive a capacity reservation fee paid by a local utility or directly from the shipper in order to guarantee product delivery, which minimizes their dependency on volume. This type of contract should provide stable cash flow and help limit the MLP's credit risk as commodity prices fluctuate.
MLPs have the potential to provide a valuable inflation hedge within an infrastructure portfolio in three distinct ways. First, as mentioned above, by having market rates for both tariff and non-tariff assets tied to government reported inflation measures such as PPI (Producer Price Index) and CPI (Consumer Price Index), cash flows are not diluted in an inflationary world. Infrastructure assets also traditionally hedge inflation through the rising replacement cost of long-lived hard assets and/or Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth associated with increased asset use. Lastly, MLPs involved in businesses such as propane, heating oil, exploration & production, coal and certain gathering & processing activities have typically displayed more seasonal and commodity sensitivity associated with their cash flows. Inflation hedging capabilities can be expanded by increasing one's portfolio allocation toward MLPs involved with these more commodity sensitive businesses.
In addition to certain MLPs that possess commodity price exposure, all energy oriented MLPs are subject to energy risks. Changes in end-user demand or innovative energy alternatives could affect the need for transportation, processing and storage through the existing infrastructure owned by MLPs. Lower commodity prices affect certain MLPs in two ways: Firstly, lower commodity prices may negatively affect production, which could impact future MLP growth projects. Secondly, for those gathering and processing MLPs with equity volumes in their contracts, lower commodity prices on natural gas and natural gas liquids could lead to lower margins. For those MLPs with equity volume sensitivity, it is important to maintain effective and detailed hedging programs to help preserve cash flow and distributions.
MLPs have demonstrated a variety of compelling characteristics, balanced with modest risk in our view, over a long time period. MLPs may offer an attractive investment opportunity that should be considered as a potential core holding within any investor's asset allocation.

Business Continuity Planning

 










Chickasaw Capital Management, LLCChickasaw Securities, LLCBusiness Continuity Planning
We have developed a Business Continuity Plan on how we will respond to events that significantly disrupt our business. Since the timing and impact of disasters and disruptions are unpredictable, we will have to be flexible in responding to actual events as they occur. With that in mind, we are providing you with this information on our business continuity plan.
Contacting Us – If after a significant business disruption you cannot contact us as you usually do at 901-537-1866 or 800-743- 5410, you should go to our web site at www.chickasawcap.com for further direction.
Our Business Continuity Plan – We plan to quickly recover and resume business operations after a significant business disruption and respond by safeguarding our employees and property, making a financial and operational assessment, protecting the firm’s books and records, and allowing our customers to transact business.  In short, our business continuity plan is designed to permit our firm to resume operations as quickly as possible, given the scope and severity of the significant business disruption.
Our business continuity plan addresses: data backup and recovery; all mission critical systems; financial and operational  assessments; alternative communications with customers, employees, and regulators; alternate physical location of employees; critical supplier, contractor, bank and counter-party impact; regulatory reporting; and assuring our customers prompt access to their funds and securities if we are unable to continue our business.
We back up important records in a geographically separate area. While every emergency situation poses unique problems based on external factors, such as time of day and the severity of the disruption, our objective is to restore operations and be able to complete existing transactions and accept new transactions and payments within 24 hours. Your orders and requests for funds and securities could be delayed during this period.
Varying Disruptions – Significant business disruptions can vary in their scope, such as only our firm, a single building housing our firm, the business district where our firm is located, the city where we are located, or the whole region. Within each of these areas, the severity of the disruption can also vary from minimal to severe. In a disruption to only our firm or a building housing our firm, we will transfer our operations to a local site when needed and expect to recover and resume business within 2 hours. In a disruption affecting our business district, city, or region, we will transfer our operations to a site outside of the affected area, and recover and resume business within 24 hours. In either situation, we plan to continue in business and notify you how to contact us through our web site www.chickasawcap.com. If the significant business disruption is so severe that it prevents us from remaining in business, we will assure our customers prompt access to their funds and securities.
For more information – If you have questions about our business continuity planning, you can contact us at 901-537-1866 or 800-743-5410.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history, without adjustment for sales loads. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. The Fund’s I Shares received 3 stars over the three year period and 4 stars over the five year period. The Fund’s A Shares received 3 stars over the three year period and 4 stars over the five year period. The Fund’s C Shares received 3 stars over the three year period and 4 stars over the five year period. The five-year rating for C Shares is based on extended performance, using historical adjusted returns prior to the inception date of the Class C shares (Class C inception was 3/31/14), and reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class (inception date for Class I and A was 2/17/11), adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of the Class C shares. These star ratings for all share classes were among Energy Limited Partnership Funds with 76 funds in the three year period and 34 funds in the five year period. Past performance is no guarantee of future performance.

You should consider the MainGate MLP Fund's ("Fund") investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus that contains this and other information, click here. To have a hardcopy prospectus mailed to you, call 855.MLP.FUND (855.657.3863).
The Fund is offered only to United States residents and information on this website is intended only for such persons. Nothing on this website should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell shares of the Fund in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Index performance is not illustrative of fund performance. An investment cannot be made directly in an index. Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. The Fund is nondiversified, meaning it may concentrate its assets in fewer individual holdings than a diversified fund. Therefore, the Fund is more exposed to individual stock volatility than a diversified fund. The Fund will invest in Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) which concentrate investments in the natural resource sector and are subject to the risks of energy prices and demand and the volatility of commodity investments. Damage to facilities and infrastructure of MLPs may significantly affect the value of an investment and may incur environmental costs and liabilities due to the nature of their business. MLPs are subject to significant regulation and may be adversely affected by changes in the regulatory environment. Investments in smaller companies involve additional risks, such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. Investments in foreign securities involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. MLPs are subject to certain risks inherent in the structure of MLPs, including complex tax structure risks, limited ability for election or removal of management, limited voting rights, potential dependence on parent companies or sponsors for revenues to satisfy obligations, and potential conflicts of interest between partners, members and affiliates.
An investment in the Fund does not receive the same tax advantages as a direct investment in the MLP. The Fund is treated as a regular corporation or “C” corporation and is therefore subject to U.S. federal income tax on its taxable income at rates applicable to corporations (currently at a maximum rate of 35%) as well as state and local income taxes. MLP Funds accrue deferred income taxes for future tax liabilities associated with the portion of MLP distributions considered to be a tax-deferred return of capital and for any net operating gains as well as capital appreciation of its investments. This deferred tax liability is reflected in the daily NAV and as a result the MLP Fund’s after-tax performance could differ significantly from the underlying assets even if the pre-tax performance is closely tracked. The potential tax benefits from investing in MLPs depend on them being treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes.
Return of Capital: A return, by the Fund, of an investor's monies that is not considered income and therefore is not taxed because its amount does not exceed the original investment.

      Chickasaw Receives Morningstar’s Highest Rating
    



      Chickasaw MLP SMA Rated Five Stars by Morningstar
    





March 27, 2014 02:26 PM Eastern Daylight Time



MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Chickasaw MLP Separately Managed Account strategy has earned 
      Morningstar’s five-star rating overall, ranking within the top 10% of 
      the Equity Energy category for the period ending 12/31/13. This strategy 
      seeks to deliver results through discipline, fundamental research, 
      quantitative skill and managing risk. The Chickasaw MLP SMA model 
      portfolio is constructed with careful consideration of the risk/reward 
      equation and the expected total return while targeting an overall 
      attractive yield.
    


      “Our investment team is thrilled to receive the 5 star Morningstar 
      rating overall for the Chickasaw MLP SMA strategy,” says Matthew 
      G. Mead, Principal Chickasaw Capital Management. “The strategy is also 
      ranked #1 in the Equity Energy category for 5 year returns, which is an 
      honor for the entire Chickasaw investment team,” he concluded.
    

      Positioned among the very top MLP investment firms, Chickasaw Capital 
      Management’s portfolio managers average 19 years of MLP experience — which 
      they believe is the most in the U.S. The firm currently has $2.2 
      billion in assets under management.

      An MLP is a publicly traded entity that is listed on the major U.S. 
      stock exchanges and conforms to the same accounting, reporting and 
      regulations as any publicly traded corporation. MLPs are significant 
      owners of America’s energy infrastructure, controlling substantial 
      assets involved in the transportation, processing and storage of the 
      nation’s energy resources. These assets include major pipeline systems 
      that deliver products such as natural gas, crude oil and refined fuels 
      to end markets.

      Morningstar, Inc. is a leading provider of independent investment 
      research in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia. Morningstar 
      rates separate accounts from one to five stars based on how well they 
      have performed in comparison to similar funds. The Overall Morningstar 
      Rating for a separate account is derived from a weighted average of the 
      performance figures associated with its three-, five- and 10-year (if 
      applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. Within each Morningstar 
      Category, the top 10% of separate accounts receive five stars, the next
