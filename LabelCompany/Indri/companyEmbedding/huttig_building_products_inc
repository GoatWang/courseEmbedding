The FMCG major had reported Rs 1,174 crore profit for the corresponding quarter last year. Revenue for the quarter came in at Rs 9,094 crore, up 4.98 per cent YoY over Rs 8,662 crore reported in the same quarter last year. Volume growth remained flat, the company said in a BSE filing. The company said that sentiment during the quarter was cautious in the run up to GST rollout. It noted that despite high promotional intensity, stock pipelines remained low and varied across categories, channels and geographies. Ebitda margins expanded 160 basis points, the company said. The company was expected not to see GST-related destocking, as severe as witnessed during the demonetisation phase. Analysts noted that while there was no impact on consumer demand during the quarter, destocking by wholesalers was visible. Owing to the fact that the share of wholesale was lower for HUL, the impact was expected to be lesser for HUL against the expectation for many other staple companies. Cost of goods sold fell 75 basis points, while the company maintained advertisement and promotion spends during the quarter. Zero-based budgeting (ZBB) helped drive A&amp;P percentage down by 20 bps and other expenses down by 40 bps, the company said. Ebitda for the quarter rose 14 per cent, it said. Transition to GST was swift and smooth starting from day 1, the company said.ITC tanks 15% after GST Council hikes cess on cigarettesCigarette makers were choking in trade, with market leader ITC being hit the worst, its stock falling as much as 15 per cent to Rs 276.90 on the BSE, which reduced its market value to Rs. 3.37 lakh crore, compared to yesterday's closing value of Rs. 3.96 lakh crore. The slump comes on the back of the GST (Goods and Services Tax) Council led by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley hiking compensation cess on cigarettes. The hike came into effect from the midnight of Monday and Tuesday. The Sensex tanked as much as 450 points while the Nifty briefly slipped below the 9,800 mark to 9,792.05. Losses in the market were led by ITC, which has the second highest weightage (7.65 per cent) in the broader Nifty. Salt-to-hotels conglomerate ITC's cigarette division contributes nearly two-thirds of the FMCG (fast moving consumer goods sector) major's total revenues. Over 60 per cent of ITC's revenues come from its cigarettes business. Brokerage firm Macquarie said the increase in cess is clearly a negative for ITC. The increase in overall taxes/ higher retail prices would impact cigarette volume and earnings adversely, it said. The compensation cess on cigarettes consists of two components - an ad valorem tax of 5 per cent and another numerical cess on each category of filter and non-filter varieties. While the ad valorem has remained the same, the numerical cess linked to the length of cigarettes was increased by the Council. For non-filter 65 mm cigarettes, the numerical cess has been raised to Rs. 2,076 per 1,000 units; for non-filter 65-70 mm cigarettes it is Rs. 3,668 per 1,000 units. For filter category, 65 mm cigarettes will be charged Rs. 2,076 per 1,000 units, 65-70 mm will be charged Rs. 2,747 per 1,000 units and 70-75 mm will be charged Rs. 3,668 per 1,000 units. For other filter cigarettes the ad valorem has been increased to 36 per cent plus Rs. 4,170 per 1,000 units. Whether cigarette makers will increase prices is currently unclear. However, brokerages believe the companies would have to hike prices in order to protect margins. The increase in cess would bring in Rs 5,000 crore of additional tax revenue which otherwise would have gone to the manufacturers, Jaitley said after the emergency meeting that took place on Monday evening through video conferencing.Read MoreReutershuttig building products inchuttig building productseikonNavbharat TimesFeatured Today In TravelFrom our Global PartnersNorfolk Southern to consolidate operating divisionsBP says it is considering IPO of U.S. pipeline assetsIBM misses revenue estimatesU.S. health insurers dip after Senate bill flops1Huttig Building Products announces five-year $250 mln credit facility2Norfolk Southern to consolidate operating divisions3BP says it is considering IPO of U.S. pipeline assets4IBM misses revenue estimates5U.S. health insurers dip after Senate bill flops`

Huttig Building Products, Inc. Announces Five-Year $250 Million Credit Facility
























ST. LOUIS, Jul 18, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) --


                                        








Huttig Building Products, Inc.                 

/quotes/zigman/25767945/composite HBP
-0.66%


, a leading domestic distributor of millwork, building materials and wood products, today announced it has entered into an agreement to amend and extend its $160 million senior secured credit facility. The amendment, among other things, increases borrowing capacity from $160 million to $250 million, reduces interest rate charges and extends the facility for five years from the execution date, to July 14, 2022. The amended facility may be increased to $300 million, through an uncommitted $50 million accordion feature, subject to certain conditions. Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC (Wells Fargo), Bank of America, N.A. (Bank of America) and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JPMorgan) are lenders under the facility.        









"Our amended credit facility allows us to continue implementing our investment strategy," said Oscar A. Martinez, Huttig's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "While the facility did not expire until 2019, the increased size and extended maturity provides the capital structure flexibility to fuel our continued growth. We are pleased to continue our relationship with Wells Fargo, Bank of America and JPMorgan who have been valued lending partners."


                                        








Pricing for the amended facility is based on LIBOR plus 125 to 175 basis points, depending on levels of average borrowing availability. Under the prior facility amendment, pricing was at LIBOR plus 150 to 225 basis points.


                                        








Further details concerning the amendment are contained in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K which has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Huttig Building Products, Inc. Announces First Quarter 2017 Results




















May 01, 2017 16:30 ET

 | Source: Huttig Building Products, Inc.






First Quarter 2017 Highlights: Net sales of $175.7 millionGross margin of 20.2 percentTotal available liquidity of $81.8 million ST. LOUIS, May  01, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Huttig Building Products, Inc. (“Huttig”) (NASDAQ:HBP), a leading domestic distributor of millwork, building materials and wood products, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. “Our first quarter results show the continued growth of our business and an increase in operating expenses resulting from the continued, meaningful investments we are making in our accelerated growth strategy,” said Jon Vrabely, President and CEO of Huttig Building Products.  “While these investments are negatively impacting our short-term results, they are truly transformational in nature and provide the best opportunity to generate significant, sustained, profitable growth in the intermediate term.”           SUMMARY OF FIRST QUARTER 2017 RESULTS  (unaudited)  (In Millions, Except Per Share Data)                      Three Months Ended March 31,     2017   2016   Net sales  $  175.7  100.0% $  158.8 100.0%  Gross margin     35.5  20.2%    32.0 20.2%  Operating expenses     37.0  21.1%    28.9 18.2%  Operating (loss) income    (1.5) -0.9%    3.1 2.0%  (Loss) income from continuing operations before taxes    (2.1) -1.2%    2.6 1.6%  Net (loss) income    (0.9) -0.5%    1.4 0.9%  (Loss) income from continuing operations per share -         basic and diluted    (0.04)     0.06   Net (loss) income per share -  basic and diluted    (0.04)     0.06                     Results of Operations Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 Net sales were $175.7 million in 2017, which was $16.9 million, or 11 percent, higher than in 2016.  The increase was primarily due to higher levels of construction activity, the BenBilt Building Systems acquisition that we completed during the second quarter of 2016 and the effect of our special promotional winter buy sales occurring in the first quarter of 2017 compared to our special promotional winter buy sales occurring in the second quarter of 2016. Millwork sales increased 15 percent in 2017 to $91.9 million, primarily due to increased construction activity and the acquisition. Building products sales increased 10 percent in 2017 to $68.1 million primarily due to our special promotional winter buy sales.  Wood product sales decreased 4 percent in 2017 to $15.7 million. Gross margin increased 11 percent to $35.5 million in 2017 compared to $32.0 million in 2016.  As a percentage of sales, gross margin was 20.2 percent in both 2017 and 2016.  We continue to focus on our operational initiatives as well as improved product mix as we expand our value-add capabilities to serve the repair/remodel construction segment to advance long-term growth. Operating expenses increased $8.1 million to $37.0 million in 2017, compared to $28.9 million in 2016.  The increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs as a result of hiring additional personnel and expenses attributable to higher variable costs associated with increased sales, investment in the Huttig-Grip division and the acquisition.  As a percentage of sales, operating expenses increased to 21.1 percent in 2017 compared to 18.2 percent in 2016, reflecting increased headcount to service anticipated sales growth. Vrabely added, “The increase in our operating expenses is the result of continued investments in our people, as well as the expansion of our value-add service capabilities and the Huttig-Grip product line, which present significant, intermediate-term growth opportunities.” Net interest expense was $0.6 million in 2017 and $0.5 million in 2016.  The increase was primarily due to higher average debt and higher borrowing rates in 2017 compared to 2016. Income tax benefit of $1.2 million was recognized for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.  Income tax expense of $1.1 million was recognized in the first quarter of 2016.  As a result of the foregoing factors, we reported a loss from continuing operations of $0.9 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to income of $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $0.1 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $4.2 million in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measurement. See attached reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Balance Sheet Total available liquidity was $81.8 million at March 31, 2017, representing a 1 percent decrease over total liquidity of $82.6 million at March 31, 2016.  At March 31, 2017, total available liquidity included $1.1 million of cash plus $80.7 million of availability under the credit facility, while at March 31, 2016, total available liquidity included $2.8 million of cash plus $79.8 million of availability under the credit facility.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking information as defined by the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This information presents management's expectations, beliefs, plans and objectives regarding future financial performance, and assumptions or judgments concerning such performance. Any discussions contained in this press release, except to the extent that they contain historical facts, are forward-looking and accordingly involve estimates, assumptions, judgments and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those addressed in the forward-looking information, include, but are not limited to, the strength of construction, home improvement and remodeling markets and the recovery of the homebuilding industry to levels consistent with the historical average of total housing starts; the cyclical nature of our industry; the uncertainties resulting from the changes to policies and laws following the U.S. election in November 2016; the cost of environmental compliance, including actual expenses we may incur to resolve proceedings we are involved in arising out of a formerly owned facility in Montana; any limitations on our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets to reduce future taxable income and tax liabilities; our ability to comply with, and the restrictive effect of, the financial covenant  under our credit facility; the loss of a significant customer; deterioration of our customers’ creditworthiness or our inability to forecast such deteriorations; changes in commodity prices; risks associated with our private brands; termination of key supplier relationships; risks of international suppliers; competition with existing or new industry participants; goodwill impairment; the seasonality of our operations; significant uninsured claims; federal and state transportation regulations; fuel cost increases; our failure to attract and retain key personnel;  deterioration in our relationship with our unionized employees, including work stoppages or other disputes; funding requirements for multi-employer pension plans for our unionized employees; the integration of any businesses we acquire and the liabilities of such businesses; and product liability claims and other legal proceedings and contingencies. Other important factors that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those addressed in the forward-looking information, include, but are not limited to, those detailed in Huttig's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in other reports filed by Huttig with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. Non-GAAP Financial Measures  Huttig supplements its reporting of net income with non-GAAP measurement of Adjusted EBITDA. This supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. Huttig defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted for interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and other special significant items as listed in the table below. Huttig presents Adjusted EBITDA because it is a primary measure used by management, and by similar companies in the industry, to evaluate operating performance and Huttig believes it enhances investors’ overall understanding of the financial performance of our business.  Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized term under GAAP and does not purport to be an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance.  Huttig compensates for the limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures by using them to supplement GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors affecting the business.  Because not all companies use identical calculations, Huttig’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
