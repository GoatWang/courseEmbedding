The History of Henry Schein







































  


In 1932, at the height of the Depression, a pharmacist named Henry Schein started our company with the belief that we can fulfill our responsibilities as a corporate citizen by giving back to the communities we serve. Ever since then, we have pursued the ideal of "doing well by doing good." This spirit of individuals helping society is exemplified through Henry Schein Cares, our global corporate social responsibility program.

Stocks to Watch in Dental Products: Henry Schein Inc. and Sirona Dental Systems Inc.
Should you fill the cavities in your portfolio with these two dental stocks?











                Leo Sun
            

                (TMFSunLion)



            
            Dec 5, 2015 at 7:23AM
            
            





Investors often dismiss dental stocks as boring, slow-growth investments. Nonetheless, demand for dental equipment has been steadily rising worldwide. Grand View Research estimates that the global dental equipment market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4% between 2013 and 2020, since 60% to 90% of schoolchildren and nearly 100% of adults suffer from various dental problems. Let's take a look at two solid names in this sector -- Henry Schein (NASDAQ:HSIC) and Sirona Dental Systems (NASDAQ:SIRO).

Source: Pixabay.
Henry ScheinHenry Schein is the world's largest distributor of dental health products and services for dentists and veterinarians. Its stock has risen about 14% since the beginning of the year, easily outperforming the S&P 500's 1% gain. The company generates revenue from three main business units -- dental, animal health, and medical products and services.
Last quarter, Henry Schein's dental revenue dipped 2.5% annually to $1.27 billion and accounted for nearly half of its top line. Excluding foreign exchange impacts, sales rose 4.6%. Animal health and medical revenue respectively declined 3.4% and rose 24.3%. On a constant-currency basis, animal health revenue was up 4.5% and medical revenue improved 25%. North America revenues, which accounted for 69% of its top line, rose 8.6% as international revenues fell 9.3%. 
The company's total revenues rose 2.4% to $2.7 billion and matched analyst estimates. On a constant-currency basis, sales improved 8.3%, thanks to 4.8% growth from internally generated sales and 3.5% growth from acquisitions. Henry Schein's major acquisitions over the past two years include Scil Animal Care, which expanded its veterinary presence; Lincoln Dental Labs, which strengthened its dental laboratory distribution business; and five companies from Arseus, which bolstered its European dental and technology businesses. 





On the bottom line, Henry Schein's adjusted net income rose 13.7% to $130.6 million, or $1.55 per share, beating estimates by eight cents. For the full year, the company expects its adjusted diluted EPS to grow 8% to 10% annually. For fiscal 2016, it expects earnings to grow 10% to 12% from the midpoint of its 2015 guidance. 
Sirona Dental SystemsSirona Dental Systems, which was originally spun off from Siemens AG, is a leading manufacturer of high-tech dental equipment. Its flagship CEREC system combines digital imaging with 3D printing to produce porcelain crowns, onlays, inlays, and veneers. This streamlined process replaces the older and messier method of using molds. Sirona claims that about 15% of dentists worldwide use the system, which can cut a patient's time in the chair in half.

Sirona's revenue rose 5.1% annually last quarter to $304.9 million, exceeding estimates by $9.9 million. Excluding currency impacts, revenue rose 18%. Instruments revenue improved 15.9%, CAD/CAM Systems revenue rose 11.1%, imaging systems revenue increased 2.2%, and treatment centers revenue declined 4.8%. All four segments would have posted stronger double-digit growth on a constant-currency basis. Sirona's U.S. revenues, which accounted for just a third of its top line, rose 34.2%. That gain was fueled by 18.4% internal sales growth and 15.8% acquisition-related growth. 





Like Henry Schein, Sirona has grown inorganically by combining with smaller rivals. In September, Sirona agreed to merge with Dentsply International (NASDAQ:XRAY), which sells consumable healthcare products for dental and other healthcare markets, to become the world's largest pure-play maker of dental products, with a combined market value of over $13 billion. The new company, Dentsply Sirona, is expected to generate $3.8 billion in annual revenues, with an adjusted EBITDA of over $900 million. Sirona stock has risen 25% this year, but a large portion of those gains came after the Dentsply merger was announced. The merger is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2016. Under the terms of the agreement, Sirona shareholders will receive 1.8142 shares of Dentsply for each Sirona share they own. 
Stocks to watch, not to buyHenry Schein and Sirona are interesting dental stocks to watch, but I wouldn't rush to buy either one. Both companies are heavily exposed to a strong dollar, which could get even stronger with interest rate hikes.
Henry Schein's P/E of 27 is also slightly pricier than the industry average of 24 for the medical equipment wholesale industry. Its forward P/E of 24 also trades at a premium to its projected earnings growth rate of 8% to 10% for the year. Sirona's P/E of 33 is also higher than the industry average of 30 for the medical appliances and equipment industry. It would also be smarter to wait for the Dentsply merger to close next year and see how the combined company fares before jumping in.

History[edit]
In 1932, Henry Schein, a graduate of Columbia University College of Pharmacy, borrowed $500 and opened a pharmacy in Queens, New York.[3][6] The company expanded into dental supplies in the 1960s, and by the late 1980s, Henry Schein held approximately 10 percent of the dental-supply market. Marvin Schein, Henry Schein's son, took over management of daily operations in 1971.[7]
In 1978, founder Henry Schein's son Jay Schein became CEO of the company.[6] When Jay Schein died of cancer in 1989, Stanley Bergman took over as CEO.[3][6]Bergman was born in South Africa and came to New York in 1976, where he became an accountant. In 1980, he joined Henry Schein and was promoted to CFO.[8][6]
Henry Schein Inc. filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 1995 to sell 6.2 million shares in an initial public offering with William Blair & Company as the lead underwriter.[9] The IPO raised $72.8 million and began trading on the Nasdaq.[3][7] By 1996, the company was up to $1.4 billion in sales and $29 million in profit under Bergman's leadership. That year, the company made seventeen acquisitions.[7]
In August 1997, Henry Schein Inc. agreed to buy Sullivan Dental Products Inc. for approximately $318 million. The purchase made the company the world's largest distributor of dental equipment and supplies. By that point, Henry Schein had made 16 acquisitions in 1997. Also in 1997, Henry Schein acquired New York-based medical-products distributor Micro BioMedics Inc[10] as well as Dentrix Dental Systems.[7]
Henry Schein announced the acquisition of demedis GmbH and Euro Dental Holding GmbH in June 2004.[11] In November 2009, it was announced that Henry Schein Inc. and Butler Animal Health Supply would be launching joint venture Butler Schein Animal Health, the largest veterinary sales and distribution company in the United States.[12] Butler Schein Animal Health was rebranded as Henry Schein Animal Health in 2013.[13] Between 1989 and 2016, Henry Schein purchased approximately 200 companies.[6]
Operations[edit]
Dental[edit]
In 1997, Henry Schein acquired Sullivan Dental Products and Dentrix Dental Systems, making it the world's largest distributor of dental equipment and supplies.[10][7] Dentrix Ascend, Henry Schein's cloud-based software designed for dental offices, is a scalable system. Its interface was built to be intuitive and the company works with users to include features dental offices require.[14]
Henry Schein established the Henry Schein Dental Business Institute in March 2015 to teach owners and operators of dental practices the fundamentals of business. The first class to complete the program graduated in March 2016.[15] Henry Schein also launched the Henry Schein Digital Dentistry Program at Temple University's Maurice H. Kornberg School of Dentistry in 2016.[16]
In May 2016, Henry Schein's entity Dentrix presented the DEXIS software's ability to integrate X-rays into a patient's chart.[17] Zahn Dental, Henry Schein's laboratory supply business, acquired Custom Automated Prosthetics in June 2016. The acquisition enabled Henry Schein to expand its prosthetic offerings.[18]
Medical[edit]
In November 2014, Henry Schein Medical announced a strategic arrangement with Cardinal Health. Cardinal Health's physician office-sales organization consolidated into Henry Schein Medical.[19][20][21]
Animal health[edit]
Henry Schein produces software that is used in veterinary practices designed to improve communication and data management including the online cloud-based application, Rapport.[22] In February 2016, Henry Schein released Axis-Q, a software application designed to ease the recording and access of veterinary medical records.[23]

History[edit]
In 1932, Henry Schein, a graduate of Columbia University College of Pharmacy, borrowed $500 and opened a pharmacy in Queens, New York.[3][6] The company expanded into dental supplies in the 1960s, and by the late 1980s, Henry Schein held approximately 10 percent of the dental-supply market. Marvin Schein, Henry Schein's son, took over management of daily operations in 1971.[7]
In 1978, founder Henry Schein's son Jay Schein became CEO of the company.[6] When Jay Schein died of cancer in 1989, Stanley Bergman took over as CEO.[3][6]Bergman was born in South Africa and came to New York in 1976, where he became an accountant. In 1980, he joined Henry Schein and was promoted to CFO.[8][6]
Henry Schein Inc. filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 1995 to sell 6.2 million shares in an initial public offering with William Blair & Company as the lead underwriter.[9] The IPO raised $72.8 million and began trading on the Nasdaq.[3][7] By 1996, the company was up to $1.4 billion in sales and $29 million in profit under Bergman's leadership. That year, the company made seventeen acquisitions.[7]
In August 1997, Henry Schein Inc. agreed to buy Sullivan Dental Products Inc. for approximately $318 million. The purchase made the company the world's largest distributor of dental equipment and supplies. By that point, Henry Schein had made 16 acquisitions in 1997. Also in 1997, Henry Schein acquired New York-based medical-products distributor Micro BioMedics Inc[10] as well as Dentrix Dental Systems.[7]
Henry Schein announced the acquisition of demedis GmbH and Euro Dental Holding GmbH in June 2004.[11] In November 2009, it was announced that Henry Schein Inc. and Butler Animal Health Supply would be launching joint venture Butler Schein Animal Health, the largest veterinary sales and distribution company in the United States.[12] Butler Schein Animal Health was rebranded as Henry Schein Animal Health in 2013.[13] Between 1989 and 2016, Henry Schein purchased approximately 200 companies.[6]
Operations[edit]
Dental[edit]
In 1997, Henry Schein acquired Sullivan Dental Products and Dentrix Dental Systems, making it the world's largest distributor of dental equipment and supplies.[10][7] Dentrix Ascend, Henry Schein's cloud-based software designed for dental offices, is a scalable system. Its interface was built to be intuitive and the company works with users to include features dental offices require.[14]
Henry Schein established the Henry Schein Dental Business Institute in March 2015 to teach owners and operators of dental practices the fundamentals of business. The first class to complete the program graduated in March 2016.[15] Henry Schein also launched the Henry Schein Digital Dentistry Program at Temple University's Maurice H. Kornberg School of Dentistry in 2016.[16]
In May 2016, Henry Schein's entity Dentrix presented the DEXIS software's ability to integrate X-rays into a patient's chart.[17] Zahn Dental, Henry Schein's laboratory supply business, acquired Custom Automated Prosthetics in June 2016. The acquisition enabled Henry Schein to expand its prosthetic offerings.[18]
Medical[edit]
In November 2014, Henry Schein Medical announced a strategic arrangement with Cardinal Health. Cardinal Health's physician office-sales organization consolidated into Henry Schein Medical.[19][20][21]
Animal health[edit]
Henry Schein produces software that is used in veterinary practices designed to improve communication and data management including the online cloud-based application, Rapport.[22] In February 2016, Henry Schein released Axis-Q, a software application designed to ease the recording and access of veterinary medical records.[23]

History[edit]
In 1932, Henry Schein, a graduate of Columbia University College of Pharmacy, borrowed $500 and opened a pharmacy in Queens, New York.[3][6] The company expanded into dental supplies in the 1960s, and by the late 1980s, Henry Schein held approximately 10 percent of the dental-supply market. Marvin Schein, Henry Schein's son, took over management of daily operations in 1971.[7]
In 1978, founder Henry Schein's son Jay Schein became CEO of the company.[6] When Jay Schein died of cancer in 1989, Stanley Bergman took over as CEO.[3][6]Bergman was born in South Africa and came to New York in 1976, where he became an accountant. In 1980, he joined Henry Schein and was promoted to CFO.[8][6]
Henry Schein Inc. filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 1995 to sell 6.2 million shares in an initial public offering with William Blair & Company as the lead underwriter.[9] The IPO raised $72.8 million and began trading on the Nasdaq.[3][7] By 1996, the company was up to $1.4 billion in sales and $29 million in profit under Bergman's leadership. That year, the company made seventeen acquisitions.[7]
In August 1997, Henry Schein Inc. agreed to buy Sullivan Dental Products Inc. for approximately $318 million. The purchase made the company the world's largest distributor of dental equipment and supplies. By that point, Henry Schein had made 16 acquisitions in 1997. Also in 1997, Henry Schein acquired New York-based medical-products distributor Micro BioMedics Inc[10] as well as Dentrix Dental Systems.[7]
Henry Schein announced the acquisition of demedis GmbH and Euro Dental Holding GmbH in June 2004.[11] In November 2009, it was announced that Henry Schein Inc. and Butler Animal Health Supply would be launching joint venture Butler Schein Animal Health, the largest veterinary sales and distribution company in the United States.[12] Butler Schein Animal Health was rebranded as Henry Schein Animal Health in 2013.[13] Between 1989 and 2016, Henry Schein purchased approximately 200 companies.[6]
Operations[edit]
Dental[edit]
In 1997, Henry Schein acquired Sullivan Dental Products and Dentrix Dental Systems, making it the world's largest distributor of dental equipment and supplies.[10][7] Dentrix Ascend, Henry Schein's cloud-based software designed for dental offices, is a scalable system. Its interface was built to be intuitive and the company works with users to include features dental offices require.[14]
Henry Schein established the Henry Schein Dental Business Institute in March 2015 to teach owners and operators of dental practices the fundamentals of business. The first class to complete the program graduated in March 2016.[15] Henry Schein also launched the Henry Schein Digital Dentistry Program at Temple University's Maurice H. Kornberg School of Dentistry in 2016.[16]
In May 2016, Henry Schein's entity Dentrix presented the DEXIS software's ability to integrate X-rays into a patient's chart.[17] Zahn Dental, Henry Schein's laboratory supply business, acquired Custom Automated Prosthetics in June 2016. The acquisition enabled Henry Schein to expand its prosthetic offerings.[18]
Medical[edit]
In November 2014, Henry Schein Medical announced a strategic arrangement with Cardinal Health. Cardinal Health's physician office-sales organization consolidated into Henry Schein Medical.[19][20][21]
Animal health[edit]
Henry Schein produces software that is used in veterinary practices designed to improve communication and data management including the online cloud-based application, Rapport.[22] In February 2016, Henry Schein released Axis-Q, a software application designed to ease the recording and access of veterinary medical records.[23]

History[edit]
In 1932, Henry Schein, a graduate of Columbia University College of Pharmacy, borrowed $500 and opened a pharmacy in Queens, New York.[3][6] The company expanded into dental supplies in the 1960s, and by the late 1980s, Henry Schein held approximately 10 percent of the dental-supply market. Marvin Schein, Henry Schein's son, took over management of daily operations in 1971.[7]
In 1978, founder Henry Schein's son Jay Schein became CEO of the company.[6] When Jay Schein died of cancer in 1989, Stanley Bergman took over as CEO.[3][6]Bergman was born in South Africa and came to New York in 1976, where he became an accountant. In 1980, he joined Henry Schein and was promoted to CFO.[8][6]
Henry Schein Inc. filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 1995 to sell 6.2 million shares in an initial public offering with William Blair & Company as the lead underwriter.[9] The IPO raised $72.8 million and began trading on the Nasdaq.[3][7] By 1996, the company was up to $1.4 billion in sales and $29 million in profit under Bergman's leadership. That year, the company made seventeen acquisitions.[7]
In August 1997, Henry Schein Inc. agreed to buy Sullivan Dental Products Inc. for approximately $318 million. The purchase made the company the world's largest distributor of dental equipment and supplies. By that point, Henry Schein had made 16 acquisitions in 1997. Also in 1997, Henry Schein acquired New York-based medical-products distributor Micro BioMedics Inc[10] as well as Dentrix Dental Systems.[7]
Henry Schein announced the acquisition of demedis GmbH and Euro Dental Holding GmbH in June 2004.[11] In November 2009, it was announced that Henry Schein Inc. and Butler Animal Health Supply would be launching joint venture Butler Schein Animal Health, the largest veterinary sales and distribution company in the United States.[12] Butler Schein Animal Health was rebranded as Henry Schein Animal Health in 2013.[13] Between 1989 and 2016, Henry Schein purchased approximately 200 companies.[6]
Operations[edit]
Dental[edit]
In 1997, Henry Schein acquired Sullivan Dental Products and Dentrix Dental Systems, making it the world's largest distributor of dental equipment and supplies.[10][7] Dentrix Ascend, Henry Schein's cloud-based software designed for dental offices, is a scalable system. Its interface was built to be intuitive and the company works with users to include features dental offices require.[14]
Henry Schein established the Henry Schein Dental Business Institute in March 2015 to teach owners and operators of dental practices the fundamentals of business. The first class to complete the program graduated in March 2016.[15] Henry Schein also launched the Henry Schein Digital Dentistry Program at Temple University's Maurice H. Kornberg School of Dentistry in 2016.[16]
In May 2016, Henry Schein's entity Dentrix presented the DEXIS software's ability to integrate X-rays into a patient's chart.[17] Zahn Dental, Henry Schein's laboratory supply business, acquired Custom Automated Prosthetics in June 2016. The acquisition enabled Henry Schein to expand its prosthetic offerings.[18]
Medical[edit]
In November 2014, Henry Schein Medical announced a strategic arrangement with Cardinal Health. Cardinal Health's physician office-sales organization consolidated into Henry Schein Medical.[19][20][21]
Animal health[edit]
Henry Schein produces software that is used in veterinary practices designed to improve communication and data management including the online cloud-based application, Rapport.[22] In February 2016, Henry Schein released Axis-Q, a software application designed to ease the recording and access of veterinary medical records.[23]

History[edit]
In 1932, Henry Schein, a graduate of Columbia University College of Pharmacy, borrowed $500 and opened a pharmacy in Queens, New York.[3][6] The company expanded into dental supplies in the 1960s, and by the late 1980s, Henry Schein held approximately 10 percent of the dental-supply market. Marvin Schein, Henry Schein's son, took over management of daily operations in 1971.[7]
In 1978, founder Henry Schein's son Jay Schein became CEO of the company.[6] When Jay Schein died of cancer in 1989, Stanley Bergman took over as CEO.[3][6]Bergman was born in South Africa and came to New York in 1976, where he became an accountant. In 1980, he joined Henry Schein and was promoted to CFO.[8][6]
Henry Schein Inc. filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 1995 to sell 6.2 million shares in an initial public offering with William Blair & Company as the lead underwriter.[9] The IPO raised $72.8 million and began trading on the Nasdaq.[3][7] By 1996, the company was up to $1.4 billion in sales and $29 million in profit under Bergman's leadership. That year, the company made seventeen acquisitions.[7]
In August 1997, Henry Schein Inc. agreed to buy Sullivan Dental Products Inc. for approximately $318 million. The purchase made the company the world's largest distributor of dental equipment and supplies. By that point, Henry Schein had made 16 acquisitions in 1997. Also in 1997, Henry Schein acquired New York-based medical-products distributor Micro BioMedics Inc[10] as well as Dentrix Dental Systems.[7]
Henry Schein announced the acquisition of demedis GmbH and Euro Dental Holding GmbH in June 2004.[11] In November 2009, it was announced that Henry Schein Inc. and Butler Animal Health Supply would be launching joint venture Butler Schein Animal Health, the largest veterinary sales and distribution company in the United States.[12] Butler Schein Animal Health was rebranded as Henry Schein Animal Health in 2013.[13] Between 1989 and 2016, Henry Schein purchased approximately 200 companies.[6]
Operations[edit]
Dental[edit]
In 1997, Henry Schein acquired Sullivan Dental Products and Dentrix Dental Systems, making it the world's largest distributor of dental equipment and supplies.[10][7] Dentrix Ascend, Henry Schein's cloud-based software designed for dental offices, is a scalable system. Its interface was built to be intuitive and the company works with users to include features dental offices require.[14]
Henry Schein established the Henry Schein Dental Business Institute in March 2015 to teach owners and operators of dental practices the fundamentals of business. The first class to complete the program graduated in March 2016.[15] Henry Schein also launched the Henry Schein Digital Dentistry Program at Temple University's Maurice H. Kornberg School of Dentistry in 2016.[16]
In May 2016, Henry Schein's entity Dentrix presented the DEXIS software's ability to integrate X-rays into a patient's chart.[17] Zahn Dental, Henry Schein's laboratory supply business, acquired Custom Automated Prosthetics in June 2016. The acquisition enabled Henry Schein to expand its prosthetic offerings.[18]
Medical[edit]
In November 2014, Henry Schein Medical announced a strategic arrangement with Cardinal Health. Cardinal Health's physician office-sales organization consolidated into Henry Schein Medical.[19][20][21]
Animal health[edit]
Henry Schein produces software that is used in veterinary practices designed to improve communication and data management including the online cloud-based application, Rapport.[22] In February 2016, Henry Schein released Axis-Q, a software application designed to ease the recording and access of veterinary medical records.[23]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
