                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe affirmation is a result of stable performance of the underlying collateral. While credit enhancement remains high, payment to class B-7 comes from pool collateral that is represented by single-tenant properties, three of which (47% of the pool) are leased to Walgreens (rated 'BBB/Outlook Stable as of September 2016); therefore, Fitch capped the rating at 'BBBsf'. All remaining loans are performing.As of the November 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 98.5% to $12.7 million from $838.8 million at issuance. Fitch modeled losses of 3.8% of the remaining pool; expected losses on the original pool balance total 3.7%, including $30.7 million (3.7% of the original pool balance) in realized losses to date. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting class C.Pool Concentration: The pool is highly concentrated with only nine of the original 168 loans remaining. Four loans (24.7%) are defeased and the remaining five loans (75.3%) are backed by single-tenant properties,three of which (47%), are leased to Walgreens. However, Walgreens signed long term leases at all three properties, with the earliest lease expiration in 2056.Maturities: Six loans (91.4%) mature in 2017 and the remaining three loans (8.6%) mature in 2018.Balloon Loans: Six loans (95.1%) are structured with 30 year amortization schedules followed by balloon payments and three loans (4.9%) are fully amortizing.The largest loan in the pool is Randall's Store (26.1%), which is secured by a 59,000 square foot (sf) retail building in Sugar Land, TX. The property is 100% occupied by Randall's Store, a Texas grocery chain, which has a lease expiration of November, 2022. As of December 2015, debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) was 1.37x.The second, third and fifth largest loans in the pool are secured by 14,000 sf retail buildings occupied by Walgreens and located in Seattle, WA (17.5%), Gresham, OR (17.2%) and Portland, OR (12.3%). The leases expire in 2067, 2056, and 2056, respectively.RATING SENSITIVITIESThe Rating Outlook on class B-7 is Stable due to sufficient credit enhancement and continued paydown. Positive or negative rating actions are not expected unless there is a material change in the performance of the remaining collateral.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action.Fitch affirms the following class:--$6.3 million class B-7 at 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.The classes A-1A, A-1B, A-2, A-3, B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4 and CP certificates have paid in full. Fitch does not rate the class B-5, B-6 and C certificates. Fitch previously withdrew the rating on the interest-only class S certificates.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 01 Sep 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886006Criteria for Rating Caps and Limitations in Global Structured Finance Transactions (pub. 16 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/882401Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/883130North America and Asia-Pacific Multiborrower CMBS Surveillance Criteria (pub. 01 Dec 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/891159Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1016587Solicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1016587Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/regulatoryALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third-party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.The information in this report is provided “as is” without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.

      Fitch Affirms DLJ 1998-CF1
    





December 15, 2016 03:25 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed one class of DLJ Commercial Mortgage Corp. 
      commercial mortgage pass-through certificates series 1998-CF1. A 
      detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmation is a result of stable performance of the underlying 
      collateral. While credit enhancement remains high, payment to class B-7 
      comes from pool collateral that is represented by single-tenant 
      properties, three of which (47% of the pool) are leased to Walgreens 
      (rated 'BBB/Outlook Stable as of September 2016); therefore, Fitch 
      capped the rating at 'BBBsf'. All remaining loans are performing.
    

      As of the November 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been reduced by 98.5% to $12.7 million from $838.8 
      million at issuance. Fitch modeled losses of 3.8% of the remaining pool; 
      expected losses on the original pool balance total 3.7%, including $30.7 
      million (3.7% of the original pool balance) in realized losses to date. 
      Interest shortfalls are currently affecting class C.
    

      Pool Concentration: The pool is highly concentrated with only nine of 
      the original 168 loans remaining. Four loans (24.7%) are defeased and 
      the remaining five loans (75.3%) are backed by single-tenant 
      properties,three of which (47%), are leased to Walgreens. However, 
      Walgreens signed long term leases at all three properties, with the 
      earliest lease expiration in 2056.
    

      Maturities: Six loans (91.4%) mature in 2017 and the remaining three 
      loans (8.6%) mature in 2018.
    

      Balloon Loans: Six loans (95.1%) are structured with 30 year 
      amortization schedules followed by balloon payments and three loans 
      (4.9%) are fully amortizing.
    

      The largest loan in the pool is Randall's Store (26.1%), which is 
      secured by a 59,000 square foot (sf) retail building in Sugar Land, TX. 
      The property is 100% occupied by Randall's Store, a Texas grocery chain, 
      which has a lease expiration of November, 2022. As of December 2015, 
      debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) was 1.37x.
    

      The second, third and fifth largest loans in the pool are secured by 
      14,000 sf retail buildings occupied by Walgreens and located in Seattle, 
      WA (17.5%), Gresham, OR (17.2%) and Portland, OR (12.3%). The leases 
      expire in 2067, 2056, and 2056, respectively.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlook on class B-7 is Stable due to sufficient credit 
      enhancement and continued paydown. Positive or negative rating actions 
      are not expected unless there is a material change in the performance of 
      the remaining collateral.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in 
      relation to this rating action.
    

      Fitch affirms the following class:
    

      --$6.3 million class B-7 at 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      The classes A-1A, A-1B, A-2, A-3, B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4 and CP certificates 
      have paid in full. Fitch does not rate the class B-5, B-6 and C 
      certificates. Fitch previously withdrew the rating on the interest-only 
      class S certificates.

      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third-party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can

      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to
