Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Accuray Incorporated Fiscal Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Doug Sherk. Sir, you may begin.
Doug Sherk
Thank you, Tim and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Accuray's conference call to review the financial results for the quarter ending December 31, 2016, which is the company’s second quarter of its fiscal 2017 year as well as recent corporate developments. 
Joining us todays are Josh Levine, Accuray's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Waters, Accuray's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during our call today -- the call includes forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties, including statements regarding our business plans and strategies as well as our outlook for fiscal 2017. There are a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including, but not limited to, risks associated with the adoption of CyberKnife, TomoTherapy, Onrad and Radixact Systems; commercial execution; future order growth; future revenue growth and macroeconomic factors outside of the company's control. 
These and other risks are more fully described in the press release we issued after the market close this afternoon, as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. 
During the question-and-answer today, we request that questioners limit themselves to two questions and then re-queue with any follow-up questions. We thank everyone in advance for their cooperation with this process.
And with that out of the way I'd like to turn the call over to Accuray's President and Chief Executive Officer, Josh Levine.
Joshua H. Levine
Thanks Doug. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining on today's call. Following the market close today we reported second quarter financial results, highlighted by strong growth for both gross orders and backlog. Gross orders for the quarter increased 17% year-over-year to $78.5 million, while our backlog grew 16% year-over-year to a record $426.2 million. We believe our progress is evidence that the catalysts driving order growth discussed with you over the last several quarters are beginning to take hold. These catalysts include a meaningful replacement cycle for Accuray products and greater recognition by both existing and new customers that our company's product portfolio offers increased versatility and functionality for customers. 
Over the next few minutes I'd like to provide more color on the most important of these catalysts, before turning the call over to Kevin for a more detailed review of our financial performance and full year outlook. First, as many of you know, we are entering the early phase of a multi-year replacement cycle of approximately 200 TomoTherapy and CyberKnife systems that will reach their tenure in service dates within the next 36 months. While we anticipate replacements will generally average 10% to 20% of orders on an annual basis, the results in the second quarter were north of that range with the largest number of replacements occurring in the US market. 

At the end of our first fiscal quarter we communicated we had secured commitments for several replacement orders in Q1 that were indeed finalized in the second quarter. We are optimistic about the replacement sales momentum continuing. When we look at the full file of our installed base we have a mix that leans heavily towards large multi-bunker [ph] academic institutions where many have our earlier generation Tomo and CyberKnife systems, who will therefore benefit from the significantly improved functionality, versatility and reliability of our newest devices. 
Many of these institutions are led by key opinion leaders who are engaged in research and who recognize the value of improved workflow and efficiency associated with our latest generation products. Our view is bolstered when we look at an installed customer base that is increasingly satisfied with the performance and reliability of our systems. 
Related to this earlier in the month, we announced that Accuray radiation therapy systems continue to set the industry standard for customer satisfaction once again receiving MD Buyline's highest Composite Overall User Satisfaction rating among radiation treatment delivery systems in the US. In fact most recent ratings report for calendar Q4 showed that Accuray radiation therapy products have now achieved the highest composite rating among industry peers for 11 of the past 12 quarters. The MD Buyline survey results are consistent with the net promoter scores by IMV ServiceTrak, where Accuray was rated number one in overall system performance. We believe these improvements in system performance reliability and ease of use are helping to drive gross order and backlog growth. 
Additionally, future order growth benefited from an improved order mix of our CyberKnife system. We continue to see the majority of CyberKnife system orders configured with a Multileaf Collimator, which not only increases the versatility and speed of the system but also enhances the average selling price and margin profile. While it's probably too early to attribute the second quarter CyberKnife order strength to recent clinical data, we do believe that CyberKnife SBRT study for low and intermediate risk prostate patients that was presented at ASTRO In September will enhance the strategic positioning and clinical validation of CyberKnife as an effective full body radiosurgery device, supporting momentum and order growth going forward. 
Additionally, while the majority of our Q2 CyberKnife orders in the US were replacement cells, throughout the rest of the world we saw a healthy mix of both replacements and new CyberKnife customers, which speaks to the expanded versatility of our latest generation CyberKnife platform. Transitioning to Radixact, future orders also benefited from the early rollout of our new Radixact System, the next generation of our TomoTherapy platform. As we announced the first patient treatments had occurred in a number of our early reference site accounts -- site accounts in the U.S. and Europe.
Customer feedback regarding the performance of the new Radixact System at those locations was extremely positive with regards to speed, efficiency and image quality of the device. Customers were also pleased with the performance of our new precision treatment planning software and its adaptor [ph] planning and retreatment capabilities. Additionally in Q2, we continued our multi-system momentum with the booking of another multi-system order for three Radixact units with the prestigious Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital. 
Regarding Onrad, our new value product segment offering in China, we remain on track with regards to our initial launch. As we have discussed previously regarding Onrad, a large element of the selling process is dependent on successful participation in provincial level tender processes. Based on the tender process timelines, we expect initial order uptake for Onrad to begin late in fiscal Q3 or early Q4 with further order ramp continuing from there forward.

While we’re pleased that the halfway mark of our fiscal year to be above our internal forecast for gross orders and backlog, we recognize that potential variability in terms of outcomes, timing in two key areas, potentially create some revenue uncertainty in the second half of this fiscal year. Let me touch on these two areas, revenue conversion and the timing of Class A license issues in China in more detail.
First, we continue to see modestly extended revenue conversion times, due to a higher mix of international distributor orders in our backlog. We experienced that increasing trend in the percentage of our backlog related to distributor orders which increased 6% since fiscal year-end 2014. The impact of working with independent distributors in general is that we have less direct control over the timing in converting these orders to revenue versus our direct sales. Process critical activity such as site planning, installation planning and coordination of contractors, when the distributor has primary responsibility for system installation, results in less direct line of site with the end user facility and limits our ability to manage all elements of the installation process, which can result in timing variability and delays.
The second area of potential impact is the timing uncertainty of a final announcement concerning Class A radiotherapy licenses from the Chinese Ministry of Health. Given the delays in this announcement over the past several quarters, it’s becoming more difficult to predict when the Class A license program specifics will be finalized.
Our internal assumption supporting our second half fiscal 2017 revenue forecast is tied to a final announcement regarding Class A radiotherapy licenses coming by the end of our fiscal third quarter. But given the delays we’ve seen and the uncertainty of timing going forward, we believe it’s prudent to remind you of the potential impact of our second half revenue outlook related to continued delays.
With that said, we remain very confident in the China market opportunity overall and our competitive positioning in the class A radiotherapy segment. And with that I’d like to turn the call over to Kevin.
Kevin Waters
Thank you, Josh and good afternoon everyone. We ended the second quarter with backlog of $426.2 million, up 16% over the prior year. Backlog included gross orders of $78.5 million and net orders of $54.1 million, reflecting age outs of $19.9 million and one cancellation for $3.6 million. Age outs in the quarter were anticipated and consistent with the guidance we provided in October.
In addition, currency negatively impacted net orders by approximately $1 million in the second quarter. Josh already highlighted the factors contributing to our strong gross order performance, including replacement sales above historical averages, improved mix, of both new and replacement CyberKnife orders and a multi-system Radixact order. All of these items led to significant gross order growth in the quarter and we are approximately $10 million above our guidance for the first half of fiscal 2017.
First half of fiscal 2017 gross order performance translated into 16% year-over-year growth in our backlog. As we look out 12 months to 24 months when these systems are installed our backlog could translate in to product revenue growth rate greater than our rate of product growth in fiscal 2017.
Turning now to our income statement, total revenues for the second quarter were $87.5 million compared with record levels of revenue of $108.9 million in the year ago period. On a sequential basis, revenues were up slightly over the first quarter and we continue to anticipate a linear progression of revenue as we move through the balance of the year. I’ll provide more detail on the metric shortly. Product revenues for the quarter were $35.4 million. We performed above our expectations for the quarter in the U.S. and Japan. This was offset by below plan performance in Europe which is primarily attributable to the marginally extended conversion to revenue times that Josh highlighted. 

Service revenues for the second quarter were $52.1 million compared with $53.2 million in the year ago period, which was in line with our expectations. 
Turning to gross margins, our overall gross margin for the quarter was 36%, down 320 basis points compared with the prior year period and flat on a sequential basis. Product gross margins in the quarter decreased 620 basis points over the prior year period to 35%, primarily driven by the lower overall unit sales volume as well as product and channel mix. Product and channel mix continue to be the most significant factor in regards to quarterly fluctuations in product margins. As with the first fiscal quarter we again experienced a higher concentration of TomoTherapy Systems to revenue as compared to CyberKnife. In prior year we averaged an approximate one-to-one ratio of CyberKnife to TomoTherapy revenues. And in the first six month of 2017 this mix has been two to one in favor of TomoTherapy.
I would also highlight that overall pricing in the first half of 2017 has been relatively stable to the year ago period and within our expectations. We continue to anticipate an improvement in product gross margin in the second half of the fiscal year on higher revenue volumes and more favorable mix that should gross margins on a full year basis to be approximately flat as compared to the year ago period. 
Service gross margin in the fiscal second quarter of 36% were essentially flat with the year ago period. We continue our focus on improved parts reliability and cost management and anticipate full year fiscal 2017 service margins to be at or above fiscal 2016, which were 36%. Operating expenses for the quarter decreased 15% from the prior year period to $36.2 million. The $6.5 million decline included a $3 million decrease in R&D, a $1.2 million decrease in selling and marketing and the $2.3 million decrease in G&A primarily due to lower legal expenses. The contributing factor behind the lower operating expenses across all categories was incentive compensation and commission expenses as a result of lower sales volume. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $1.8 million compared to $6.8 million in a year ago period. We continue to have a particularly high level of confidence in our ability to effectively manage costs, which I'll touch on in our guidance shortly. 
Let’s now turn to the balance sheet. We had $108.4 million of cash and investment at December 31, 2016. The $16 million sequential decrease in cash from the first quarter is primarily due to the timing of revenue collections which can be seen in the $14.7 million increase in accounts receivable. Additionally we used $6 million to pay down current debt balances.
Turning to our capital structure, we remain focused on strengthening our balance sheet by reducing the potential dilution associated with our convertible debt. We will report to you on our progress as development merits and we continue to believe accurate annual financial performance and growing backlog will provide greater options and flexibility. 
Turning now to our annual guidance for fiscal 2017, we are today affirming the guidance originally provided back in August for all metrics except operating expenses as follows: Year-over-year growth of approximately 5% for gross orders; a revenue range of $410 to $420 million. Although our first half performance leads us to believe the lower end of the range is more likely independent primarily on two variables that I’ll explain shortly. We’re expecting adjusted EBITDA range of $32 to $38 million. Additionally given first half operating expense levels were below expectations, we are lowering full year operating expenses to be down approximately 3% as compared to fiscal 2016. 
Given the lower operating expenses, we do remain confident in our ability to achieve our adjusted EBITDA range which would represent year-over-year growth of between 30% and 55%. With regard to full year revenue, implicit in our revenue guidance are two variables that will impact our ability to achieve the revenue range. Josh mentioned our internal assumptions around expectations of a Class A license announcement out of China in the third quarter. China Class A revenues comprise approximately $10 million to $15 million to our second half fiscal 2017 revenue guidance. Additionally, almost all of the China revenue contribution is now anticipated to be in our fourth quarter. 

Our revenue guidance also anticipates the shipments or installation of several distributed orders within the timeframe expected when these orders were entered in the backlog. At this time we have no reason to believe the conversion of these orders to revenue will experience timing delays. As with China, our firm belief is that the conversion to revenue is purely a timing issue. Further we would anticipate closing out fiscal 2017 with product system backlog of approximately $440 million, which would be above the overall market growth rate. We also anticipate Q3 age outs to be approximately $12 million. We anticipate that age outs as a percentage of backlog for the full year of fiscal 2017 will be an improvement over fiscal 2016's level of 13%. 
And with that I would now like to hand the call back to Josh. 
Joshua H. Levine
Thanks, Kevin. Before we open the call up to your questions, I'd like to thank the entire Accuray team for their focus and contribution to our performance in second quarter. Our company's commitment to the important work we are doing in improving the lives of cancer patients by providing leading edge treatment solutions remains central to our mission. 
Now operator we're ready to open the call up for questions. 
Question-and-Answer Session 
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen & Company. Your line is open. 
Josh Jennings 
Hi good evening, thanks gentlemen. I was hoping to ask you a few questions on the sales funnel. Clearly the replacement cycle has set up nicely. And any high level thoughts on how you're feeling about the de novo customer funnel at mid-year versus the beginning of the year. Then on Radixact, and one of the promise of the platform that it will more fully open up to single and dual vault segments of the market and can you talk about the early Radixact funnel and the mix of single and dual vault centers within it. And then lastly you secured another multi-system order in fiscal 2Q. Does the funnel include more potential multi-system orders as well? 
Joshua H. Levine
So Josh I'll take in, I guess in that sequence that the question were given. Let me talk a little bit about replacement cycle in general. As we've characterized in the past the primary geographic focus is our US market and Western Europe across both platforms. If you think about just the performance, let's say in Q2 and the contribution, the bigger contribution in terms of product mix from a CyberKnife standpoint, right now across the entire installed base that's kind of coming into replacement cycle on CyberKnife, less than 20% of that installed base actually has the latest generation device. 
So when you think about the opportunities for M6, MLC equipped people that are looking to build full body radio surgery programs, we think we have a lot more ground to cover in terms of opportunities inside the installed base and that's represented by replacement cycle. We talked a little bit about product advantages on both platforms. I mean we have the basis here for confidence really comes from a better performing product on both platforms, better functionality, better speed, better throughput, better reliability. And those things really translate into expanded clinical versatility in the minds of customers but also a growing addressable market opportunity for us. 
So I'm pretty bullish on the continuation of momentum in the replacement sales piece in both the US market and Western Europe.
Kevin Waters
Yeah I could take your single and dual vault question, we continue to experience the majority of our orders for Radixact and TomoTherapy in single and dual vault, which has been really running now for probably last four or five quarters, Josh. So that trend continued in the second quarter. 

Joshua H. Levine
Josh, I think the last question you had was around Radixact, and kind of funnel and what our view is right now from an early assessment? We are in still in this current quarter, ramp and monitor [ph], which is really kind of a reference site installation optimization exercise that essentially makes sure that we’re creating the very best reference sites we can and understanding elements of installation that are specific to the new platform. 
That program is not completed until the end of this quarter, so the fiscal third quarter but quite frankly as you can see it’s not standing in the way of us taking orders for Radixact. So we’ve got sites in both the U.S. and Europe that are reference sites that we’ve already taken to revenue and that are all treating patients today. And again we expect that they’ll be completed with ramp and monitor as a phase by the end of the third quarter but generally the feedback from those customers that now have patient treatment experiences with the new system has been really positive, very strong feedback, positive feedback about speed, product performance and so much this is exceeding their expectations quite frankly. 
So we’ve again a stronger sense that we’ve got with Radixact, a true workhorse product and a product that quite frankly is going to really meet the needs of a lot of customers. 
Josh Jennings 
Thanks for that. Sorry for the multi-pronged question. Just one follow-up, just on the replacement cycle, I don't -- sorry if you guys commented on this in your prepared remarks but can you give us an idea whether you’re maintaining that replacement conversion rate? And then lastly with Radixact and with the next generation CyberKnife with the InCise MLC, are you seeing any customers move up their replacement timeline to have the latest and greatest Accuray technology platform earlier than say 10 years? Thanks for taking the questions guys. 
Kevin Waters
So I'll start. I will let Josh come -- follow-up on the timing. We did see in the second quarter, Josh above, I’d say historical performance on the replacement cycle. We have said that you should expect in fiscal 2017 for us to be in the 10% to 20% range as a percent of total orders. We were north of that in the second quarter. But I don’t get too excited about looking at it on a quarterly basis. I think for fiscal 2017 we’re still comfortable with placements being somewhere in the 10% to 20% range of total orders. 
Joshua H. Levine
Josh, on the accelerated timing, if you will, part of the question, again if you look at the profile of the typical location that we have our installed base equipment and you’re talking about large multi-bunker academic institutions, generally a more complex case mix of patients that end up being treated in those institutions, and in many cases people that lead those departments and those -- the radiation oncology practice, if you will, at those medical centers, are pretty well-known key opinion leaders, people that are still actively involved in research with those patient populations and our devices. So there’s generally a desire to have, what I would characterize as the latest and greatest, if you will in terms of our equipment. 
I think maybe in certain cases you see people that would -- and have the capability from a budget and a flexibility standpoint to be able to go, to upgrade, perhaps sooner than a ten year replacement cycle but our expectations are that it isn't necessarily that that’s going to happen on a routine basis or a highly predictable basis. 
We’ve got a lot to keep us busy quite frankly, just at the level of replacement sale opportunity in front of us. Again it’s 200 plus systems across CyberKnife and TomoTherapy, on both platforms and again I think we have a fairly robust view of the momentum if you will of replacement sales continuing. 

Josh Jennings 
Thanks for those answers. Appreciate it. 
Joshua H. Levine
Thanks Josh.
Operator 
And our next question comes from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Your line is open. 
Anthony Petrone
Thanks and good afternoon. Maybe I’ll start with a higher level question just on the market landscape and then move into a couple on guidance. But maybe just Josh and Kevin if you provide an update on the competitive landscape, just as it relates to elect and vary and maybe the similarities and differences around the landscape heading into calendar year 2017?
Kevin Waters
So I’ll start Anthony. I think again if you look at where, certainly where our replacement sales opportunity resides, again you've got heavy concentration in the U.S. and Western Europe. In the U.S. market the primary people we're competing against is Variant. Probably seven out of the ten bunkers that our sales people drive past have a Variant device of one form or another running in those vaults. So I'd say it's a very -- from a competitive scenario, it's a very Variant-centric kind of landscape. 
I think we're doing a really good job of maintaining and retaining our existing bunkers. And we are showing that with improved functionality and product capability and reliability we've got -- in a competitive sense, we've got the ability to convince single and dual vault locations that Tomo and now Radixact are really viable options for them, where overtime if you look back over the last four-five years that quite frankly historically wasn't the case. 
So I think we're feeling pretty good about the competitive dynamics. Again we're not wining at 100%, we're not going to win at 100%. But I think we're being a more viable competitor quite frankly today, than we've been at any point of time in my experience at Accuray.
Anthony Petrone
That's helpful and maybe just to clarify from a bunker size standpoint is Tomo and Radixact similar to sort of existing dimensions for the majority of those installed Variant bunkers?
Kevin Waters
Yeah, they would certainly be more characteristic of a relatively easy substitution, relatively minimal bunker modification would be required. So that certainly helps the discussion. 
Anthony Petrone
Okay. And then just on guidance, you've mentioned distributor orders. I'm just trying to get a sense of the difference in timing of revenue recognition sort of when you have a distributor order versus a direct sales order. And maybe just the last question would be what do age outs and cancellations look like with respect to distributor orders versus direct orders? Thanks. 
Kevin Waters
Yeah, so I'll answer your age out question first. Our age outs historically have been primarily distributor orders as compared to direct orders. With that said the comments I made about expecting age outs in '17 to improve as a percentage of backlog over fiscal 2016's level of 13% takes into account the increase in the revenue conversion cycle that both Josh and I highlighted. So we've already factored in any impact that would have in our age out guidance. 
Your first question with regards to differences in conversion timing, I mean the fact is it does vary by region. And you're going to see some differences. I think in this quarter we are impacted primarily, as I mentioned on the revenue side by our distributors in the European region primarily the non-Western European regions where we use distributors. However on a positive note, we highlighted I think in our third quarter call last year, Japan which is a region where we are 100% distributor and we've actually seen that conversion process improve over the last six to nine months, so much so that Japan now in the first half of 2017 is representing approximately 15% of total company revenues as compared to 5% in the first half of 2016. 

So it's vary region specific, macro factor specific, but the weakness and the delays we saw in the first half of 2017 were primarily Europe.
Anthony Petrone
Very helpful. Thanks. 
Operator
And our next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst
Hey guys, thanks. It's actually Patrick in for Tycho. Maybe just to expand on Anthony's question on revenue conversion. Definitely understand it's more difficult to handicap given distributors, all that direct control. But now that you've kind of identified that as a problem and increased focus on it, is there anything you can do to accelerate conversion from the distributors or how you're thinking about improving that a little bit. 
Joshua H. Levine
Yeah, so Patrick, it's a great question. We just as a little bit of background on the resources that we usually have involved, when we're involved in a direct sale and then where we have primary responsibility for installation. We've got installation teams and essentially revenue conversion teams in our regions that are working with end user facilities on site planning elements and site planning details, working on installation details and bunker modification components -- elements of the process, and coordination quite frankly in some cases with contractors locally to support those activities that I just described. Those resources are our resources that are dedicated and they’re focused by region and when we're direct sales mechanism and we’ve got responsibility for installation, those resources are highly engaged, actively engaged in a really end-to-end process with the site and institution, the end user institution.
We are trying to work more closely with distributors to find out its – it’s really a little bit of the help us, help you discussion. We’re working with them to find out what we can bring with regards to some of the resources I just described that would help augment or help support, perhaps in ways that they’re not capable of on their own, those – the execution if you will of those activities that I just described. 
So we’ve got a large number of independent distributors that we work with in different parts of the world, but this is not necessarily an exercise for us where we’ve got to support every one of them. These -- the orders are probably, more heavily concentrated in, again, as Kevin described before, central Europe, certainly, as of – most recently Japan -- well that’s an improving situation as Kevin highlighted. So we have -- I think we have the resources from the Accuray side that need to be engaged in these conversations with distributors pushing and expanding their involvement perhaps if you will in efforts to move this process forward in a more expedited fashion.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. That’s helpful. And then may be one for Kevin, just on gross margins, now they’re obviously a bit soft in the first half. Now looking out -- you guys gave at the Analyst Day the longer term target of 45%. Maybe just talk to your confidence level in that number and the key leverage to get you there from obviously a lower base coming off first half of the year?
Kevin Waters
Yeah. So as I mentioned your question really is two parts. On the second quarter as I said, the most significant factor continues to be really mix and we were hurt in the first half of the year by product mix having a high ratio of Tomo revenues and also just an overall lower sales volume. We still think given our forecast for the back half for the year, we can get back to essentially flat product margins in 2017 as compared to 2016. 
Longer term, we still continue to work towards the goal we put forward on Analyst Day of 45% overall margins. This would represent service margins in the low 40% range, product margins in the high 40s. Revenue improvements are an obvious factor in regard to margin improvements, but another thing, we are also working on as a company, which we haven’t talked about in a few quarters, we do remain focused on cost down initiatives on our systems and we are currently investing in several large standing engineering products, which will not benefit fiscal 2017, but it is going to contribute as we head into 2018 and 2019.

So I don’t view our overall margin results in the first six months as any risk or indication that we can’t get to where we want to get to in fiscal 2019.
Unidentified Analyst
Understood. And maybe just one, last one, you guys mentioned Japan, an increase in product revenue, I don’t think you’ve shown any improvement to Radixact yet. So maybe what are you anticipating that, what’s the visibility there on that, and then how significant is the opportunity for Radixact? Thank you.
Kevin Waters
Yes. So we’ve submitted all the necessary paper work for showing [ph] an approval in Japan and we expect that very shortly, we expect in our fiscal third quarter.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Brandon Henry from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Brandon Henry
Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Motion management, it's an important differentiator for CyberKnife, that’s not yet available on the Radixact platform. So can you provide us with an update on the timeline for the motion management for Radixact? And then discuss, how important you think this technology will be in driving TomoTherapy replacements? And I have a follow-up question.
Kevin Waters
Brandon, it’s a great question. The – what you describe in terms of capability on CyberKnife, which is the motion management capability the software component to that which is the automated theme adjustment capability through synchrony, these are similar technology upgrades that we believe are going to be really pretty central to longer term adoption and utility of Radixact going forward.
This is a highly upgradable platform that will allow for motion tracking overtime, motion correction in terms of beam [ph] correction overtime. So, if you think about how CyberKnife has evolved Radixact would look again different platform obviously but would look similar in terms of how it tracts along those upgradability pathways if you will, and this is a major, at least my feedback, this is a major part of the thought process for those customers that are looking at considering Radixact in the replacement sales discussion. 
Again if you think it about it in terms of our existing installed base we’re taking a customer with earlier generation product and even in an upgraded form that earlier generation product will never get to the level of capability from a functionality perspective that Radixact will, given the functionality improvements that I just described. And we haven't been specifically quite frankly about timing, but I would say that we feel pretty good about the rate at which or the pace at which we are moving through our technology roadmap and advancing the development of these incremental product capabilities.
Brandon Henry
Okay. And then just a couple of questions. First, have you seen any differences in the historical win rate for replacements for TomoTherapy versus CyberKnife and then also the replacement rates for the U.S. versus international market?
Joshua H. Levine
No, we haven’t. I think the answer would be it's too early to draw any definitive conclusions. We’re very early in this replacement cycle. I will say the first half of 2017 yielded positive results on both product platforms. We saw in the U.S. predominantly all replacement sales and also predominantly CyberKnife related, while in the OUS we saw a nice mix of replacement sales and the competitive wins across both platforms. So I don’t think -- I think it’s too early in the cycle Brandon to draw any conclusion. We’re performing kind of at or above our expectations on replacements sales across both product platforms at the movement.
Brandon Henry
Okay. And then final question from me, you mentioned that operating expenses will now be down 3% to 4% for this fiscal year versus I think previous guidance, of kind of flat, can you talk about where the cost reduction is coming from and also if fiscal second half revenue performance does fall short of expectations, are there additional opportunities for cost cutting that would still allow you to meet your fiscal year 2017 adjusted EBITDA guidance? Thanks.

Kevin Waters
Yeah, I believe so. So we finished for the first six months of 2017 roughly down $10 million in OpEx or 12% below prior year. 4.4, roughly 4.5 of that is attributable to legal expenses, I'll call them nonrecurring and what you seeing in the first half is lower revenue levels leaving to decreased compensation expenses and decreased commission expenses. And our guidance right now of operating expenses down 3% assumes we're within our revenue range of $410 to $420 million and if we would be below that range I think it’s fair to suggest that our operating expenses could potentially be down less than 3% primarily due to the two factors on compensation that I just mentioned, which, by the way, in my prepared remarks I had said that's what gives us, I’d say particularly higher level of confidence in our ability to achieve our EBITDA range.
Brandon Henry
Okay. Thank you.
Kevin Waters
No problem.
Operator
And at this time, I’m showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back to management for any closing remarks.
Joshua H. Levine
Thank you, operator. And thank you everyone for your participation on this afternoon’s call. We look forward to talking with you again on our fiscal third quarter earnings call and thanks and have a good evening.

Welcome to the Accuray Incorporated Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Doug Sherk. Sir, please go ahead.
Douglas Sherk
Thank you, Liz and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Accuray's conference call to review financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 which ended on March 31, 2017, as well as recent corporate developments. Joining us today are Josh Levine, Accuray's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Waters, Accuray's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that our call today includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements regarding our business plans and strategies as well as our outlook for fiscal 2017.
There are a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations including, but not limited to, risks associated with the adoption of the CyberKnife, TomoTherapy, Onrad and Radixact Systems; commercial execution; future order growth; future revenue growth; and macroeconomic factors outside of the company's control.
These and other risks are more fully described in the press release we issued after the market closed this afternoon as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions].
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Accuray's President and Chief Executive Officer, Josh Levine.
Joshua Levine
Thank you, Doug. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us on today's call. Following the market close today, we reported third quarter financial results highlighted by strong growth for both gross orders and backlog. Gross orders for the third quarter increased 49% year-over-year to $83.8 million while our backlog grew to a record $450 million which is approximately 21% higher than prior year. This built upon our second quarter gross order results that we reported in late January which were also ahead of our expectations. These order results help illustrate why we reiterated our gross order guidance for the full year back in January and are doing so again today.
At the same time, our revenue results in the third quarter were moderated by the continued delay in the announcement of class A radiotherapy licenses in China and the long revenue conversion time associated with a higher mix of distributor source orders. We have pointed out during our Q2 earnings call that our full year revenue outlook could potentially be impacted by these 2 factors and this was proven to be the case. As a result, we're recasting our full year revenue outlook to a range of $380 million to $390 million. While we're encouraged by our continued momentum in order growth, we're not pleased with the trends related to the timing of revenue conversion and are announcing today a number of executive-level personnel and structural organization changes with a focus in 3 key areas, first, to ensure that we build on our recent order momentum; second, to improve our revenue conversion time lines in those regions where distributor-initiated orders have become a bigger part of the overall order mix in our backlog; and lastly, to drive a more streamlined executive-level structure to improve our overall market responsiveness.

The first of these changes is the elimination of the Chief Operating Officer position held by Kelly Londy; and the promotion of Lionel Hadjadjeba, the Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. Kelly will remain with Accuray through the end of the fiscal year to ensure a smooth transition and I deeply appreciate her many contributions to Accuray over her 6-year tenure. At the same time, I look forward to working more directly with Lionel and his commercial management team to drive our business.
As Chief Commercial Officer, Lionel will bring a high level of focus, accountability and urgency to our commercial sales efforts. Additionally, in this role, Lionel will help bridge and link the multiple departments and personnel that are involved in customer-facing activities, some of which are regionally based and some of which come from our headquarter location in Sunnyvale and our international subsidiary location outside of Geneva, Switzerland. Lionel joined Accuray in 2012 as the president of our international business and most recently has been leading the worldwide sales and service organization. In this new role, Lionel will remain -- will maintain worldwide responsibility for all our sales regions while reporting directly to me. Lionel will lead all of the corporate and region-based customer-facing activities and processes that impact commercial momentum, including sales, marketing, service, medical affairs, training and medical education.
Additionally, we announced today the creation of a dedicated Vice President of Revenue Management position that will report to Kevin Waters, our Chief Financial Officer. This position will be responsible for driving the revenue forecast and overseeing the order-to-revenue conversion process for the company by working closely with our regional installation, service and commercial teams to ensure we will improve the overall timing and cadence of system installation and ultimately revenue conversion.
Turning back to the quarter's results. Our third quarter order results validate customer market perceptions about our improved product functionality, performance and reliability. Accuray's competitive position for both product and service offerings continues to strengthen. And on a global basis, we continue to win more competitive bunkers than we lose. In addition, our product portfolio is strongly aligned with 2 of the fastest-growing radiotherapy treatment segments, image-guided IMRT and SBRT.
The latest generation of our TomoTherapy product platform, Radixact, has continued to contribute to our order growth since the early rollout phase of reference sites began late last calendar year. I'm happy to announce we have completed the ramp in monitor phase of the commercial launch process. And as of today's call, full commercial launch is now underway. We have received positive feedback from all of our reference sites in the U.S. and Europe that confirm Radixact's improvements in treatment planning and overall treatment speed as the standout differentiating attributes of the system while still providing our customers with the unparalleled treatment precision of the TomoTherapy architecture for their most challenging cases.
As an example, we have received feedback from one of our reference sites at a new state-of-the-art cancer center in South Florida. This customer has routinely been treating over 30 patients per day within a standard daily treatment schedule. Customers at our other reference sites have shared similarly positive feedback. The Radixact System is proving itself to be a platform that can treat the broadest range of cancer patients quickly and precisely, making it a viable choice as a mainstream clinical treatment option.
In another positive piece of Radixact news, in January, we received Shonin approval in Japan for Radixact and we're able to secure several Radixact orders from that market during the fiscal third quarter which exceeded our expectations. Additionally, we expect our first Radixact patient treated in Japan sometime in fiscal Q4.

Accuray's second new product, Onrad, also provided a modest contribution to our fiscal Q3 gross orders which was in line with our expectations. And we're continuing to focus on advancing the provincial tender processes and building our sales funnel for this segment of the market. As we had communicated in our last call, we expected initial OnRad order uptake in Q3 with order momentum ramping from there.
Moving to CyberKnife. We saw continued market interest and order momentum during the third quarter. CyberKnife orders represented approximately 50% of our gross order dollars in the quarter. We believe much of this momentum can be attributed to the better clinician and patient experiences provided by the CyberKnife M6 system, including greater functionality with the MLC-enabling treatment of a broader case range with faster planning and treatment times. We also believe market awareness and confidence in CyberKnife's unique capabilities for treating prostate cancer which is the fastest-growing cancer diagnosis in the male population, is helping to drive prospective customer interest.
Recently emerging clinical data about CyberKnife's capabilities in the treatment of prostate cancer is having a positive effect on customer awareness. The most recent CyberKnife study was presented at the ASCO-sponsored Genitourinary Cancers Symposium by Dr. Donald Fuller in February. Dr. Fuller's study showed that CyberKnife treatment's for treating localized prostate cancer can be successfully delivered by community-based centers as well as academic hospitals. 90% of the 259 patients in the study were treated at facilities identifying themselves as community-based nonacademic across the United States. And after a 5-year follow-up, 100% of the 112 patients low-risk patients treated by CyberKnife remain disease-free and 88.5% of the intermediate-risk patients treated remain disease-free. Importantly, the study also found that toxicity levels in the 259 patients treated with CyberKnife compare favorably to the toxicity levels of other radiotherapies.
Dr. Fuller's results mirror the clinically significant CyberKnife-specific SBRT prostate study presented at ASTRO last September by Dr. Robert Meier. When taken together, the clinical findings of both of these important studies represent the first truly device-specific data with long term patient follow-up and validate CyberKnife's unique capabilities and clinical value for safely and effectively treating low- and intermediate-risk prostate patients. Clinical studies at the time led by Doctors Meier and Fuller help clinically validate and continue to drive the broader market trends we're seeing in the shift towards SBRT and hypofractionated treatment delivery. 
In another example of how CyberKnife is transforming prostate treatment delivery, feedback from one of the largest volume, multidisciplinary urology practices in the U.S. indicated that they had recently treated their 1,000th patient -- prostate patient with their MLC-equipped CyberKnife since installing the M6 system in October of 2013, with a significant ramp in the number of patients over the last 2 years. We believe the most recently released clinical data on the treatment of prostate cancer with CyberKnife can be particularly powerful in the upcoming months when CMS is expected to release a report on episodic payments. Both ASTRO and ACRO have submitted proposals to CMS on episodic payment models. These proposals if adopted would position hyperfractionation which is what our technologies are extremely well suited to provide, in favorable reimbursement position.
Additionally, the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force has issued draft screening guidelines for prostate cancer that, rather than discouraging screening, advised patients to discuss screening with their doctors. We anticipate finalization of those guidelines later this calendar year and believe they will be a positive catalyst that will likely bring patients in for earlier diagnosis and treatment.

Finally, I'd like to have a -- say a few words about customer feedback. At the beginning of this month, we held the Accuray AERO Users' Summit in Chicago. While this summit enables our customers to share best practices and learn about innovative approaches to improving treatment results for their patients, it also enables our management team to gather customer feedback. Over the course of the 2-day event, we met with more than 70 customers, representing a broad cross-section of large academic institutions as well as smaller regional and community-based facilities and received an overwhelming level of support and positive feedback for the improvements we have made to the functionality and reliability of our product portfolio.
We believe that the organizational changes we announced today will result in improved consistency and execution of both orders and revenue conversion timing. The growth drivers we have laid out for our business remain firmly in place, namely the growing need for radiotherapy devices globally, the positioning of Accuray's product portfolio in the fastest-growing treatment segments of the market, the growing body of data illustrating the clinical efficacy of Accuray's technology and the upcoming replacement sales opportunity in our installed base with systems entering their 10-year replacement window.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin.
Kevin Waters
Thank you, Josh and good afternoon, everyone. As Josh highlighted, we ended the third quarter with backlog of $450 million, representing growth of 21% over the prior year. Our Q3 performance included gross orders of $83.8 million and net orders of $71.8 million, reflecting age-outs of $8.5 million, 1 cancellation for $2.8 million and $700,000 of negative foreign currency impact. Age-outs in the quarter were better than we anticipated, as an order which we expected to age-out ended up being shipped during the quarter.
Gross order performance was favorably impacted by both our new Radixact System as well as significantly more CyberKnife System orders compared to the same prior year period.
Order growth by geography was driven by strong performance in Asia Pacific, Japan and our European region. On a year-to-date basis order growth is up 13% over the first 9 months of prior year. Additionally, our replacement order rates have continued at a consistent pace during the first 9 months of fiscal 2017.
Turning now to our income statement. Total revenue for the third quarter was $97.3 million, representing an increase of 11% on a sequential basis. This compares to revenue of $105.3 million in the year ago period.
Product revenue for the quarter was $48 million. Product revenues in both the U.S. and Japan were significantly above prior year revenues. However, as Josh touched on, both China and the longer revenue conversion times, particularly in Europe, negatively impacted Q3 revenue performance.
Service revenue for the third quarter was $49.3 million compared with $51.5 million in the year ago period which was slightly below our expectations due to less installation and training revenue which coincides with the shortfall in product revenues.
Turning now to gross margins. Our overall gross margin for the quarter was 36.4% compared with the prior year period gross margin of 42.7%, primarily driven by reduced product gross margins. Product gross margins decreased 650 basis points over the prior year, primarily driven by the lower overall unit sales volume as well as product and channel mix. Overall pricing was stable as compared to the year ago period and within our expectations.
Product gross margins should improve sequentially in the fourth quarter on higher unit sales volume. However, on a full year basis, product margins will now be approximately 37% to 39% which is due to a combination of product and channel mix and lower overall revenues.

Service gross margins in the fiscal third quarter were 34% as compared with 40% in the year ago period. On a year-to-date basis, service margins are 36% which are slightly below prior year-to-date performance of 37%. We continue our focus on improved parts reliability and cost management and continue to anticipate full year fiscal 2017 service margins to be at or above 2016 which were 36%.
Operating expenses for the quarter were $36.7 million. This 7% reduction compared to the prior year was driven by a $2.5 million decrease in G&A and an $800,000 decrease in R&D while we had a slight increase of $500,000 in selling and marketing.
Our improvement in G&A was the result of lower legal expenses while R&D was the result of lower development expenses, primarily related to prior year costs associated with the development of the Radixact System. Adjusted EBITDA was $7.1 million compared to $13.9 million in the year ago period. Adjusted EBITDA through the first 9 months of the fiscal year was $10.1 million compared to $19.6 million in the prior year.
Turning to the balance sheet. We had $84.1 million of cash and investments at March 31, 2017. The $24.3 million sequential decrease in cash from the second quarter is due to restricting $12.5 million to satisfy future payment obligations associated with our term loan and also a decrease from working capital usage.
With regard to our fourth quarter cash flows, we expect to generate positive cash flow, primarily through a decrease in working capital on reduced accounts receivable and inventory balances.
With respect to our outstanding convertible debt that is due in February 2018, we're currently evaluating all financing sources that will allow us to either refinance our existing convertible debt or provide the cash necessary to settle the debt in cash at maturity, thus avoiding additional potential dilution.
Turning now to our annual guidance for fiscal 2017. We're today updating our guidance as follows, Year-over-year growth of approximately 5% for gross orders which is unchanged from our previous guidance. Revenue within the range of approximately $380 million to $390 million. This compares to our previous guidance range of $410 million to $420 million and reflects a reduction due to the delay in the issuance of China class A licenses and extended revenue conversion timing associated with distributor orders.
Our outlook for adjusted EBITDA is a range of $22 million to $26 million compared to $32 million to $38 million previously and reflects our revised revenue outlook and an operating expense decline of 8% to 10% compared to the prior year. The operating expense decline from previously issued guidance is primarily due to less incentive compensation expenses associated with the revised revenue range.
We anticipate closing out fiscal 2017 with product system backlog of approximately $445 million to $460 million. This includes Q4 age-outs of approximately $15 million to $20 million. Age-out as a percentage of ending backlog for the full year fiscal 2017 would represent a slight improvement over fiscal 2016 and ending backlog would show growth of 10% to 13% over prior year.
And with that, I would now like to hand the call back to Josh.
Joshua Levine
Thanks, Kevin. Before we open up the call for your questions, I'd like to thank the entire Accuray team for their focus and contribution this quarter. Our company's commitment to the important work we're doing in improving the lives of cancer patients by providing leading-edge treatment solutions remains central to our mission.
And now, operator, we're ready to open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.

Tycho Peterson
Josh, maybe on the distributor dynamics. I know you called this out last quarter, but you had reaffirmed guidance last quarter and kind of anticipated that this would be kind of a manageable issue. Can you maybe just talk about, to the extent that you are taking steps -- and I know you talked a little bit about this in the last earnings call in terms of trying to accelerate that conversion, maybe just talk about any incremental progress you've had there and how long do you think it takes to resolve these issues.
Joshua Levine
So I think we've made some progress, but I don't think that progress, Tyco, has been enough. It's one of the reasons why we're putting the role that we described in our prepared remarks in place and getting better focus on and better alignment. I think that -- you remember the conversation we had at the end of last quarter, this is a consequence, quite frankly, in terms of the mix -- the order mix in the backlog. It's primarily in the markets or regions where we have bigger distributor order growth taking place.
And as a consequence, we basically don't have the same clear line of sight around those basic activities that are -- we're managing on our own in the direct business, like site planning, installation planning, coordination of contractors. We have a distributor in the middle of those conversations. We have an end user that we're trying to coordinate calendarization of those activities with which creates a longer revenue conversion cycle. The strategy and the thought process around the VP of Revenue role is that we have one person there at that point that drives the forecasting process, but the details that underpin the forecasting process such as the entire end-to-end order revenue conversion process, so coordination, working with our regional installation and service teams, coordinating with the distribution partners and the end-user facilities to ensure that we've got essentially the pieces moving in the right direction to improve installation cadence and execution. And so there are some process changes that I think that will take place.
I don't see those as sweeping. But the creation of this dedicated role focused on this process from end to end, I think, will be a very, very helpful piece to improved forecast predictability. And I also think that having this position report to Kevin Waters puts added visibility and a sense of process discipline and urgency to it that, quite frankly, in my view, have been somewhat lacking. So that's the high-level thought process about the strategy with it.
Tycho Peterson
Okay. And then for my follow-up, just on competitive dynamics. Last quarter, I think you talked about winning 75% to 80% of replacement orders. Is that kind of still holding? And as we think about early interest in Onrad, how do you think about just competitive dynamics there? Obviously, Varian is talking about launching a new lower-end system for emerging markets as well.
Joshua Levine
Yes. So nothing has changed with regards to the order mix and what's impacting it. We're still seeing roughly 10% to 20% of the order mix coming from the installed base replacement opportunities. The -- that means, by definition, the remaining roughly 80% to 90% of orders are coming either from greenfield opportunities or competitive opportunities. And so as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we -- on a global basis, we're still seeing winning at a higher rate than we're giving up our own bunkers. So we feel good about that. Radixact has been a good contributor albeit early in that discussion.
We have order activity in the third quarter that's Radixact related. And this is the first quarter of true full commercial launch. So we have basically all of our reference sites now up and running and actively treating patients which is going to help expand the sales process and the advancement in terms of sales funnel for this, in general. We've heard the market chatter about what Varian may or may not be coming to the market with an escrow. But at this point, it's too early to speculate on what that might mean or what the potential impact of that is. We've gotten really good feedback from the sites that are using Radixact in terms of tangible differences in the treatment planning capability and treatment speed. So we feel good about early functionality, early feedback on functionality at this point that Radixact has been getting.

Operator
Our next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen and Company.
Joshua Jennings
I was hoping to follow up on the revenue conversion issue. And can you just help us think about as we get into fiscal '18 and you anniversary the revenue conversion lag times, how does that start to play out? Clearly, you have some new people in place and you're trying to optimize the path forward. But once you anniversary the lag times, will you be able to manage that better? Or does it just continue to cause issues in terms of revenue recognition?
Kevin Waters
Josh, this is Kevin. So we're not going to comment on 2018 guidance specifically. We'll do that on our next call. But just in a general sense, our revenue growth rates going forward should more appropriately reflect the growth in our product revenue backlog and that's not what's occurring this year. And we think by making some of these process changes, we could have the future more appropriately reflect those growth rates.
I'd also use an analogy here. And if you look at a country like Japan which is 100% distributor, where we cited their increased revenue conversion process in fiscal 2016, we've been able to put a high level of focus there. And we're now seeing Japan, for example, perform significantly above plan and be a big contributor to our results. And that's the analogy I would use when I look moving forward in regards to us doing what we can do on distributor conversion.
Joshua Jennings
Great. And the growth rates in that order delta, it was the smallest gap in many quarters. You talked about one order that you thought might fall out off of that, but that you -- that went -- turned into an installation. But are there any trends that we should be thinking about in terms of that gap narrowing as we move forward here?
Kevin Waters
Yes. I don't think there's any trend. I think -- I also pointed out that age-outs are going to be higher in our fiscal fourth quarter in our prepared remarks. But to put age-outs in perspective, we've highlighted increased revenue conversion times. We've seen others in the industry talk about this phenomenon as well. And we're going to end 2017 with approximately $40 million of orders that are older than 30 months. I'd like to point out that of those $40 million that have aged out, only $10 million of those have subsequently been canceled by the end user. So while we report age-outs, I do believe that the remaining $30 million do have the potential to be future revenue and we're seeing a bit of increased age-outs in our fourth quarter due to this increase in conversion timing.
Joshua Jennings
Great. And my last question. Just on the service revenue not dramatically lower, but it trended lower in Q3 here than we've seen in numerous quarters. How should would be thinking about service revenue growth, maybe what happened in Q3 for the sequential downtick and then how we should be thinking about service revenue growth going forward?
Kevin Waters
Yes. So I'll speak to the sequential downtick. So service revenue is dependent on product revenue as well. So we record installation and training revenue at the same time as we have installs. And when we have a quarter like we did in this fiscal third quarter, where distributors in Japan, for example, perform very well, we're not responsible for installation in those markets. And therefore, we see a decline in installation and training revenue. On top of that, we also had less upgrade revenue in our fiscal third quarter. We think our service revenue growth rate should improve as we head into 2018 as we have more upgrades to offer and we can start to fill that pipeline again.
Operator
Our next question comes from Amit Hazan with Citi.
Unidentified Analyst
This is Phil [ph] on for Amit. I guess, I'll start with the other side of guidance. Maybe great order number from a gross perspective and through 3 quarters. Just what went into the decision, I guess, not to take that guidance level up for the rest of the year? Was there any pull forward that we saw or what went into that decision?

Kevin Waters
I think, just to be quite honest, given our trends and we're sitting on a call here where we've lowered revenue guidance, we're happy with our full year order guidance. However, Q4 would still suggest a number of approximately $85 million which would represent a quarterly high for us in 2017. We believe that's attainable due to the strength of our funnel, but we just didn't feel it was appropriate even though we're ahead of our expectations to look at raising that metric at the time.
With that said, as we exit 2017, our second half growth rate orders would be kind of in the 11% to 12% range. And I think that's pointing to a lot of the initiatives that Josh highlighted in terms of the full Radixact launch and some of our success in the replacement cycle. But again, we're happy to be ahead where we expect it to be. But we just thought given the Q4 absolute numbers, it's still a large number. It wouldn't be appropriate to raise that metric.
Unidentified Analyst
Right. Understood. Sounds good. Maybe just a little bit higher level, any comment on either pricing or purchasing trends maybe in light of political AHCA uncertainty? Anything you've seen there would be great.
Joshua Levine
No impact, Phil [ph], at least from an AHCA discussion standpoint. And I'd say pricing has continued to operate or flow at the levels that we expected it to. We don't see any major degradation there, so I'd say it's fairly stable.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Henry with RBC Capital Markets.
Brandon Henry
So you guys lowered revenue guidance by $30 million. Can you help me parse out what the impact was from the continued delay from Chinese class A quotas and then what the impact was in the longer distributor conversions?
Kevin Waters
Yes. So it's roughly equal. So the China class A delay, we were anticipating approximately $10 million to $15 million in the back half of our fiscal year and probably more in the high end there. So you're looking at a $15 million shortfall from China class A. And then it'd be a roughly equal contribution from the delay of the distributor orders that Josh discussed. That distributor conversion, by the way, I'd point out, was primarily for orders in Eastern Europe due both to construction and end-user project delays.
Brandon Henry
Okay. And then separately, you guys mentioned that ASTRO and ACRO are working on bundled payment model for radiation oncology. Can you give us a sense regarding the potential timing of implementation of these initiatives and how quickly you think they'll be rolled out?
Joshua Levine
Brandon, we don't have -- we're tracking it, but we don't have any greater insights than you do on timing. We know that the inputs to CMS have been made and CMS is expected to release a report sometime fairly soon. But don't have visibility on exact timing of that. So I guess, it's a stay tuned kind of answer. But again, our takeaway on this is that when you think about episodic payment structures and models and you think about what really is implied there with regards to the opportunity both clinically for the patient, overall experience for the patient and the payer market impact in terms of the economics -- the health economic impact of this, all signs point to the fact that hypofractionated treatment, SBRT in a hypofractionated form is really a good solution for all of those constituencies that I just talked about. And we, quite frankly, think we're really well positioned with our current portfolio to help take advantage of that. I guess, from a timing standpoint, we think this is relatively soon, maybe this summer. But again, I don't know -- we don't have an exact time frame.
Operator
Our next question comes from Christian Moore with Jefferies.
Christian Moore

Maybe one on Radixact. It seems like it's progressing well. We were just wondering if you could help quantify the contributions to the gross orders. And just by geography, a little color on what you're seeing in Radixact uptake. Obviously, it's in Japan now and how the ramp in Europe and U.S. is going as well.
Kevin Waters
Yes. This is Kevin. So we have said that roughly 50% of our orders were CyberKnife orders in Josh's remarks which means the other 50% are on the TomoTherapy platform. We're not going to break out what amount of TomoTherapy platform orders were the H Series versus Radixact. What I will say is that we did have -- Radixact was a significant contributor to that number. We did have initial placements in Japan with Shonin approval which we received in January which was above our expectations. And then we also have CE Mark for Radixact in the Eurozone and also obviously FDA approval. And so that's why continue to sell that product.
Christian Moore
And then maybe one just on the upcoming ASTRO conference. Have you factored in anything from a competitive launch standpoint in terms of what Varian is expected to be bringing into the market for fiscal '17 or beyond in your models? And is there anything else that investor -- that you want us to be paying attention to?
Joshua Levine
Yes. I mean, I think the direct answer on factoring things into forward looking, in fact, is -- when I say forward looking, I guess, I'm referring to fiscal '18. We're not going to be talking about guidance or expectations on '18 until we get to our year-end earnings release. But we -- the forecast that we're running to, from an internal standpoint, are to take into account what we know right now. And again, I think I indicated before that we have heard some market noise, customer noise about a Varian product launch in escrow, but we don't have any further information than you do beyond what was communicated yesterday in Varian's release. It sounds like it's a product that may be more focused on emerging markets. But I think that's at this point speculation on what it means. And specific impact, it's too early to really predict.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Sean Lavin with BTIG.
Ryan Zimmerman
This is actually Ryan on for Sean. So just one for Kevin. With the operational changes underway and the process improvements related to revenue conversion, should we be thinking about any onetime charges or nonrecurring charges over the next few quarters as you guys implement those processes?
Kevin Waters
No. In fact, all of the discussion -- changes that Josh referenced, any onetime severance thing is already factored into our operating expense guidance that we gave. I would expect that as we staff this function, there could be additional adds but nothing material. We'd still be able to adhere to kind of our operating expense run rate. So nothing unusual there.
Operator
Showing no further questions in queue at this time, I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Levine for any closing remarks.
Joshua Levine
Thank you, operator and thank you, everyone, for your participation this afternoon. We look forward to talking with you on our fiscal fourth quarter earnings call. Thanks and have a good evening.
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.
