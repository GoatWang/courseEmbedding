      The above results for the second quarter of 2017, as compared to the 
      same period in 2016, reflected the following operating elements:
    


        The approximately $10.0 million increase in revenues as described 
        above;
      

        An increase in direct cost of revenues of approximately $5.0 million 
        primarily related to the increase in the direct cost of revenues for 
        the real estate operations of approximately $4.7 million, which 
        primarily reflects the increase of approximately $3.7 million in cost 
        basis related to the increased land sales during the quarter;
      

        The sale of mitigation credits to Minto Communities, LLC during the 
        second quarter of 2017 for approximately $1.1 million resulting in a 
        gain of approximately $932,000, or $0.10 per share, after tax;
      

        An increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately 
        $828,000 primarily related to the legal and other costs related to our 
        contested director election at our 2017 annual shareholder meeting;
      

        An increase in depreciation and amortization of approximately $1.4 
        million resulting from the growth in our income property portfolio; and
      

        Income of approximately $1.4 million recognized in the second quarter 
        of 2016 in connection with the Company’s disposition of four 
        single-tenant income properties offset by the recognition of 
        approximately $2.0 million in impairment charges in the second quarter 
        of 2016.

        A decrease in general and administrative expenses of approximately 
        $749,000 primarily related to a reduction in stock compensation costs 
        of approximately $1.7 million offset by an increase of approximately 
        $1.1 million in the legal and other costs related to our contested 
        director election at our 2017 annual shareholder meeting in excess of 
        the legal costs we incurred in 2016 related to certain other 
        shareholder matters;
      

        An increase in depreciation and amortization of approximately $2.1 
        million resulting from the growth in our income property portfolio;

        acquire the land underlying our golf operations; and
