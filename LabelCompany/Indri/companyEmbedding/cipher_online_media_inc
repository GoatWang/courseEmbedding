The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

The External CipherChain is a unique security tool that you can use for a variety of storage applications. Built on a FIPS certified AES 256-bit crypto engine, the External CipherChain is the perfect solution to secure sensitive data stored on external RAID storage, hard drive, SSDs. You can even secure popular flash media when connected to the External CipherChain by using the Addonics eSATA DigiDrives. The External CipherChain can also be used as a drive sanitization tool for removing any sensitive data stored on an used hard drive or flash media.
Similar to the Addonics field proven CipherChain, the External CipherChain is very easy-to-use and implement. As a simple pass through device between the storage device and the system, once connected up, the simple ion of the Cipher key will activate the encryption and decryption of the data on the fly with no noticeable performance degradation. There is no software or driver to install and no special training required. It is as easy as using a key to open a door. The External CipherChain is Operating System independent and will work on any system.
Any external storage device with eSATA or SATA connection can be attached to the External CipherChain, which in turn connects to any host via an eSATA port. Using an optional Addonics USB 3.0 - eSATA adapter, the External CipherChain can connect to a USB 3.0 / 2.0 port on any computer. The compact size and rugged metal housing of the External Cipherchain makes it extremely portable and easy to deploy in various environments where applications require solid data security. The External CipherChain operates at very low power and can be powered directly by a system using various Addonics optional cables.

 
On the diagram below. Click on the computer to see various host connection options. Click on any eSATA device to see different device connection options.

Security The External CipherChain is a full disk encryption solution. This means that the boot sector, partition table and all the information in the drive are encrypted. If the encrypted external drive is stolen, the drive will appear as a brand new drive with no trace of any data. The AES 256-bit encryption provided by the External CipherChain is considered the highest level of encryption standard, secure enough to protect classified information designated as "Top Secret".
Performance  The External CipherChain encrypts and decrypts data on the fly using a NIST and CSE certified cryptographic AES engine. Unlike software encryption product which depends on system CPUs to encrypt and decrypt data, the External CipherChain has no impact to CPU utilization. This leaves the system CPU to perform all its computing task at normal speed. There is also no measurable impact to the performance on the hard drive.
Cipher key  The AES 256-bit Cipher key used for the encryption/decryption in the External CipherChain is the same Cipher key as used in the Addonics Diamond Cipher drive kit, Ruby Cipher drive kit, CipherChain and CipherChain-E. As a result, you can share the same encryption key to operate on the storage device that has been encrypted by either the CipherChain, Diamond Cipher or Ruby Cipher drive kits. You may also order Cipher keys with the same key codes when you order multiple CipherChain ES kits or Cipher keys. You may also re-programmed the Cipher keys to other codes using the optional key management system or sending the keys to Addonics for the re-programming service at no charge.
Drive Sanitization  The External CipherChain can also be used as a drive sanitization equipment for wiping clean all previous data on a used hard or flash media by using the following operation procedures:

Connect the storage device to be sanitized into device side of the External CipherChain.
Connect the External CipherChain to the computer.
Initialize and perform a standard formatting (not quick format) of the hard drive or the flash media..
Transfer unimportant data to completely fill the hard drive or the flash media . This essentially writes over every sector in the hard drive or the flash media with unimportant encrypted data that are not viewable to any OS. The drive or the flash media, when connects directly to a system, will appear like brand new with no trace of any data
Now connect the drive or flash media directly to the computer. Initialize and format the hard drive or the flash media with any OS to use it as a brand new hard drive or media


 News
2011-03-10  External CipherChainKeeping one's personal data safe at all times is an extremely important task, especially when said pieces of information have quite a sensitive nature, and this is exactly where the new External CipherChain from Addonics comes into play.View article
