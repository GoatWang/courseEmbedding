During the final days of 2015, one San Antonio-based hedge fund sprouted up and raised $267,000 in equity among five investors through pooled investment fund interests and is seeking to raise more, according to a recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.




The company, 1209 Capital Partners LLC. is an investment firm with offices at Union Square that bills itself as a diverse asset manager that specializes in commodity futures trading but also private equity investments. The firm's online portfolio is blocked from public access and the webpage is password protected.

"(The) 1209 (Capital Partners LLC) is primarily a global oil, metals and macroeconomics trading fund but also makes public and private technology, media and telecom investments," wrote Nathan N. Hudson, the chief executive officer of the investment firm in a recent email. "This next year will be a soft opening for 1209 and I look to enlarge the assets under management in 2017."
Hudson is also the principal of the company and investment manager for the pooled investment fund that is set to operate as a hedge fund, according to documents on file with the SEC. His company, 1209 Capital Partners LP was founded in 2013 and no further securities offerings were discovered on file with the federal agency. The total investment for 1209 Capital Partners LP has an indefinite offering and is expected to last more than a year.




 


Hudson holds a degree in Political Science from Brown University and a masters' degree in History from Cambridge University. He is scheduled to receive an undisclosed management fee.
He previously worked as a landman for BlackBrush Oil & Gas Limited Partnership for more than three years starting in 2011 according to his LinkedIn profile. He is also connected to two companies with offices at 10101 Reunion Place in San Antonio -- Hudson Byrd Capital LLC and Texas Energy International LLC.
Hudson Byrd Capital LLC is a company created in 2013 and Aaron Byrd was another partner in that limited liability corporation that has since changed its name to 1209 Capital Partners LLC, according to documents on file in Delaware. Byrd is not part of the new company.
