CLIENT PORTAL















 



Beddow Capital Management provides professional investment management services to individuals, corporations and institutions.
We help clients achieve their financial objectives by investing for long term capital appreciation. Our rigorous research focuses on buying companies at a discount to their private market value. Using fundamental analysis, we build portfolios of U.S. and foreign securities: this international diversification has historically enhanced portfolio returns and reduced volatility. Our goal is to provide superior returns.
We aim to be a key resource for our clients in financial matters. We assist them by interacting with their other advisors such as attorneys, accountants, brokers and bankers. Client service is important to us.
“An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative”. - Benjamin Graham The Intelligent Investor


 

























 



Investment Style –  Beddow Capital





































(307) 734-7300 | info@beddowcapital.com



CLIENT PORTAL


















Investment Style
How do we chose our investments?We are value investors. We pursue a contrarian approach to investment selection and build diversified portfolios. Our focus is on those publicly traded companies which are being valued at a low multiple of earnings, cash flow, book value, or sales. Using a bottom up approach, we study companies whose share price is less than their intrinsic value. We search for inexpensive securities, focusing on areas of the stock market that are out of favor, unwanted or unloved. To be considered, a security must also offer both a margin of safety and attractive prospects for capital appreciation. We expect to generate superior portfolio returns by realizing gains when our investments more closely reflect their true worth.
Our approach favors securities of established businesses which have demonstrated consistent profitability. We study balance sheets and accounting conventions. Publicly available information provides financial and operating data in quarterly and annual reports. We also review Securities and Exchange Commission filings, company presentations and press releases, newspapers and magazines, and data available on the internet. We often visit companies in which we have an interest and make every effort to insure a company’s management is committed to increasing their shareholders’ values. The smaller the company, the more important it is for us to be comfortable with the management.
Our search for value spans the entire capitalization spectrum, from large-cap to micro-cap. In addition to common stock, we may invest in preferred stock, convertible securities, high yield debt obligations, hybrid securities, royalty trusts, partnership interests and other types of securities. We have traditionally invested in foreign securities, both those listed on a U.S. exchange, and those ordinary shares traded in the overseas market. Typically, our foreign investments have been limited to large-cap companies. The most important criterion, however, is that the investment offers the potential for an attractive total return.
We are investors, not traders. We make no attempt to time directional swings in the market, interest rates or exchange rates. We are not concerned with annual benchmark comparisons. Our portfolios generally hold between 25 and 35 individual securities. Historically, turnover has been less than 20% in any one year, indicating an average holding period of five years or more. Consequently, our client portfolios are fully invested at all times. Only rarely has cash represented more than 5% of portfolio value. Based on a 25 year record, we believe our approach will continue to generate superior risk-adjusted returns.

CLIENT PORTAL


















Clients
Who do we serve?Our clients are individuals, pension and profit-sharing plans, trusts, estates, and small businesses who have accumulated significant assets. Many of our clients have been with us for more than a decade and with some families, we include several generations. Our approach to portfolio management emphasizes the accumulation of wealth over the long term by careful security selection. This requires discipline and patience.
Individual investors face greater challenges today than at almost any time in the past. The number of potential investments is increasing as are the challenges of portfolio management. Volatility in securities markets, rapid innovation in financial products, and growing complexity in the tax code require care, skill, and attention in portfolio construction. Personal and professional commitments frequently limit the time and attention an individual is able to devote to making sound financial decisions. Beddow Capital Management aims to be the key resource in achieving a client’s financial goals.
All client portfolios are managed on a fully discretionary basis. We assume responsibility for investment selection, asset allocation, and the ongoing management of your portfolio and report results on a quarterly basis.

About Us
Who are we?EDWARD G. BEDDOW
Founder and President
Edward G. Beddow has been professionally involved with the financial markets for over 35 years. As a Vice President in Dean Witter Reynolds’ investment banking group in the late 1970’s, he gained wide experience in public and private financings and undertook numerous valuation studies associated with merger and acquisition proposals and major capital projects. Since 1987, he has devoted his time exclusively to investment management. He is a member of the CFA Institute, the CFA Society of San Francisco, and a member of the Investment Advisor Association (formerly the Investment Counsel Association of America.)
As a portfolio manager, Ed has developed an investment style that emphasizes a contrarian approach to securities whose underlying value is not currently being reflected in the markets. Ed’s philosophy is that a timely investment in these companies will provide superior long-term returns. His commitment to this value philosophy is underlined by the fact that he invests the major part of his own capital in the same manner as our client portfolios.
Prior to starting his own firm., Ed earned an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business and served five years as a military officer in West Germany and the United States. Ed is a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. He is an avid fly fisherman during the summer months in the Teton mountains where Beddow Capital Management maintains a Jackson, WY office. He enjoys hiking and hopes someday to compete in the One Fly Tournament.

What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.
