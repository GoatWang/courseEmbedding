Early life[edit]
Koppelman was born to a Jewish family,[3] the son of Ruth[4] and Irving Koppelman.[5]
His uncle, Morris Koppelman, held a patent for inventing the Egg carton.
Career[edit]
Koppelman broke into the music business as a member of the musical group The Ivy Three which had a Top 10 hit in 1960 entitled "Yogi", after the cartoon Yogi Bear.[6][7] Soon, Koppelman and bandmate and future business partner Don Rubin joined the songwriting staff of Aldon Music under CEO Don Kirshner, a group that included Carole King, Neil Sedaka, Barry Mann, and Cynthia Weil. When Columbia Pictures purchased Aldon Music, Koppelman was promoted to director of Screen Gems/Columbia Music, the new company that resulted from the merger. In 1965, with financial backing of his uncle, Leon Koppelman, Koppelman and Rubin left Columbia to form Koppelman/Rubin Associates, an entertainment company that signed The Lovin Spoonful the same year. In 1967, Koppleman/Rubin signed The Little Bits of Sound a group from Long Island, New York with a psychedelic sound. In 1968, Commonwealth United purchased Koppelman/Rubin Associates and Koppelman and Rubin stayed on to run the music division. In 1968 they signed the psychedelic band the Rahgoos and famously made the band change its name to Gandalf.[8] During the early 1970s, Koppelman moved on to CBS Records and held numerous positions, including Vice President/National Director of A&R where he signed acts including Billy Joel, Dave Mason, Janis Ian, Journey, and Phoebe Snow.[9]
By the mid-1970s, Koppelman had stepped up to Vice President/General Manager of worldwide publishing for CBS Records. In 1975, he formed The Entertainment Company with Martin Bandier and New York real estate developer and Bandier's father-in-law, Samuel LeFrak. The company independently administered and promoted song catalogs and produced music artists like Barbra Streisand, Dolly Parton, Diana Ross, the Four Tops, and Cher.[9] By 1981 the Entertainment Company had grown into a production company with its own staff of producers and 20 in-house songwriters and in 1984, they purchased the Combine Music catalog of 25,000 country songs.[9] Around that time Koppelman's son, Brian Koppelman, then a student at Tufts University in Boston, discovered musician Tracy Chapman and brought her to his father who soon signed her to a record deal.[10]
In 1986, Koppelman, Bandier, and Stephen C. Swid formed SBK Entertainment World, Inc., in order to buy the 250,000 titles owned by CBS Songs for $125 million, the highest price ever paid for a music publishing portfolio. SBK developed into the largest independent music publisher in the world and played a major role in the careers of artists like Michael Bolton, Robbie Robertson, New Kids on the Block, Icehouse, Al B. Sure!, and Eric B. & Rakim.[9][11]
In 1989, SBK Entertainment World, Inc. was sold to EMI Music for $300 million. As part of the deal, Koppelman and Bandier formed a partnership with EMI Music Worldwide to create their own record label, SBK Records. In addition, Koppelman took the positions of Chairman and CEO of the new label and Chairman of EMI Music Publishing. Bandier received the posts of President and Chief Operating Officer of SBK Records and Vice Chairman of EMI Music Publishing. Only one year after SBK Records opened, they received their first platinum album with Technotronic's Pump Up the Jam. SBK Records went on to sign artists Jesus Jones, Wilson Phillips, and Vanilla Ice, among others. In 1991, Koppelman and Bandier sold their share of SBK Records to EMI Music, making EMI the sole owner of the label. When EMI Music decided to consolidate its operations and formed EMI Records Group North America, Koppelman was subsequently appointed Chairman and CEO. During his time at EMI, Koppelman played an integral role in the reunion of singer Frank Sinatra with Capitol Records, which spawned the five-million-selling album Duets.[9] Koppelman served as CEO until 1997.
From 2000 to 2004 Koppelman was Chairman of Steve Madden, Ltd.,[12] and led the company while Madden served jail time for securities fraud.[13]
In 2005, Koppelman was appointed Chairman of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia.[14] Koppelman also appeared as Martha Stewart's right-hand man on NBC's The Apprentice: Martha Stewart in 2005.[15] He served as de facto CEO of the Company from 2008-2011 when he stepped down to expand his company, CAK Entertainment.[16] Since 2010, Koppelman has served as director at Six Flags Entertainment Corporation[17] and also currently sits on the Board of Directors of Las Vegas Sands.[18]
In June 2014, Koppelman was appointed Chairman of Medient Studios Inc., replacing Manu Kumaran.[19]
CAK Entertainment, Inc.[edit]
Koppelman founded CAK Entertainment in 1997.[20] Along with general counsel David Fritz and Managing Director Stephanie Roberts, the company conducts marketing, brand development and advisory work for artists and companies including Marc Anthony and Jennifer Lopez (managing their apparel and lifestyle products line with Kohl’s Department Stores), Adam Levine and Nicki Minaj (managing their apparel and lifestyle products lines with Kmart), country recording artist Clay Walker, car auctioneer, Barrett-Jackson, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia and Freehand Music.[21]
Personal life[edit]
Koppelman has been married twice. His first wife was Brenda "Bunny" Koppelman who was also Jewish; they had three children: Brian, Stacy and Jennifer. She died of pancreatic cancer in 2008.[22][23] On October 29, 2011, he married Gerri Kyhill Koppelman.[24]
His daughter, Jennifer Hutt is a radio personality who has hosted several radio shows including the popular Sirius Satellite Radio show Just Jenny.[25][26]
His son, Brian Koppelman, is a screenwriter whose credits include Rounders and Ocean's Thirteen.[27][28]

Early life[edit]
Koppelman was born to a Jewish family,[3] the son of Ruth[4] and Irving Koppelman.[5]
His uncle, Morris Koppelman, held a patent for inventing the Egg carton.
Career[edit]
Koppelman broke into the music business as a member of the musical group The Ivy Three which had a Top 10 hit in 1960 entitled "Yogi", after the cartoon Yogi Bear.[6][7] Soon, Koppelman and bandmate and future business partner Don Rubin joined the songwriting staff of Aldon Music under CEO Don Kirshner, a group that included Carole King, Neil Sedaka, Barry Mann, and Cynthia Weil. When Columbia Pictures purchased Aldon Music, Koppelman was promoted to director of Screen Gems/Columbia Music, the new company that resulted from the merger. In 1965, with financial backing of his uncle, Leon Koppelman, Koppelman and Rubin left Columbia to form Koppelman/Rubin Associates, an entertainment company that signed The Lovin Spoonful the same year. In 1967, Koppleman/Rubin signed The Little Bits of Sound a group from Long Island, New York with a psychedelic sound. In 1968, Commonwealth United purchased Koppelman/Rubin Associates and Koppelman and Rubin stayed on to run the music division. In 1968 they signed the psychedelic band the Rahgoos and famously made the band change its name to Gandalf.[8] During the early 1970s, Koppelman moved on to CBS Records and held numerous positions, including Vice President/National Director of A&R where he signed acts including Billy Joel, Dave Mason, Janis Ian, Journey, and Phoebe Snow.[9]
By the mid-1970s, Koppelman had stepped up to Vice President/General Manager of worldwide publishing for CBS Records. In 1975, he formed The Entertainment Company with Martin Bandier and New York real estate developer and Bandier's father-in-law, Samuel LeFrak. The company independently administered and promoted song catalogs and produced music artists like Barbra Streisand, Dolly Parton, Diana Ross, the Four Tops, and Cher.[9] By 1981 the Entertainment Company had grown into a production company with its own staff of producers and 20 in-house songwriters and in 1984, they purchased the Combine Music catalog of 25,000 country songs.[9] Around that time Koppelman's son, Brian Koppelman, then a student at Tufts University in Boston, discovered musician Tracy Chapman and brought her to his father who soon signed her to a record deal.[10]
In 1986, Koppelman, Bandier, and Stephen C. Swid formed SBK Entertainment World, Inc., in order to buy the 250,000 titles owned by CBS Songs for $125 million, the highest price ever paid for a music publishing portfolio. SBK developed into the largest independent music publisher in the world and played a major role in the careers of artists like Michael Bolton, Robbie Robertson, New Kids on the Block, Icehouse, Al B. Sure!, and Eric B. & Rakim.[9][11]
In 1989, SBK Entertainment World, Inc. was sold to EMI Music for $300 million. As part of the deal, Koppelman and Bandier formed a partnership with EMI Music Worldwide to create their own record label, SBK Records. In addition, Koppelman took the positions of Chairman and CEO of the new label and Chairman of EMI Music Publishing. Bandier received the posts of President and Chief Operating Officer of SBK Records and Vice Chairman of EMI Music Publishing. Only one year after SBK Records opened, they received their first platinum album with Technotronic's Pump Up the Jam. SBK Records went on to sign artists Jesus Jones, Wilson Phillips, and Vanilla Ice, among others. In 1991, Koppelman and Bandier sold their share of SBK Records to EMI Music, making EMI the sole owner of the label. When EMI Music decided to consolidate its operations and formed EMI Records Group North America, Koppelman was subsequently appointed Chairman and CEO. During his time at EMI, Koppelman played an integral role in the reunion of singer Frank Sinatra with Capitol Records, which spawned the five-million-selling album Duets.[9] Koppelman served as CEO until 1997.
From 2000 to 2004 Koppelman was Chairman of Steve Madden, Ltd.,[12] and led the company while Madden served jail time for securities fraud.[13]
In 2005, Koppelman was appointed Chairman of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia.[14] Koppelman also appeared as Martha Stewart's right-hand man on NBC's The Apprentice: Martha Stewart in 2005.[15] He served as de facto CEO of the Company from 2008-2011 when he stepped down to expand his company, CAK Entertainment.[16] Since 2010, Koppelman has served as director at Six Flags Entertainment Corporation[17] and also currently sits on the Board of Directors of Las Vegas Sands.[18]
In June 2014, Koppelman was appointed Chairman of Medient Studios Inc., replacing Manu Kumaran.[19]
CAK Entertainment, Inc.[edit]
Koppelman founded CAK Entertainment in 1997.[20] Along with general counsel David Fritz and Managing Director Stephanie Roberts, the company conducts marketing, brand development and advisory work for artists and companies including Marc Anthony and Jennifer Lopez (managing their apparel and lifestyle products line with Kohl’s Department Stores), Adam Levine and Nicki Minaj (managing their apparel and lifestyle products lines with Kmart), country recording artist Clay Walker, car auctioneer, Barrett-Jackson, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia and Freehand Music.[21]
Personal life[edit]
Koppelman has been married twice. His first wife was Brenda "Bunny" Koppelman who was also Jewish; they had three children: Brian, Stacy and Jennifer. She died of pancreatic cancer in 2008.[22][23] On October 29, 2011, he married Gerri Kyhill Koppelman.[24]
His daughter, Jennifer Hutt is a radio personality who has hosted several radio shows including the popular Sirius Satellite Radio show Just Jenny.[25][26]
His son, Brian Koppelman, is a screenwriter whose credits include Rounders and Ocean's Thirteen.[27][28]

Now co-managing country star Clay Walker, the former CEO of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia and Steve Madden Ltd. also expounds on running a company whose namesake is in prison. "These things happen," he tells THR.

As a former executive at CBS Records, the founder of SBK Records (later sold to EMI for a reported $295 million) and CEO of his own CAK Entertainment, which handles brand management for such artists as Jennifer Lopez, Nicki Minaj, Adam Levine and Marc Anthony, Charles Koppelman is a music industry veteran if ever there was one. But in the last decade, the lifelong New Yorker has stepped away from the lights of arena stages and devoted himself fully to the business of branding -- first, as chairman of the board for shoe giant Steve Madden from 2000 to 2004, and then as chairman of the board and CEO of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia from 2005 to 2011 (worth noting: during both stints, the company’s founders were incarcerated).
Today, the 73-year-old executive is jumping back into the music game, taking on co-management duties for country star Clay Walker, getting him representation at CAA and launching a campaign to celebrate the 20th anniversary of his debut album, as well as the singer's forthcoming release, which has yet to be announced.
Why Walker and why now, when the industry’s glory days have long since faded? Koppelman explained in a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter.
What prompted your return to the music business? 
Clay has been a friend and we’ve had a lot of conversations over the years. I’ve always felt that he was an incredible artist that never quite reached his potential. Although he’s a big star, he has so much more to go, and is much more diverse than where he’s been. That, quite candidly, is the way I approach branding. I look at artists and songs as brands, and Clay really fits the overall picture of not only someone who can be bigger in the world of music, concerts and performance, but has a great future for television, film and other branding opportunities. Clay is the perfect lightning rod for that and I think we can take him to the next level.
Does becoming a country star inherently involve being able to crossover? Or can you still just be a country singer?
No, I think it is crossover. I’ve always been a fan of country music. It's America’s music -- I love the songs, love the lyrics. You can go to any city in the country, whether it’s Southern, north, east or the southwest, and hear country radio so country music is as vibrant as ever.

In your time away from the music business, did you miss it?
The music business that I grew up in is a different business today. But individual artists are the same business. The basics haven't changed: great songs, great live shows, and being in the right venues to expose your music to more people. Today, you have an opportunity to do that even more via social media, television, all the formats where music is in real-time.
Of all the companies that you’ve run, which experience has taught you the most?
I've always had an interest in the fashion side of pop culture. When I first connected with Steve Madden, it was very clear to me that he sold his shoes to the same constituency -- females from 13 to 35, let’s say -- that I was gearing my music to. I learned to go about the marketing in a similar way. With Martha Stewart, the power of the brand, the power of television, taught me that if you can marry all those ingredients -- like you marry a great song with a great artist -- and get the right television exposure, then you’ve got something that really is going to be sustainable. You can expand and blow up.
Then, if you take it a step further and look at the fashion sense of that person, that gives you plenty of places to extend the brand. Marc Anthony being a great example. I’ve known Marc for ten years. About four or five years ago, he and I had a conversation that he could be a brand. I always thought he was the Latin Sinatra. He has a style unto himself. We took some time and put some ideas together, and Marc Anthony is now doing tremendous business at Kohl’s with his apparel line. You’d be amazed at the numbers that he does. He has a perspective on fashion. He has perspective on a look.
Is it more challenging to market a men’s line? 
That was the case five years ago. Today, men’s business is a terrific business. Lifestyle is a terrific business. When you think of country, look at the amount of people involved in rodeo or NASCAR -- it’s a lifestyle. And it hasn't been well-served from a fashion perspective.
Carlos Santana, however, has an incredibly successful shoe line. What gives?
Most people don’t get the connection. If you’re a big movie star -- say George Clooney -- nobody really cares what shoes or suit he’s wearing. What we care about are the roles he plays. When you’re a music celebrity, your fans are used to spending money on you. They go to your shows. They want to look like you. They want to be like you. You become part of their life. So it’s a no-brainer that the audience, if the products are right, will respond to that. That’s why Marc Anthony does so well. Jennifer Lopez does incredibly well. Nicki Minaj and Adam Levine, who are two clients of mine, are about to launch their lines at K-Mart. It isn’t about celebrity as much as it is a lifestyle. It’s a connection. Daily television is a connection. You see someone everyday, and you trust them. You emulate them. You take their suggestions.
SBK Records, which was home to Vanilla Ice and Wilson Phillips in the 1990s, claims some very successful alumni, among them: Daniel Glass, who’s seen massive hits by Phoenix and Mumford & Sons on his own Glassnote Entertainment…
I couldn’t be prouder of him.
Q&A: Glassnote's Daniel Glass: Taking Mumford & Sons to the Masses Was 'Torture in the Beginning'
Did you see those CEO traits in Daniel back then when he was head of promotion?
Of course! [Republic Records chairman and CEO) Monte Lipman was one of my interns. I’ve got those people all over the place. I used to hire anybody who had a child that wanted to intern. We would have 50 to 100 interns because I found them to be a great resource. We'd play music for them, look at their lifestyle, see what they’re into. To this day, I get anecdotal research from my grandchildren and my kids. The first time I heard about Lady Gaga was from a granddaughter of mine when she was 13-years-old! I took her to a concert, and she wouldn’t let me come in. So I waited outside and watched who was coming to that concert. There were straight people, and gay people, and black people, and people with piercings everywhere -- it was such a variety of folks streaming into this club on the Upper West Side. I said to my daughter who was with me, “If I was still in the music publishing business, I would go in and write a check for a million bucks without even hearing a note of music.” Because it was so clear to me.
Martin Bandier was the B in SBK and is still in the publishing business running Sony/ATV, which bought EMI Music Publishing, the company he helmed for 18 years. Are you surprised that he's still at it and essentially doing the same thing?
I’m not surprised. Marty is a dear friend who loves what he’s doing. It’s all about loving what you do. Publishing is a different kind of business. I always look at music publishing kind of like real estate: you own the songs and if somebody wants to use them, they have to pay you. It’s different than relying on finding a great song, finding a great artist and making sure that the public becomes aware of them.
Along with private equity firm Apollo Global Management, you were in the bidding to purchase EMI Publishing. How do you think things have worked out?
I think the combination [with Sony/ATV] is awesome. They have the scale to absorb a lot of overhead, and as a business, music publishing is a great business. I know for sure nobody could run that business better than Marty. It’s an incredible asset -- one I helped build and would have loved to own. The truth is, on a standalone, it would have been much more difficult. Combining it with what is already at Sony/ATV and the great team that Marty has assembled -- a lot of whom, are still there from when we assembled them. They’re a terrific team and I’m sure they’re going to do very well.
You led two companies during or after their founders were incarcerated. Is jail time sometimes just the cost of doing business?
These things do happen. When you’re a high-profile individual, it becomes even more daunting, of course. But in both of those instances, these are incredibly talented individuals. Steve Madden got into trouble having nothing to do with his business, his designs or his shoes. [Madden was convicted of stock manipulation, money, and securities fraud in 2002 and sentence to 41 months in prison]. He made a mistake and he got in trouble for it. Martha was never convicted for insider trading. They convicted her because they said she lied on a question to a prosecutor. [In 2004, Stewart was found guilty of conspiracy, obstruction of an agency proceeding, and making false statements to federal investigators; She was sentenced to five months in prison.] Having said that, Martha was iconic. Her brand is iconic. Steve’s brand was phenomenal. The public -- they get it. These are good people. I also represented Michael Jackson for a number of years. My Christmas party invitation would say, “If you’re not indicted, you’re not invited.”

Charles A. Koppelman, chairman and CEO of EMI Records Group North America, rises from his mammoth, semicircular, blond wooden desk in his ultramodern mid-Manhattan office. He glances out his 42nd-floor comer window at all of Central Park spread before him in a green-and-blue aerial view, which makes it seem more a feature of a highly detailed, multicolored map than a living expanse of nature and humanity. Then he slowly lifts the cover of his stark black Davidoff humidor, surveys the hand-rolled splendors that lie within, and reaches for an elegantly long Cohiba Esplendido.


"I'm very lucky," he says, pausing to light his Cuban cigar and take the first aromatic puff of the day. "I really love what I do. I'm someone who looks forward to Mondays."


And well he should, for at 53, Koppelman is a giant of the American music business. As chairman and CEO, he is responsible for the record companies within the North American division of the British conglomerate Thorn EMI: Capitol Records, the legendary label of the Beatles, Nat "King" Cole, and the young Frank Sinatra; Liberty Records, the country-music home of Garth Brooks and Tanya Tucker; EMI Records Group, which comprises the contemporary labels Chrysalis and SBK Records; Angel Records, which specializes in classical music and Broadway cast albums; EMI Latin, and EMI Canada.


In his 30 years in the music world, he has discovered or worked with some of the most famous and popular recording stars of the era. The first artists he signed were the Lovin' Spoonful in 1965. He persuaded Bobby Darin to record the song "If I Were a Carpenter" and coproduced the record. In 1973, while working for Columbia Records as head of artists and recordings, he signed Janis Ian. After 1975, when he got together with builder Samuel Lefrak to form the Entertainment Company, he produced and found songs for Glen Campbell ("Southern Nights"), Dolly Parton ("Here You Come Again"), Paul Anka, Cher, Eddie Murphy, The Four Tops, and Barbra Streisand (five albums, from "Songbird" to "Guilty," including her smash-hit pairings with Donna Summer and Barry Gibb).


Koppelman produced the music for the television show "Fame." In the mid-1980s, his son Brian, then a student at Tufts University in Boston, discovered a brilliant young performer named Tracy Chapman and brought her to his father. Then came rapper Vanilla Ice, whose first album, "To the Extreme," was No. 1 for six weeks and sold more than 7 million copies, and the vocal group Wilson Phillips, whose debut album sold more than 5 million copies. And then his most recent successes: Arrested Development, which won two Grammys this year, for best new artist and best rap performance by a duo or group, and Jon Secada, the composer and singer who garnered a Grammy for best Latin pop album.


"I've spent the last 30 years finding, working with, and developing talent," Koppelman says, in a voice that gently betrays his New York City roots (he was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Laurelton, Queens) and that, despite its calm tone, reveals at least a hint of the precision, determination, and toughness necessary to compete in what can often be the cutthroat competition of his profession. He describes his work as "listening to songs, hearing a song and feeling it would be right for a particular artist to sing, and convincing that artist that he or she should sing it. And then finding a producer to produce it, making sure the music comes out in a way that matches my original vision, the way I imagined it when I first heard it. It's incredibly simple, and it's incredibly difficult."


Clearly, for Koppelman, it is incredibly simple. With his thinning gray hair, roundish open face, and confident self-assured demeanor, he certainly looks the role of CEO. And he dresses it, too, from the crisp white shirt to the blue-and-gold striped tie to the colorful wide suspenders illustrated with scenes from his favorite sports passion: golf. His business surroundings, too, are appropriate for his position. Music and video equipment of every kind populates his spacious realm: cassette and compact-disc players, turntable, amplifier, and VCR, all presided over by four huge gray-and-black Tandy speakers suspended from on high, one in each corner of the kingdom. Awards, plaques, and memorabilia are everywhere: a platinum record for Streisand's "Guilty," Chapman on the cover of Rolling Stone, Arrested Development on the cover of Spin, "Record Company CEO of the Year" in 1990, the 1991 Humanitarian Award from the T.J. Martell Foundation for Leukemia, Cancer and AIDS Research. Along a shelf by one set of windows sits a group of modern sculptures, among them a giant papier-mâché rendering of his ear: a gift from a partner, with a dedication: "To my friend Charles, whose ears are exceeded only by his heart."


It is an appropriate artistic gesture, for Koppelman's ears have certainly been a prime factor in his career: ears that have the ability to know, on first hearing, whether a song or performer has that indefinable something--or doesn't. It is, says Koppelman, a matter of taste: "Whether it's taste in music or taste in cigars or taste in clothes." (And indeed, he has just come from his personal tailor, where he was delayed for 20 minutes over a problem with a button.) "You have to know what is the best in order to have the best. My wife has a great expression: 'The best will do just fine.' And I think taste is what does it. You're either born with it or you acquire it."


Koppelman's ears work in a very basic way: "I'm a fan. I can't sing. I can't write music. I just think that if I'm attracted to something, everybody's going to be attracted to it. When I listen to a singer, one of the things I focus on is whether I believe that singer. Do I believe the words they're singing? Is their voice distinctive? Will I recognize that voice any time I hear it? When I listen to a song, is it really organic? Do I feel the hairs stand up on the back of my neck when I hear it? Does it make me smile? Things of that nature that I think are the same things the audience hears and responds to. Maybe it's some sort of common--and I underline common--denominator that I have within me, because more of what I like, everybody ends up liking."


Despite his apparent instinctive ability to recognize the music that makes him dance, the art of melody did not consume much of his childhood. "All I did when I was growing up was play stickball, base- ball, and basketball," Koppelman says. "If stickball was the national pastime, I think I would have been Ty Cobb." He attended Adelphi College and Long Island University, earning a degree in physical education, and an early goal was to coach or manage in baseball.


But he had a next-door neighbor "who sang all the time," and while in college he met someone else who also sang and played the guitar. "And the three of us would hang around and sometimes create some music," he says. "I didn't create the music. I was kind of hanging around. And if they were singing songs, maybe I'd try to sing on one of the notes that everyone else was singing. So there might have been three people but there was only two-part harmony."


Coincidentally, another neighbor was the editor of Cash Box, a music trade publication, and, Koppelman says, "from about age 14 to 18, I was exposed to reading old Cash Box magazines, so I some- how learned there was a business of music."


Meanwhile, his friends were still singing. "I realized that if we sang at different college events, it would be a great way to attract girls." One Easter week, he suggested that the group go into Manhattan to see whether they could get a recording contract. "We went in and knocked on doors," he says. "I had the names of all these different record companies from reading Cash Box. And as luck would have it, we were signed by a small record company owned by a dentist from New Jersey. It was called Shell Records. Their logo was a big seashell."


The group took the name the Ivy Three. And this unlikely creation would lead to a surprising musical hit and, for Koppelman (and another trio member, Don Rubin, who would become a long-time associate), a lifetime career.


One day, Koppelman says, while working part time in the boys' department of Gimbels, he had another idea: Why not a song about Yogi Bear? After all, the Hanna-Barbera cartoon character was the rage on college campuses. So he found a pair of songwriters and wound up working with them; the song "Yogi" was born and, wonder of wonders, became a hit. "We went on tour," Koppelman recalls. "We sang in the Midwest. We sang on the Dick Clark television show, American Bandstand. And that got me interested in the music business." Sports was out, and music was in.


The Ivy Three had no other hits and soon disbanded. But Koppelman and Rubin got jobs writing songs for Alden Music, which was co-owned by music publisher Don Kirschner, whom Koppelman had met when the Ivy Three performed at Grossinger's in the Catskills. Alden's stable of writers included Carole King and Neil Sedaka, and it soon became clear that Koppelman was not in their league. But he had not really wanted to be a songwriter; he had just wanted an entree to the business. "So after about two years of unsuccessfully writing songs, Don Kirschner hired me to be the director of his music publishing company," he says. "It was just about the time he sold it to Columbia Pictures, so my first real job was as director of Screen Gems-Columbia Music. That was in 1963."


Two years later, he and Rubin went into business on their own. In 1970, they sold their company, and Koppelman went to work for Columbia Records, first running their publishing company and then as head of artists and recordings. Then, in 1975, he and Lefrak formed the Entertainment Company, which was both a music-publishing and record-production concern. "And," says Koppelman, "it just evolved from there."


In 1986, he and two colleagues, Stephen C. Swid and Martin N. Bandier, the latter of whom had been general counsel for the Lefrak Organization and who had worked with Koppelman since the start of the Entertainment Company, got together to buy CBS Songs for a reported $125 million. CBS Songs was the music-publishing division of CBS Records; its holdings included the MGM-United Artists copyright catalog, including such songs as "Over the Rainbow," "Singin' in the Rain," "New York, New York," and the music from the James Bond movies. Three years later, the partners sold their company to Thorn EMI, reportedly for more than $300 million, and Koppelman moved to EMI Records Group North America (as did Bandier).


"It's a daily challenge," Koppelman says, slowly taking another puff of his Cohiba. For with the change of positions has come a slight change in his role. "It's as meaningful to me these days to discover a terrific young executive and nurture that person as it is to find a great young artist," he says. "Being in this business, I'm surrounded by young people who have great energy, and what I hope is to give them focus. If you can give someone who's young, whether it's your child or an employee or a partner, the guidance and the focus to harness their talent, that's something you can really enjoy."


Something else that Koppelman clearly enjoys is his cigars. And he has delighted in them for many years. "I never smoked cigarettes," he says. "When I was 23 or 24, I saw somebody smoking a Tiparillo. So I started by smoking a couple of Tiparillos, and from there I kept moving up. I spent a lot of time smoking Cream of Jamaica. Then I tried Temple Hall Claros for a long period of time. And ultimately I ended up with Davidoff Cuban No. 1's, and Montecrisro Especiales, and now Cohiba Esplendidos."


"I can't tell you that I'm a cigar aficionado," he continues, perhaps ignoring the fact that he has not one but two humidors on the window sill behind his desk (the other, in brown and blond wood, is from Dunhill and contains under its lid a plaque from the Connoisseur's Humidor Society). "But I can tell you that I love to smoke cigars. It's incredibly relaxing. And I like the taste."


He has from time to time tried other cigars, he says. "I'm not a Cuban snob. I'll try a Dominican cigar. But I just keep gravitating back to the Cohibas. To me they're the best."


Another of his loves, as his suspenders suggest, is golf--in part because it recalls the sporting life of his childhood. "I've been playing about seven or eight years," he says, "but I've only been serious about it for the past two or three. In the beginning, I played infrequently, no more than ten times a year. Now I play every chance I get. Yesterday I had the best score I've ever made. I shot an 87. So I'm making real progress."


What he loves most about the game, he says, is the competition--the inner contest. "I'm very competitive," he says, "and golf is a terrific way to be competitive within yourself. It's a great feeling to hit a pure shot. I loved to play basketball and to shoot the ball, and the skills in putting the ball in the hoop or putting the ball in the cup are not that dissimilar. I also used to love batting in stickball, making contact with the ball and being able to put it where I wanted to put it. Golf really combines so many of the sports I enjoyed when I was a kid."


Koppelman lives in Roslyn Harbor, Long Island. He and his wife, Bunny, have three children. "Two of them are married," he says. "And all three are now in law school."


His corporate life is quintessentially bicoastal. He spends a week or so every month presiding over the company's Hollywood office in the Capitol Tower on the legendary corner of Hollywood and Vine. Commuting is accomplished by means of a chartered private jet. He stays in the presidential suite at either the Hotel Bel-Air or the Peninsula Hotel, and as is only fitting for a chief executive, he has the services of a Bentley and a driver on the shores of both the Atlantic and the Pacific.


Because he has achieved so much in his career, it is natural to wonder whether anything is missing: Is there something he wants to do that he has not yet done?


He reflects for a moment. "I don't think so," he says, sounding like a prototypically superconfident and accomplished CEO.


Is he absolutely sure?


He ponders again. He glances quickly at his suspenders, and then toward the shelf that holds a newspaper reproduction of a portrait of him at golf, painted by sports artist LeRoy Neiman. He smiles.


"I guess," he says, "I'd really like to shoot an 86."

“Special music industry advisers to the Estate of Prince Rogers Nelson” is not a job title that Charles Koppelman and L. Londell McMillan expected or wanted. But with the artist’s affairs in disarray after his death from an accidental drug overdose on April 21 -- he apparently left behind no will -- and a tax bill estimated at $100 million, it’s a job they undertook with determination and decisiveness.In recent weeks the duo have announced deals for the estate with Warner Bros. Records and Universal Music Group (which include previously unreleased material from Prince’s legendary vault), Universal Music Publishing, Global Music Rights and Universal’s Bravado for licensing and merchandise -- all in time for the Jan. 21 due date of the tax bill's first payment -- and sources tell Billboard that streaming deals for most of Prince's biggest hits will be in place on Grammy night (Feb. 12).The two are perhaps uniquely qualified for the role. Koppelman, 76, is one of the most formidable industry executives of the past 50 years. He began his career as a singer but quickly became a top-flight publisher, working for Don Kirshner’s Aldon Music, with Clive Davis at CBS Records, and in partnership with current Sony/ATV chief Martin Bandier, founded SBK Entertainment, which was sold to EMI in 1989 for $300 million. After leaving his post at the helm of EMI in 1997, he worked with Steve Madden and Martha Stewart before returning to the music business with his own C.A.K. Entertainment in 2011, where he has scored branding deals for Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony with Kohl’s, Nicki Minaj and Adam Levine with K-Mart, and many others. McMillan, 40, is a veteran attorney who has worked with Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Chaka Khan and, until 2006, Prince, whom he also managed for part of their dozen-year-long working relationship. ; he is also owner of hip-hop publication The Source and Jones magazine. 


At press time, their status with the estate was in transition -- Comerica Bank, which took over from Bremer Bank as the estate’s administrator on Feb 1., has not determined whether the two will continue as advisers -- and two of Prince’s six likely heirs, among other disagreements, have objected to McMillan continuing as an advisor, citing past nonpayment of a loan and his role in organizing an uneven Prince tribute concert in October. Yet the two emphasize they will remain contractually involved in each deal they have made and will make for the estate. Below, they talk about working with and maximizing the legacy of this unique, innovative and very self-determined artist and businessman.You both worked directly with Prince. What can you say about him as a businessman?McMillan: He was very much an innovator -- don't forget, he was the first major artist to use the Internet to go directly to the consumer in a major way. He didn't always seek the largest advances; he sought the most amount of control and ownership, so the deals we're making now are in that spirit. And I think it's also important to work with people who had prior relationships with Prince. For instance, [Universal EVP] Michelle Anthony is someone who worked with me and Prince directly in a major way. There are other executives that I was able to get Prince to warm up to, including [Koppelman], including Clive Davis. At one point, people thought he had contempt for the record industry and people in the industry. But he really just had contempt for the one-sided legal terms that impact artists and writers, and we wanted to be transformative and revolutionary in that sense. Prince did write the playbook, and I think we had a very strong run at having people rethink how the business model and the industry works.Koppelman: He really laid the groundwork for a lot of other artists who redefined the kind of deals they would make: So many more artists own most or all of their publishing and just do administrative deals; so many more artists have shorter terms on their recording deals and understand that they need to get ownership at some point. He was really a forerunner of making that public. I mean, when he put the word "slave" on his face [as a tactic to get out of his Warner Bros. deal in the early 1990s], he was saying to Warner: "I'm not your slave." He was saying the things that were right to be said at that time, and everyone took notice. Most artists would be afraid to do that, and most of the managers would quiet them down and say, "This is the way it works. Let's get you another big advance."


McMillan: He wasn't afraid and I guess I didn't know enough to be afraid! [Laughter] Apart from Prince’s non-Warner catalog, what major assets are still unexploited?Koppelman: There's tremendous, tremendous interest in doing things with his legacy, whether it's a motion picture, documentaries, Broadway, Cirque de Soleil. All of those are opportunities that I think are in the future for Londell and me and the estate to work on. But what we needed to do initially was get the deals in place that are going to enhance the estate and make it valuable for the heirs, and those deals needed to be in the hands of the best of class. We must have had 20 different publishing meetings -- with every multinational, and some that just administer and collect. What was the state of his business when you took over?Koppelman: It's important to understand that over the last couple of years, Prince's business life was a bit of a shambles. I use the analogy, a little bit, of Michael Jackson. Michael had no personal life but his business life was in great order: He had the right record deal, he had the right music-publishing partner and ownership. Prince had a terrific personal life but over the last couple of years, had none of those other great relationships that would enhance the value [of his assets]. That worked for him, because if Prince needed money he could wake up on Monday and do a concert on Friday and raise whatever money he needed. And he was very independent. I'll tell you one quick little story. The first time I met Prince was in 1991, maybe '92. Someone called my office, a cold call, and said they were calling on behalf of Prince, and we set up a meeting. [At the meeting] Prince said that he was incredibly impressed with SBK and [diversity of the] artists I was signing and how I was marketing them: Technotronic, Wilson Phillips, Tracy Chapman, Vanilla Ice, Jon Secada. He asked if I would be interested in him producing artists for SBK, and I said, "Are you kidding? Of course -- when can I hear some music?" He said, "You can't. I'll deliver it and you'll put it out." I said, "Well, it's my record company, I can't put something out and market it if I don't believe in it. I'm gonna have to hear it." He stood up, said "Thank you very much," and walked out the door. I didn't hear from him again until Londell called [beginning the process for the 1996 deal].


What is your status as advisors to the estate now that Bremer Bank is basically out of the picture?Koppelman: They're not [completely] out yet. They will be out at a point in time. It'll be sooner than later.McMillan: And the court will give whomever steps into that role similar authority to move forward in a way that will be in the best interest of the estate.Are you still empowered to do deals and continue exploiting the assets?Koppelman: Definitely. Do you hope to be in this role indefinitely?Koppelman: I think we would have two different answers to that. Mine would depend on the circumstances and how much aggravation may be involved. When we started this march together I was very excited about it -- recognizing how incredible Prince was, and also recognizing the opportunities that weren't seized upon over the last number of years. There was money being left everywhere, people weren't collecting, it was a bit of a mess. So in the first week I think we met or spoke to at least 50 different players, and we basically had deals ready to go within two or three weeks after these meetings. But then there were different sides causing different issues, and that actually retarded some of the progress. So, I’m really good at what I do but I also don't need to do this, and would not have done this if Londell had not come to talk to me about it, and if I didn't have the ultimate respect for Prince. [McMillan] has a different perspective because he's the friend and kind of the conscience here, and will do anything to make sure that the wrong things don't happen.McMillan: His legacy is very much a part of my legacy. I owe much of my career to his generosity, his confidence in our friendship, the work we did. So I'm a lifer, whether I'm approved by a court, or just a citizen and a friend. Koppelman: All factions, in my view, would like us to continue to do what we are doing. McMillan: Most factions. [Laughter] Koppelman: At the end of the day, all of them will want that. This actually quite easy to do; the hard thing is deciding who to do it with. But deals have a gestation period: If you're talking about Broadway or movies, even if you did the deal today, [the product won't be ready for the marketplace until] two years down the road. And if you did it a year from today, you're talking three, four years down the road. How relevant will it be then? I'm not sure. The public grows up every day and the attention span doesn't last forever. 


McMillan: What I am most thrilled about is taking this great body of work and working with the family and others in the industry to determine how it will be re-introduced to generation Y and Z and continue that legacy. Prince has amazing content beyond the music -- there are [filmed recordings of] the most amazing performances that we haven't even begun to discuss.  Koppelman: That's the way you introduce Prince to a younger audience or an audience that didn't really know him that well -- and that's why the time frame is important, for example, to have a documentary for the younger generation, and for an older generation to reacquaint and understand his incredible talent. If that happens three years from now, it's not the same.Is anyone currently going through the unreleased material and determining what's coming next?McMillan: Currently things are on a schedule, and there is not an active search through that material because of some of the things Charles spoke about in terms of different interests. So currently the process of that is being contemplated. So how it's done, preserving the integrity of it, making sure the right players are there...Koppelman: And determining what's releasable and how to release it, et cetera.McMillan: So that has not commenced but it's soon to commence. I do want to make clear that if Prince were here, we likely would not be making these deals -- but also, Prince would not be needing half the value of his estate [to pay the estate tax bill] right now. While some people may say "Why are you making all these deals? Prince wouldn't make these deals," Prince never wanted to lose ownership and control of his creations, so we place ownership and control over dealmaking [in order to] preserve the assets and stay within Prince's brand values. And as I have told everybody, there's not gonna be a big I.R.S. truck backing up to Paisley Park saying "I'll take those assets!"


Is the fact that he didn't have a will a reason why so much of the value of his estate is going to the government? Koppelman: No. It'll be worked out. Whether he had a will or he didn't have a will, when you die there's an estate that has to be dealt with for the government.McMillan: At some point, somebody would've been getting it and having to [raise] the estate tax. The government's gonna get paid regardless.Why didn’t Prince have a will?McMillan: Let me say it this way. Prince, in my opinion, should've had a will. Many of us who worked with Prince advised him to have a will. But those who really know Prince are not surprised he didn't have a will.Why?McMillan: Because Prince would ask you, “Who wants to kill me? Somebody wants to kill me?” [Laughter] All of us thought that Prince would outlive us. Koppleman: And by the way, the only reason Michael Jackson had a will is because on one of his financing [deals], the banker insisted upon it. Otherwise he probably wouldn't have had a will. [Having one would mean] recognizing your own mortality, and some artists or some people... McMillan: I do want to say one thing about the family and the heirs, they're not fighting with each other. Some of the issues [are due to the fact] that you've got six people who have been forced to come together. Some of them didn't even know each other. They had different views and concepts, different advisors. So when you have that many differences, it takes time to shake itself out.


Londell, two of the heirs have made some strong accusations against you. Is there anything you want to say in regard to that beyond what you've already said?McMillan: Family members in mourning are easy to take advantage of. People who advise vulnerable people should have a higher responsibility and ethics in terms of what they do. I'm very confident in what we're doing and I know that those stories are false, both of those allegations have no truth and no merit whatsoever. There’s never been any malice or wrongdoing that I've been accused of that has merit. We've got four of six [likely heirs] that are very enthusiastic and I'm very grateful to have the majority of the family fully in support. Prince told me a long time ago, "Don't worry too much about what other people say, just keep doing the right thing and move forward."Apart from the earlier Warner Bros. material, does the estate own all of Prince’s masters?McMillan: Everything from [1996's] Emancipation on, absolutely, one hundred percent. Even with masters under Warner Bros. -- not all of them, but [the estate] owns a substantial amount of the Warner masters.


Are any of the licensing deals for that material still in effect? Could someone license all of the non-Warner material?McMillan: Certainly towards the latter part of his life there are a few that may be in effect, but nothing that's materially going to impact what we do -- to our knowledge. To our knowledge -- I want to make sure that's clear.Koppelman: That's why it's always good to have a lawyer as your partner.McMillan: We've got another big, huge deal that's about to be announced. It's gonna be one of the best deals ever, I think, because he's got one of the greatest catalogs. Can you give any sense of what that deal is?Koppelman: [Laughing] We could, but we'd have to shoot you. McMillan: It's for recorded music [the catalog deal with Universal, announced on Feb. 9].

Early life[edit]
Koppelman was born to a Jewish family,[3] the son of Ruth[4] and Irving Koppelman.[5]
His uncle, Morris Koppelman, held a patent for inventing the Egg carton.
Career[edit]
Koppelman broke into the music business as a member of the musical group The Ivy Three which had a Top 10 hit in 1960 entitled "Yogi", after the cartoon Yogi Bear.[6][7] Soon, Koppelman and bandmate and future business partner Don Rubin joined the songwriting staff of Aldon Music under CEO Don Kirshner, a group that included Carole King, Neil Sedaka, Barry Mann, and Cynthia Weil. When Columbia Pictures purchased Aldon Music, Koppelman was promoted to director of Screen Gems/Columbia Music, the new company that resulted from the merger. In 1965, with financial backing of his uncle, Leon Koppelman, Koppelman and Rubin left Columbia to form Koppelman/Rubin Associates, an entertainment company that signed The Lovin Spoonful the same year. In 1967, Koppleman/Rubin signed The Little Bits of Sound a group from Long Island, New York with a psychedelic sound. In 1968, Commonwealth United purchased Koppelman/Rubin Associates and Koppelman and Rubin stayed on to run the music division. In 1968 they signed the psychedelic band the Rahgoos and famously made the band change its name to Gandalf.[8] During the early 1970s, Koppelman moved on to CBS Records and held numerous positions, including Vice President/National Director of A&R where he signed acts including Billy Joel, Dave Mason, Janis Ian, Journey, and Phoebe Snow.[9]
By the mid-1970s, Koppelman had stepped up to Vice President/General Manager of worldwide publishing for CBS Records. In 1975, he formed The Entertainment Company with Martin Bandier and New York real estate developer and Bandier's father-in-law, Samuel LeFrak. The company independently administered and promoted song catalogs and produced music artists like Barbra Streisand, Dolly Parton, Diana Ross, the Four Tops, and Cher.[9] By 1981 the Entertainment Company had grown into a production company with its own staff of producers and 20 in-house songwriters and in 1984, they purchased the Combine Music catalog of 25,000 country songs.[9] Around that time Koppelman's son, Brian Koppelman, then a student at Tufts University in Boston, discovered musician Tracy Chapman and brought her to his father who soon signed her to a record deal.[10]
In 1986, Koppelman, Bandier, and Stephen C. Swid formed SBK Entertainment World, Inc., in order to buy the 250,000 titles owned by CBS Songs for $125 million, the highest price ever paid for a music publishing portfolio. SBK developed into the largest independent music publisher in the world and played a major role in the careers of artists like Michael Bolton, Robbie Robertson, New Kids on the Block, Icehouse, Al B. Sure!, and Eric B. & Rakim.[9][11]
In 1989, SBK Entertainment World, Inc. was sold to EMI Music for $300 million. As part of the deal, Koppelman and Bandier formed a partnership with EMI Music Worldwide to create their own record label, SBK Records. In addition, Koppelman took the positions of Chairman and CEO of the new label and Chairman of EMI Music Publishing. Bandier received the posts of President and Chief Operating Officer of SBK Records and Vice Chairman of EMI Music Publishing. Only one year after SBK Records opened, they received their first platinum album with Technotronic's Pump Up the Jam. SBK Records went on to sign artists Jesus Jones, Wilson Phillips, and Vanilla Ice, among others. In 1991, Koppelman and Bandier sold their share of SBK Records to EMI Music, making EMI the sole owner of the label. When EMI Music decided to consolidate its operations and formed EMI Records Group North America, Koppelman was subsequently appointed Chairman and CEO. During his time at EMI, Koppelman played an integral role in the reunion of singer Frank Sinatra with Capitol Records, which spawned the five-million-selling album Duets.[9] Koppelman served as CEO until 1997.
From 2000 to 2004 Koppelman was Chairman of Steve Madden, Ltd.,[12] and led the company while Madden served jail time for securities fraud.[13]
In 2005, Koppelman was appointed Chairman of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia.[14] Koppelman also appeared as Martha Stewart's right-hand man on NBC's The Apprentice: Martha Stewart in 2005.[15] He served as de facto CEO of the Company from 2008-2011 when he stepped down to expand his company, CAK Entertainment.[16] Since 2010, Koppelman has served as director at Six Flags Entertainment Corporation[17] and also currently sits on the Board of Directors of Las Vegas Sands.[18]
In June 2014, Koppelman was appointed Chairman of Medient Studios Inc., replacing Manu Kumaran.[19]
CAK Entertainment, Inc.[edit]
Koppelman founded CAK Entertainment in 1997.[20] Along with general counsel David Fritz and Managing Director Stephanie Roberts, the company conducts marketing, brand development and advisory work for artists and companies including Marc Anthony and Jennifer Lopez (managing their apparel and lifestyle products line with Kohl’s Department Stores), Adam Levine and Nicki Minaj (managing their apparel and lifestyle products lines with Kmart), country recording artist Clay Walker, car auctioneer, Barrett-Jackson, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia and Freehand Music.[21]
Personal life[edit]
Koppelman has been married twice. His first wife was Brenda "Bunny" Koppelman who was also Jewish; they had three children: Brian, Stacy and Jennifer. She died of pancreatic cancer in 2008.[22][23] On October 29, 2011, he married Gerri Kyhill Koppelman.[24]
His daughter, Jennifer Hutt is a radio personality who has hosted several radio shows including the popular Sirius Satellite Radio show Just Jenny.[25][26]
His son, Brian Koppelman, is a screenwriter whose credits include Rounders and Ocean's Thirteen.[27][28]

In addition, Koppelman took the positions of Chairman and CEO of the new label and Chairman of EMI Music Publishing. Bandier received the posts of President and Chief Operating Officer of SBK Records and Vice Chairman of EMI Music Publishing. Only one year after SBK Records opened, they received their first platinum album with Technotronic's Pump Up the Jam. SBK Records went on to sign artists Jesus Jones, Wilson Phillips, and Vanilla Ice, among others. In 1991, Koppelman and Bandier sold their share of SBK Records to EMI Music, making EMI the sole owner of the label. When EMI Music decided to consolidate its operations and formed EMI Records Group North America, Koppelman was subsequently appointed Chairman and CEO. During his time at EMI, Koppelman played an integral role in the reunion of singer Frank Sinatra with Capitol Records, which spawned the five-million-selling album Duets.[9] Koppelman served as CEO until 1997.
From 2000 to 2004 Koppelman was Chairman of Steve Madden, Ltd.,[12] and led the company while Madden served jail time for securities fraud.[13]
In 2005, Koppelman was appointed Chairman of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia.[14] Koppelman also appeared as Martha Stewart's right-hand man on NBC's The Apprentice: Martha Stewart in 2005.[15] He served as de facto CEO of the Company from 2008-2011 when he stepped down to expand his company, CAK Entertainment.[16] Since 2010, Koppelman has served as director at Six Flags Entertainment Corporation[17] and also currently sits on the Board of Directors of Las Vegas Sands.[18]
In June 2014, Koppelman was appointed Chairman of Medient Studios Inc., replacing Manu Kumaran.[19]

Koppelman founded CAK Entertainment in 1997.[20] Along with general counsel David Fritz and Managing Director Stephanie Roberts, the company conducts marketing, brand development and advisory work for artists and companies including Marc Anthony and Jennifer Lopez (managing their apparel and lifestyle products line with Kohl’s Department Stores), Adam Levine and Nicki Minaj (managing their apparel and lifestyle products lines with Kmart), country recording artist Clay Walker, car auctioneer, Barrett-Jackson, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia and Freehand Music.[21]

Early life[edit]
Koppelman was born to a Jewish family,[3] the son of Ruth[4] and Irving Koppelman.[5]
His uncle, Morris Koppelman, held a patent for inventing the Egg carton.
Career[edit]
Koppelman broke into the music business as a member of the musical group The Ivy Three which had a Top 10 hit in 1960 entitled "Yogi", after the cartoon Yogi Bear.[6][7] Soon, Koppelman and bandmate and future business partner Don Rubin joined the songwriting staff of Aldon Music under CEO Don Kirshner, a group that included Carole King, Neil Sedaka, Barry Mann, and Cynthia Weil. When Columbia Pictures purchased Aldon Music, Koppelman was promoted to director of Screen Gems/Columbia Music, the new company that resulted from the merger. In 1965, with financial backing of his uncle, Leon Koppelman, Koppelman and Rubin left Columbia to form Koppelman/Rubin Associates, an entertainment company that signed The Lovin Spoonful the same year. In 1967, Koppleman/Rubin signed The Little Bits of Sound a group from Long Island, New York with a psychedelic sound. In 1968, Commonwealth United purchased Koppelman/Rubin Associates and Koppelman and Rubin stayed on to run the music division. In 1968 they signed the psychedelic band the Rahgoos and famously made the band change its name to Gandalf.[8] During the early 1970s, Koppelman moved on to CBS Records and held numerous positions, including Vice President/National Director of A&R where he signed acts including Billy Joel, Dave Mason, Janis Ian, Journey, and Phoebe Snow.[9]
By the mid-1970s, Koppelman had stepped up to Vice President/General Manager of worldwide publishing for CBS Records. In 1975, he formed The Entertainment Company with Martin Bandier and New York real estate developer and Bandier's father-in-law, Samuel LeFrak. The company independently administered and promoted song catalogs and produced music artists like Barbra Streisand, Dolly Parton, Diana Ross, the Four Tops, and Cher.[9] By 1981 the Entertainment Company had grown into a production company with its own staff of producers and 20 in-house songwriters and in 1984, they purchased the Combine Music catalog of 25,000 country songs.[9] Around that time Koppelman's son, Brian Koppelman, then a student at Tufts University in Boston, discovered musician Tracy Chapman and brought her to his father who soon signed her to a record deal.[10]
In 1986, Koppelman, Bandier, and Stephen C. Swid formed SBK Entertainment World, Inc., in order to buy the 250,000 titles owned by CBS Songs for $125 million, the highest price ever paid for a music publishing portfolio. SBK developed into the largest independent music publisher in the world and played a major role in the careers of artists like Michael Bolton, Robbie Robertson, New Kids on the Block, Icehouse, Al B. Sure!, and Eric B. & Rakim.[9][11]
In 1989, SBK Entertainment World, Inc. was sold to EMI Music for $300 million. As part of the deal, Koppelman and Bandier formed a partnership with EMI Music Worldwide to create their own record label, SBK Records. In addition, Koppelman took the positions of Chairman and CEO of the new label and Chairman of EMI Music Publishing. Bandier received the posts of President and Chief Operating Officer of SBK Records and Vice Chairman of EMI Music Publishing. Only one year after SBK Records opened, they received their first platinum album with Technotronic's Pump Up the Jam. SBK Records went on to sign artists Jesus Jones, Wilson Phillips, and Vanilla Ice, among others. In 1991, Koppelman and Bandier sold their share of SBK Records to EMI Music, making EMI the sole owner of the label. When EMI Music decided to consolidate its operations and formed EMI Records Group North America, Koppelman was subsequently appointed Chairman and CEO. During his time at EMI, Koppelman played an integral role in the reunion of singer Frank Sinatra with Capitol Records, which spawned the five-million-selling album Duets.[9] Koppelman served as CEO until 1997.
From 2000 to 2004 Koppelman was Chairman of Steve Madden, Ltd.,[12] and led the company while Madden served jail time for securities fraud.[13]
In 2005, Koppelman was appointed Chairman of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia.[14] Koppelman also appeared as Martha Stewart's right-hand man on NBC's The Apprentice: Martha Stewart in 2005.[15] He served as de facto CEO of the Company from 2008-2011 when he stepped down to expand his company, CAK Entertainment.[16] Since 2010, Koppelman has served as director at Six Flags Entertainment Corporation[17] and also currently sits on the Board of Directors of Las Vegas Sands.[18]
In June 2014, Koppelman was appointed Chairman of Medient Studios Inc., replacing Manu Kumaran.[19]
CAK Entertainment, Inc.[edit]
Koppelman founded CAK Entertainment in 1997.[20] Along with general counsel David Fritz and Managing Director Stephanie Roberts, the company conducts marketing, brand development and advisory work for artists and companies including Marc Anthony and Jennifer Lopez (managing their apparel and lifestyle products line with Kohl’s Department Stores), Adam Levine and Nicki Minaj (managing their apparel and lifestyle products lines with Kmart), country recording artist Clay Walker, car auctioneer, Barrett-Jackson, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia and Freehand Music.[21]
Personal life[edit]
Koppelman has been married twice. His first wife was Brenda "Bunny" Koppelman who was also Jewish; they had three children: Brian, Stacy and Jennifer. She died of pancreatic cancer in 2008.[22][23] On October 29, 2011, he married Gerri Kyhill Koppelman.[24]
His daughter, Jennifer Hutt is a radio personality who has hosted several radio shows including the popular Sirius Satellite Radio show Just Jenny.[25][26]
His son, Brian Koppelman, is a screenwriter whose credits include Rounders and Ocean's Thirteen.[27][28]

Sure!, and Eric B. & Rakim.[9][11]
In 1989, SBK Entertainment World, Inc. was sold to EMI Music for $300 million. As part of the deal, Koppelman and Bandier formed a partnership with EMI Music Worldwide to create their own record label, SBK Records. In addition, Koppelman took the positions of Chairman and CEO of the new label and Chairman of EMI Music Publishing. Bandier received the posts of President and Chief Operating Officer of SBK Records and Vice Chairman of EMI Music Publishing. Only one year after SBK Records opened, they received their first platinum album with Technotronic's Pump Up the Jam. SBK Records went on to sign artists Jesus Jones, Wilson Phillips, and Vanilla Ice, among others. In 1991, Koppelman and Bandier sold their share of SBK Records to EMI Music, making EMI the sole owner of the label. When EMI Music decided to consolidate its operations and formed EMI Records Group North America, Koppelman was subsequently appointed Chairman and CEO. During his time at EMI, Koppelman played an integral role in the reunion of singer Frank Sinatra with Capitol Records, which spawned the five-million-selling album Duets.[9] Koppelman served as CEO until 1997.
From 2000 to 2004 Koppelman was Chairman of Steve Madden, Ltd.,[12] and led the company while Madden served jail time for securities fraud.[13]
In 2005, Koppelman was appointed Chairman of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia.[14] Koppelman also appeared as Martha Stewart's right-hand man on NBC's The Apprentice: Martha Stewart in 2005.[15] He served as de facto CEO of the Company from 2008-2011 when he stepped down to expand his company, CAK Entertainment.[16] Since 2010, Koppelman has served as director at Six Flags Entertainment Corporation[17] and also currently sits on the Board of Directors of Las Vegas Sands.[18]
In June 2014, Koppelman was appointed Chairman of Medient Studios Inc., replacing Manu Kumaran.[19]
CAK Entertainment, Inc.[edit]
Koppelman founded CAK Entertainment in 1997.[20] Along with general counsel David Fritz and Managing Director Stephanie Roberts, the company conducts marketing, brand development and advisory work for artists and companies including Marc Anthony and Jennifer Lopez (managing their apparel and lifestyle products line with Kohl’s Department Stores), Adam Levine and Nicki Minaj (managing their apparel and lifestyle products lines with Kmart), country recording artist Clay Walker, car auctioneer, Barrett-Jackson, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia and Freehand Music.[21]
Personal life[edit]
Koppelman has been married twice. His first wife was Brenda "Bunny" Koppelman who was also Jewish; they had three children: Brian, Stacy and Jennifer. She died of pancreatic cancer in 2008.[22][23] On October 29, 2011, he married Gerri Kyhill Koppelman.[24]
His daughter, Jennifer Hutt is a radio personality who has hosted several radio shows including the popular Sirius Satellite Radio show Just Jenny.[25][26]
His son, Brian Koppelman, is a screenwriter whose credits include Rounders and Ocean's Thirteen.[27][28]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
