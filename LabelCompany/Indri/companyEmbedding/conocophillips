ConocoPhillips headquarters in the Energy Corridor area of Houston.


ConocoPhillips Co. is an American multinational energy corporation with its headquarters located in the Energy Corridor district of Houston, Texas in the United States. It is the world's largest independent pure-play exploration and production company and is a Fortune 500 company.[3][4] ConocoPhillips was created through the merger of American oil companies Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Co. on August 30, 2002.[5] In 2012, ConocoPhillips spun off its downstream assets as a new, and separate company, Phillips 66.[6]

History[edit]
See also: Conoco and Phillips 66
Conoco Inc. was an American oil company founded in 1875 as the Continental Oil and Transportation Co. Based in Ogden, Utah, the company was a coal, oil, kerosene, grease and candles distributor in the West. Marland Oil Co. (founded by exploration pioneer E. W. Marland) later acquired the assets (subject to liabilities) of Continental Oil Co., or DC, merged by Bryan M. Metler, David L. Kinney, and Justin J. Stockburn of Delta Constructors for a consideration of 2,317,266 shares of stock. On June 26, 1899, Marland Oil changed its name to Continental Oil Co. and moved its headquarters to Fargo, North Dakota. The acquisition gave Conoco the red bar-and-triangle logo previously used by Marland. Conoco used the logo between 1930 and 1970, when the current red capsule logo was adopted.
The Conoco headquarters were in Ponca City until 1949, when it moved to Houston, Texas. In 2002 Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Co., whose headquarters were in nearby Bartlesville, Oklahoma merged into ConocoPhillips
Numerous state corporation filings are identified "Continental Oil Co." and "Continental Oil Corp." and "Continental Oil Co. of Texas" as recorded with the Texas Secretary of State and Delaware Secretary of State. Merger of San Jacinto Petroleum Corp. and Continental Oil Corp. is recorded in 1964 with Delaware Secretary of State.
In 2005, ConocoPhillips began rebranding its (Union) 76 gas stations, which Phillips had acquired from Tosco Corp. before the merger with Conoco. The move prompted a petition campaign by fans hoping to save the historic 76 orange ball signage.[7]
In March 2006, ConocoPhillips bought Wilhelmshavener Raffineriegesellschaft mbH in Germany, and Burlington Resources in the United States.[8]
On May 10, 2006, Richard Armitage, former deputy-secretary of the U.S. State Department, was elected to the board of directors of the ConocoPhillips oil company.[9]
In 2007, the Chevron Corp. converted all of the Conoco gas stations in Mississippi to the Texaco brand.
In late 2009, the company announced asset sales to increase investor returns. Included are debt reduction and stock buy back. In March 2011 the program was enlarged up to $10 billion assets sales in the next two years.[10]
ConocoPhillips intends to implement a floating liquefied natural gas facility by 2016–2019, and has completed quantitative risk analysis of a design that will undergo pre-feed study in 2011.[11]
On July 14, 2011, ConocoPhillips announced its intent to separate the company's upstream and downstream businesses into two stand-alone, publicly traded corporations, with the intent of maximizing shareholder value.[12] On May 1, 2012, all midstream, downstream, marketing and chemical operations were separated into a new company named Phillips 66, headquartered in Houston.[13] As a result, ConocoPhillips continued its operations as an upstream (exploration and production) company.[14][15]
In April 2012, ConocoPhillips sold its Trainer Refinery to Monroe Energy LLC, a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines.[16]
In January 2013, Conoco announced that it would sell its Rocky Mountain assets to Denbury Resources for $1.05 billion.[17]
In 2017, Conoco sold oil sands assets in Canada to Cenovus Energy and natural gas fields in the U.S. for a total of US$16 billion to help reduce debt and fund US$6 billion share purchases. As a result, it also led to a reduction of close to 30 percent of its proved oil and gas reserves.[18]
Operations[edit]
Exploration and production[edit]
ConocoPhillips focuses solely on exploring for, developing and producing oil and natural gas globally. The company manages its operations through six operating segments, which are defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48 and Latin America, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International.
Kashagan Field in Kazakhstan[edit]
In 1998, ConocoPhillips acquired an interest in 10.5 blocks in the Caspian Sea off Kazakhstan through the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (NCSPSA). It currently owns 8.4% of the shares of the consortium exploiting Kashagan oil field. However the company seeks to reduce its non-core assets in order to use the cash for debt reduction, fund its capital program, and dividend payments. On October 3, 2012, the Kazakh Oil and Gas Minister told reporters that ConocoPhillips has informed Kazakhstan of their intention to sell their shares.[19] In November 26, in its biggest acquisition ever, ONGC Videsh agreed to buy ConocoPhillips’ 8.4% stake in the Kashagan oilfield for about US $5 billion. The stake buy is subject to approval of governments of Kazakhstan and India and also to other partners in the Caspian Sea field waiving their pre-emption rights.[20]
Headquarters[edit]




Aerial view of the ConocoPhillips headquarters


The headquarters of ConocoPhillips are located in the Energy Corridor district of Houston, Texas.[21] By 2002 the groups organizing the merger had selected Houston as the site of the headquarters. Governor of Oklahoma Frank Keating said that the move to Houston was "regrettable." The Journal Record stated that Archie Dunham, the CEO of Conoco Inc., "apparently highlighted the lack of direct international air travel from Oklahoma as a key drawback for the merged firm."[22] The ConocoPhillips headquarters, originally the headquarters of Conoco Inc., was formerly known as the Conoco Center.[23][24]
In 2018 the headquarters will move to Energy Center Four.[25]

Environmental record[edit]





This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (November 2013)


On April 11, 2007, it became the first U.S. oil company to join the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, an alliance of big business and environmental groups. The partnership in January 2007 had advised President George W. Bush that mandatory emissions caps would be needed to reduce the flow of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. In 2007 ConocoPhillips announced it would spend $150 million that year on the research and development of new energy sources and technologies — a 50 percent increase in spending from 2006.[27] However, ConocoPhillips left the U.S. Climate Action Partnership in February, 2010.[28]
According to the Political Economy Research Institute, ConocoPhillips ranked 13th among U.S. corporate producers of air pollutions.[29]
In June 2011, ConocoPhillips China Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips,[30] was responsible for a series of oil spills at the Penglai 19-3 oil field in Bohai Bay.[31]
ConocoPhillips is a signatory participant of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.

History[edit]
See also: Conoco and Phillips 66
Conoco Inc. was an American oil company founded in 1875 as the Continental Oil and Transportation Co. Based in Ogden, Utah, the company was a coal, oil, kerosene, grease and candles distributor in the West. Marland Oil Co. (founded by exploration pioneer E. W. Marland) later acquired the assets (subject to liabilities) of Continental Oil Co., or DC, merged by Bryan M. Metler, David L. Kinney, and Justin J. Stockburn of Delta Constructors for a consideration of 2,317,266 shares of stock. On June 26, 1899, Marland Oil changed its name to Continental Oil Co. and moved its headquarters to Fargo, North Dakota. The acquisition gave Conoco the red bar-and-triangle logo previously used by Marland. Conoco used the logo between 1930 and 1970, when the current red capsule logo was adopted.
The Conoco headquarters were in Ponca City until 1949, when it moved to Houston, Texas. In 2002 Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Co., whose headquarters were in nearby Bartlesville, Oklahoma merged into ConocoPhillips
Numerous state corporation filings are identified "Continental Oil Co." and "Continental Oil Corp." and "Continental Oil Co. of Texas" as recorded with the Texas Secretary of State and Delaware Secretary of State. Merger of San Jacinto Petroleum Corp. and Continental Oil Corp. is recorded in 1964 with Delaware Secretary of State.
In 2005, ConocoPhillips began rebranding its (Union) 76 gas stations, which Phillips had acquired from Tosco Corp. before the merger with Conoco. The move prompted a petition campaign by fans hoping to save the historic 76 orange ball signage.[7]
In March 2006, ConocoPhillips bought Wilhelmshavener Raffineriegesellschaft mbH in Germany, and Burlington Resources in the United States.[8]
On May 10, 2006, Richard Armitage, former deputy-secretary of the U.S. State Department, was elected to the board of directors of the ConocoPhillips oil company.[9]
In 2007, the Chevron Corp. converted all of the Conoco gas stations in Mississippi to the Texaco brand.
In late 2009, the company announced asset sales to increase investor returns. Included are debt reduction and stock buy back. In March 2011 the program was enlarged up to $10 billion assets sales in the next two years.[10]
ConocoPhillips intends to implement a floating liquefied natural gas facility by 2016–2019, and has completed quantitative risk analysis of a design that will undergo pre-feed study in 2011.[11]
On July 14, 2011, ConocoPhillips announced its intent to separate the company's upstream and downstream businesses into two stand-alone, publicly traded corporations, with the intent of maximizing shareholder value.[12] On May 1, 2012, all midstream, downstream, marketing and chemical operations were separated into a new company named Phillips 66, headquartered in Houston.[13] As a result, ConocoPhillips continued its operations as an upstream (exploration and production) company.[14][15]
In April 2012, ConocoPhillips sold its Trainer Refinery to Monroe Energy LLC, a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines.[16]
In January 2013, Conoco announced that it would sell its Rocky Mountain assets to Denbury Resources for $1.05 billion.[17]
In 2017, Conoco sold oil sands assets in Canada to Cenovus Energy and natural gas fields in the U.S. for a total of US$16 billion to help reduce debt and fund US$6 billion share purchases. As a result, it also led to a reduction of close to 30 percent of its proved oil and gas reserves.[18]
Operations[edit]
Exploration and production[edit]
ConocoPhillips focuses solely on exploring for, developing and producing oil and natural gas globally. The company manages its operations through six operating segments, which are defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48 and Latin America, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International.
Kashagan Field in Kazakhstan[edit]
In 1998, ConocoPhillips acquired an interest in 10.5 blocks in the Caspian Sea off Kazakhstan through the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (NCSPSA). It currently owns 8.4% of the shares of the consortium exploiting Kashagan oil field. However the company seeks to reduce its non-core assets in order to use the cash for debt reduction, fund its capital program, and dividend payments. On October 3, 2012, the Kazakh Oil and Gas Minister told reporters that ConocoPhillips has informed Kazakhstan of their intention to sell their shares.[19] In November 26, in its biggest acquisition ever, ONGC Videsh agreed to buy ConocoPhillips’ 8.4% stake in the Kashagan oilfield for about US $5 billion. The stake buy is subject to approval of governments of Kazakhstan and India and also to other partners in the Caspian Sea field waiving their pre-emption rights.[20]
Headquarters[edit]




Aerial view of the ConocoPhillips headquarters


The headquarters of ConocoPhillips are located in the Energy Corridor district of Houston, Texas.[21] By 2002 the groups organizing the merger had selected Houston as the site of the headquarters. Governor of Oklahoma Frank Keating said that the move to Houston was "regrettable." The Journal Record stated that Archie Dunham, the CEO of Conoco Inc., "apparently highlighted the lack of direct international air travel from Oklahoma as a key drawback for the merged firm."[22] The ConocoPhillips headquarters, originally the headquarters of Conoco Inc., was formerly known as the Conoco Center.[23][24]
In 2018 the headquarters will move to Energy Center Four.[25]

On April 11, 2007, it became the first U.S. oil company to join the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, an alliance of big business and environmental groups. The partnership in January 2007 had advised President George W. Bush that mandatory emissions caps would be needed to reduce the flow of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. In 2007 ConocoPhillips announced it would spend $150 million that year on the research and development of new energy sources and technologies — a 50 percent increase in spending from 2006.[27] However, ConocoPhillips left the U.S. Climate Action Partnership in February, 2010.[28]
According to the Political Economy Research Institute, ConocoPhillips ranked 13th among U.S. corporate producers of air pollutions.[29]
In June 2011, ConocoPhillips China Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips,[30] was responsible for a series of oil spills at the Penglai 19-3 oil field in Bohai Bay.[31]

ConocoPhillips headquarters in the Energy Corridor area of Houston.


ConocoPhillips Co. is an American multinational energy corporation with its headquarters located in the Energy Corridor district of Houston, Texas in the United States. It is the world's largest independent pure-play exploration and production company and is a Fortune 500 company.[3][4] ConocoPhillips was created through the merger of American oil companies Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Co. on August 30, 2002.[5] In 2012, ConocoPhillips spun off its downstream assets as a new, and separate company, Phillips 66.[6]

History[edit]
See also: Conoco and Phillips 66
Conoco Inc. was an American oil company founded in 1875 as the Continental Oil and Transportation Co. Based in Ogden, Utah, the company was a coal, oil, kerosene, grease and candles distributor in the West. Marland Oil Co. (founded by exploration pioneer E. W. Marland) later acquired the assets (subject to liabilities) of Continental Oil Co., or DC, merged by Bryan M. Metler, David L. Kinney, and Justin J. Stockburn of Delta Constructors for a consideration of 2,317,266 shares of stock. On June 26, 1899, Marland Oil changed its name to Continental Oil Co. and moved its headquarters to Fargo, North Dakota. The acquisition gave Conoco the red bar-and-triangle logo previously used by Marland. Conoco used the logo between 1930 and 1970, when the current red capsule logo was adopted.
The Conoco headquarters were in Ponca City until 1949, when it moved to Houston, Texas. In 2002 Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Co., whose headquarters were in nearby Bartlesville, Oklahoma merged into ConocoPhillips
Numerous state corporation filings are identified "Continental Oil Co." and "Continental Oil Corp." and "Continental Oil Co. of Texas" as recorded with the Texas Secretary of State and Delaware Secretary of State. Merger of San Jacinto Petroleum Corp. and Continental Oil Corp. is recorded in 1964 with Delaware Secretary of State.
In 2005, ConocoPhillips began rebranding its (Union) 76 gas stations, which Phillips had acquired from Tosco Corp. before the merger with Conoco. The move prompted a petition campaign by fans hoping to save the historic 76 orange ball signage.[7]
In March 2006, ConocoPhillips bought Wilhelmshavener Raffineriegesellschaft mbH in Germany, and Burlington Resources in the United States.[8]
On May 10, 2006, Richard Armitage, former deputy-secretary of the U.S. State Department, was elected to the board of directors of the ConocoPhillips oil company.[9]
In 2007, the Chevron Corp. converted all of the Conoco gas stations in Mississippi to the Texaco brand.
In late 2009, the company announced asset sales to increase investor returns. Included are debt reduction and stock buy back. In March 2011 the program was enlarged up to $10 billion assets sales in the next two years.[10]
ConocoPhillips intends to implement a floating liquefied natural gas facility by 2016–2019, and has completed quantitative risk analysis of a design that will undergo pre-feed study in 2011.[11]
On July 14, 2011, ConocoPhillips announced its intent to separate the company's upstream and downstream businesses into two stand-alone, publicly traded corporations, with the intent of maximizing shareholder value.[12] On May 1, 2012, all midstream, downstream, marketing and chemical operations were separated into a new company named Phillips 66, headquartered in Houston.[13] As a result, ConocoPhillips continued its operations as an upstream (exploration and production) company.[14][15]
In April 2012, ConocoPhillips sold its Trainer Refinery to Monroe Energy LLC, a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines.[16]
In January 2013, Conoco announced that it would sell its Rocky Mountain assets to Denbury Resources for $1.05 billion.[17]
In 2017, Conoco sold oil sands assets in Canada to Cenovus Energy and natural gas fields in the U.S. for a total of US$16 billion to help reduce debt and fund US$6 billion share purchases. As a result, it also led to a reduction of close to 30 percent of its proved oil and gas reserves.[18]
Operations[edit]
Exploration and production[edit]
ConocoPhillips focuses solely on exploring for, developing and producing oil and natural gas globally. The company manages its operations through six operating segments, which are defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48 and Latin America, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International.
Kashagan Field in Kazakhstan[edit]
In 1998, ConocoPhillips acquired an interest in 10.5 blocks in the Caspian Sea off Kazakhstan through the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (NCSPSA). It currently owns 8.4% of the shares of the consortium exploiting Kashagan oil field. However the company seeks to reduce its non-core assets in order to use the cash for debt reduction, fund its capital program, and dividend payments. On October 3, 2012, the Kazakh Oil and Gas Minister told reporters that ConocoPhillips has informed Kazakhstan of their intention to sell their shares.[19] In November 26, in its biggest acquisition ever, ONGC Videsh agreed to buy ConocoPhillips’ 8.4% stake in the Kashagan oilfield for about US $5 billion. The stake buy is subject to approval of governments of Kazakhstan and India and also to other partners in the Caspian Sea field waiving their pre-emption rights.[20]
Headquarters[edit]




Aerial view of the ConocoPhillips headquarters


The headquarters of ConocoPhillips are located in the Energy Corridor district of Houston, Texas.[21] By 2002 the groups organizing the merger had selected Houston as the site of the headquarters. Governor of Oklahoma Frank Keating said that the move to Houston was "regrettable." The Journal Record stated that Archie Dunham, the CEO of Conoco Inc., "apparently highlighted the lack of direct international air travel from Oklahoma as a key drawback for the merged firm."[22] The ConocoPhillips headquarters, originally the headquarters of Conoco Inc., was formerly known as the Conoco Center.[23][24]
In 2018 the headquarters will move to Energy Center Four.[25]

Environmental record[edit]





This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (November 2013)


On April 11, 2007, it became the first U.S. oil company to join the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, an alliance of big business and environmental groups. The partnership in January 2007 had advised President George W. Bush that mandatory emissions caps would be needed to reduce the flow of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. In 2007 ConocoPhillips announced it would spend $150 million that year on the research and development of new energy sources and technologies — a 50 percent increase in spending from 2006.[27] However, ConocoPhillips left the U.S. Climate Action Partnership in February, 2010.[28]
According to the Political Economy Research Institute, ConocoPhillips ranked 13th among U.S. corporate producers of air pollutions.[29]
In June 2011, ConocoPhillips China Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips,[30] was responsible for a series of oil spills at the Penglai 19-3 oil field in Bohai Bay.[31]
ConocoPhillips is a signatory participant of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.

History[edit]
See also: Conoco and Phillips 66
Conoco Inc. was an American oil company founded in 1875 as the Continental Oil and Transportation Co. Based in Ogden, Utah, the company was a coal, oil, kerosene, grease and candles distributor in the West. Marland Oil Co. (founded by exploration pioneer E. W. Marland) later acquired the assets (subject to liabilities) of Continental Oil Co., or DC, merged by Bryan M. Metler, David L. Kinney, and Justin J. Stockburn of Delta Constructors for a consideration of 2,317,266 shares of stock. On June 26, 1899, Marland Oil changed its name to Continental Oil Co. and moved its headquarters to Fargo, North Dakota. The acquisition gave Conoco the red bar-and-triangle logo previously used by Marland. Conoco used the logo between 1930 and 1970, when the current red capsule logo was adopted.
The Conoco headquarters were in Ponca City until 1949, when it moved to Houston, Texas. In 2002 Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Co., whose headquarters were in nearby Bartlesville, Oklahoma merged into ConocoPhillips
Numerous state corporation filings are identified "Continental Oil Co." and "Continental Oil Corp." and "Continental Oil Co. of Texas" as recorded with the Texas Secretary of State and Delaware Secretary of State. Merger of San Jacinto Petroleum Corp. and Continental Oil Corp. is recorded in 1964 with Delaware Secretary of State.
In 2005, ConocoPhillips began rebranding its (Union) 76 gas stations, which Phillips had acquired from Tosco Corp. before the merger with Conoco. The move prompted a petition campaign by fans hoping to save the historic 76 orange ball signage.[7]
In March 2006, ConocoPhillips bought Wilhelmshavener Raffineriegesellschaft mbH in Germany, and Burlington Resources in the United States.[8]
On May 10, 2006, Richard Armitage, former deputy-secretary of the U.S. State Department, was elected to the board of directors of the ConocoPhillips oil company.[9]
In 2007, the Chevron Corp. converted all of the Conoco gas stations in Mississippi to the Texaco brand.
In late 2009, the company announced asset sales to increase investor returns. Included are debt reduction and stock buy back. In March 2011 the program was enlarged up to $10 billion assets sales in the next two years.[10]
ConocoPhillips intends to implement a floating liquefied natural gas facility by 2016–2019, and has completed quantitative risk analysis of a design that will undergo pre-feed study in 2011.[11]
On July 14, 2011, ConocoPhillips announced its intent to separate the company's upstream and downstream businesses into two stand-alone, publicly traded corporations, with the intent of maximizing shareholder value.[12] On May 1, 2012, all midstream, downstream, marketing and chemical operations were separated into a new company named Phillips 66, headquartered in Houston.[13] As a result, ConocoPhillips continued its operations as an upstream (exploration and production) company.[14][15]
In April 2012, ConocoPhillips sold its Trainer Refinery to Monroe Energy LLC, a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines.[16]
In January 2013, Conoco announced that it would sell its Rocky Mountain assets to Denbury Resources for $1.05 billion.[17]
In 2017, Conoco sold oil sands assets in Canada to Cenovus Energy and natural gas fields in the U.S. for a total of US$16 billion to help reduce debt and fund US$6 billion share purchases. As a result, it also led to a reduction of close to 30 percent of its proved oil and gas reserves.[18]
Operations[edit]
Exploration and production[edit]
ConocoPhillips focuses solely on exploring for, developing and producing oil and natural gas globally. The company manages its operations through six operating segments, which are defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48 and Latin America, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International.
Kashagan Field in Kazakhstan[edit]
In 1998, ConocoPhillips acquired an interest in 10.5 blocks in the Caspian Sea off Kazakhstan through the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (NCSPSA). It currently owns 8.4% of the shares of the consortium exploiting Kashagan oil field. However the company seeks to reduce its non-core assets in order to use the cash for debt reduction, fund its capital program, and dividend payments. On October 3, 2012, the Kazakh Oil and Gas Minister told reporters that ConocoPhillips has informed Kazakhstan of their intention to sell their shares.[19] In November 26, in its biggest acquisition ever, ONGC Videsh agreed to buy ConocoPhillips’ 8.4% stake in the Kashagan oilfield for about US $5 billion. The stake buy is subject to approval of governments of Kazakhstan and India and also to other partners in the Caspian Sea field waiving their pre-emption rights.[20]
Headquarters[edit]




Aerial view of the ConocoPhillips headquarters


The headquarters of ConocoPhillips are located in the Energy Corridor district of Houston, Texas.[21] By 2002 the groups organizing the merger had selected Houston as the site of the headquarters. Governor of Oklahoma Frank Keating said that the move to Houston was "regrettable." The Journal Record stated that Archie Dunham, the CEO of Conoco Inc., "apparently highlighted the lack of direct international air travel from Oklahoma as a key drawback for the merged firm."[22] The ConocoPhillips headquarters, originally the headquarters of Conoco Inc., was formerly known as the Conoco Center.[23][24]
In 2018 the headquarters will move to Energy Center Four.[25]

Environmental record[edit]





This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (November 2013)


On April 11, 2007, it became the first U.S. oil company to join the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, an alliance of big business and environmental groups. The partnership in January 2007 had advised President George W. Bush that mandatory emissions caps would be needed to reduce the flow of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. In 2007 ConocoPhillips announced it would spend $150 million that year on the research and development of new energy sources and technologies — a 50 percent increase in spending from 2006.[27] However, ConocoPhillips left the U.S. Climate Action Partnership in February, 2010.[28]
According to the Political Economy Research Institute, ConocoPhillips ranked 13th among U.S. corporate producers of air pollutions.[29]
In June 2011, ConocoPhillips China Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips,[30] was responsible for a series of oil spills at the Penglai 19-3 oil field in Bohai Bay.[31]
ConocoPhillips is a signatory participant of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.

Governor of Oklahoma Frank Keating said that the move to Houston was "regrettable." The Journal Record stated that Archie Dunham, the CEO of Conoco Inc., "apparently highlighted the lack of direct international air travel from Oklahoma as a key drawback for the merged firm."[22] The ConocoPhillips headquarters, originally the headquarters of Conoco Inc., was formerly known as the Conoco Center.[23][24]
In 2018 the headquarters will move to Energy Center Four.[25]

On April 11, 2007, it became the first U.S. oil company to join the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, an alliance of big business and environmental groups. The partnership in January 2007 had advised President George W. Bush that mandatory emissions caps would be needed to reduce the flow of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. In 2007 ConocoPhillips announced it would spend $150 million that year on the research and development of new energy sources and technologies — a 50 percent increase in spending from 2006.[27] However, ConocoPhillips left the U.S. Climate Action Partnership in February, 2010.[28]
According to the Political Economy Research Institute, ConocoPhillips ranked 13th among U.S. corporate producers of air pollutions.[29]
In June 2011, ConocoPhillips China Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips,[30] was responsible for a series of oil spills at the Penglai 19-3 oil field in Bohai Bay.[31]
ConocoPhillips is a signatory participant of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.

What’s ConocoPhillips’s Worldwide Operations Production Mix?


By Nicholas Chapman

ConocoPhillips’s production mix
As you can see in the graph below, ConocoPhillips’s (COP) production mix for 3Q16 was ~38.0% crude oil, ~12.0% bitumen, ~10.0% natural gas liquids, and ~40.0% natural gas. That means ConocoPhillips (COP) is tilted more toward liquids production. Its total liquids production is ~60.0%. Typically, upstream companies with more liquids production have better operating margins.

For 3Q16, ConocoPhillips’s Lower 48 operations reported a production mix of ~40.0% crude oil, ~18.0% natural gas liquids, and ~42.0% natural gas. That means the company’s 3Q16 production from its Lower 48 operations contains ~58.0% liquids and is tilted toward liquids production.
COP’s Canada operations reported ~62.0% bitumen in their production mix with total liquids production of ~72.0% and natural gas production of ~28.0%. All of ConocoPhillips’s bitumen production comes from its Canada operations.
For 3Q16, ConocoPhillips’s Europe and North Africa operations reported a production mix of ~65.0% crude oil, ~3.0% natural gas liquids, and ~32.0% natural gas.
ConocoPhillips’s Asia Pacific and Middle East operations are tilted toward natural gas production, with ~68.0% natural gas in its production mix.
What’s COP’s strategy for production mix going forward?
On November 10, 2016, while presenting at AIM (Analyst and Investor Meeting) in New York, ConocoPhillips revealed its production mix strategy for the next two years. COP is planning to reduce natural gas exposure in North America. To know more, refer to Market Realist’s article ConocoPhillips’s Production Mix Strategy for 2017–2018.
Other upstream companies
Other upstream companies with higher crude oil percentages in their production mixes are Stone Energy (SGY), Devon Energy (DVN), and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD). These companies have ~43.0%, ~40.0%, and ~57.0%, respectively, of crude oil in their production mixes.
Volatility in oil prices also impacts ETFs and ETNs such as the ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Crude Oil (SCO), the Vanguard Energy ETF (VDE), and the VelocityShares 3x Long Crude Oil ETN (UWTIF).
Now let’s take a look at ConocoPhillips’s oil and gas revenue mix for 3Q16.

(Judy Patrick / ConocoPhillips)    A sign on the North Slope points the way to the two wells, Tinmiaq 2 and 6, that are part of ConocoPhillips’ newly announced Willow discovery in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. (Judy Patrick / ConocoPhillips)          Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share via Email  Share on Tumblr  Share on Reddit  Share on LinkedIn  Share on Google Plus      Print article                         ConocoPhillips on Friday heralded a promising new oil discovery on its leases in the nation's petroleum reserve in Alaska that could produce up to 100,000 barrels of oil daily, possibly providing some replacement to depleted production from Prudhoe Bay.      The oil giant said its large acquisitions of acreage in state and federal lease sales in December were a "follow-up" to the big discovery, which it had kept secret. The large purchases in the lease sale are a sign the Houston-based oil company believes the oil play, or similar geological finds, may extend much farther.      The news of the Arctic discovery comes as Alaska faces forecasts of continued economic gloom, with low oil prices slamming the state budget and leading to thousands of layoffs on the Slope and in Cook Inlet oil fields and other industries.      But it also comes on the heels of two oil discoveries in the past year that could yield even larger quantities of crude, according to announcements by two independent oil companies.      "This discovery is tremendously exciting not only for Conoco, but also for the state of Alaska," said Joe Marushack, president of ConocoPhillips Alaska, in a prepared statement.      The discovery will also likely factor into Juneau lawmakers' discussions over oil-production taxes as they convene this month to begin considering reducing tax benefits for the Slope industry.      Supporters of tax credits say they have encouraged investment in oil fields and, before oil prices began sliding sharply, pushed employment in the industry to record levels.               Opponents say the state can't afford to be so generous with industry, especially when many other sectors are hurting.      Conoco said the discovery, known as Willow and located in the Greater Mooses Tooth Unit where other development is already underway by the company, could lead to a multibillion-dollar investment, providing thousands of jobs and generating revenues for the local, state and federal governments.      If oil is produced there, Alaska would receive half of the 16.67 percent of the federal share, or royalty, of oil produced from federal lands. The federal government would get the other half.      The discovery wells, about 4 miles apart, are called Tinmiaq 2 and 6. They are 28 miles west of the Alpine Central Facility processing oil at ConocoPhillips' large Alpine oil field.      "Willow's proximity to existing infrastructure improves the economic viability of the discovery," Marushack said.      The Willow wells were drilled in early 2016 in the northeastern portion of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.               Once the federal government agreed to lease land in the Indiana-sized reserve, it was cracked open for oil development by Conoco and partner Anadarko Petroleum Corp., holding a 22 percent interest in the unit. The discovery was on federal land.      Conoco recently began oil production at the first producing field within the reserve's boundaries, CD5, where 20,000 barrels of daily production has beat expectations by 25 percent. It is beginning construction this winter at Greater Moose's Tooth 1, where peak production is estimated to reach 30,000 barrels of oil daily.      "The acreage acquired in the recent state and federal lease sales gives us running room to test the concepts that led to Willow and other NPR-A discoveries," said Richard Lunam, a top Conoco official.      The Willow wells were discovered in the Brookian Nanushuk geologic formation, relatively shallow rock that has been overlooked by Alaska's oil industry, as explorers scouted for the deeper and older pools of oil such as those at the giant Prudhoe Bay.      The Nanushuk and the related Torok formation were created roughly 100 million years ago as sediments from eroding mountains deposited across the Slope, when it was an oceanic basin. Caelus Energy and Armstrong Oil and Gas have announced two large Slope discoveries in the formations over the last year.      David Houseknecht, project chief for the U.S. Geological Survey's Energy Resources Program for Alaska, said the details provided by Conoco so far suggest the discovery is a strong candidate for development and oil production.      "It's all good," he said of the details.      The oil is light, so it could readily flow through the reservoir during production, unlike thick crude that sticks to rocks and is hard to produce. Light oil is also more valuable in the market.      He said the estimated size of the discovery is "respectable," with Conoco saying it may contain more than 300 million barrels of recoverable oil.      That would make it a bit larger than the Slope's Northstar field, now operated and owned by Hilcorp Alaska, he said. Oil production there began around 2000, reaching 70,000 barrels daily, though levels have since fallen.      Conoco did not say whether it has hired a third-party engineering firm to help confirm the data. But Houseknecht said the oil major would not make such an announcement unless it had solid evidence.               "It's probably already a pretty reliable estimate. It's like the old (Magic) 8 Ball. All signs point to yes," he said of the prospects for development.      "We have our own expert staff who know how to appraise these discoveries,"  said Natalie Lowman, Conoco communications director for Alaska.      The data gathered so far "provides a pretty solid technical foundation to confirm that Willow is a discovery with development potential," she said.      The company plans to learn more about the discovery starting this month by acquiring state-of-the-art 3-D seismic data to support previously gathered information, providing a closer glimpse of the formation.      Conoco said the Tinmiaq 2 well, with pay-zones containing light crude oil, was "tested and established good reservoir deliverability." The well had a sustained 12-hour test rate of 3,200 barrels of oil per day.      "The test rate is very good," said Houseknecht.      If permits are approved in a timely way and the project is economically competitive with other oil projects, Conoco said production could start in 2023.

Why ConocoPhillips Reported Higher Production in 1Q17


By Nicholas Chapman

				Jun 29, 2017				4:45 pm EDT            










ConocoPhillips’s 1Q17 production
In 1Q17, ConocoPhillips (COP) reported total production (USO) (UNG) of 1,584 Mboepd (thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day), which is ~2% higher than the midpoint of its 1Q17 production guidance of 1,555 Mboepd–1,595 Mboepd. ConocoPhillips’s 1Q17 production was ~0.4% higher than its 1Q16 production of 1,578 Mboepd.

Production trend
As shown in the above chart, ConocoPhillips’s quarterly production volumes peaked in 1Q15. In the first two quarters of 2016, the company reported declining production. However, this trend was broken in 3Q16, when ConocoPhillips reported sequentially higher production. Although ConocoPhillips’ 1Q17 production beat the midpoint of its production guidance, it was slightly lower than the company’s 4Q16 production of 1,587 Mboepd.



Why ConocoPhillips reported higher production in 1Q17
ConocoPhillips’s 1Q17 production was impacted by normal field decline and dispositions. Last year, the company completed asset sales in Canada, the Lower 48, Alaska, and Russian company Polar Lights. However, ConocoPhillips’s lower production was offset by a production boost from multiple development programs, growth from existing projects, and improved well performance. In the last six months, ConocoPhillips achieved its first production at Malikai in Malaysia, APLNG Train 2 in Australia, Bohai WHP-J in China, and Alder in Europe.
Production from Libya
ConocoPhillips restarted its Libya production in 4Q16. In 4Q16 and 1Q17, the company’s production from Libya was ~9 Mboepd. The company’s 1Q17 production discussed above does not include its production from Libya. Including Libya, ConocoPhillip’s 1Q17 production was 1,593 Mboepd, which is ~1% higher than its production of 1,578 Mboepd in 1Q16. Peer Murphy Oil (MUR) also has operations in Libya. In the next part, we’ll compare ConocoPhillips’s 1Q17 production with its disposition-and-downtime-adjusted 1Q16 production.

Engineering

Working on the leading edge of engineering innovation is an enviable place to be. Especially within an industry that challenges you to provide for the needs of future generations.
Engineers at ConocoPhillips focus their energies on the crude oil and natural gas exploration and production technologies that are vital to our tomorrow. That means developing legacy assets, exploring for new reserves, and releasing the full potential the land and sea have to offer. All while ensuring that we minimize the environmental impact of our work.
ConocoPhillips’ global resource base includes conventional oil and unconventional heavy oil and conventional natural gas, as well as gas and oil from tight sands, coalbeds and shales. Experienced engineers who join us can contribute to our growth through activities like these:

Reservoir performance evaluations
Stimulation evaluations and procedures
Production optimization
Facilities optimization and upgrades
Remedial workovers.

University Students & Graduates
Who we are
Exploration and Production (upstream) explores for, develops and produces crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) worldwide. The majority of our reserves are located in politically stable countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
How you can contribute
There are extensive engineering opportunities in E&P, including field assignments in drilling operations and production operations onshore and offshore and at processing facilities for NGLs and LNG. There also are headquarters assignments evaluating and developing E&P prospects around the globe. E&P engineers work collaboratively with many disciplines using the latest technology to deliver tomorrow’s energy solutions.
Opportunities within E&P include drilling, completions, production, facility and reservoir engineering positions. Typical duties of a new E&P engineer may include:

Determining optimum methods for drilling, completing or working over wells in both onshore and offshore locations.
Developing the most efficient methods to recover reserves through equipment design and operating practices.
Developing engineering design specifications, recommendations and cost estimates for engines, compressors, pumps, turbines, casing, tubing, piping and many other types of equipment.
Planning well locations, quantifying anticipated reserves, analyzing well logs and booking corporate reserves.

How you can grow
We believe the development of our technical professionals is a career-long continuum. There are 3 career paths that engineers generally follow. They either become a technical expert, a technical generalist or transition into leadership. These paths are chosen based on performance, skills, desire and company needs. Our engineers utilize individual development plans in discussions with leadership to identify key goals, desires and mobility. Our objective is to provide newly hired engineers a well-rounded development plan that helps ensure their overall effectiveness.
In addition to their supervisor, each new-hire engineer should be assigned a technical mentor who can provide guidance based on engineering discipline. The supervisor and mentor will work together with the new engineer on a skills development plan that serves as the beginning of career-long learning. Skills will be developed through classroom training, virtual training and on-the-job training. Each year, or as required, an assessment is completed to help fill an online skills inventory. This inventory is used for identifying additional training needs, identifying new roles or for determining subject matter experts within the company.
Additionally, each new engineer participates in the PetroTech Academy, a training program that gives early career petro-technical employees an opportunity to broaden their knowledge of the upstream life cycle and the company’s collaborative approach to asset management.
What we’re looking for
ConocoPhillips hires engineers primarily from the petroleum, mechanical and chemical disciplines to begin work in completions, drilling, facilities, production or reservoir roles.
Many of our new hires have worked internships in the oil industry and have an understanding of what role they would like to take. For those without industry exposure, a role will be selected based on company needs. In these cases, these individuals will have enhanced opportunities to understand all of the opportunities available, so they can find the best fit.

History[edit]
See also: Conoco and Phillips 66
Conoco Inc. was an American oil company founded in 1875 as the Continental Oil and Transportation Co. Based in Ogden, Utah, the company was a coal, oil, kerosene, grease and candles distributor in the West. Marland Oil Co. (founded by exploration pioneer E. W. Marland) later acquired the assets (subject to liabilities) of Continental Oil Co., or DC, merged by Bryan M. Metler, David L. Kinney, and Justin J. Stockburn of Delta Constructors for a consideration of 2,317,266 shares of stock. On June 26, 1899, Marland Oil changed its name to Continental Oil Co. and moved its headquarters to Fargo, North Dakota. The acquisition gave Conoco the red bar-and-triangle logo previously used by Marland. Conoco used the logo between 1930 and 1970, when the current red capsule logo was adopted.
The Conoco headquarters were in Ponca City until 1949, when it moved to Houston, Texas. In 2002 Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Co., whose headquarters were in nearby Bartlesville, Oklahoma merged into ConocoPhillips
Numerous state corporation filings are identified "Continental Oil Co." and "Continental Oil Corp." and "Continental Oil Co. of Texas" as recorded with the Texas Secretary of State and Delaware Secretary of State. Merger of San Jacinto Petroleum Corp. and Continental Oil Corp. is recorded in 1964 with Delaware Secretary of State.
In 2005, ConocoPhillips began rebranding its (Union) 76 gas stations, which Phillips had acquired from Tosco Corp. before the merger with Conoco. The move prompted a petition campaign by fans hoping to save the historic 76 orange ball signage.[7]
In March 2006, ConocoPhillips bought Wilhelmshavener Raffineriegesellschaft mbH in Germany, and Burlington Resources in the United States.[8]
On May 10, 2006, Richard Armitage, former deputy-secretary of the U.S. State Department, was elected to the board of directors of the ConocoPhillips oil company.[9]
In 2007, the Chevron Corp. converted all of the Conoco gas stations in Mississippi to the Texaco brand.
In late 2009, the company announced asset sales to increase investor returns. Included are debt reduction and stock buy back. In March 2011 the program was enlarged up to $10 billion assets sales in the next two years.[10]
ConocoPhillips intends to implement a floating liquefied natural gas facility by 2016–2019, and has completed quantitative risk analysis of a design that will undergo pre-feed study in 2011.[11]
On July 14, 2011, ConocoPhillips announced its intent to separate the company's upstream and downstream businesses into two stand-alone, publicly traded corporations, with the intent of maximizing shareholder value.[12] On May 1, 2012, all midstream, downstream, marketing and chemical operations were separated into a new company named Phillips 66, headquartered in Houston.[13] As a result, ConocoPhillips continued its operations as an upstream (exploration and production) company.[14][15]
In April 2012, ConocoPhillips sold its Trainer Refinery to Monroe Energy LLC, a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines.[16]
In January 2013, Conoco announced that it would sell its Rocky Mountain assets to Denbury Resources for $1.05 billion.[17]
In 2017, Conoco sold oil sands assets in Canada to Cenovus Energy and natural gas fields in the U.S. for a total of US$16 billion to help reduce debt and fund US$6 billion share purchases. As a result, it also led to a reduction of close to 30 percent of its proved oil and gas reserves.[18]
Operations[edit]
Exploration and production[edit]
ConocoPhillips focuses solely on exploring for, developing and producing oil and natural gas globally. The company manages its operations through six operating segments, which are defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48 and Latin America, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International.
Kashagan Field in Kazakhstan[edit]
In 1998, ConocoPhillips acquired an interest in 10.5 blocks in the Caspian Sea off Kazakhstan through the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (NCSPSA). It currently owns 8.4% of the shares of the consortium exploiting Kashagan oil field. However the company seeks to reduce its non-core assets in order to use the cash for debt reduction, fund its capital program, and dividend payments. On October 3, 2012, the Kazakh Oil and Gas Minister told reporters that ConocoPhillips has informed Kazakhstan of their intention to sell their shares.[19] In November 26, in its biggest acquisition ever, ONGC Videsh agreed to buy ConocoPhillips’ 8.4% stake in the Kashagan oilfield for about US $5 billion. The stake buy is subject to approval of governments of Kazakhstan and India and also to other partners in the Caspian Sea field waiving their pre-emption rights.[20]
Headquarters[edit]




Aerial view of the ConocoPhillips headquarters


The headquarters of ConocoPhillips are located in the Energy Corridor district of Houston, Texas.[21] By 2002 the groups organizing the merger had selected Houston as the site of the headquarters. Governor of Oklahoma Frank Keating said that the move to Houston was "regrettable." The Journal Record stated that Archie Dunham, the CEO of Conoco Inc., "apparently highlighted the lack of direct international air travel from Oklahoma as a key drawback for the merged firm."[22] The ConocoPhillips headquarters, originally the headquarters of Conoco Inc., was formerly known as the Conoco Center.[23][24]
In 2018 the headquarters will move to Energy Center Four.[25]

Environmental record[edit]





This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (November 2013)


On April 11, 2007, it became the first U.S. oil company to join the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, an alliance of big business and environmental groups. The partnership in January 2007 had advised President George W. Bush that mandatory emissions caps would be needed to reduce the flow of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. In 2007 ConocoPhillips announced it would spend $150 million that year on the research and development of new energy sources and technologies — a 50 percent increase in spending from 2006.[27] However, ConocoPhillips left the U.S. Climate Action Partnership in February, 2010.[28]
According to the Political Economy Research Institute, ConocoPhillips ranked 13th among U.S. corporate producers of air pollutions.[29]
In June 2011, ConocoPhillips China Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips,[30] was responsible for a series of oil spills at the Penglai 19-3 oil field in Bohai Bay.[31]
ConocoPhillips is a signatory participant of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.

ConocoPhillips headquarters in the Energy Corridor area of Houston.


ConocoPhillips Co. is an American multinational energy corporation with its headquarters located in the Energy Corridor district of Houston, Texas in the United States. It is the world's largest independent pure-play exploration and production company and is a Fortune 500 company.[3][4] ConocoPhillips was created through the merger of American oil companies Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Co. on August 30, 2002.[5] In 2012, ConocoPhillips spun off its downstream assets as a new, and separate company, Phillips 66.[6]

History[edit]
See also: Conoco and Phillips 66
Conoco Inc. was an American oil company founded in 1875 as the Continental Oil and Transportation Co. Based in Ogden, Utah, the company was a coal, oil, kerosene, grease and candles distributor in the West. Marland Oil Co. (founded by exploration pioneer E. W. Marland) later acquired the assets (subject to liabilities) of Continental Oil Co., or DC, merged by Bryan M. Metler, David L. Kinney, and Justin J. Stockburn of Delta Constructors for a consideration of 2,317,266 shares of stock. On June 26, 1899, Marland Oil changed its name to Continental Oil Co. and moved its headquarters to Fargo, North Dakota. The acquisition gave Conoco the red bar-and-triangle logo previously used by Marland. Conoco used the logo between 1930 and 1970, when the current red capsule logo was adopted.
The Conoco headquarters were in Ponca City until 1949, when it moved to Houston, Texas. In 2002 Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Co., whose headquarters were in nearby Bartlesville, Oklahoma merged into ConocoPhillips
Numerous state corporation filings are identified "Continental Oil Co." and "Continental Oil Corp." and "Continental Oil Co. of Texas" as recorded with the Texas Secretary of State and Delaware Secretary of State. Merger of San Jacinto Petroleum Corp. and Continental Oil Corp. is recorded in 1964 with Delaware Secretary of State.
In 2005, ConocoPhillips began rebranding its (Union) 76 gas stations, which Phillips had acquired from Tosco Corp. before the merger with Conoco. The move prompted a petition campaign by fans hoping to save the historic 76 orange ball signage.[7]
In March 2006, ConocoPhillips bought Wilhelmshavener Raffineriegesellschaft mbH in Germany, and Burlington Resources in the United States.[8]
On May 10, 2006, Richard Armitage, former deputy-secretary of the U.S. State Department, was elected to the board of directors of the ConocoPhillips oil company.[9]
In 2007, the Chevron Corp. converted all of the Conoco gas stations in Mississippi to the Texaco brand.
In late 2009, the company announced asset sales to increase investor returns. Included are debt reduction and stock buy back. In March 2011 the program was enlarged up to $10 billion assets sales in the next two years.[10]
ConocoPhillips intends to implement a floating liquefied natural gas facility by 2016–2019, and has completed quantitative risk analysis of a design that will undergo pre-feed study in 2011.[11]
On July 14, 2011, ConocoPhillips announced its intent to separate the company's upstream and downstream businesses into two stand-alone, publicly traded corporations, with the intent of maximizing shareholder value.[12] On May 1, 2012, all midstream, downstream, marketing and chemical operations were separated into a new company named Phillips 66, headquartered in Houston.[13] As a result, ConocoPhillips continued its operations as an upstream (exploration and production) company.[14][15]
In April 2012, ConocoPhillips sold its Trainer Refinery to Monroe Energy LLC, a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines.[16]
In January 2013, Conoco announced that it would sell its Rocky Mountain assets to Denbury Resources for $1.05 billion.[17]
In 2017, Conoco sold oil sands assets in Canada to Cenovus Energy and natural gas fields in the U.S. for a total of US$16 billion to help reduce debt and fund US$6 billion share purchases. As a result, it also led to a reduction of close to 30 percent of its proved oil and gas reserves.[18]
Operations[edit]
Exploration and production[edit]
ConocoPhillips focuses solely on exploring for, developing and producing oil and natural gas globally. The company manages its operations through six operating segments, which are defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48 and Latin America, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International.
Kashagan Field in Kazakhstan[edit]
In 1998, ConocoPhillips acquired an interest in 10.5 blocks in the Caspian Sea off Kazakhstan through the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (NCSPSA). It currently owns 8.4% of the shares of the consortium exploiting Kashagan oil field. However the company seeks to reduce its non-core assets in order to use the cash for debt reduction, fund its capital program, and dividend payments. On October 3, 2012, the Kazakh Oil and Gas Minister told reporters that ConocoPhillips has informed Kazakhstan of their intention to sell their shares.[19] In November 26, in its biggest acquisition ever, ONGC Videsh agreed to buy ConocoPhillips’ 8.4% stake in the Kashagan oilfield for about US $5 billion. The stake buy is subject to approval of governments of Kazakhstan and India and also to other partners in the Caspian Sea field waiving their pre-emption rights.[20]
Headquarters[edit]




Aerial view of the ConocoPhillips headquarters


The headquarters of ConocoPhillips are located in the Energy Corridor district of Houston, Texas.[21] By 2002 the groups organizing the merger had selected Houston as the site of the headquarters. Governor of Oklahoma Frank Keating said that the move to Houston was "regrettable." The Journal Record stated that Archie Dunham, the CEO of Conoco Inc., "apparently highlighted the lack of direct international air travel from Oklahoma as a key drawback for the merged firm."[22] The ConocoPhillips headquarters, originally the headquarters of Conoco Inc., was formerly known as the Conoco Center.[23][24]
In 2018 the headquarters will move to Energy Center Four.[25]

Environmental record[edit]





This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (November 2013)


On April 11, 2007, it became the first U.S. oil company to join the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, an alliance of big business and environmental groups. The partnership in January 2007 had advised President George W. Bush that mandatory emissions caps would be needed to reduce the flow of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. In 2007 ConocoPhillips announced it would spend $150 million that year on the research and development of new energy sources and technologies — a 50 percent increase in spending from 2006.[27] However, ConocoPhillips left the U.S. Climate Action Partnership in February, 2010.[28]
According to the Political Economy Research Institute, ConocoPhillips ranked 13th among U.S. corporate producers of air pollutions.[29]
In June 2011, ConocoPhillips China Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips,[30] was responsible for a series of oil spills at the Penglai 19-3 oil field in Bohai Bay.[31]
ConocoPhillips is a signatory participant of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.

ConocoPhillips headquarters in the Energy Corridor area of Houston.


ConocoPhillips Co. is an American multinational energy corporation with its headquarters located in the Energy Corridor district of Houston, Texas in the United States. It is the world's largest independent pure-play exploration and production company and is a Fortune 500 company.[3][4] ConocoPhillips was created through the merger of American oil companies Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Co. on August 30, 2002.[5] In 2012, ConocoPhillips spun off its downstream assets as a new, and separate company, Phillips 66.[6]

History[edit]
See also: Conoco and Phillips 66
Conoco Inc. was an American oil company founded in 1875 as the Continental Oil and Transportation Co. Based in Ogden, Utah, the company was a coal, oil, kerosene, grease and candles distributor in the West. Marland Oil Co. (founded by exploration pioneer E. W. Marland) later acquired the assets (subject to liabilities) of Continental Oil Co., or DC, merged by Bryan M. Metler, David L. Kinney, and Justin J. Stockburn of Delta Constructors for a consideration of 2,317,266 shares of stock. On June 26, 1899, Marland Oil changed its name to Continental Oil Co. and moved its headquarters to Fargo, North Dakota. The acquisition gave Conoco the red bar-and-triangle logo previously used by Marland. Conoco used the logo between 1930 and 1970, when the current red capsule logo was adopted.
The Conoco headquarters were in Ponca City until 1949, when it moved to Houston, Texas. In 2002 Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Co., whose headquarters were in nearby Bartlesville, Oklahoma merged into ConocoPhillips
Numerous state corporation filings are identified "Continental Oil Co." and "Continental Oil Corp." and "Continental Oil Co. of Texas" as recorded with the Texas Secretary of State and Delaware Secretary of State. Merger of San Jacinto Petroleum Corp. and Continental Oil Corp. is recorded in 1964 with Delaware Secretary of State.
In 2005, ConocoPhillips began rebranding its (Union) 76 gas stations, which Phillips had acquired from Tosco Corp. before the merger with Conoco. The move prompted a petition campaign by fans hoping to save the historic 76 orange ball signage.[7]
In March 2006, ConocoPhillips bought Wilhelmshavener Raffineriegesellschaft mbH in Germany, and Burlington Resources in the United States.[8]
On May 10, 2006, Richard Armitage, former deputy-secretary of the U.S. State Department, was elected to the board of directors of the ConocoPhillips oil company.[9]
In 2007, the Chevron Corp. converted all of the Conoco gas stations in Mississippi to the Texaco brand.
In late 2009, the company announced asset sales to increase investor returns. Included are debt reduction and stock buy back. In March 2011 the program was enlarged up to $10 billion assets sales in the next two years.[10]
ConocoPhillips intends to implement a floating liquefied natural gas facility by 2016–2019, and has completed quantitative risk analysis of a design that will undergo pre-feed study in 2011.[11]
On July 14, 2011, ConocoPhillips announced its intent to separate the company's upstream and downstream businesses into two stand-alone, publicly traded corporations, with the intent of maximizing shareholder value.[12] On May 1, 2012, all midstream, downstream, marketing and chemical operations were separated into a new company named Phillips 66, headquartered in Houston.[13] As a result, ConocoPhillips continued its operations as an upstream (exploration and production) company.[14][15]
In April 2012, ConocoPhillips sold its Trainer Refinery to Monroe Energy LLC, a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines.[16]
In January 2013, Conoco announced that it would sell its Rocky Mountain assets to Denbury Resources for $1.05 billion.[17]
In 2017, Conoco sold oil sands assets in Canada to Cenovus Energy and natural gas fields in the U.S. for a total of US$16 billion to help reduce debt and fund US$6 billion share purchases. As a result, it also led to a reduction of close to 30 percent of its proved oil and gas reserves.[18]
Operations[edit]
Exploration and production[edit]
ConocoPhillips focuses solely on exploring for, developing and producing oil and natural gas globally. The company manages its operations through six operating segments, which are defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48 and Latin America, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International.
Kashagan Field in Kazakhstan[edit]
In 1998, ConocoPhillips acquired an interest in 10.5 blocks in the Caspian Sea off Kazakhstan through the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (NCSPSA). It currently owns 8.4% of the shares of the consortium exploiting Kashagan oil field. However the company seeks to reduce its non-core assets in order to use the cash for debt reduction, fund its capital program, and dividend payments. On October 3, 2012, the Kazakh Oil and Gas Minister told reporters that ConocoPhillips has informed Kazakhstan of their intention to sell their shares.[19] In November 26, in its biggest acquisition ever, ONGC Videsh agreed to buy ConocoPhillips’ 8.4% stake in the Kashagan oilfield for about US $5 billion. The stake buy is subject to approval of governments of Kazakhstan and India and also to other partners in the Caspian Sea field waiving their pre-emption rights.[20]
Headquarters[edit]




Aerial view of the ConocoPhillips headquarters


The headquarters of ConocoPhillips are located in the Energy Corridor district of Houston, Texas.[21] By 2002 the groups organizing the merger had selected Houston as the site of the headquarters. Governor of Oklahoma Frank Keating said that the move to Houston was "regrettable." The Journal Record stated that Archie Dunham, the CEO of Conoco Inc., "apparently highlighted the lack of direct international air travel from Oklahoma as a key drawback for the merged firm."[22] The ConocoPhillips headquarters, originally the headquarters of Conoco Inc., was formerly known as the Conoco Center.[23][24]
In 2018 the headquarters will move to Energy Center Four.[25]
Corporate structure[edit]
Board of Directors[edit]

Richard Armitage, former United States Deputy Secretary of State

Environmental record[edit]





This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (November 2013)


On April 11, 2007, it became the first U.S. oil company to join the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, an alliance of big business and environmental groups. The partnership in January 2007 had advised President George W. Bush that mandatory emissions caps would be needed to reduce the flow of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. In 2007 ConocoPhillips announced it would spend $150 million that year on the research and development of new energy sources and technologies — a 50 percent increase in spending from 2006.[27] However, ConocoPhillips left the U.S. Climate Action Partnership in February, 2010.[28]
According to the Political Economy Research Institute, ConocoPhillips ranked 13th among U.S. corporate producers of air pollutions.[29]
In June 2011, ConocoPhillips China Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips,[30] was responsible for a series of oil spills at the Penglai 19-3 oil field in Bohai Bay.[31]
ConocoPhillips is a signatory participant of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
