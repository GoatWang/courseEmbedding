Bio-Inspired Approach to Hassle-Free Mounting and AttachmentAkron Ascent Innovations



AAI is pioneering a new way to attach that takes the mess, damage, and hassle out of adhesives.Akron Ascent Innovations (AAI) was founded in 2012 to commercialize a new approach to attach objects to various surfaces.  For lack of a better word, we call it a "dry adhesive," but it's not like any adhesive you've ever seen.  It isn't sticky, but it can secure sheets, films, pictures, cards, packages, photos, frames, and even high capacity hooks to walls and other surfaces without damage.  Even better, it can be repositioned and often reused, depending on the application, which gives a world of new opportunities not possible with conventional adhesives.







BIG GRIP - NO STICKAdhesive technology hasn't changed much in the past few thousand years - the stronger the stick, the better the glue, and the more pain involved when it comes time to remove it.







Damage freeAAI's repositionable and cleanly removable dry adhesives are the perfect solution for imperfect and indecisive decorators.







Dry AdhesiveAAI is pioneering a dry adhesive technology based on solid nanofibers that conform intimately to surfaces.  The strength is remarkable, but without the stick and hassle of conventional adhesives.

At AAI, we are interested in the future of adhesives. We were founded in 2012 with the mission of developing a revolutionary dry adhesive that we have affectionately named A’Qat™ (pronounced “A Cat”). This material belongs to a new class of super-adhesives called "dry adhesives" that are inspired by nature's greatest crawler, the gecko. The advantage of dry adhesives is that they can be designed to be extremely strong in one direction (a thumbnail size piece of A’Qat™ can hold over 100 pounds), but can still be easily removed, repositioned, and reused, all without damaging your surface.

The ability to predict mesoscale structure based on the various attributes of nanoparticles, particularly particle size, size distribution, aspect ratio, and chemical functionality, is necessary to understand and potentially tailor the physical response of multi-functional materials.  Recently, molecular-scale modeling approaches have indicated that simple estimates of particle shape and local order in a fluid are sufficient to predict various categories of structural order for many convex polyhedral [Damasceno Science 2012; 337 (6093):453-7].  However, these discontinuous nano-scale modeling approaches implicitly assume local constitutive relationships that may introduce considerable error if interfacial interactions or non-local coupling between mechanical fields are present.  Extensive experimental investigations have been attempted, but little detail on the fundamental physics of the nanoparticles is possible because of challenges in achieving reproducible properties of an ensemble of individual nanoparticles.

Part 4 of 4 of the epic nanoscale phenomena mini-series, composed during multi-hour travel delays over the holidays... Carbon nanotubes are very exciting materials that are very challenging to use because they really like to group together rather than spreading out.  This is because interactions between particles also increase with surface area, which poses a big challenge (this is also part of the reason why electrospun nanofibers can stay together without a binder when used as a dry adhesive!).  The challenge is how to separate the tubes without changing their properties too much.

In the field of polymer nanocomposites, there is a great deal of interest in nanoparticles because they can directly interact and influence the behavior of individual polymer chains.  The ease of mobility of a polymer chain greatly influences its bulk properties.  Generally, we are forced to change the entire structure of the polymer in order to modify something like its use temperature or mechanical properties.  Using nanoparticles, we can completely change the behavior of a conventional polymer that is easier to process or prepare that so-called "engineering plastics."

Nanomaterials are so finely divided that they exhibit properties that are intermediate between the macro-scale behavior we are accustomed to, and true molecular-scale behavior.  They may show unique  properties related to changes in  electrical, optical, mechanical, and thermal phenomena (some examples to follow), or may be even more exotic, such as quantum confinement, where the size of a particle is so small that we are altering the configuration and interactions of its atoms and electrons.

Nanoscale phenomena is as nice a place as any to begin a series of non-technical technical articles.  After all, it has all the trimmings of remarkable potential, fertile innovation opportunities, challenges in commercialization, and non-intuitive barriers to entry, each deserving of its own consideration.  You, me, and everything we generally think of as reality exist on the macroscale.  It’s the arena where our senses make sense, where we live our lives and where we can have some intuitive understanding of the world around us.  To put it a bit more technically, it’s the arena where things are continuous.  Included here are 3 relatively short articles on nanoscale phenomena, which will eventually wrap around to the world of nanofibers, electrospinning, and adhesion that all contribute to the nexus that is Akron Ascent.

AAI is the first company to use electrospinning to produce dry adhesives, which offers the potential for solvent-free, environmentally friendly adhesives that are strong when you need them, but can be easily removed from surfaces without leaving behind a residue or causing damage.produce nanofibers, can be used to produce dry adhesives.  Electrospinning is a versatile technique to fabricate nanofibers with finely controlled nanostructures that are useful for a range of properties, including adhesives.  Most importantly, electrospinning offers a scalable route to control these structures with a resolution that can typically only be achieved with much more time consuming, batch processes such as lithography.

AAI’s dry adhesive technology is based on the principle of contact splitting, which is a robust and reversible (elastic) mechanism of adhesion commonly exploited by animals such as flies, beetles, spiders, and the most prolific climber of all, the gecko.  All surfaces have some attractive force between them arising from weak, inter-molecular forces known as van der Waals (vdW) forces.  This force decreases linearly with the size of the contact, but the resulting stress (force divided by area), increases.  As a result, a surface made up on a large number of small contact sites will have an immensely larger interaction with a target surface than a smooth one.

CLEVELAND, Ohio - The Ohio Third Frontier Commission on Wednesday approved $12.5 million to support startups, commercialize technologies, and help companies develop innovative products. Two-thirds of the money, or more than $8.4 million, was awarded to The University of Akron, the Cleveland Clinic and four other Northeast Ohio businesses and research entities.
Other recipients statewide were: Cincinnati Children's Hospital, The Ohio State University, OsteoNovus Inc., Rekovo LLC, and Ohio University.
"Taking ideas and getting them to the marketplace strengthens Ohio's technology economy," David Goodman, director of the Ohio Development Services Agency and chair of the Ohio Third Frontier Commission, said in a written statement. "In addition, moving the state's companies to the next level with new products will keep them competitive, ensuring jobs for Ohio's future."
Six Northeast Ohio entities won Ohio Third Frontier Technology Validation and Start-Up Awards, which provides grants in two phases: first, when a company demonstrates that a technology can be commercialized, via activities such as testing or prototyping; and second, when Ohio startups license and ultimately commercialize technology developed at Ohio higher education or nonprofit research institutions.
-- Akron Ascent Innovations LLC was awarded $100,000 to commercialize a dry, reusable adhesive that can be removed easily without damaging surfaces or leaving a sticky residue.
-- The Cleveland Clinic was awarded $50,000 to validate a rapid eye-tracking method for detecting social attention deficits to help identify individuals at risk of Autism Spectrum Disorders and track treatment progress.
-- iRxReminder LLC of Cleveland was awarded $100,000 to commercialize a pill-dispensing device that reminds patients to take their medication and tracks their usage.
-- Kent State University was awarded two $50,000 grants, for technology to improve the energy efficiency of certain types of LCDs and for new thin film materials to improve the quality of OLED displays.
-- Miach Medical Innovation, Inc. of Shaker Heights was awarded $100,000 to prototype and test a feeding tube with embedded sensors that can be inserted more accurately and monitored more closely.
-- The University of Akron was awarded five $50,000 grants for: a new low-cost, reliable technology for hybrid car engines; imaging goggles to make cancer surgeries less expensive; new technology to prevent cell phone screens from cracking; a 3D-printed socket to reduce the discomfort of prosthetics; and software for faster graphics processing in computers.
In addition, the Cleveland Clinic and The University of Akron also won sizeable Ohio Third Frontier Innovation Platform Awards, which provides grants to link research at Ohio's colleges, universities and nonprofit research institutions to the needs of Ohio companies.
-- The Cleveland Clinic was awarded $2,999,936 in collaboration with Renovo Biosciences, Renovo Neural, Juventas Therapeutics, ImageIQ and ChanTest, for a project to develop a rodent imaging center at the Cleveland Clinic to better understand human diseases. 
-- The University of Akron was awarded $3 million in collaboration with PolyOne, Lubrizol, SNS NanoFiber, Viscus Biologics and Austen BioInnovation Institute in Akron, for a project that will develop numerous products including novel polymers, X-ray shielding materials, protective coatings for medical devices and catheters, and antimicrobial materials for wound healing.
-- The University of Akron was also awarded $1,744,192 in collaboration with Exacter, Inc. and Jacco & Associates, for a project to develop a smart sensor platform for mitigating electrical grid outages, and an HVAC sensor system to regulate airflow and improve system efficiency.
