Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market volatili ty, the Fund's current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. The Fund's performance at market price will differ from its results at NAV. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value or market  price (as applicable) with all distributions reinvested and includes management fees and other expenses. Until the reinvestment of Fund distributions is completed, returns are calculated using the lower of the net asset value or market price of the shar es on the distribution ex date.  Once the reinvestment is complete, returns are calculated using the average reinvestment price.  Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative.

This data reflects distributions paid on Fund shares held for the full calendar year and is not predictive of the tax character of current or future distributions.  Fund shareholders should refer to the individual IRS Form 1099-DIVs provided to them shor tly after each year-end to determine the appropriate federal income tax treatment of the distributions they receive.  Eaton Vance is not responsible for any errors in tax reporting that may result from using the above data. Exempt-interest dividends are  not subject to regular federal income tax. Exempt-interest dividends derived from specified private activity bonds are subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT). Non-qualified ordinary dividends are subject to federal income tax at ordinary rates. Cap ital gains distributions are taxable at long-term capital gain rates. Nondividend distributions, also known as return of capital distributions, are not subject to current federal income tax. Instead, the tax cost basis of each shareholder receiving a ret urn of capital distribution is reduced by the amount of the distribution.

 Fact SheetJun 30, 2017







The Fund
This offering provides exposure to the New Jersey municipal bond market, seeking to provide Fund shareholders with current income exempt from regular federal income tax and state personal income tax. Fund investments span municipal sectors and credit tie rs, with allocations directed by manager, Adam Weigold, since 2010.



The Approach
The Fund's active management draws upon the expertise of Eaton Vance's municipal bond team, among America's largest and most experienced municipal bond managers. The investment team applies Eaton Vance's credit research process, while implementing a rela tive-value trading approach to municipal investing.



The Features
Eaton Vance's decades of municipal market experience informs the Fund's strategy. Invests in longer-maturity bonds than many peers, which may provide higher levels of tax-exempt income1 and greater price volatility. Relative-value trading may add to  performance, while ongoing credit monitoring helps mitigate risk.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market vola tility, the Fund’s current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value (NAV) with all distributions reinvested. Returns for other classes of share s offered by the Fund are different. Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative. Fund performance during certain periods reflects the strong bond market performance and/or the strong performance of bonds held during those periods. This perf ormance is not typical and may not be repeated. Max Sales Charge: 4.75%.

Portfolio Management




 
Adam A. Weigold, CFA


Managed Fund since 2010






The information included herein does not reflect securities deemed to be held by the Fund pursuant to financial accounting standard 140 (FAS 140).


Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding.


About Risk: 
An imbalance in supply and demand in the municipal market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. There generally is limited public information  about municipal issuers. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. Investments in income securities may be affected by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of  principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer's ability to make principal and interest payments. Because the Fund may invest significantly in a particular state, the Fund sh are value may fluctuate more than a fund with less exposure to such state. Investments rated below investment grade (typically referred to as "junk") are generally subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity than higher-rated investments. Derivat ive instruments can be used to take both long and short positions, be highly volatile, result in economic leverage (which can increase both the risk and return potential of the Fund), and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying instrumen t on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty, correlation and liquidity risk. If a counterparty is unable to honor its commitments, the value of Fund shares may decline and/or the Fund could experience delays in the return of collateral or ot her assets held by the counterparty. A nondiversified fund may be subject to greater risk by investing in a smaller number of investments than a diversified fund. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fu nd may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.



1. A portion of the Fund's distributions generally will be subject to alternative minimum tax.
2. Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index is an unmanaged index of municipal bonds traded in the U.S. Unless otherwise stated, index returns do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales charges, commissions, expenses, taxes or leverage, as applicable.  It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Historical performance of the index illustrates market trends and does not represent the past or future performance of the fund.
3. Total annual operating expense ratios are as stated in the Fund's most recent prospectus. Net expense ratio is not a result of a fee waiver or expense reimbursement. Net expense ratio excludes interest expense relating to the Fund's liability with respec t to floating rate notes held by third parties in conjunction with residual interest bond transactions by the Fund. The Fund also records offsetting interest income in an amount equal to this expense relating to the municipal obligations underlying such  transactions and, as a result, net asset value and performance have not been affected by this expense.
4. Percent of total net assets.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.

About Risk: 
An imbalance in supply and demand in the municipal market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. There generally is limited public information  about municipal issuers. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. Investments in income securities may be affected by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of  principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer's ability to make principal and interest payments. Because the Fund may invest significantly in a particular state, the Fund sh are value may fluctuate more than a fund with less exposure to such state. Investments rated below investment grade (typically referred to as "junk") are generally subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity than higher-rated investments. Derivat ive instruments can be used to take both long and short positions, be highly volatile, result in economic leverage (which can increase both the risk and return potential of the Fund), and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying instrumen t on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty, correlation and liquidity risk. If a counterparty is unable to honor its commitments, the value of Fund shares may decline and/or the Fund could experience delays in the return of collateral or ot her assets held by the counterparty. A nondiversified fund may be subject to greater risk by investing in a smaller number of investments than a diversified fund. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fu nd may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.



2. Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index is an unmanaged index of municipal bonds traded in the U.S. Unless otherwise stated, index returns do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales charges, commissions, expenses, taxes or leverage, as applicable.  It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Historical performance of the index illustrates market trends and does not represent the past or future performance of the fund.
3. Total annual operating expense ratios are as stated in the Fund's most recent prospectus. Net expense ratio is not a result of a fee waiver or expense reimbursement. Net expense ratio excludes interest expense relating to the Fund's liability with respec t to floating rate notes held by third parties in conjunction with residual interest bond transactions by the Fund. The Fund also records offsetting interest income in an amount equal to this expense relating to the municipal obligations underlying such  transactions and, as a result, net asset value and performance have not been affected by this expense.
6. The Morningstar Muni New Jersey Category includes funds that invest at least 80% of its assets in state and local government bonds free from both federal and New Jersey state taxes.
7. SEC 30-day yield is a standardized measure based on the estimated yield to maturity of a fund's investments over a 30-day period and is based on the maximum offer price at the date specified. The SEC 30-day yield is not based on the distributions made by  the fund, which may differ. Distribution Rate at NAV is calculated by dividing the last distribution paid per share (annualized) by NAV. For National Municipal Funds, taxable-equivalent performance is calculated using a 43.4% tax rate (equals maximum in dividual federal tax rate adjusted for the Medicare surtax). For Single-State Municipal Funds, taxable-equivalent performance also reflect maximum effective individual state income tax rates. Local income taxes that may apply are not considered. The Fund 's monthly distribution may be comprised of ordinary income, net realized capital gains and returns of capital.
8. Distribution Rate at NAV and Market Price is calculated by dividing the last distribution paid per share (annualized) by NAV or market price, respectively. For National Municipal Funds, Taxable-Equivalent Distribution Rate at NAV and Market Price is calc ulated using a 43.4% tax rate (equals maximum individual federal tax rate adjusted for the Medicare surtax). For Single-State Municipal Funds, Taxable-Equivalent Distribution Rates also reflect maximum effective individual state income tax rates. Local i ncome taxes that may apply are not considered.
9. The Fund's distributions may be comprised of tax-exempt income, ordinary income, net realized capital gains and return of capital. The Fund will determine the tax characteristics of all Fund distributions after the end of the calendar year and will provi de shareholders such information at that time. Please consult your tax advisor for further information.

Ratings are based on Moody's, S&P or Fitch, as applicable. If securities are rated differently by the ratings agencies, the higher rating is applied. Ratings, which are subject to change, apply to the creditworthiness of the issuers of the underlying sec urities and not to the Fund or its shares. Credit ratings measure the quality of a bond based on the issuer's creditworthiness, with ratings ranging from AAA, being the highest, to D, being the lowest based on S&P's measures. Ratings of BBB or higher by  S&P or Fitch (Baa or higher by Moody's) are considered to be investment-grade quality. Credit ratings are based largely on the ratings agency's analysis at the time of rating. The rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection  of the issuer's current financial condition and does not necessarily reflect its assessment of the volatility of a security's market value or of the liquidity of an investment in the security. Holdings designated as "Not Rated" are not rated by the nati onal ratings agencies stated above.
