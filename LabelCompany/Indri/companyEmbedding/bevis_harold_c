Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Xerium Technologies 2016 Third Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. At the request of Xerium Technologies, this conference call will be Webcast and recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference call over to Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Cliff Pietrafitta.
Clifford Pietrafitta
Thank you, [indiscernible], and good afternoon everyone. I would like to remind everyone to please refer to the press release regarding our financial results for the third quarter 2016 filed on October 27, 2016 and our corresponding 10-Q with particular reference to the Safe Harbor note contained in the text of the press release about our forward-looking statements and the use of certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted EBITDA and the associated reconciliation of such measures to GAAP under Regulation G.
Those same statements also apply to our remarks on this conference call. Our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those described in the press release and in our SEC filings. For a full discussion, please refer to our earnings release as well as our SEC filings, including our June 30, 2016 10-Q and our December 31, 2015 10-K.
Now, I will turn over the call to Harold Bevis, our President and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide opening remarks. Harold?
Harold C. Bevis
Thank you, Cliff, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us this afternoon to review Xerium's third quarter 2016 results. At this time, I would like to refer you to the business update slide deck that was posted to our Web-site for this call.
Starting on Slide 3, in the third quarter we had sales of $119.2 million, up approximately 1% on a constant currency basis. By segment, our rolls and service sales were up 6.5%, primarily due to incremental sales from the Company's acquisition of Spencer Johnston which was completed in the second quarter. In the machine clothing business, sales declined 2% compared to the prior year.
Our repositioning projects have generated a large volume of new products that are now in production or existing products which are being manufactured at new locations. This has resulted in some production inefficiencies as our team debottlenecks new production, which we expect to resolve in 2017. By contrast, the demand side of the equation speaks to the success of our repositioning, as highlighted by the growth in our backlog compared to the prior year.
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $22.9 million or 19.2% of sales, compared to $28.3 million or 24% of sales for the prior year. Before getting into the details, it's important to put the comparable in context as the year-over-year change included a $3 million negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates. On an apples-to-apples basis, our operating EBITDA margin was down approximately $2.4 million to $25.9 million compared to the prior year.
The main issues for the decline in adjusted EBITDA are production problems in two of the Company's machine clothing plants where they have both missed output and have margin compression in the machine clothing business, particularly in Latin America. We expect similar conditions in Q4, and therefore, we are revising our full-year adjusted EBITDA outlook to be approximately $100 million. We believe these conditions will be temporary and we will discuss them further.

As we've previously reported, we closed on the refinancing of all of the Company's outstanding debt in the third quarter. This was an important milestone for our Company and allows sufficient time for us to execute our deleveraging plan. This action was additive to our debt in the quarter based on the fees associated with the refinancing, and based upon our current plan, this marks the peak of our leverage through this investment cycle associated with the repositioning of the Company.
Turning to cash flow, we have now reported our third consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow following the completion of our repositioning investments over the prior couple of years. In the quarter, free cash flow was $1.2 million, which compares to $2.3 million usage of cash last year. Notably, higher free cash flow was achieved just by a $4 million unfavorable impact from a shift in interest payment timing relating to our refinancing. Year-to-date, we've generated $12.4 million of free cash flow.
Moving to Slide 4, in the third quarter we continued to implement the Company's repositioning plan. As I previously noted, our accelerated CapEx cycle is now complete and we are moving to the execution and ramp-up phase of our strategic plan. This includes more than $50 million of growth capacity which we have installed globally, combined with a total of $49 million in product introductions, $14 million of which were in field trial in the third quarter of 2016.
With respect to our cost reduction programs, our team has continued to work diligently to identify opportunities to improve our margin profile, and in the third quarter we realized $5.4 million of gross cost takeout. These efforts are most apparent on the SG&A line for us, which delivered a 180 basis point reduction versus prior year.
Additionally, we have implemented the Lean Six Sigma program at all 28 plants globally. During the second year of the program, projects have been aimed at waste reduction, lead time reduction and quality improvement. Becoming operationally leaner and efficient has been a goal of ours and through Lean Six Sigma we look to further enhance improvements we've made already.
The combination of lower capital spending, the reduction of costs, the benefits of a repositioned company in the right markets with right products has led to a sharp improvement in our cash flow compared to prior year. We continue to expect a total of $25 million to $35 million of free cash flow for this year. And consistent with our prior communications, we expect to continue to generate free cash flow and pay down debt for the foreseeable future and it is the top priority, our top priority to reduce our leverage back to normal levels.
Turning to backlog on Page 5, our backlog has improved over the past year. This improvement is the direct result of the success of our repositioning projects and wins from our new products. We have maintained our focus where the market is strongest, both geographically and by end market, and by end market this includes a focus on markets which are growing which include pulp, boxboard, containerboard and tissue. This market growth is driven by a secular shift in consumer behavior away from brick-and-mortar to click shopping, and we are happy to report that we have been successful in penetrating these markets.
Moving to our revised expectations, which is also detailed in our press release, we have reduced our full-year adjusted EBITDA expectation to approximately $100 million from $110 million at the prior midpoint. Looking at Slide 6, the main driver of our revised guidance is due to gross margin issues, which I would like to cover.
Our sales, SG&A and free cash flow are fine. Our gross margins have been compressed. And the main problems are relating to production problems at two of our plants and margin compression in machine clothing business, particularly in Brazil. We view these issues as temporary and we are already underway with correcting our production problems.

With respect to the impact of currency, we are shifting our production appropriately to line up to our lowest cost facilities with as much volume as possible in order to offset currency headwinds. While we expect these actions to show a meaningful improvement to our EBITDA margins, we do expect it to take a few quarters to fully implement.
Aside from these issues we are working to address, our sales are on plan, our cost out programs continue to progress on plan, and in addition we are also able to constantly hold our free cash flow guidance despite lower operating EBITDA through the implementation of tight working capital management and tight capital spending management.
As we turn to close out 2016, we are in an exciting and challenging time for our Company. Our repositioning projects are largely complete and our new products are providing a meaningful offset to declining rates and our backlog is strengthening. Cash flow has been positive all year, and as a result of our refinancing, we have sufficient runway ahead of us to execute our new leveraging plans. We expect Q4 to be similar to Q3 with the gross margin compression issues covered earlier. However, we do expect these results to be significantly better than Q4 of 2015.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Cliff for a closer look at the numbers.
Clifford Pietrafitta
Thank you, Harold. Moving to our financials on Slide 7, revenue in the third quarter of 2016 was $119.2 million, compared with the prior quarter of $117.7 million. On a constant currency basis, sales were up 0.9% compared to the third quarter of 2015.
Higher sales during the period reflected a 7.3% year-over-year increase in the Company's roll covers segment, mainly attributable to the recent acquisition of Spencer Johnston, partially offset by a 3% decrease in machine clothing on a constant currency basis. The decline in machine clothing was primarily due to temporary production output issues in North America which the Company is in the process of addressing.
By division, our machine clothing segment net sales decreased 3% on a constant currency basis to $70.3 million in the third quarter of 2016, compared to $72.5 million in the third quarter of 2015. The decline was mostly from decreased volume in North America [indiscernible]. Machine clothing gross margin, excluding plant startup costs, was 38.6% in Q3 2016 compared to 42.9% in Q3 2015. The decline in gross profit margin reflects higher Brazilian cost and inflation, unfavorable product mix and margin compression in certain regions.
Moving to our rolls segment, net sales for the third quarter of 2016 increased 7.3% at constant currency coming in at $48.2 million compared with the prior year level of $45.2 million. Higher rolls sales were the result of our acquisition of Spencer Johnston. Rolls gross margin, excluding startup costs, in the third quarter of 2016 was 35.2% compared to third quarter of 2015 gross margin of 38.1%. The decline was primarily due to higher Brazilian cost and inflation and unfavorable product mix.
Moving back to our consolidated results, third quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA was $25.9 million before giving effect to $3 million of negative foreign exchange impacts compared with the third quarter of 2015 adjusted EBITDA of $28.3 million. As previously mentioned, our EBITDA was held down by lower gross margin rates due to the issues previously discussed, but was partially offset by lower SG&A cost driven by our cost down programs.
Cash taxes were $4.9 million in Q3 2016. For the full year 2016, we expect that cash taxes will be approximately $14 million. Cash taxes are primarily impacted by income the Company earns in tax paying jurisdictions relative to income it earns in non-tax-paying jurisdictions, primarily the United States.

On a GAAP basis, third quarter 2016 loss per share was $0.83 compared to third quarter 2015 earnings per share of $0.06. Non-GAAP third quarter 2016 basic earnings per share was $0.05 per share, compared to third quarter non-GAAP 2015 basic earnings per share of $0.30.
Free cash flow was $1.2 million in the quarter, compared to third quarter 2015 free cash flow of negative $2.3 million. The increase is primarily the result of our reduced capital expenditures and includes a $4 million unfavorable impact from the refinancing. As we have stated before, it is our priority to delever and use available cash to pay down debt.
Our net debt at the end of the third quarter of 2016 was $522.9 million. The increase in debt from the third quarter of 2015 is primarily due to the acquisition of Spencer Johnston and costs associated with our debt refinancing completed during this third quarter. Our net debt leverage ratio on a pro forma basis is 5.2x after factoring in the impact of the Spencer Johnston acquisition.
Turning to Slide 8, I'd like to review the big picture. Compared to prior year, Brazil economic impacts were the biggest issue the Company has faced this year, negatively impacting our 2016 year-to-date adjusted EBITDA by approximately $6 million. Secondly, as previously mentioned, we have experienced some production issues which have impacted our gross margins and are in the process of being corrected. Next, we have been actively introducing new products to the market which will allow us to penetrate new sales areas and contribute to profitability in the future.
In summary, we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $100 million assuming our current sales, production and currency outlook. We continue to expect 2016 free cash flow to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million.
I will now turn the call back over to Harold for final comments before we take your questions.
Harold C. Bevis
Thank you, Cliff. As we assess our progress, we're excited to be fully repositioning Xerium to address the changed market, and while our metrics are not uniformly positive, we are beginning to see the benefits of our restructuring in the underlying cash generating power of our business. We are gaining traction with new products and in new geographies and we are confident of our ability to generate strong returns for our shareholders. I'd like to thank our shareholders and our bondholders for their ongoing support and our employees for their dedication to providing world-class products and services to our customers.
Operator, with that, I'd like to open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Anthony Young. Your line is open.
Anthony Young
Just to understand the cost side a little bit better, in the bold points you guys talked about unfavorable currency impact of $3 million, I mean is that currency impact a translation impact like one time in the quarter or is your cost structure sort of higher now than probably in the past?
Harold C. Bevis
Anthony, $2 million of the $3 million relates to an FX gain that was in the third quarter of 2015, which was not present in 2016. The rest of that, the other $1 million relates to combination translation transaction currency effects that we experienced during the quarter.
Anthony Young
Okay, that's helpful. And then on the CapEx, you have CapEx at $3.6 million, or your GAAP CapEx for the quarter $3.6 million, are you guys really, is this are you at a maintenance level or are you below a maintenance level or do you think this is sustainable?
Harold C. Bevis
Our maintenance level is about $6 million a year and we're spending about $16 million. So we're doing $10 million of discretionary projects, both on cost out and on repositioning. Most of it is on repositioning. So we are still moving assets to emerging countries. And expanding capacity – one of our problems, as I mentioned, is that we are bottlenecked a little bit on some of our successful new product ramp-ups and we've had to install new capacity to keep up and bring other plants into the production of those products. So, most of the discretionary spending is around the commercial repositioning and we're way above maintenance level. That's just $6 million.

Anthony Young
Okay. And just to circle back on the Brazil servicing, I mean was it a new – what were some of the problems that you were having there I guess as far – the two facilities you said you were having problems, I think they were in Brazil, what are some of the problems you are having there specifically and was there a workforce problem or…?
Harold C. Bevis
There's two things. On the production problems that we're having, they are at two plants in North America, and it is our two machine clothing plants in North America. We only have two, Starkville, Mississippi and Kentville, Nova Scotia, Canada. Both of them are very backed up with long lead times. And we had irregular wins, so the wins have been clogged up under certain machines and we weren't ready for that, and we now have redistributed the production to some other global plants as well as expanding our capacity and ability to get further output from those plants. So the plant issues were associated with holding our sales back in North America really because we've had a lot of new wins in tissue and in board and packaging and we were clogged up in the plants.
The margin compression issue, which is Brazil, is two-fold. It is inflation being much higher than we expected. The inflation rates this year, which were statutory, have come in around 10% and most of our plants settled in this quarter and the reais has been appreciating. So we have a double-whammy. The market is in sales dollars is a U.S. sales dollar market and our costs are in reais, and so we've had our cost going up and then translation in the U.S. dollars going down. And so it showed up on the COGS line because our SG&A, we called in check there and showed progress on the SG&A line.
And so what Brazil has gone through this year has cost us $6 million year-over-year. We didn't foresee that. We saw a portion of it in the last quarter and we now are [convinced] [ph] that this is a steady-state situation and we've embedded it into our outlook. So, we're expecting that one to hang around for a few quarters. We've looked at the inflation outlooks and the currency outlooks. There is a better feeling now that they have [indiscernible] President of Brazil, but we view this as being gradual. So, that is two separate issues that have impacted us there, Anthony.
Anthony Young
Okay. Right now this is helpful. I appreciate the additional color on the situation. Thanks, guys.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of John Rolfe from Argand Capital. Your line is open.
John Rolfe
You mentioned in Slide 7 that you're committed to doing about $25 million of free cash flow [indiscernible].
Harold C. Bevis
Yes.
John Rolfe
Can you kind of give us the components of that from EBITDA, interest expense, cash taxes and CapEx I guess [indiscernible]?
Harold C. Bevis
I can tell you that our operating discipline here is to not spend money until we have the money. So we first monitor our operating cash inflows from the business, and we're maintaining a very high level of buffer, and then we decide the pace at which we're going to do our investments. And so, we're able to tightly shift our free cash flow guidance. With regards to the components of cash inflow and outflow, Cliff, do you want to walk through that?
Clifford Pietrafitta
Sure. John, we just did the refi of the bond, so we got about $48 million interest not going forward with the new debt structure. Our capital expenditures this year were probably about $16 million and our cash taxes as we mentioned in the press release about $14 million. So if you add that up, about $78 million, we are running about $100 million, it will be in the low $100 million going forward. So, basically we're talking about the $25 million is really the difference between those rough members I just gave you.

John Rolfe
Okay. So is it fair to assume though, I mean going forward I would assume that you guys would hope to be growing that EBITDA number modestly kind of year-over-year, and at the same time, I would assume that we should see that interest expense start to creep down as you pay off some debt. Are those both reasonable assumptions?
Harold C. Bevis
Yes, John, this is Harold. We're not going to give 2017 EBITDA guidance right now, but we do see our margin compression issues as being temporary. They are definitely holding back our EBITDA right now. So, yes, we do see an improvement in that dynamic and we see it over the next couple of quarters. But with regards to the production issues, they are already underway as a matter of fact. So, we do see strengthening in our volumes as our new products take hold and we are working to maintain good lead times as we enter and penetrate into these new markets.
So we do see increasing volumes and we do see our current margin issues subsiding and our rolls business is doing quite well. The Spencer Johnston pick-up has really helped us in a lot of specialty services and they are mainly not in paper, and so they are really helping our diversification efforts. So, we do see a rising EBITDA but we're not going to give numbers regarding 2017 at this moment in time.
John Rolfe
Understood. I was just trying to understand kind of directionally, as we look out over that four year period, so you've talked a little about EBITDA and I assume that you're still committed to paying down debt, so we should see that interest expense coming down over time as well, is that a right assumption?
Harold C. Bevis
That's right.
John Rolfe
Okay.
Harold C. Bevis
Yes, you're correct. And if and when the EBITDA correction happens and we have higher free cash flow, we will definitely strongly consider paying down more debt than that. But right now, our model is conservative and we're just basing our outlook on these numbers that we've shared with you today.
Operator
There are no further audio questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Harold Bevis.
Harold C. Bevis
Thank you very much for calling in. We appreciate it and we look forward to speaking with you in the next call. We are very happy with the repositioning efforts that are underway at the Company, we're working on these temporary margin issues that have held back our EBITDA for the moment, and we look forward to reporting our progress in the next call together. Thank you.
Operator
