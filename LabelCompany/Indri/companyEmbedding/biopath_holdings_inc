BP1002















Prexigebersen
BP1002








BP1002 (Liposomal Bcl2) for Follicular Lymphoma and other forms of Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma
Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common form of low grade or slow-growing non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). There are 56,000 new cases of NHL per year, with approximately 30 percent of these follicular lymphoma and approximately 60% being the more aggressive diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) type. Treatments of varying efficacy exist for FL and DLBCL; however, due to the wide variety of subtypes of this disease, a frontline approach is lacking. FL can arise anywhere in the body within the germinal centers of the lymph nodes. Between 40 to 80 percent of patients will respond to initial therapy, but virtually all will relapse. Ten percent of the relapsed patients will not respond to treatment at all (refractory).
BP1002 (Liposomal Bcl2) is a neutral-charge, liposome-incorporated antisense drug designed to inhibit protein synthesis of Bcl2, a protein involved in regulating programmed cell death. Bcl2 is overexpressed in more than 90 percent of FL and in a wide variety of solid tumors. Amplified expression of Bcl2 protein in FL is due to the defining genetic hallmark of the disease, the chromosomal translocation t(14;18), which moves the Bcl2 gene from chromosome 18 into the heavy chain immunoglobin locus on chromosome 14.  Overexpression of Bcl2 stops affected cells from being killed by chemotherapy. We believe that BP1002 overcomes the failures of previous attempts at inhibiting Bcl2 by specifically interrupting the protein expression of one protein and not a family of necessary proteins and does so without inherent toxicity. With BP1002, more drug substance can reach the circulating lymphocytes so that the cancer cells can be treated with a therapeutically relevant dose.  We believe BP1002 provides a new tool for cancer treatment for not just lymphomas, but also many cancers for which Bcl2 expression is preventing cell death. The introduction of a new, non-toxic, and specific Bcl2 inhibitor could be a major advance in cancer therapeutics.
Bio-Path is preparing to submit an IND for BP1002 and is planning to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial for lymphoma in 2017

					Full Description



Bio-Path Holdings, Inc. is a clinical and preclinical stage oncology focused antisense drug development company. The Company utilizes a technology that achieves systemic delivery for target specific protein inhibition for any gene product that is over-expressed in disease. The Company's drug delivery and antisense technology, called DNAbilize, is a platform that uses P-ethoxy, which is a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) backbone modification that is intended to protect the DNA from destruction by the body's enzymes when circulating in vivo, incorporated inside of a neutral charged lipid bilayer. In vivo, the DNAbilize delivered antisense drug substances are systemically distributed across the body to allow for reduction or elimination of proteins in blood diseases and solid organs. Using DNAbilize as a platform for drug manufacturing, the Company has approximately two antisense drug candidates in development to treat a total of over five different disease indications.The Company's lead drug candidate, Liposomal Grb2 (BP1001), targets the protein Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2). BP1001 is in Phase II clinical trials for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and for blast phase and accelerated phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). BP1001 is also in preclinical studies for solid tumors, including triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). The Company has also completed Phase I clinical trials for BP1001 for indications for Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). The Company's other liposome delivered antisense drug candidate, Liposomal Bcl2 (BP1002), targets the protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2). BP1002 is in preparation for an Investigational New Drug (IND) application. BP1002 is intended to target the lymphoma and certain solid tumor markets. Clinical targets for BP1002 include lymphoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer and leukemia.

The Company utilizes a technology that achieves systemic delivery for target specific protein inhibition for any gene product that is over-expressed in disease.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Company Description (as filed with the SEC)
We are a clinical and preclinical stage oncology focused antisense drug
development company utilizing a novel technology that achieves systemic delivery
for target specific protein inhibition for any gene product that is
over-expressed in disease. Our drug delivery and antisense technology, called
DNAbilize(TM), is a platform that uses P-ethoxy, which is a deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) backbone modification that is intended to protect the DNA from destruction
by the body's enzymes when circulating in vivo, incorporated inside of a neutral
charged lipid bilayer. We believe this combination allows for high efficiency
loading of antisense DNA into non-toxic, cell-membrane-like structures for
delivery of the antisense drug substance into cells. In vivo, the DNAbilize(TM)
delivered antisense drug substances are systemically distributed throughout the
body to allow for reduction or elimination of proteins in blood diseases and
solid tumors.  ... More ...
