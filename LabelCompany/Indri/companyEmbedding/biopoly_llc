Femoral condyle partial resurfacing device made from a microcomposite of Hyaluronic Acid and UHMWPE. Learn More





 The BioPoly® Advantage  
    Current surgical treatments for painful, debilitating articular cartilage defects lie between two extremes: biological attempts (microfracture, OATS, ACI) and artificial replacement (total or partial joint arthroplasty). Unfortunately, many patients are not good candidates for the biological techniques (or they have had a failed treatment) but they may not yet be ready for an invasive artificial joint.  
    The BioPoly® ReSurfacing devices provide a treatment option between these extremes. Utilizing a patented material that is self lubricating for improved wear properties (via a biological enhancement with Hyaluronic Acid) the BioPoly® RS devices are uniquely designed to replace only the damaged cartilage. Therefore, patients can quickly recover and return to pain-free, active lifestyles.

BioPoly™

Professor develops innovative implant material to improve quality of life for patients with joint pain
Schwartz Biomedical, LLC of Fort Wayne, Indiana has received a $1.3 Million, 2 year grant from the Indiana 21st Century Research and Technology Fund to investigate a novel material for use in human total joint replacements. Schwartz Biomedical has been named the principal investigator on this project and is partnering with Colorado State University (Fort Collins, Colorado), DePuy Orthopaedics (Warsaw, Indiana) and the Northeast Indiana Innovation Center (Fort Wayne, Indiana) to develop market and commercialize a new bearing material.

Because of today’s active life style, total joint replacements are needed in younger and younger patients. Doctors are reluctant to perform joint replacement surgeries on these younger patients due to the limited life of some of the implant materials. In addition, much of the aging population remain active well into their latter stages of life; and even an older, active patient may be faced with the revision of their artificial joint due to the "wearing out" of the implant material. In the case of many artificial total joints, the plastic or polymer bearing component of the implant will experience wear and can be the limiting factor in the life of the total joint. Joint surface replacements, a somewhat less invasive surgery and sometimes a first step prior to total joint surgery, have experienced mixed clinical success due in part, to the poor lubrication properties of the current bearing materials. Schwartz Biomedical, LLC has licensed the technology from Colorado State University (CSU) and has partnered with the CSU researchers to investigate a "biologically enhanced", self lubricating polymer bearing material that could be used in both total joint and surface replacement implants.

This technology, developed by Dr. Sue James at CSU, involves the chemical enhancement of the polymer material by combining it with a naturally occurring lubricant found in healthy human joints. Initial wear testing has shown that this enhancement results in a 50% reduction in wear when compared to the standard polymer currently used in joint replacement devices. Schwartz Biomedical holds the license for this technology and intends to further research it’s applications into different areas within orthopaedics (tissue engineering, sports medicine, spine, etc.). 

Schwartz Biomedical, LLC, is a tissue engineering company that generates and develops novel tissue engineering solutions to orthopaedic and oral/maxillofacial problems. Dr. Herb Schwartz is the founder, president and CEO of Schwartz Biomedical. Prior to founding his own company, Dr. Schwartz was employed by DePuy Orthopaedics in their Orthobiologics (soft tissue engineering) Department. During his tenure with DePuy, Dr Schwartz established himself as a prolific innovator by generating more than 25 U.S. patents (issued or pending) in the field of orthopaedics and tissue engineering. He received his Ph.D. and MS in Biomechanical Engineering from the University of Cincinnati and his BS in Mechanical Engineering from Purdue University.

Founded as the Colorado Agricultural College in 1870, Colorado State University (CSU) is a land-grant institution and a Carnegie Doctoral/Research University-Extensive. Dr Sue James is the Director of the Biomedical Engineering Program, Director of Rocky Mountain Materials Research (RMMR) and co-Director of the Orthopaedic Bioengineering Research Laboratory at CSU. She received her Ph.D. in polymers from MIT in 1993 and her B.S. in Metallurgical Engineering and Materials Science (with a minor in Biomedical Engineering) from Carnegie Mellon in 1989. 

DePuy Orthopaedics, a Johnson and Johnson Company, was established in 1895 as the first commercial orthopedics company in the United States. The company designs, manufactures and distributes orthopaedic devices and supplies including hip, knee, extremity, trauma, orthobiologics, and operating room products and is headquartered in Warsaw, Indiana. 

The Northeast Indiana Innovation Center, located in Fort Wayne, Indiana, is a community technology business incubator designed to accelerate the growth and success of entrepreneurial companies through an array of business support resources and services. The Innovation Center’s main goal is to produce successful firms that will leave the incubation program financially viable and freestanding.

BioPoly™ RS LLC

BioPoly™ LLC
Schwartz Biomedical Awarded Another Grant: $2 Million

FORT WAYNE, IN — Schwartz Biomedical subsidiary, BioPoly LLC, has been awarded $2MM from Indiana's 21st Century Fund to develop a new orthopaedic implant, called BioPoly™ RS (ReSurfacing), which will be used to replace only the damaged portion of a joint (i.e. knee, hip, shoulder, phalanges, etc...) as opposed to the entire joint. Patients receiving this new implant will not have to put up with chronic pain that many arthritis sufferers endure while they wait for their joint to deteriorate to the point where they are total joint replacement candidates.

According to Herb Schwartz Ph.D., President and CEO of Schwartz Biomedical LLC and BioPoly RS LLC, the grant will enable Schwartz Biomedical to complete its preclinical research and product development work, as well as the FDA submission which will allow the product to be sold as a medical device. "Our timeline is aggressive," according to Schwartz, "Product development should be complete within the next 2-3 years with the first implant ready for market launch in 2009." In order to accomplish this goal, Janine Campbell Ph.D., a Principal Scientist who specializes in chemistry, has joined the Schwartz Biomedical team and will provide her expertise toward the commercialization of this technology.

Schwartz Biomedical has partnered with Colorado State University and the Northeast Indiana Innovation Center to complete the development and commercialization of the BioPoly™ RS implant technology.

The BioPoly™ RS material platform is a hydrophilic polymer which has mechanical and biochemical properties similar to that of native articular cartilage so that the implant can interface and articulate with normal joint tissue. Therefore, if the patient has a focal cartilage defect, the surgeon will have a viable option of replacing, or partially resurfacing, only the damaged tissue with the BioPoly™ RS implant such that the implant will physiologically share the biomechanical loads. 

In 2004, Schwartz Biomedical received its first grant, totaling $1.27 million, from the state's 21st Century Research to commercialize a new total joint material. In 2005, one of Schwartz Biomedical's subsidiary companies (BioDuct LLC) received $1.35 million in investment capital to complete product development work for a tissue regeneration technology for the knee.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
