About Me




       
   For the last fourteen years I’ve been cooking professionally, and while I love the food, the culture, and the people I’ve met working in restaurants, I’ve recently discovered another passion: coding.  A few years ago, I started building my first DBMS, a web application intended for independent restaurateurs to efficiently track product usage and cost.  Though it is still a work in progress, having grown to incorporate a number of functions not envisioned in the first version, my goal of releasing an easy-to-use, yet powerful and free software package motivates me to continue learning.  This goal, coupled with the birth of my daughter in May of 2013, sparked my decision to return to school, and I am currently pursuing my Bachelor`s of Science in Computer Information Systems.   
	    The foundation of my skill set lies in MySQL, PHP, HTML, and JavaScript, though I am also comfortable working with jQuery.  Additionally, my course work to date(as well as a few new freelance projects) have provided an excellent working knowledge of both Java and C++.  To me, one of the most enjoyable aspects of application development is database programming, and I particularly enjoy the work involved in compiling statistical data and providing access to reliable, pertinent information.   




 




Web Application Showcase
     First up is an inventory and invoice management system designed to supply a small business with the ability to log inventory usage of product, calculate the cost of items produced, and maintain a database of product and inventory activity, as well as accurately track fluctuating prices of products purchased.  
                    The second application processes point of sale reports to generate statistical analyses of individual product sales, as well as generate visual representation of sales trends, compare product performance, and evaluate the sales percentage against fluctuating sales amounts in order to achieve an ‘apples to apples’ view of product performance.
        As these systems have been a learning exercise for me over the last two years, there are some areas built around third party code.  In situations where the learning curve of certain functionality would have prohibited completion of the project, I have utilized open source code, all released under the GNU GPL, and with authorship notices in the ‘About’ section of each project. 
     
	I’d like to thank you for taking the time to view my work, and sincerely welcome any feedback.
