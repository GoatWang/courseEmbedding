Brumm to Chief Operating Officer and Paul Westberg to Chief Business Officer. Mr. Brumm had been serving as Chief Financial Officer and will continue in that role and Mr. Westberg was previously Senior Vice President, Corporate Development. “Josh’s leadership has been instrumental to our success to date,” said Jay Shepard, CEO of Versartis, Inc. “Since Josh joined Versartis in 2013, he has spearheaded our capital markets activities, raising $350 million in our Series E, IPO and follow on offerings. He has a wealth of career experience leading successful operations and bringing innovative pharmaceuticals and medical devices to market. He has played a pivotal role in crafting our global and product strategy and established our Versartis GmbH subsidiary.  Versartis will continue to benefit immensely from his operational and commercial expertise as we prepare for somavaratan Phase 3 data expected in September, and plan for a potential regulatory filing and product launch.” Mr. Shepard continued, “I’m extremely pleased to have Paul assume the role of Chief Business Officer. In addition to his exceptional corporate development track record, Paul has consistently provided critical strategic leadership since joining us in the early years of Versartis. Most recently, he led our efforts to out-license the commercial rights to somavaratan in Japan. Paul sought a partner with proven product launch experience in competitive markets and a desire to expand its current endocrinology franchise. Ultimately, he negotiated an exceptionally strong alliance with Teijin Limited, valued up to $165 million in upfront and potential milestone payments plus attractive transfer pricing and royalties. Paul will continue to play a pivotal role in the development and execution of our strategies with the potential to lead to significant value creation opportunities for shareholders of Versartis.” “Both Mr. Brumm and Mr. Westberg’s expanded roles reflect the company’s determination to assemble a well-rounded team of senior level experts as we focus our aim on successfully launching somavaratan and building a cutting edge biotechnology company.” Mr. Brumm has more than a decade of operations, corporate finance and investment banking experience in the life science industry. He was named Silicon Valley Business Journal's CFO of the Year for companies under $500 million in 2014 and finalist for the Bay Area CFO of the Year Awards in the small public company category during 2016. Prior to Versartis, he served as Executive Vice President of Finance and Principal Financial Officer for Pharmacyclics Inc. Previously Mr. Brumm held the role of Chief Financial Officer at ZELTIQ Aesthetics, Inc., and held a number of operational and financial positions in strategic planning, global finance, IT and administration. At ZELTIQ as Senior Managing Director of International Sales and Corporate Development, he led the launch of its first commercial product in all markets outside of the United States and Canada. Prior to joining ZELTIQ, Mr. Brumm was Director of Finance at Proteolix, Inc., helping in the sale of the company to Onyx Pharmaceuticals. He has also held investment banking roles at Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. and Morgan Stanley. Mr. Brumm was Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Nu-Ag Distribution, LLC, an agricultural consulting company. He holds a BA in Business Administration from the University of Notre Dame. Mr. Westberg has more than twenty years of transactions, operations, and advisory experience focused on advancing innovative technologies/products in the life sciences sector.  He joined Versartis from Bayhill Therapeutics, where he was the Vice President of Business Development responsible for the company’s licensing activities and was a key contributor to its private equity fundraisings, IPO preparations and operational activities. Most notably, Mr. Westberg led a transformational licensing deal for $350M+ with Genentech/Roche for Bayhill’s novel Phase 1/2 program in type 1 diabetes. Prior to Bayhill, he was the Vice President of Business Development at Novacea where he was responsible for multiple transactions including the in-licensing of two clinical stage oncology products.

(NASDAQ:VSAR), an endocrine-focused biopharmaceutical company that is developing somavaratan (VRS-317), a novel, long-acting form of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) for growth hormone deficiency (GHD), announced the promotion of Joshua T. Brumm to Chief Operating Officer and Paul Westberg to Chief Business Officer. Mr. Brumm had been serving as Chief Financial Officer and will continue in that role and Mr. Westberg was previously Senior Vice President, Corporate Development. "Josh's leadership has been instrumental to our success to date," said Jay Shepard, CEO of Versartis, Inc. "Since Josh joined Versartis in 2013, he has spearheaded our capital markets activities, raising $350 million in our Series E, IPO and follow on offerings. He has a wealth of career experience leading successful operations and bringing innovative pharmaceuticals and medical devices to market. He has played a pivotal role in crafting our global and product strategy and established our Versartis GmbH subsidiary.  Versartis will continue to benefit immensely from his operational and commercial expertise as we prepare for somavaratan Phase 3 data expected in September, and plan for a potential regulatory filing and product launch." Mr. Shepard continued, "I'm extremely pleased to have Paul assume the role of Chief Business Officer. In addition to his exceptional corporate development track record, Paul has consistently provided critical strategic leadership since joining us in the early years of Versartis. Most recently, he led our efforts to out-license the commercial rights to somavaratan in Japan. Paul sought a partner with proven product launch experience in competitive markets and a desire to expand its current endocrinology franchise. Ultimately, he negotiated an exceptionally strong alliance with Teijin Limited, valued up to $165 million in upfront and potential milestone payments plus attractive transfer pricing and royalties. Paul will continue to play a pivotal role in the development and execution of our strategies with the potential to lead to significant value creation opportunities for shareholders of Versartis." "Both Mr. Brumm and Mr. Westberg's expanded roles reflect the company's determination to assemble a well-rounded team of senior level experts as we focus our aim on successfully launching somavaratan and building a cutting edge biotechnology company." Mr. Brumm has more than a decade of operations, corporate finance and investment banking experience in the life science industry. He was named Silicon Valley Business Journal's CFO of the Year for companies under $500 million in 2014 and finalist for the Bay Area CFO of the Year Awards in the small public company category during 2016. Prior to Versartis, he served as Executive Vice President of Finance and Principal Financial Officer for Pharmacyclics Inc. Previously Mr. Brumm held the role of Chief Financial Officer at ZELTIQ Aesthetics, Inc., and held a number of operational and financial positions in strategic planning, global finance, IT and administration. At ZELTIQ as Senior Managing Director of International Sales and Corporate Development, he led the launch of its first commercial product in all markets outside of the United States and Canada. Prior to joining ZELTIQ, Mr. Brumm was Director of Finance at Proteolix, Inc., helping in the sale of the company to Onyx Pharmaceuticals. He has also held investment banking roles at Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. and Morgan Stanley. Mr. Brumm was Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Nu-Ag Distribution, LLC, an agricultural consulting company. He holds a BA in Business Administration from the University of Notre Dame. Mr. Westberg has more than twenty years of transactions, operations, and advisory experience focused on advancing innovative technologies/products in the life sciences sector.  He joined Versartis from Bayhill Therapeutics, where he was the Vice President of Business Development responsible for the company's licensing activities and was a key contributor to its private equity fundraisings, IPO preparations and operational activities. Most notably, Mr. Westberg led a transformational licensing deal for $350M+ with Genentech/Roche for Bayhill's novel Phase 1/2 program in type 1 diabetes. Prior to Bayhill, he was the Vice President of Business Development at Novacea where he was responsible for multiple transactions including the in-licensing of two clinical stage oncology products.

ZELTIQ(R) Aesthetics Promotes Joshua T. Brumm to Senior Vice President

PLEASANTON, Calif., May 8, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ZELTIQ Aesthetics, Inc. (Nasdaq:ZLTQ) a medical technology company focused on developing and commercializing products utilizing its proprietary controlled-cooling technology platform, today announced that the Board of Directors has promoted Chief Financial Officer Joshua Brumm to Senior Vice President, from Vice President. Mr. Brumm has served as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer since January 2012. Prior to that, he served as Vice President, Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Mr. Brumm will continue to oversee all financial operations, corporate development, information technology and investor 
relations functions.

Mark Foley, interim President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Since Josh stepped into the CFO role in January, he has made a number of significant contributions that have strengthened the finance team and operational management of ZELTIQ. We have complete confidence that he will continue to be an invaluable member of the executive team. We look forward to his continued leadership in this role."

About ZELTIQ Aesthetics 


 ZELTIQ®  Aesthetics is a medical technology company focused on developing and commercializing products utilizing its proprietary controlled-cooling technology platform. The Company's first commercial product, the CoolSculpting System, is designed to selectively reduce stubborn fat bulges that may not respond to diet or exercise. CoolSculpting is based on the scientific principle that fat cells are more sensitive to cold than the overlying skin and surrounding tissues. CoolSculpting utilizes patented technology of precisely controlled cooling to reduce the temperature of fat cells in the treated area, which is intended to cause fat cell elimination through a natural biological process known as apoptosis, without causing scar tissue or damage to the skin, nerves, or surrounding tissues. ZELTIQ developed CoolSculpting to safely, noticeably, and measurably reduce the fat layer within a 
treated fat bulge without requiring the patient to diet or exercise.
