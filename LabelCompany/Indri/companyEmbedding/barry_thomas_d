Home » About Us

Bingo Hair Cosmetics Manufacture Ltd., established in 2001, specializes in the manufacture of hair care products such as hair color cream, hair conditioner, hair wax, hair gel, hair spray, shampoo, and more. Bingo products are widely used for hair coloring, hair care, hair styling, hair repairing, and hair perming. Our company is derived from Bingo-In Italy Cosmetic Manufacture Ltd., which was a joint venture with an Italian hair cosmetics company. In September, 2009, we terminated the joint venture relationship and Bingo-In Italy Cosmetic Manufacture Ltd. was renamed Bingo Hair Cosmetic Ltd.

Our company is headquartered in Hong Kong. Located in Guangzhou, China, our factory covers 3,000 square meters and has over 100 employees. We have seven main departments, including R&D, Manufacturing, Quality Control, Sales, Personnel, Warehouse, and the Dyeing Intermediate Preparation Center. Through the use of superior technology we manufacture reasonably-priced, high-quality hair serum, perm lotion, hair mask, hair sculpting lotion, and much more. As a result of our efforts, our exports totaled over 7 million USD in 2010, and we have earned highly regarded position in the hair care products field. 

Bingo Hair Cosmetics Manufacture Ltd. primarily manufactures hair color cream, shampoo, hair conditioner, styling products, straightening products, dyeing products, and perm products. We now have a monthly production capability of 500 metric tons. The use of an Italian, fully logic controlled system machine TGM for filling coloring cream allows us to increase efficiency and product quality. We also utilize automatic shampoo and conditioner filling production lines, Hitachi ink jet printers, automatic vacuum emulsification boilers, Avery Dennison labeling machines, tri-dimensional packers, and an advanced waste water processor which regenerates waste water above 15 metric tons. Our products can be stored for ten years at room temperature. All of our hair products are made according to the safety ordinances of China, the USA, and Europe, so customers can feel secure in using any of our extensive line of products.

We have built excellent relationships with domestic and overseas customers with our high-quality products, first-class management system, and excellent after-sales service. We welcome all inquires and orders, no matter your location.

Your Debt Does Not Define You.
There’s A Way Out.




Over 23 years of experience in bankruptcy law.


Get Help Now











It’s Our Mission to Help You Through These Troubled Times.




If your debt is out of control, bankruptcy may be a great option for you. Stop creditor calls and collection agency harassment, wage garnishment, lawsuits and foreclosure—start your journey toward financial freedom.













Chapter 7
Bankruptcy
Chapter 7 bankruptcy will effectively stop wage garnishments, lawsuits and creditor calls while providing you with the opportunity to begin rebuilding your credit. It can also eliminate most forms of unsecured debt, including medical bills and credit cards. Don’t face this alone – let us help you.


Learn More






Considering
Bankruptcy?
Declaring bankruptcy can immediately stop harassing phone calls and letters from creditors and collection agencies, curb wage reductions, end repossessions and delay foreclosures, creating renewed stability for you and your family. But that doesn’t mean bankruptcy is always the answer.


Learn More






Chapter 13
Bankruptcy
Chapter 13 bankruptcy can help you consolidate overdue mortgage, car loans, credit card debt, student loans and other unsecured debt, giving you the option to repay your debt interest free, over a period of three to five years. Creditors cannot attempt to collect from you during this period.
