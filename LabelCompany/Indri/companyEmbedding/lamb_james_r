If you were God, writing a book you wanted men to understand, would you write it in such a way that men would have to make up meaning in order to understand it, or would you write it in such a way that those that seek to understand could actually come to a knowledge of its truth (Mt 7:7)? The present commentary takes the position that God wrote Revelation such that with sufficient effort and intellectual honesty, readers can understand it. Certainly God uses symbols in Revelation, but when He does, He provides inspired interpretations of the symbols. This commentary seeks to avoid the mistakes of the views that use the symbolical approach to Revelation (preterist, continuous historical, spiritualist, and idealist). These approaches suffer from two basic flaws: assuming the text is symbolical when it is not and making up meaning regarding the text based on stream of consciousness word association, much as one would do looking at Rorschach inkblots. This commentary seeks to avoid telling God what He should have said and strives to understand what God actually meant.Of all the existing approaches to understanding Revelation, this commentary is most closely aligned with the dispensationalist (premillennialist/Left Behind) view in that it views Revelation from a literalist perspective. It is different from the typical dispensationalist schema in that it views the seven seals as the powers of the Lamb, understands the exercise of the powers of the seven seals to be simultaneous processes, and casts chapters 8-22 as three parallel prophecies of the Lamb's power over the course of the histories of Israel, the nations, and the saints. This commentary also makes use of many of the non-canonical works that provide insight into the spirit world and detail regarding the end of the present age.

Lamb, James R
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Michigan:













Does Lamb, James R carry a valid contracting license?



Michigan requires contractors performing any work on residential properties to be licensed with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. 
Lamb, James R currently holds license 2101029512 (Builder Individual), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Michigan?



Contractors in Michigan must complete a 60 hour approved prelicensure education class prior to taking a buisness and law exam. Contractors are required to take continuing education upon renewal of an active license. 











Your liability risk when hiring Lamb, James R



Michigan requires licensed contractors to carry an active workers' compensation policy. Although general liability insurance is not required under Michigan state law, it is always advisable to hire contractors who carry it. Request copies of the certificates for both forms of insurance for your records. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Michigan, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Meat
The most important product we get from sheep is meat. Meat 
                is an important component of our diets, and lamb and mutton supply 
                us with many of the vital vitamins and proteins we need for healthy 
                living. Lamb is the meat (flesh) from a sheep that is less than 
                one year old. Mutton is the meat from a sheep that is over one 
                year of age. The terms yearling mutton are applied to the meat from a sheep that is between one and two years of age.




World meat 
                        consumption 


  Pork

40 percent 


  Beef

32 percent 


  Poultry

22 percent 


  Lamb and mutton

6 percent 



                  While sheep meat only accounts for 6 percent of the world's meat 
                  consumption, it is the principle meat in regions of North Africa, 
                  the Middle East, India, and parts of Europe. The European Union 
                  is the world's largest lamb consumer and number one importer of lamb, 
                  whereas 99 percent of the lamb imported originates from Australia 
                  and New Zealand.


Wool
Wool is the product for which sheep are best known. Wool is 
                  widely used in clothing from knitwear such as socks and jumpers 
                  to cloth used for suits and costumes. It is used in the furniture 
                  trade both for making chair covers and for upholstery. Many of 
                  the better carpets produced traditionally and today are made from 
                  wool. Wool is used to fill mattresses. It is used in diverse products, 
                  such as tennis ball covers, pool table baize, and hanging basket 
                  liners.

                  Alternative uses of wool are increasing. Wool is a very useful 
                  product when oil spills occur. Pads made from wool can be used 
                  to soak up the oil. In 1999 when an oil spill occurred near Phillip 
                  Island, Australia, the Phillip Island penguins were fitted with 
                  wool sweaters. The sweaters helped maintain the tiny penguin's 
                  body heat and prevented them from being poisoned by the oil. 
There is a company in the United Kingdom that makes caskets out of wool. Prince Charles is a big support of the eco-friendly wool caskets. Several companies are making insulation from  wool. Wool has a higher R value than many traditional materials. Mulch pads made from wool offer an environmentally-friendly alternative to plastic mulches. 
Bricks reinforced with wool (and seaweed) are less toxic than those reinforced with traditional alternatives. Plus, they're stronger. An entrepreneur in England is making packaging material out of left over wool. Not only are the wool-insulated boxes more environmentally-friendly, but they have out-performed poly-based insulating material, keeping items twice as cool.
Learn about the qualities of wool =>


Lanolin
Raw wool contains 10 to 25 percent grease or "lanolin," 
                  which is recovered during the scouring process. Lanolin consists 
                  of a highly complex mixture of esters, alcohols, and fatty acids 
                  and is used in adhesive tape, printing inks, motor oils, and auto 
                  lubrication. Lanolin is also used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. 
                  Virtually all cosmetics and beauty aids, such as lipsticks, mascara, 
                  lotions, shampoos, and hair conditioners, contain lanolin.
Skins
Sheep skins are removed from the carcasses after slaughter. 
                  They are treated in a process called tanning and made into soft 
                  leather. Sheep skin is commonly used for making the chamois cloth 
                  that you wash your car with. A small number of skins are preserved 
                  as sold as sheepskins, with the wool still attached.

                  The skins from hair sheep produce the highest quality leather. 
                  This is because the numerous fine wool fibers, as compared to 
                  the lesser number of coarse fibers of the hair sheep, cause the 
                  skin to be more open and loose in texture.
Persian lambskin
One of the main reasons for keeping Karakul sheep commercially 
                  is for the production of Karakul lambskin, the skin of a newborn 
                  lamb, 1 to 3 days old. Newly born lambs have tightly-curled, shiny, 
                  black fur. Karakul lambskin is also known as Persian lambskin 
                  or Astrakhan. It is typically used in full-fur garments, such 
                  as coats and skirts, and as trimming, edging, lining, and for 
                  accessories. 

                  Karakul lamb fur accounts for almost 12 percent of the world's 
                  fur trade, second only to mink. Karakul sheep are raised mostly 
                  in Central Asia, Afghanistan, and Namibia, where they are the 
                  only animals that can survive the harsh environmental conditions, 
                  while providing both a food source and income to local people. 


Dairy
Sheep cheese comprises about 1.3 percent of the world's cheese 
                  production. Some of the world's most famous cheeses were originally 
                  made from sheep's milk: Roquefort, Feta, Ricotta, and Pecorina 
                  Romano. Sheep's milk is also made into yogurt, butter, and ice 
                  cream. The United States is a large importer of sheep milk cheeses.


Science and medicine
Sheep make many contributions to the fields of science and 
                  medicine. They are used as research models to study disease and 
                  perfect surgical techniques. They are used in stem cell research. 
                  Their blood is the ideal medium for culturing bacteria. Sheep 
                  are used to produce pharmaceuticals in their blood and milk. Using nanotechnology, scientists are using wool proteins to create new wound dressings, bone graft implants, and medical sutures.


Landscape management
                    While sheep have  been used for centuries to control unwanted vegetation, 
                  grazing as a fee-based service is a relatively new phenomenon. Along 
                  with goats, sheep are the best livestock to use to control unwanted 
                  vegetation, such as  noxious weeds and invasive plants. Sheep are also a good companion enterprise to solar farming, as they can control vegetation under the solar panels, while producing an income.
