Private Equity
Putting Capital to Work, Making Companies Stronger.





Overview Our investments span a wide range of industries around the world in established and growth-oriented businesses alike. Playing a vital role in helping companies realize their growth potential, we uncover value by identifying great companies and enhancing their performance by providing patient capital and operating support to strong management teams. Our approach helps our portfolio companies grow core businesses, launch new initiatives, make transformative acquisitions and upgrade technologies and systems to support their long-term strategy.   
We provide more than just capital. We seek to make the companies we invest in stronger through a bottoms-up strategy of transformation. Crucially, we bring the expertise of our Portfolio Operations Group to provide strategic guidance on a variety of operational improvements, including revenue growth, procurement, leadership development, lean process and IT optimization, energy sustainability, and employee health care.
  







				A Message from Joe Baratta, Global Head of Private Equity
			










DRIVING
Transformative Impact  We strive to create value by investing in great businesses where our capital, strategic insight, global relationships and operational support can drive transformation that unlocks the company’s potential. In addition to benefiting our investors, the improvements in growth and global competitiveness benefit workers, communities and other stakeholders. 
We are patient investors who practice the art of the long view, and are committed to achieving the best long-term outcomes for our businesses and our investors. 
 


DISCIPLINED
Due Diligence  Our investment approach is based on a disciplined due diligence process that measures risk while identifying the catalysts for increased value. We purposefully engage only in friendly transactions and work with talented management teams to achieve transformative results. Our specialized Portfolio Operations Group helps to maximize value by improving processes across varied elements of a business’s operations.    
The returns that these investments earn for our investors – pension funds, academic and charitable institutions, governments and other institutions, as well as retail investors – help to secure and grow the assets needed to support retirees and fund essential programs.
 











$100 billion AUM

Blackstone is a global leader in private equity, with $100 billion in assets under management through our opportunistic and private equity segments.






82 Portfolio

 Over 250 Private Equity 
Professionals

All numbers are as of June 30, 2017. 








 $37.5billion
Available Capital to Invest




“ “We are constantly looking for situations where we see something, or we are able to add value in a way that our competitors don't. Our people feel the obligation to go out there and find special situations where we can intervene to drive change.”  - Joseph Baratta Global Head of Private Equity   











   
Pro-active, targeted sourcing  Sector-based, theme-driven deal sourcing is the primary responsibility and mandate of our investment professionals. We aim to source high-quality and proprietary investment opportunities by proactively developing and leveraging strong relationships with companies and key deal intermediaries. At regular pipeline meetings with sector teams, we review potential opportunities and determine what resources – both internal and external – are best suited to pursue those opportunities.  




   
Value-oriented discipline In determining value for new investments, we focus on a business’s current outlook and judge the predictability of that outlook over time, while also factoring in what we can do for the business to drive even better outcomes after our acquisition. 
  




   
Transformational operating improvements 
We actively target companies in which significant value can be created through clear strategic and operational change, and created our Portfolio Operations Group to provide hands-on support to help our portfolio companies become more productive, efficient and valuable. Once a company joins the portfolio, we help management craft a plan to reach their full potential over the long term, and provide assistance as they put this plan into practice.  




Our Portfolio


We are proud of Blackstone’s role as a positive economic catalyst for the companies in our Corporate Private Equity portfolio. We work to identify, invest in and enhance the value of great businesses.


Global in scope, our Corporate Private Equity group has offices in Toronto, New York, London, Dusseldorf, Mumbai, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Sydney. As of June 30, 2017, our Corporate Private Equity funds held interests in 82 companies.

Traditional Leveraged Buyouts 












Traditional Leveraged Buyouts 

We pursue control leveraged buyouts of both large and mid-cap companies globally

                Our large buyouts tend to be in companies of global scale with strong brands and high relative market shares, where we can still drive growth and operating improvements.  Our mid-cap buyouts tend to be of companies that are differentiated vs. larger competitors and have protected market niches and multiple avenues of growth and operating improvements.

Buy and Build Platforms

Smaller companies, scalable platforms, backable management teams

                In our “buy-and-build” transactions we tend to invest in smaller companies that have scalable platforms and backable management teams in large, fragmented industries, where we believe there are substantial revenue and margin benefits from sector consolidation.

 $371billion
Assets Under Management
*As of June 30, 2017




“ “Blackstone has always been managed with a perspective of achieving successful growth over the long-term… Our management has consistently sought to focus on the best outcomes for our businesses and investments over a period of years rather than on the short-term impact.”   - Blackstone Prospectus, June 2007   













In 1985 Blackstone opened its doors with a staff of four, including the two founders, Peter G. Peterson and Stephen A. Schwarzman, and a balance sheet of $400,000. From these early beginnings, besides big dreams, the founders have held these core beliefs:
     1   In an environment of ever larger firms, the most gifted would desire a more personal setting and would join Blackstone to create exciting new businesses in their fields of expertise.
            2   In a world of giant organizations    with a broad array of services, there was room for a specialized firm with the highest levels of professionalism and integrity, and senior-level attention to clients and relationships.        3   In contrast to the prevailing philosophy  of “other people’s money,” the firm would always put significant amounts of its own money in the investments it made.
            4   We will consistently strive to achieve  superior performance through innovation, uniqueness and excellence.        5  Above all else our people — their creativity,   imagination, dedication, teamwork and integrity — will be our key assets.
