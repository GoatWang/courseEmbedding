How to Qualify for the CPA Exam




To qualify for the CPA Exam, you need to meet educational and other requirements specific to the state or jurisdiction in which you intend to be licensed to practice.




Most states require that you have a bachelor’s degree before you sit for the exam. However, some states require that you have 150 hours of coursework (the equivalent of a Master’s degree) before you qualify to sit.

How to Apply for the CPA Exam




To apply for the CPA Exam, you must submit forms and transcripts, along with fees (ranging from $900 to $1,000), to the state board or its designee.




You may apply to any state or jurisdiction, but may only register to take the exam in one jurisdiction at a time.




Applications can be submitted at any time during the year, and the process usually takes from four to six weeks for first-time candidates.

Schedule

Schedule Your Exam
Once your application has been processed by the state board, you’ll receive a Notice to Schedule (NTS) which is required for you to schedule your CPA Exam at a Prometric Test Center. Generally, you’ll need to sit for your first exam within six months of receiving the NTS, although this can vary by jurisdiction.
The CPA Exam is offered two out of every three months of each quarter. The months when testing is available are called "testing windows."
You may schedule the exam parts in any order, and one at a time, if you prefer.
Testing is Available

January and February
April and May
July and August
October and November

How to Qualify for the CPA Exam




To qualify for the CPA Exam, you need to meet educational and other requirements specific to the state or jurisdiction in which you intend to be licensed to practice.




Most states require that you have a bachelor’s degree before you sit for the exam. However, some states require that you have 150 hours of coursework (the equivalent of a Master’s degree) before you qualify to sit.

How to Apply for the CPA Exam




To apply for the CPA Exam, you must submit forms and transcripts, along with fees (ranging from $900 to $1,000), to the state board or its designee.




You may apply to any state or jurisdiction, but may only register to take the exam in one jurisdiction at a time.




Applications can be submitted at any time during the year, and the process usually takes from four to six weeks for first-time candidates.

Schedule

Schedule Your Exam
Once your application has been processed by the state board, you’ll receive a Notice to Schedule (NTS) which is required for you to schedule your CPA Exam at a Prometric Test Center. Generally, you’ll need to sit for your first exam within six months of receiving the NTS, although this can vary by jurisdiction.
The CPA Exam is offered two out of every three months of each quarter. The months when testing is available are called "testing windows."
You may schedule the exam parts in any order, and one at a time, if you prefer.
Testing is Available

January and February
April and May

How to Qualify for the CPA Exam




To qualify for the CPA Exam, you need to meet educational and other requirements specific to the state or jurisdiction in which you intend to be licensed to practice.




Most states require that you have a bachelor’s degree before you sit for the exam. However, some states require that you have 150 hours of coursework (the equivalent of a Master’s degree) before you qualify to sit.

How to Apply for the CPA Exam




To apply for the CPA Exam, you must submit forms and transcripts, along with fees (ranging from $900 to $1,000), to the state board or its designee.




You may apply to any state or jurisdiction, but may only register to take the exam in one jurisdiction at a time.




Applications can be submitted at any time during the year, and the process usually takes from four to six weeks for first-time candidates.

Schedule Your Exam
Once your application has been processed by the state board, you’ll receive a Notice to Schedule (NTS) which is required for you to schedule your CPA Exam at a Prometric Test Center. Generally, you’ll need to sit for your first exam within six months of receiving the NTS, although this can vary by jurisdiction.
The CPA Exam is offered two out of every three months of each quarter. The months when testing is available are called "testing windows."
You may schedule the exam parts in any order, and one at a time, if you prefer.
Testing is Available

January and February
April and May
