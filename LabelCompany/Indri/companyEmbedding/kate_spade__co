Men's ClothingGuys, it’s time to update your wardrobe. Luckily for you, we’ve got all the staples and on-trend pieces your closet needs. Explore men’s clothing (including big & tall sizes), plus shoes and accessories to create outfits tailored for every occasion. And if you’re interested in a few helpful styling tips, then check out our Men’s Guide to Style. Don’t worry, you can thank us later.
First, let’s keep it casual. The keys to a great laid-back wardrobe are to pick pieces that fit well, are comfortable and are versatile. T-shirts and tees are a great place to start. Plain tees are simple and can be worn with anything. Bonus? They can double as undershirts in a pinch. Graphic tees are an easy way to show off your personality. Go with versions that showcase your interests, rep your favorite sports team or just look cool. Finish your chill shirt collection with a few polos—they’re a more polished option and can easily be dressed down or up.
Now that you’ve got your list of classic casual shirts, it’s time to focus on refreshing your collection of shorts and pants. From cargos and chinos to denim, we’ve got you covered. When it comes to jeans, especially, grab a few pairs in various washes—think light, medium and dark. Feeling adventurous? Colored denim provides a fresh update to your look. From skinny and slim fit to bootcut and relaxed, fit matters and you should always pick pairs that suit your frame and that you feel good in.
Let’s move on to pieces you’ll need to dress to impress. Look pulled together with suits, dress shirts, undershirts and men’s dress shoes. Take the opportunity to mix and match with sport coats and blazers. Pair them with dress pants or jeans for a modern feel (but only if if the dress code is more lenient). Whether you’re headed to the office, a wedding or special event, your stylish clothes will speak for themselves. Don’t forget accessories. Grab a wallet, cuff links, ties, belts and more to round out your look.
Whether you’re dressed up or down, you’ll need to layer up when it’s cold outside. Our collection of jacket, coats and vest will keep you warm. Throw on cozy sweaters and sweatshirts into your look, and for even more warmth, stock up on hats, scarves and gloves. Stick with Timberland boots and thicker fabrics that help trap heat—think wool, leather, cotton and more.
Oh, and we can’t forget workout clothes. Whether you live at the gym or are just getting back into an exercise routine, you’re going to need a solid collection of activewear. And on rest days (and every evening), pajamas and loungewear will come in handy. We’re here to help you look great every hour of the day. Find helpful styling tops and tricks with Macy’s Men’s Guide to Style.
Who’s ready for a wardrobe refresh? Shop men’s clothing, shoes, accessories and more at Macy’s.Looking for huge savings? Shop our Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Holiday Gift Guide!

History[edit]
Liz Claiborne Inc. was founded in 1976 by Liz Claiborne, Art Ortenberg, Leonard Boxer, and Jerome Chazen. In 1980, Nina McLemore founded Liz Claiborne Accessories.[2] Liz Claiborne Inc. went public in 1981 and had made the Fortune 500 list in 1986, ten years after it was founded, with retail sales of $1.2 billion.[citation needed]
After retiring in 1989, Claiborne died on June 26, 2007, at the age of 78 from complications from cancer.[3]
On May 15, 2012, Liz Claiborne Inc. officially became Fifth & Pacific, Inc. and shifted focus to three brands – Juicy Couture, Kate Spade New York, and Lucky Brand Jeans.
On October 7, 2013, Fifth & Pacific Cos announced that they would sell Juicy Couture to Authentic Brands Group for $195 million.[4] In December, the company announced it was selling Lucky Brand Jeans for $225 million to Leonard Green & Partners, leaving the Kate Spade businesses as the company's sole label.
On February 25, 2014, Fifth & Pacific was renamed Kate Spade & Company. Craig A. Leavitt succeeded William McComb, whose retirement marked the official end of the company's transformation from Liz Claiborne to Kate Spade.[5]
Business Growth and Consolidation[edit]




Kate Spade New York Madison Avenue Store


Founder Leonard Boxer retired in 1985, and in 1989, Liz Claiborne and Art Ortenberg also retired from active management. Jerome Chazen became the company's Chairman in 1989 and held that role until 1996, when Paul Charron became Chairman and C.E.O. and held that position until 2006. During Charron's tenure Liz Claiborne, Inc. acquired Lucky Brand Jeans in 1999. In 2001, they acquired Mexx and in 2003 they bought another small fashion company, Juicy Couture. The company acquired kate spade in 2006. On October 16, 2006, Liz Claiborne Inc. named William McComb, a Johnson & Johnson veteran, the company's Chief Executive Officer.[6]
On October 8, 2009, JC Penney Co. (based out of Plano, TX), announced that it would become the exclusive retailer for the Liz Claiborne brand. All Liz Claiborne merchandise would exit any additional department-store retailer, and the Liz Claiborne New York designed by Isaac Mizrahi would move from department stores to QVC. The Liz&Co. and Concepts by Claiborne brands originally exclusively sold at JC Penney would be phased out, and the Liz Claiborne merchandise would begin appearing in JC Penney stores in August 2010. In October 2011, the company completed the sale of its Dana Buchman brand to Kohl's. In November 2011, the Company announced that it has completed the transaction to sell domestic and international trademark rights of its Liz Claiborne family of brands and domestic trademark rights of its Monet brand to JC Penney. In 2013, Fifth & Pacific narrowed its focus to the Kate Spade brand by selling both Juicy Couture and Lucky Brand Jeans, returning to a mono-brand company.[7]
Leadership[edit]
Deborah Lloyd, formerly of Banana Republic and Burberry, joined kate spade New York in 2007 and leads the creative aspects of the brand as president and chief creative officer. In this role, she oversees all creative aspects, including product design, merchandising and creative services.[8]
Craig A. Leavitt, currently chief executive officer, joined shortly thereafter.
Brands[edit]
The Kate Spade & Company portfolio of brands today includes Kate Spade New York and Jack Spade. The Adelington Design Group, a private-label jewelry design and development group, is also operated by the company.[9] It markets brands through department stores, and serves J. C. Penney, via an exclusive license for Liz Claiborne and Monet jewelry lines, and Kohl's with a license for Dana Buchman jewelry.

History[edit]
Liz Claiborne Inc. was founded in 1976 by Liz Claiborne, Art Ortenberg, Leonard Boxer, and Jerome Chazen. In 1980, Nina McLemore founded Liz Claiborne Accessories.[2] Liz Claiborne Inc. went public in 1981 and had made the Fortune 500 list in 1986, ten years after it was founded, with retail sales of $1.2 billion.[citation needed]
After retiring in 1989, Claiborne died on June 26, 2007, at the age of 78 from complications from cancer.[3]
On May 15, 2012, Liz Claiborne Inc. officially became Fifth & Pacific, Inc. and shifted focus to three brands – Juicy Couture, Kate Spade New York, and Lucky Brand Jeans.
On October 7, 2013, Fifth & Pacific Cos announced that they would sell Juicy Couture to Authentic Brands Group for $195 million.[4] In December, the company announced it was selling Lucky Brand Jeans for $225 million to Leonard Green & Partners, leaving the Kate Spade businesses as the company's sole label.
On February 25, 2014, Fifth & Pacific was renamed Kate Spade & Company. Craig A. Leavitt succeeded William McComb, whose retirement marked the official end of the company's transformation from Liz Claiborne to Kate Spade.[5]
Business Growth and Consolidation[edit]




Kate Spade New York Madison Avenue Store


Founder Leonard Boxer retired in 1985, and in 1989, Liz Claiborne and Art Ortenberg also retired from active management. Jerome Chazen became the company's Chairman in 1989 and held that role until 1996, when Paul Charron became Chairman and C.E.O. and held that position until 2006. During Charron's tenure Liz Claiborne, Inc. acquired Lucky Brand Jeans in 1999. In 2001, they acquired Mexx and in 2003 they bought another small fashion company, Juicy Couture. The company acquired kate spade in 2006. On October 16, 2006, Liz Claiborne Inc. named William McComb, a Johnson & Johnson veteran, the company's Chief Executive Officer.[6]
On October 8, 2009, JC Penney Co. (based out of Plano, TX), announced that it would become the exclusive retailer for the Liz Claiborne brand. All Liz Claiborne merchandise would exit any additional department-store retailer, and the Liz Claiborne New York designed by Isaac Mizrahi would move from department stores to QVC. The Liz&Co. and Concepts by Claiborne brands originally exclusively sold at JC Penney would be phased out, and the Liz Claiborne merchandise would begin appearing in JC Penney stores in August 2010. In October 2011, the company completed the sale of its Dana Buchman brand to Kohl's. In November 2011, the Company announced that it has completed the transaction to sell domestic and international trademark rights of its Liz Claiborne family of brands and domestic trademark rights of its Monet brand to JC Penney. In 2013, Fifth & Pacific narrowed its focus to the Kate Spade brand by selling both Juicy Couture and Lucky Brand Jeans, returning to a mono-brand company.[7]
Leadership[edit]
Deborah Lloyd, formerly of Banana Republic and Burberry, joined kate spade New York in 2007 and leads the creative aspects of the brand as president and chief creative officer. In this role, she oversees all creative aspects, including product design, merchandising and creative services.[8]
Craig A. Leavitt, currently chief executive officer, joined shortly thereafter.
Brands[edit]
The Kate Spade & Company portfolio of brands today includes Kate Spade New York and Jack Spade. The Adelington Design Group, a private-label jewelry design and development group, is also operated by the company.[9] It markets brands through department stores, and serves J. C. Penney, via an exclusive license for Liz Claiborne and Monet jewelry lines, and Kohl's with a license for Dana Buchman jewelry.

Business history[edit]




Store on Madison Avenue






Temporary shop in New York


Prior to company creation[edit]
Katherine Noel Brosnahan (later known as Kate Spade) was born on December 4, 1962 in Kansas City, Missouri. She grew up in Kansas City and went to an all-girls Catholic high school. She moved to Arizona, where she attended Arizona State University and graduated in 1985.[3] It is there that she met her future husband, Andy Spade. Katherine majored in journalism, while Andy majored in architecture.
After they completed their education, the couple had moved to New York City by 1986.[4] It was in New York that Katherine worked as a style editor for Mademoiselle, but left in 1991 (with the title of senior editor/head of accessories) to start her own handbag line.[5] To get inspiration, Kate browsed local flea markets and secondhand stores. She also researched the styles, fabrics, and potential production costs of making her own handbags. The team slowly worked their way up the social ladder until they were able to create a company that would be noticed by the public.
Early stages[edit]
Kate Spade New York was founded in 1993 by Katherine Noel Brosnahan and her husband/business partner Andy Spade. Kate Spade New York started after a suggestion from Andy when Katherine wasn't sure about her next career move after logging six years at Mademoiselle.[6] Originally, the business started out with the Sam handbag and was only making colorful lively bags for consumers.[3] Eventually, Andy withdrew $35,000 from his 401K account to fund the production of Kate’s handbags. Her debut line infused classic shapes, colors and fabrics into a now iconic square bag with a little black label sewn to the outside of the bag that said “Kate Spade New York.” Their main target market at this time was the upper middle class. In 1996, Spade's company opened its first shop in New York City's SoHo. Kate Spade rose in eight months after a journalist at Cleveland Research Co. recommended buying the shares because of the brand’s growth potential.[7] Everywhere people went in New York from about 1997-2000, it would have been impossible to avoid seeing women carrying that simple nylon bag. The business was one of the first of its time to go digital, by using iPads, cell phones, and computers, as a part of the daily routine when working at one of its stores. The company started from nothing, and after 1998 it started to expand, with sales totally $27 million. By 2006, revenue was reportedly near $99 million.[8] In 1999, Neiman Marcus Group paid $34 million for 56% stake of the company.[9] And in 2006, Neiman Marcus Group acquired the remaining 44% stake in Kate Spade.[10]
Later stages[edit]
In 2004, Kate Spade operated only 13 stores in the United States, and did not ship out of the country (Cohen 198). The company initially sold handbags, but eventually extended to include stationery, personal organizers, address books, shoes, beauty products, perfume, raincoats, pajamas, and eyewear clothing. It now has a full women's clothing line. The business’ clothing and handbag lines are featured in retail stores all across America. Products are easily and continuously shipped around the world. Control operation was given to Liz Claiborne in 2007, however Andy Spade was initially in charge of the company’s operations. By 2004, Kate Spade & Co. was worth $2.5 billion, not including the complimentary company Jack Spade.[11] Kate Spade has over 180 stores around the world, and is sold in more than 400 stores worldwide (Cohen 198). Kate and Andy went from taking “the nothing black bag” to a creative personalized purse, now they create merchandise from the simple tote to home decor and bedding. In November 2006, apparel giant Liz Claiborne Inc. bought Kate Spade for about $124 million from Neiman Marcus Group.[12] Kate Spade expanded their retail stores to include Kate Spade New York Outlets. The brand has over 47 outlet locations across the United States (Outlet Sheet). [13] The outlets offer Kate Spade New York handbags, clothing, jewelry, and accessories at a discounted price. Kate Spade New York Products are also sold in major department stores including Nordstrom, Macy's, and Dillard's. Kate Spade New York handbags, clothing, jewelry, accessories, and home products can be found in these major department stores. Kate Spade Home products are also sold at Bed, Bath and Beyond. As of January 2017, Kate Spade New York also debuted an exclusive collection with Williams-Sonoma including dinnerware, glassware, and flatware. (Williams-Sonoma, INC). [14]
Company[edit]

Merchandise[edit]
Kate Spade’s first handbag was sold in January 1993.[3] Shortly after the initial products were released new collections came out containing glasses, jewelry, and other small accessories (winter 36). In 2007, "kate spade at home" was launched as a home collection brand. It features bedding, bath items, china, and various items for the home and wallpaper. In April 2013, Kate Spade New York launched a new fragrance called Live Colorfully. Previous perfumes of the house include Kate Spade from 2003 and Twirl from 2010. Live Colorfully is a fragrance made in-house that marks the 20th anniversary of the brand. Each of Spade’s products sold are packaged, and each one has a card that gives a description of Kate and Andy’s journey to the top. Every product purchased also has its own protective carrying/travelling case, no matter the item. Even large tote bags come with a case.[7]
Jack Spade[edit]
Jack Spade, a fictional name, is the men's complement to the Kate Spade brand. The style of Jack Spade reflects different aspects than the Kate Spade New York Company does, and not only because it is a male line. While Kate Spade is a clean cut line that represents a sleek, upper east side, preppy style, Jack Spade is more of a rugged style. The styles are completely different because they are based on what trends that specific gender is wearing in the upper east side. Jack Spade is composed more of darker colors rather than bright lively colors(Winters 36). Its founder and principal designer was Andy Spade. In recent years, Kate Spade has been featuring designs and special editions by guest designers and is no longer the sole artistic vision of the husband and wife team. All the Jack Spade stores were permanently closed in January 2015, but the brand continued to sell online and at Nordstrom.[15]

Men's ClothingGuys, it’s time to update your wardrobe. Luckily for you, we’ve got all the staples and on-trend pieces your closet needs. Explore men’s clothing (including big & tall sizes), plus shoes and accessories to create outfits tailored for every occasion. And if you’re interested in a few helpful styling tips, then check out our Men’s Guide to Style. Don’t worry, you can thank us later.
First, let’s keep it casual. The keys to a great laid-back wardrobe are to pick pieces that fit well, are comfortable and are versatile. T-shirts and tees are a great place to start. Plain tees are simple and can be worn with anything. Bonus? They can double as undershirts in a pinch. Graphic tees are an easy way to show off your personality. Go with versions that showcase your interests, rep your favorite sports team or just look cool. Finish your chill shirt collection with a few polos—they’re a more polished option and can easily be dressed down or up.
Now that you’ve got your list of classic casual shirts, it’s time to focus on refreshing your collection of shorts and pants. From cargos and chinos to denim, we’ve got you covered. When it comes to jeans, especially, grab a few pairs in various washes—think light, medium and dark. Feeling adventurous? Colored denim provides a fresh update to your look. From skinny and slim fit to bootcut and relaxed, fit matters and you should always pick pairs that suit your frame and that you feel good in.
Let’s move on to pieces you’ll need to dress to impress. Look pulled together with suits, dress shirts, undershirts and men’s dress shoes. Take the opportunity to mix and match with sport coats and blazers. Pair them with dress pants or jeans for a modern feel (but only if if the dress code is more lenient). Whether you’re headed to the office, a wedding or special event, your stylish clothes will speak for themselves. Don’t forget accessories. Grab a wallet, cuff links, ties, belts and more to round out your look.
Whether you’re dressed up or down, you’ll need to layer up when it’s cold outside. Our collection of jacket, coats and vest will keep you warm. Throw on cozy sweaters and sweatshirts into your look, and for even more warmth, stock up on hats, scarves and gloves. Stick with Timberland boots and thicker fabrics that help trap heat—think wool, leather, cotton and more.
Oh, and we can’t forget workout clothes. Whether you live at the gym or are just getting back into an exercise routine, you’re going to need a solid collection of activewear. And on rest days (and every evening), pajamas and loungewear will come in handy. We’re here to help you look great every hour of the day. Find helpful styling tops and tricks with Macy’s Men’s Guide to Style.
Who’s ready for a wardrobe refresh? Shop men’s clothing, shoes, accessories and more at Macy’s.Looking for huge savings? Shop our Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Holiday Gift Guide!

15 Stores With the Best and Worst Return Policies
By Elyssa Kirkham
December 24, 2015










 Previously20 Best Things to Buy in 2016




1/18
Show ThumbnailsThe holiday shopping season is in full swing. As you're buying holiday gifts and checking off your shopping list, you should also keep in mind retailers' return policies. There's a good chance that something from your holiday shopping trips will get returned, since two-thirds (68.6 percent) of consumers indicated last year that they returned gifts most or some of the time, according to the National Retail Federation's Gift Receiving and Returning report. Fortunately, most retailers offer fair return policies — 90 percent of shoppers think they do.However, some return policies definitely favor customers more than others, GOBankingRates found in its annual survey of retailers' return policies. Looking at return time limits, receipt policies and other terms, this survey ranked 31 major retailers' return policies from best to worst. Click through to see the stores that make returns a breeze — and those with the worst return policies.Read: The Best and Worst Online Retailers for Holiday Savings

2/18
Show Thumbnails10 Best Return PoliciesThe best return policies make it simple and easy for customers to return or exchange a purchase if they aren't satisfied. In fact, many of the 10 best return policies place no time limits on returns, and some will accept exchanges and returns even for well-used items.These favorable return policies truly put the customer first, which is a huge help for a shopper struggling with a holiday spending hangover or a giftee dealing with a haul of unwanted presents. Click through to see the 10 stores with the most generous return policies this holiday season.

3/18
Show Thumbnails1. Nordstrom Return PolicyNordstrom made our list of the best return policies last year, and its generous policy put it among the best this year. Nordstrom is unique because it actually has no return policy. The store "handle[s] returns on a case-by-case basis with the ultimate objective of satisfying the customer," according to its website. The store's site also said it has a philosophy to ensure its customers are satisfied and will always try to deal with customers "fairly and reasonably."In practice, this gives Nordstrom team members a lot of flexibility on returns, which can work in the customer's favor. For instance, there is no time limit on returns or exchanges, and Nordstrom's return policy does not have any hard-and-fast rules against returning items without a receipt, without tags or that have been worn (special occasion dresses excluded). Nordstrom's online return policy is similarly generous, and return shipping is free.Shoppers should note that the Nordstrom Rack return policy is different, granting 90 days to return items and requiring returns to have original tags and receipt or packing slip.Related: 7 Top Credit Cards for Earning Rewards on Your Holiday Shopping

4/18
Show Thumbnails2. L.L.Bean Return PolicyLike Nordstrom, L.L.Bean's return policy focuses on making sure you're happy. "If your purchase isn't completely satisfactory, we're happy to accept your exchange or return at any time for items purchased directly from us," according to the L.L.Bean return policy page. L.L.Bean items can be exchanged or returned at any time with no limits — even after years of use.Having a receipt handy will make a return easier, but it is not required. Returns made without a receipt will be refunded in the form of store credit at the item's current selling price or replaced by an exchange for a similar item. Returns can also be completed by mail.

5/18
Show Thumbnails3. Bed Bath & Beyond Return PolicyBed Bath & Beyond makes returns relatively easy with few restrictions, accepting returns in store and by mail. The retailer even covers return shipping costs. The Bed Bath & Beyond return policy carries no time limit, which allows buyers to return a purchase at any time, with some exceptions. With a receipt, refunds are issued in the original form of payment, except for returns made with gift receipts, which are refunded with merchandise credit.Without a receipt, a Bed Bath & Beyond employee can look up a purchase made in the last 365 days. If a record can't be located, you can still get a refund — though it will be store credit equal to the item's current purchase price less 20 percent.

6/18
Show Thumbnails4. JCPenney Return PolicyJCPenney will make a full return at any time on its items. It also accepts returns and exchanges without a receipt. There's no indication that original packaging is always required, except on certain types of items, like electronics and special occasion dresses. Returns made without a receipt or with a gift receipt will receive store credit.While JCPenney is another retailer with no time limit on returns, it also has more exceptions to this rule for furniture, fine jewelry and electronics. Many of these types of items will also require a sales receipt for return. In general, however, JCPenney's return policy gives customers plenty of leeway to get an exchange or refund when they want it.

7/18
Show Thumbnails5. Costco Return PolicyCostco places no time limit on returns, and the store strives to "guarantee your satisfaction on every product we sell with a full refund." The Costco return policy allows for items to be returned at any time. Consumer electronics are the exceptions to this rule, but even these products receive a 90-day window for returns.Costco prefers customers include the original packaging and bring their receipt when possible. However, these aren't required, and employees will still "do our best to process your return without it." In most cases, because Costco requires a membership to shop at its stores, purchases can be looked up on the membership if the customer no longer has a receipt. Costco offers returns at its stores only and not through mail, except for large or heavy items for which the warehouse retailer can arrange pickup.

8/18
Show Thumbnails6. Staples Return PolicyStaples accepts returns in store and offers free online returns. Staples will accept returns from a customer at any time and for any reason — no time limits. Furniture and office electronics do carry a 14-day time limit for returns, but this time frame is extended for the holiday season to allow for gifts to be returned.Items returned to Staples must be in "salable condition" with the original packaging but can be returned with or without a receipt. If you can't provide a receipt, Staples will try to look up the purchase to give you a full refund in the original payment method. If it can't be located, you'll still get a refund for the item's lowest sale price in the last 30 days in the form of store credit.

9/18
Show Thumbnails7. Zappos Return PolicyAs an online retailer, Zappos' return policy sets the bar high: It gives customers 365 days to return items and provides free shipping labels for all returns. This is a huge convenience for online shoppers because shoes and apparel can be a different shade than expected or be less than flattering when tried on. With free return shipping, shoppers can buy items at Zappos knowing it'll be easy and free to return them if they turn out to be different than expected.Items must be in like-new condition and in their original packaging to qualify for a return to Zappos.com. Purchases are also tied to a Zappos account, so members of the site never have to worry about a misplaced receipt or packing slip.

10/18
Show Thumbnails8. REI Return PolicyItems purchased from REI can be returned at any time within 365 days, for any reason under the store's 100 percent satisfaction guarantee. You have a year to decide if you're satisfied with your purchase, and if you aren't, REI will replace or refund your purchase. REI will even accept returns on open and used items, though it clarifies that its guarantee doesn't cover damage from normal wear and tear, improper use or accidents.The only factor that kept REI out of the top five is its policy not to accept any returns or exchanges without proof of purchase — like a receipt, gift receipt or shipping invoice. Shoppers can sign up for an REI membership to tie purchases to their member number, which can be used to look up past purchases even without a receipt.

11/18
Show Thumbnails9. Macy’s Return PolicyMacy's return policy allows buyers to return a purchase at any time with no time limit, which is the main perk that made it one of the best return policies offered. Items returned with a gift receipt are only eligible for refunds via store credit.Shoppers can make returns without a receipt but only for store credit equal to the item's lowest selling price in the last 180 days. Items must also be unused, unworn and unwashed to be accepted for return.

Show Thumbnails10. Kohl’s Return PolicyCustomers of Kohl's have no time limit to contend with when returning items to this retailer, which helped put the Kohl's return policy among the top 10. Items can also be returned without a receipt. Kohl's employees can look up the purchases made in the last 12 months via a card number or other methods to give you a full refund. If you have no receipt and the purchase can't be found in the store's database, a refund will be issued in the form of merchandise credit.Read: 40 Ways to Save Money Over the Holidays

Show Thumbnails5 Worst Return PoliciesThe worst of the return policies surveyed by GOBankingRates had a few things in common: They have short time limits on returns, often don't accept returns without a receipt and have other terms that make returns trickier. The worst store, in fact, doesn't offer refunds at all — returns are only eligible for exchange or store credit.You'd better be sure about your purchases if you're shopping at the retailers with the worst return policies. Click through for the details on the five worst return policies.

14/18
Show Thumbnails1. Forever 21 Return PolicyForever 21's return policy is the worst of the retailers surveyed because it makes it harder for customers to get back their money once it's spent. Forever 21 only allows 21 days for returns, and purchases can only be exchanged for other items or refunded in store credit, not in the original form of payment. Items must also be unworn, unwashed and unused with tags still attached. Forever 21 will be extending its return window for the holidays this year, so ask the cashier about this at checkout.For online returns by mail, Forever 21's policy is slightly better. It extends the return window to 30 days and will refund the purchase to the credit card used to pay. The Forever 21 return policy also noted that final sale items, cosmetics and gift cards cannot be returned for a refund or exchange, except to correct a defect or error.

15/18
Show Thumbnails2. Kmart Return PolicyKmart allows just 30 days for customers to return items and does not accept returns made without a receipt. Customers making a return with a gift receipt can receive an exchange for store credit only.Many items will not be eligible for return if their packages are opened — including music, movies, video games and software. Kmart has no plans to offer an extended holiday return window this year, the retailer confirmed via Twitter.

16/18
Show Thumbnails3. Barnes & Noble Return PolicyThe window for returns allowed by Barnes & Noble is the shortest on our survey at just two weeks (14 days). Items must be unopened and returned in their original condition, per the Barnes & Noble return policy, though refunds will be issued in the original form of payment.The bookseller will not issue returns without a receipt or other proof of payment, and returns made with a gift receipt will receive refunds via store credit. Barnes & Noble did extend its return window last holiday season, CNBC reported.

17/18
Show Thumbnails4. GameStop Return PolicyGameStop allows just 30 days for returns and will make no returns without a receipt. Items returned with a gift receipt qualify only for exchanges or refunds in store credit.Pre-owned items can be returned for a refund within seven days or for an identical exchange within 30 days. GameStop's return policy requires that all items be returned with original packaging in "sellable condition" and reserves the right to refuse returns of opened items.

18/18
Show Thumbnails5. Sears Return PolicySears has one of the worst return policies. It does not allow returns without a receipt. The department store will only make returns for which the customer can provide a receipt or other proof of purchase within 30 days. Sears' return policy on gift receipts is to provide only exchanges or refunds via gift cards.Sears will extend its return on windows for the holidays, however, allowing items purchased by December 24 to be returned through Jan. 24, 2016. The original packaging is required for the return to be accepted, and some items will carry a 15 percent restocking fee, which will be deducted from the refund. Sears will not accept any returns of Christmas season items after December 25.Methodology: GOBankingRates surveyed the return policies of 31 major retailers popular during the holiday shopping season to determine the best and worst. GOBankingRates ranked each policy on (1) the return window provided, (2) whether the retailer accepted returns without a receipt, (3) the condition required for returns and (4) whether the store typically offered extended holiday returns. Other return policy terms unique to retailers were considered in the rankings as they benefited the customer.

I have NEVER had a problem returning an item at WalMart!  I go to Customer Service, give them the item and receipt and they immediately give me the money.

Chris
As a former sales manager in several department and big box stores, return policies are put in place with the best of intentions, but usually end up with the worst of results.  Liberal return policies allow a customer to use a product, sometimes for quite a while, before deciding the product didn’t work out or s/he simply wants a new one of the product purchased.  Many, many times my hands were tied because the return policy forced me to issue a credit or new merchandise six months or more after a product was purchased.  Obviously, exceptions have to be made when a item is defective a week after it was purchased.  But when an item such as a dress, handbag or jewelry is purchased for the sole purpose of one wearing to a prom or a wedding and then returned, or when someone brings back a beat up backpack because “it didn’t hold up” a year after its purchase, the store loses money.  Less profit means less payroll, which means fewer jobs.  Fewer people on the sales floor results in poor customer service, and low morale among the staff. In addition, many times large purchases are made during promotions in which free gifts or additional discount coupons are offered.  When the return is made, the gift or coupon is rarely if ever surrendered, allowing the customer to shop with a discount to which s/he would not otherwise be entitled.  Upper management more often than not will let the issue of the return of a well-worn item go, as the customer doing the return knows the last thing store personnel want is a scene.  In some cases (which happens more than one realizes), the word “lawsuit” or “discrimination” is used by a customer to ensure s/he gets his/her way.  Stores need to set realistic guidelines for returns, which are favorable to a customer yet maintain a level of business integrity.  Policies such a “lifetime guarantee” or “no questions asked” simply do not work in a society that demands what it wants when it wants it, but takes no responsibility for itself.

LOVE TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR OPINION ABOUT “Best Buy” which in
my experience is the absolute worst! From “restocking fee” to refusing to
make EXCHANGE of unUSED music CD’s nevrer opened! That has cost
Worst Buy ALL my apliance purchases. Dorm refrigerators to TV’s!

You show 17 stores, but you don’t say whether they are good or bad.

Jenny
I’m not sure why Macy’s is so high on the list, except that their return policy looks good on paper. I had two occasions where I tried to return an item, WITH receipt, within the allotted time period, and was told I had to return it to the Macy’s location where it was bought, and not just any Macy’s location. That’s difficult if you live in Dallas and a relative from New Orleans sent you the item as a gift. Seriously! I have to keep it or drive 9 hours to the exact same store? I thought it was a national chain. I haven’t shopped at Macy’s in 5 years because of that and I’ve instructed my entire family to never buy me things from there again.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
