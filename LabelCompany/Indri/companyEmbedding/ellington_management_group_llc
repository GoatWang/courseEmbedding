Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.

Investment Strategies | Ellington Management











































Ellington Investments

Toggle navigation












Investment StrategiesWe manage funds and accounts in four broad strategic areas:


DIVERSIFIED CREDIT STRATEGIES
Ellington’s diversified credit strategies seek to generate attractive returns through disciplined asset selection and hedging in a broad range of sectors, comprising residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, consumer debt, and corporate debt / leveraged loans.
Our investments include securitized products, unsecuritized loans, and synthetic credit positions, deployed in both U.S. and European markets.
We rely on our deep expertise, our proprietary models and research, and our extensive trading relationships to implement relative value investment strategies. Our objective is to capture a stable income stream while mitigating return volatility over time, with our core positions outperforming their associated hedges through excess cash flow and/or superior price performance.
We seek to generate additional alpha by providing liquidity to the market and investing in sectors requiring highly specialized capabilities. Ellington’s approach to portfolio management emphasizes active trading within and between sectors.
QUANTITATIVE MACRO STRATEGIES
Ellington’s quantitative macro strategy employs a multi-model approach to capture flow-induced alphas and to allocate tactically to mispriced risk premia. The strategy exploits a number of alpha sources that are not captured by trend followers. The strategy includes both directional and relative value models, and aims to generate uncorrelated absolute returns on a diversified portfolio of futures, interest rate swaps, foreign exchange, options and equities.
Over the past decade, Ellington has made significant investment in infrastructure and technology to support an active research agenda that drives ongoing strategy innovation and evolution. Our multidisciplinary, collaborative team includes professionals with complementary backgrounds in research, development and trading. We use advanced techniques from data sciences and machine learning, alongside deep expertise in global markets, to support our research efforts.
TRADITIONAL MANDATE SOLUTIONS
Ellington offers traditional mandate solutions, including long-only, lower risk, and index-based products for select institutional clients. Our experience navigating the rich and varied opportunity set in fixed income, equities, and futures allows us to add value through disciplined risk management, sector selection, and opportunistic trading, rather than through directional macroeconomic positions.
In addition, our proprietary portfolio management systems offer time-tested support for mandate-specific investment requirements, ranging from implementation of index- and duration-tracking strategies, to compliance with legal, regulatory, and tax constraints such as ERISA and UBTI. Ellington’s traditional mandate solutions benefit from access to the same portfolio managers, proprietary models, and market insights that guide our hedge fund strategies.
RMBS PREPAYMENT AND RELATED RELATIVE VALUE STRATEGIES
Our RMBS prepayment trading strategy has been a core strategy throughout the firm’s history. The founding partners’ expertise in mortgage derivatives and agency pools dates back to the early 1980s. The strategy employs time-tested, agent-based analytics to select attractive agency and non-agency mortgage derivatives, as well as agency pools with favorable prepayment characteristics.
The CMO and MBS derivatives markets were developed to disaggregate and reallocate risks inherent in MBS. The dearth of traditional buyers for MBS derivatives presents a persistent structural opportunity for those who understand these risks. Holding periods are typically relatively long, though the strategy also engages in opportunistic trading and sector rotation.

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

Investment Strategy


For Our Shareholders









            Utilizing a flexible and opportunistic investment strategy, Ellington Financial has built a portfolio of mortgage-related investments, consistently striving to deliver attractive returns to shareholders. Ellington Financial is externally managed and advised by Ellington Financial Management LLC (our "Manager" or "Ellington Financial Management"), an affiliate of Ellington Management Group, L.L.C. ("Elllington Management Group" or "EMG"), and thus benefits from EMG’s deep experience in the mortgage-related markets, highly analytical investment processes, operational expertise and resources, and extensive relationship base, providing significant competitive advantages.
        

            Additionally, an emphasis on risk management is fundamental to the Ellington Financial approach – driving attractive, risk-adjusted returns across market cycles and enabling us to identify and succeed in investment opportunities that we believe are consistent with our investment strategy. Ellington Financial’s understanding of the market across asset classes, over time, and through a highly analytical lens helps us to realize potential and unlock value.

A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.
