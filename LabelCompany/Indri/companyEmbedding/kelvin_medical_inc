Who is Kelvin Medical, Inc? 
Kelvin Medical Inc. is a recently organized company that engages in the development and sale of medical devices. The Company was founded to develop the product called Therm-N-Ice. Therm-N-Ice is a medical device designed to easily and conveniently provide contrast therapy to the human body.
. 

 
 
 












What is Contrast Therapy? 
Contrast therapy is the application of hot and cold packs on the skin of an injured area. It decreases pain, increases circulation, and speeds healing.  Contrast therapy is most often used on sports injuries, but it is also helpful for chronic or repetitive injuries, especially those in the sub-acute stages of healing.
Contrast therapy generally consists of applying ice, then heat, then ice again in a 1:2:1 ratio.  The ratio means that you will apply the heat for twice as long as you’ve applied the ice.  You always want to end with an ice application.
How does it work?
Ice therapy flushes all the blood out of an area, along with cellular debris, which speeds healing.  It also reduces pain as it numbs the area.
Heat application brings blood to the area, which has a twofold effect.  First, it (by definition) increases circulation and fills all the blood vessels in the area, down to the tiniest capillaries, with fresh blood; this reduces pain, releases tension, and reduces muscle cramping.  Second, it brings fresh nutrients to the area, which speeds up the healing process.
. 

 
 
 












What is Therm-N-Ice? 
Therm-N-Ice is a product conveniently straps to the body, provides consistent hot and cold treatments and keeps you on the go.
​Therm-N-Ice is a medical device that straps to your arm, leg, or can be placed in almost any body area and delivers continuous hot, continuous cold, or Contrast Therapy at the touch of a button. It has  been shown to deliver therapy from 3 to 5 hours. The best part is that it is reusable!
Now you can carry relief with you, feeling confident that you are getting the therapy that you need, when you need it. This technology has only just become viable due to advancement in battery technology and passive ways of creating hot and cold. The Engineers and Designers at Kelvin Medical are diligently working to bring this sorely needed device to you. Doctors and healthcare professionals  have advised in the development of this device and helped ensure that it meets people's needs.
. 

 
 
 












Why is Therm-N-Ice Important? 
A few years ago, the magnitude of minor sprains, strains and contusions that occur, both in sports related and routine daily living activities came to our attention. There are very large numbers of these injuries and many require some form of intervention. A portion of these are so minor that a cold pack is the best treatment, while others necessitate more significant treatment. Tennis elbow, for example, requires long term treatment of hot and cold therapy.
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) indicated that in 2007 there were 22,986,000 sprains, strains and contusions reported. Of these injuries, almost 60% occurred in the arm or leg, and 17.5% were in the torso, or spine and back. It turns out that leg, arm, and back injuries are commonplace given today’s lifestyle. Current health recommendations encourage us to exercise and keep fit. However, many of us remain out of shape. Accidents will occur to both the fit and the unfit although perhaps at different rates. Bruises and sprains are ordinary incidents and not unexpected. Almost every U.S.household has an ice pack and a hot water bottle. However, neither of these items are versatile enough to be readily mobile and both require time out from personal activities in order to use.
The reality of these statistics creates a vast opening for new treatment options to address these commonplace injuries. Therm-n-Ice provides a modern approach to sprains and strains, as well as improvements to the treatment options currently available.

Therm-N-Ice keeps you on the go. Doctors and nurses recommend a therapy that is difficult to self-administer. They tell you to use on and off heat applied to a cut or a bruise for the first 48 to 72 hours, then apply hot then cold at 15 to 20 minute intervals (Contrast Therapy). We all know that this is not an easy task, between microwaves and freezers, it is time consuming, full of distractions, and keeps us immobilized. Frankly, many people just  don't take the time to do it.
Therm-N-Ice is a medical device designed to upgrade this process. It uses modern technology to more easily deliver this important treatment. Therm-N-Ice straps to your arm or leg, or almost any body area and delivers continuous hot, continuous cold, or Contrast Therapy at the touch of a button.  Advancement i
n battery technology and passive ways of creating hot and cold temperatures allows it to continuously deliver therapy from 3 to 5 hours. The best part is that the battery is easily rechargeable!
Furthermore, Therm-N-Ice comes with an additional strap for tendon immobilization which has been shown to stop the tendons from rubbing against each other, helping to further  reduce pain. Therm-N-Ice can be programmed in advance to design individualized treatment protocols that specify the temperatures applied, as well as the length of each phase of therapy.
Therm-N-Ice has no chemicals to be applied to the skin and, unlike other products available, provides consistent hot and cold temperatures for the specified treatment period. Therm-N-Ice has systems in place that monitor the temperatures being used to eliminate any possibility of burns or frostbite from excessive use.  


Therm-N-Ice keeps you on the go and feeling confident that you are getting the therapy that you need, when you need it. It is conveniently portable so that you can carry it with you and apply treatment as prescribed throughout your busy day!

THERMAL SOLUTIONS FOR THE MEDICAL INDUSTRY


Our extensive experience within the MEDICAL MARKET has proven to be a valuable asset to our customers. Our expertise in thermal solutions for medical devices and analytical instruments has been a Kelvin Technologies hallmark for many years. Instrumentation used in the preparation and analysis of organic and inorganic materials requires precise control of process temperature. Depending on the type of sample, this process temperature may vary from 37°C for the analysis of biological cells to over 500°C for the analysis of inorganic materials. In addition, the differences in incubation periods that may arise will create an increased level of difficulty in maintaining a specific temperature profile. In most medical devices, heating gases or liquids will enhance both the patient’s comfort and ability to recover quickly.





Understanding all of these applicational requirements and having a broad base of market related knowledge gives Kelvin Technologies the ability to provide the best thermal solution for your application. For example, you can find our products in Sleep Apnea Machines and Dental Sterilizers, just to name a few.











Discover why we are considered the preferred supplier of high performance thermal solutions to the Medical Industry. We provide Innovation, Engineering Expertise and Technology you can trust.

What does it mean to update a profile?





Owler is a community of business professionals working together to build a database of company information. One contribution reaches thousands of members across the Owler community.
When you contribute on Owler you're shaping the database for all people consuming Owler data. Your updates will flow through to company profiles, competitive intelligence reports, daily snapshots and more. All verified members of the Owler community can update Owler profiles.  Members help the community by sharing data, such as a company's headquarters, and also by weighing-in on sentiment-based questions, such as CEO rating.
Community members make this all happen. That being said, each data update is reviewed by at least one other person to ensure accuracy. All updates are kept anonymous. Happy updating!
