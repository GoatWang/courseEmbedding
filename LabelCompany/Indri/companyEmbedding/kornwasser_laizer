						He was the former Senior Executive VP of Medco Health Solutions, reporting directly to the CEO, David Snow. He designed and ran their entire mail-order / specialty pharma business. Medco was found to have committed fraud in several lawsuits and admitted itself, including Rx fraud, Changing Diagnoses to obtain Rx's, faking doctor approvals, Medicare Fraud, Channel Stuffing, etc. The works. It's all public information.

Then ExpressScripts buys Medco and he is fired. Then he re-appears at Valeant, reporting directly to CEO Pearson until the brand new and mysterious title "Company Group Chairman"? His compensation is tied directly to skyrocketing sales, if sales grew by over 30% a year he was to get nearly 300,000 shares a year! That's like $60M/year he was making. Insane. From the day he started to when he mysteriously disappeared when questions started being asked about Valeant's accounting and sales, the share price rocketed from $60 to $260. That made Pearson a billionaire, and Laizer made tens of millions, perhaps a hundred million plus dollars :O Wow.

What's even more strange is he was hired January 2nd, 2013, which was the exact date Philidor was first incorporated.

Hrm.. what do you guys think? Looks like Andrew Left's style of writing too. Pretty damning stuff.

Did Laizer drive Ferrari's and the like at Philidor? That's one rich 40-year old exec.

						Wow.

This sure sounds familiar.

http://www.falseclaimsact.com/case/medco-health-solutions-final-185-million-settlement

Improper practices alleged in the Complaints and covered in the Settlement Agreement include:

    Cancelling, destroying or re-entering prescriptions into its prescription database system to report a later and inaccurate prescription “receive date” for the purpose of showing that Medco had met contractual turnaround performance standards, or for avoiding contractual penalties;
    Cancelling prescriptions in doctor call, drug utilization review (“DUR”) and other pharmacy areas without attempting to clarify the prescription with the physician or patient;
    Dispensing prescriptions without properly performing DUR, without screening, and without appropriately contacting prescribers after screening;
    Failing to interpret or evaluate prescriptions and resolve any errors or ambiguities in accordance with state laws, regulations and standards of practice;
    Improperly using pharmacy technicians and other non-pharmacist personnel to perform functions which must, by law, be performed by pharmacists, or under a pharmacist’s direct supervision;
    Submitting claims for prescriptions where Medco dispenses less than (i.e., “shorted”) the quantity prescribed by the physician and billed by Medco;
    Establishing managerial structures and practices which had the foreseeable effect of causing inadequate supervision of pharmacy personnel and interfering with professional pharmacists’ ability to exercise independent professional judgment;
    Imposing production quotas on professional and support personnel within mail order pharmacies, which had the foreseeable effect of interfering with the professional obligation of pharmacists to adequately ensure clarification of prescription drug orders with prescribers prior to dispensing;
    Fabricating records of calls to physicians in connection with doctor call, DUR, managed care, and other required physician contacts, and otherwise creating false records of contact with physicians;
    Shipping and billing the Government for drugs without ensuring that the correct number, strength, dosage, and type of drugs were dispensed;
    Failing to provide accurate, complete, timely and reliable information to patients and physicians concerning the reasons for, costs relating to, and effect of drug switches, in order to induce them to approve the switch, or withdraw their objection to the switch; and
    Switching or changing patients’ prescriptions to different, more expensive or less effective drugs by providing false, misleading, or incomplete information or without the knowledge or consent of the patient or physician, or without approval of the relevant plan.

						as someone who was at medco same time as Mr. Kornwasser I would tell u to check your facts more carefully before posting this type of stuff.  for starters, he didnt run the specialty or mail order pharmacy business, anyone there at the time can tell you that.  And the lawsuits you mention were dealing with issues dating many years before he (and most of us) were ever hired at medco.  that, too, is easy to check thru publicly available information.

						Other companies use the Company Group Chairman title including JnJ. 

Comp plan was same for anyone that got stock in the company- a multiplier of shares based on stock performance. Directors, VPs, and on up had this plan- probably 30+ people at teh company. All the same accept Pearson's multiplier had no limit which was only unequal aspect of the plan. Oddest thing about comp has been multi-milion signing bonuses of recent hires. 

How do you know he was fired from previous job? May have wrong information there. 

You're misinformation destroys the credibility of any good points you may raise. 

Also your math calcs need work. Nowhere near hundred milion.

						I just did the math, would have gotten base salary, $550K plus around 200,000 shares a year. If he was there for 2.5 years that's $1.375M + 500K shares, if he sold after he left at around $260 that works out to $131.75 million, excluding bonuses on his salary.

And yes, you worked at MedCo? Were you a channel stuffer? The Rx faker? The Medicare fraud guy?

And what did Mr. Kornwasser do? He reported directly to the CEO so he obviously had to be involved.

Is that you Laizer? You seem to know Valeant inside out, including the bonus structure that most outsiders wouldn't know, and you were the only one to work at MedCo as far as I can tell....... Actually Company Group Chairman was created for you (Laizer Kornwasser) and the 2 guys from Medicalis, who were also both execs when it was convicted of fraud multiple times for stock fraud. 

My my!

						Laizer, you really goofed there!

Nice try!

From your own biography:

Laizer D. Kornwasser joined Valeant in February 2013 as Executive Vice President/Company Group Chairman. Previously, he was a Senior Executive at Medco Health prior to its acquisition by Express Scripts. At Medco, he reported directly into the CEO and was a member of the Executive Committee. He served as Senior Vice President, Consumer Solutions and Retail Markets and was responsible for retail network and mail pharmacy products and strategy. He oversaw network pricing, negotiations, plan designs and programs that maximized the retail and mail channels. Mr. Kornwasser was also responsible for the integrated care solution for Medco's six million members with diabetes. He joined Medco in August 2003, and was initially responsible for building a business development team, post spin-off from Merck. In this role he oversaw all acquisitions, joint ventures and was actively involved in developing the company's long-term growth strategy. He later assumed responsibility for the companies' channel and generic drug strategy and was President of its diabetes division, which focused on direct to consumer solutions.

Laizer? Is that you? You had to be an insider at Valeant management to know the compensation structure, and only one person was ever hired from MedCo at Valeant.

						MedCo was known for being the most fraudulent pharma co., but was never nailed with criminal penalties (rumours are corrupt officials were paid off).

Anwyays, after dozens of lawsuits against medCo (of which Laizer was basically CEO), they settled and the Bush admin forced them into a corp compliance agreement.

Every type of fraud was admitted to.

There are so many lawsuits and prosecutions for fraud at Medco it is unbelievable.

The most recent lawsuit was filed Oct 23 in delaware. Furthermore, it details exactly how Laizer got around the fed agreement.

Laizer gave himself away in the Laizer thread. He's shitting himself. He's going down hard, wouldn't be surprised if he dies alone in a cell in a penn. he made hundreds of millions with pearson cooking the books, well fuck him. Time to pay your dues motherfucker.
