Phillip Ford, former executive vice president of the Charleston Home Builders Association for the past 14 years, has accepted a similar position in Fort Myers, Fla.File/Leroy Burnell/Staff
































































































The longtime head of one of Charleston's leading real estate groups has moved on.Phillip Ford, who served as executive vice president of the Charleston Home Builders Association for the past 14 years, has accepted a similar position with the Lee Building Industry Association in Fort Myers, Fla.His last day in Charleston was Nov. 11. He wasted little time starting the new job. His first day was Nov. 14.Ford said he enjoyed his time in Charleston, but he is looking forward to a new chapter in his life."We just decided we were looking for a new adventure, and it was a good opportunity," he said. "I had a fabulous 14 years and a great time."The association's board of directors has formed a committee to search for Ford's replacement and is accepting applications."We are beginning to interview people and go through that process right now," said Richard Jackson, of JacksonBuilt Custom Homes on Daniel Island and president of the home builders group.Jackson expects the process to take a couple of months during the national search to fill the position.Jackson said he is happy for Ford and believes the change at the top will give the agency a chance to bring in someone new with fresh ideas.In the interim, he is the go-to person for questions about the agency until Jan. 1, when Tori Stein of Stein Renovation & Design Group of West Ashley will become president.Building blocksTwo longtime Charleston-area building suppliers are merging under one roof with a new name.Carolina Supplies and Materials of 2115 Monrovia St. on the upper peninsula recently purchased the assets of Carolina Building Materials and Salvage Inc. at 2440 Meeting St. Road in North Charleston, said Blake Pearce, owner and operator of Carolina Supplies.The new company will become Carolina Building Materials LLC and operate out of 2440 Meeting St. as the two businesses come together over the next six months. The purchase includes the warehouse, land and other facilities, Pearce said.Carolina Supplies is a masonry and hardscape supply retailer while Carolina Building Materials is a supplier of windows, doors, cabinets, flooring, lumber, millwork and hardware.“The new company will be a one-stop shop for the homeowner and contractors for any of the related products," Pearce said.Michael Vaughan, who owned and operated Carolina Building Materials for the past 40 years, has retired, but his brother Steve Vaughan and all of the other employees will remain.“This was such a great opportunity to not only continue operating the masonry company on the peninsula of Charleston but it also diversifies our product offerings by combining both companies together," Pearce said."We are also hoping to fill the void in the building supply industry on the peninsula that will occur when Hughes Lumber closes its doors in the near future,” he said.The Hughes Lumber site is slated to become a seven-story parking deck with apartments and businesses bookending the development between Mary and Reid streets.Hughes Lumber is currently liquidating its assets.Changing handsA 98-unit townhome complex in North Charleston recently changed hands. Oakridge Townhomes at 4320 Bonaparte Drive off Dorchester Road sold Oct. 31 for $5.05 million.The buyer was Bonaparte Marseilles Townhomes LLC, an arm of real estate investment firm URS Capital Partners of Huntington, N.Y. The seller was Tamsberg Oakridge LLC of Georgetown.New officeGolden Bear Realty is now open at 1900 Seabrook Island Road. The office originally scheduled a grand opening in October but it was delayed because of Hurricane Matthew. The agency, headed by Mike Nicklaus, son of golfing legend Jack Nicklaus, has another office on Coleman Boulevard in Mount Pleasant.Reach Warren L.

NorthMarq Capital arranges acquisition financing of $3,787,000 for Lakes of Oakridge in North Charleston, South Carolina


GREATER WESTCHESTER NY/CT (November 8, 2016) – Robert W. Ranieri, senior vice president/managing director of NorthMarq Capital’s Greater Westchester New York/Connecticut-based regional office arranged acquisition financing of $3,787,000 for Lakes of Oakridge, a 76-unit multifamily property located in North Charleston, South Carolina. The transaction was structured with a 7-year term with one year of interest only on a 30-year amortization schedule. NorthMarq arranged financing for the borrower, Bonaparte Marseilles Townhomes LLC, through Freddie Mac’s floating rate program. 
“This was a ‘value-add’ play where the buyer wanted to take advantage of the Freddie Mac floating rate program,” said Ranieri.
