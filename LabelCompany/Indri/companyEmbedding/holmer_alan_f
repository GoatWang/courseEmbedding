Alan F. Holmer, JD Biography


Title: 
Director of Inspire Pharmaceuticals Inc.


Position: 
Pro to the question "Should Prescription Drugs Be Advertised Directly to Consumers?"


Reasoning: 


					"Direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising is an excellent way to meet the growing demand for medical information, empowering consumers by educating them about health conditions and possible treatments. By so doing, it can play an important role in improving public health...

Direct-to-consumer advertising that encourages millions of Americans to consult their physicians can help to improve public health because a number of leading diseases are under diagnosed and under-treated...

Direct-to-consumer advertising is a highly effective way to communicate the availability of treatments to the public. In 1992, the first DTC consumer television advertisement for a nicotine patch aired during the Super Bowl. According to the American Association of Advertising Agencies (AAAA), the public response was so great that, within weeks, demand for the patches exceeded the supply. The product had been available for months, but people who might have been interested in quitting smoking were simply not aware of it.

Advertising promoted widespread awareness overnight, prompted patient-physician conversations, and may have helped many people to stop smoking.

Pharmaceutical companies have both a right and a responsibility to inform people about their products under the supervision of the FDA, which regulates prescription drug advertising. Companies are committed to responsible advertising that enhances the patient-physician relationship and encourages the appropriate use of prescription drugs under a physician's supervision. While such advertising prompts more people to seek professional help, it does not dictate the outcome of the physician visit or the kind of help patients eventually receive.

Direct-to-consumer advertising merely motivates patients to learn more about medical conditions and treatment options and to consult their physicians."

MANAGED CARE  April 2001Q&AA Conversation with Alan F. Holmer: Terms of Coverage for Elderly Top Priority for Drug IndustryWith the ever-rising cost of prescription drugs generating an outcry to reform Medicare, PhRMA's president finds himself in the eye of the storm. 














As president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, Alan F. Holmer represents the country's largest research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The organization lobbies on behalf of its members in Washington and state capitals. PhRMA's federal legislative priority this year is expansion of drug coverage for the elderly. Other recent battles have included Maine's attempt to impose price controls on prescription drugs and efforts to allow exported prescription drugs to be brought back to the United States for sale.
Holmer, head of PhRMA since 1996, began his career working as a congressional staffer and as a tax lawyer. In 1981, President Reagan appointed him deputy assistant to the president for intergovernmental affairs, with responsibility for liaison with state and local officials. From there, he went on to positions in the Commerce Department and in the Office of the U.S. trade representative.
He established and became cochairman of international trade practice for the law firm Sidley & Austin in 1989.
Holmer has served as an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center and as a guest lecturer at various law schools and universities. The coauthor or editor of three books, he graduated with honors from Princeton University in 1971 and Georgetown University Law Center in 1978. He spoke recently with Senior Contributing Editor Patrick Mullen.
MANAGED CARE: What issues are at the top of PhRMA's agenda?
ALAN F. HOLMER: By far, the pharmaceutical industry's top priority in 2001 is to achieve enactment of expanded prescription-drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. We're committed to trying to achieve that, ideally during this calendar year but certainly in this congressional cycle.
MC: What do you think of the Medicare prescription-drug proposal that the Bush administration has put forward?
HOLMER: We're pleased by the emphasis that President Bush has placed on this issue, and we're taking a careful look at his proposal. As we look at specific proposals, we think that seniors should have the same kind of health care options that members of Congress have, including prescription-drug coverage. That kind of coverage would help senior citizens in two ways. First, they would have access to discounts on medicines that their health plans are able to negotiate with pharmacies and manufacturers. These pharmacy and manufacturer discounts combined average somewhere between 30 and 39 percent. Second, because of these discounts with many health plans, seniors would make copayments as opposed to paying the full retail price for the medicine.
MC: Do you have any concerns about how heavily President Bush's Medicare drug benefit proposal leans on the states as the delivery mechanism? Are you concerned that it might not be administered evenly or that there might be some delays as states go about implementing the program?
HOLMER: The key aspect of this from our perspective is to make sure that the delivery mechanism is through the private sector. Two proposals seem to be getting the greatest attention in the Congress. One is the bill that passed the House last year introduced by Congressman Bill Thomas, now chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and Speaker Dennis Hastert. The other is the Breaux-Frist bill that was introduced last year and has been reintroduced this year. While we have some issues with those proposals, we think that they get the basic architecture of the benefit correctly. We look forward to working with all members of Congress — Republicans and Democrats — and with the Bush administration to try to get this done at the earliest possible time. We're also going to take care that we do it in a manner that's consistent with our core principles, including looking at the issue from the perspective of patients. We want to make sure that patients are able to choose from a variety of competing health plans, so that they will be able to select overall health coverage and a prescription-drug benefit that best meets their individual needs.
MC: Beyond the prescription-drug-benefit proposal, what changes in the regulatory environment do you expect because of the change of administrations?
HOLMER: It's a little early to tell. Obviously, we don't yet have a new administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration. Nor has there been an announcement of the new head of the Food and Drug Administration. So I think it's a little early to be able to comment on the regulatory climate in Washington. One example of what we might expect comes out of the president's budget. We're very pleased to see continued strong support for funding the National Institutes of Health. There's an extremely positive and synergistic relationship between the NIH and the pharmaceutical companies, and we're very pleased to see that continuing in the Bush administration. To the extent that issues of interest have been raised in the comments of some cabinet members during their confirmation hearings, I think there is recognition of the importance of making sure that policy proposals coming from the executive branch continue to nurture biomedical innovation.
MC: What are some examples?
HOLMER: First is strong support for basic biomedical research, which we see in the president's budget with respect to the NIH. Second, there needs to be continued strong support for intellectual property protection. Ambassador Robert Zoellick, the new U.S. trade representative, made comments during a Senate Finance Committee hearing that I think show he recognizes the tremendous importance of strong intellectual property protection. Third, we have to make sure that there is a transparent and efficient regulatory environment through the Food and Drug Administration. That will depend to a significant degree on who the new FDA commissioner turns out to be. Certainly all of the conversations that we've had with officials in the Bush administration underscore their commitment to ensuring that we have an efficient and transparent regulatory environment at the FDA. Fourth, it is imperative that pharmaceutical companies be able to sell their products in a free market environment that recognizes the extraordinary risks these companies face in getting their products to market. I think there's a strong commitment on the part of the Bush administration to market principles and market mechanisms and opposition to price controls, which would have a significantly negative impact on the pharmaceutical industry. A fifth key element is to make sure we have a global business environment that allows the American-based pharmaceutical industry to capitalize on its comparative advantages. That requires adhering to free trade principles and expanding free trade. We see strong support on the part of the Bush administration for continuing to nurture an environment that allows for a strong pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry.
MC: You mentioned free-market principles. That raises the issues of price controls. Recently a court in Maine threw out an attempt to impose price controls on drugs in that state. What was wrong with the attempt in Maine, and should there be any curbs at all on the market?
HOLMER: Private-sector mechanisms can work very effectively to control costs. Imposing price controls would discourage private investment in drug research and development and will lead to a reduction in revenues to the pharmaceutical companies. If you reduce revenues to the companies, inevitably that's going to have a negative impact on their ability to continue their extraordinary record in research and development. I know an example from my own personal perspective. My 21-year-old son and 18-year-old daughter have cystic fibrosis, and my kids aren't alone. Millions of Americans who have life-threatening diseases are waiting for better treatments and better cures. We're tantalizingly close to coming up with a cure for cystic fibrosis. To the extent that price controls are imposed on the pharmaceutical industry, you're going to make the choices even more difficult for the companies with respect to what diseases they have an opportunity to focus their research on and which projects they're just not going to be able to fund. One reason the United States leads the world in pharmaceutical innovation by far is because we have a free-market environment. I think there's strong recognition across the country that people don't want to harm the wonderful records that companies have been able to achieve in bringing new medicines to market. Having said that, are there senior citizens who don't have drug coverage and who need help with paying for their medicines? Absolutely. That's why we are so committed to making sure that a prescription-drug proposal that will expand coverage for seniors is enacted into law at the earliest possible time, hopefully this year.
MC: Do you think a Medicare benefit will diffuse the political pressure that has arisen? Last fall, Senate candidates taking busloads of seniors across the border to Canada to buy less expensive prescription drugs became a regular part of several campaigns.
HOLMER: I think that pressure will be reduced. Senior citizens who go to Canada to buy their medicines usually don't have prescription-drug coverage. Therefore, they're paying full retail price for prescriptions. They don't yet have the benefit of discounts that health plans negotiate on behalf of patients they represent. If you can get a private-sector-oriented prescription-drug plan enacted into law, that will provide those senior citizens with those discounts, plus the overall benefits that come with having insurance. Political pressure is so high on this issue because that insurance coverage does not presently exist for a significant portion of our senior citizens. About one-third of our senior citizens don't presently have prescription-drug coverage.
MC: What would you say to those who are critical of the drug industry spending research money on what are considered lifestyle drugs, such as Rogaine or Viagra?
HOLMER: Most current so-called "lifestyle drugs" were discovered while testing a medicine for a life-threatening disease. For example, a medicine that stimulates hair growth in men was discovered during the testing of a drug that was intended to treat prostate disease. The vast bulk of research dollars spent by pharmaceutical companies are directed toward life-threatening conditions.
MC: How well do you think the public understands that, especially given the enormous amounts being spent on direct-to-consumer advertising of lifestyle drugs? Does that skew perception of the pharmaceutical industry's priorities?
HOLMER: It's a good question. As far as direct-to-consumer advertising, people often don't realize this, but we have an enormous problem in this country with respect to undertreatment and underdiagnosis of disease. The American Diabetes Association will tell you that there are 6 million Americans who are unaware of the fact that they have diabetes. Yet about 15 percent of all health care costs in this country are related to diabetes. One-third of people who suffer from severe depression in this country never even seek treatment for it. Millions of Americans have high blood pressure but don't seek treatment for it. The more information we can get out there, so that patients can become more informed and have more informed conversations with their doctors, the better off those patients and our health care system will be. I was with the head of a major patient organization earlier this week. She had exactly the same attitude: That as more patients become personally involved in their own health care, the fact that pharmaceutical companies are providing more information about new cures and treatments benefits patients and the health care system.
MC: As people become more involved in their own health care, do you see consumer demand changing the focus of some pharmaceutical research?
HOLMER: I don't know the answer to that. Individual companies are going to make their own decisions as to how they're going to spend their research dollars. I'd leave that to them.
MC: How is the Internet changing the marketing of drugs, the information people have about prescription drugs, and the expectations they have when they walk into a doctor's office?
HOLMER: A Harris poll found that 70 million Americans went online to search for information about health in the last year. So the Internet is obviously an important and powerful communications tool. But despite the growth and use of the Internet with respect to pharmaceutical prescriptions, the doctor still holds the prescribing pen. If patients are going to be able to purchase medicines on the Internet, it should be with the doctor's diagnosis and a legal and valid prescription.
MC: Aren't more patients walking into doctors' offices armed with information they've downloaded about a new drug, wondering why they're not getting it?
HOLMER: I'm sure that occurs. Again, the more information patients have and the more informed conversations they can have with their doctors about new treatments, including medicines, the better off they'll be and the better care they'll receive. This is the Information Age. As consumers gain access to more information, their ability to have informed conversations with their doctors and make intelligent decisions will be enhanced. That's an extremely good thing.
MC: With the recent mapping of the human genome, the pharmaceutical industry appears to be on the verge of revolutionary change. How is that playing out so far, and where do you see it going?
HOLMER: Our survey last year found 369 biotechnology medicines in development, up from 83 in 1988. About half are in development for cancer, 39 for infectious diseases including hepatitis C and malaria, 28 for neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's, and 26 for heart disease like coronary artery and congestive heart failure. Genetic research affects all drug development, not just our companies' cutting-edge biotechnology research. The research helps us to understand how the body works and what goes wrong in specific diseases. I've seen this on a personal level with respect to cystic fibrosis research and gene therapy, a new field involving replacing genes that are malfunctioning in some way. I recently saw a fascinating piece in the Washington Post about cystic fibrosis research at the University of Pennsylvania. The challenge for cystic fibrosis research is that they know what the defective gene is and how to fix it, but they haven't found a mechanism to deliver the corrected gene into the body in a way that won't be rejected. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania are taking all the bad stuff out of the AIDS virus and the Ebola virus and using them, which are effective at latching onto the human body, to deliver the new cystic fibrosis gene. I don't know what kind of promise that holds, but it shows the kind of breathtaking developments that are occurring with respect to gene therapy and other aspects of genetic research.
MC: Are we talking about companies conducting the same kind of research as in the past, using new tools, or are we looking at the emergence of a new industry?
HOLMER: I don't think it's a new industry, but it is providing a substantial expansion of the targets of opportunity that researchers will be able to use.
MC: Over the years, physicians and members of managed care plans have found it difficult to prescribe the drug they want because it's not on the plan's formulary. Is this the right way to run a drug-delivery system within a managed care setting, or are there other ways of doing it that make more sense?
HOLMER: There are a variety of private-sector mechanisms that can be used to help contain the overall costs of prescriptions. Some may involve use of formularies. Our view is that if formularies are used, decisions regarding inclusion or exclusion of a drug from a formulary should be based on sound clinical information that is reviewed by trained health care professionals. We believe any decision to include or exclude a particular medication should consider the value for the patient, insurer, and employer in terms of positive health outcomes — with particular emphasis on quality-of-life improvements. It's imperative that prescribers and patients be well informed about how decisions are made with regard to the formulary and how to obtain a nonformulary product.
MC: Why does PhRMA oppose reimportation of prescription drugs, which some argue could bring down drug costs in this country?
HOLMER: Reimportation of medicines is a terrible idea. Going back to 1969, every FDA commissioner — Republican and Democrat — has raised concerns about reimportation. The key issue here is control of a product's chain of custody. Any reimportation plan enacted into law would significantly increase risk of harm to patients, risk that they'd be getting counterfeit products without realizing any real savings. It's important to remember that in 1988, after lengthy hearings and consideration, particularly by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Congress overwhelmingly passed a landmark consumer-protection law that prohibited reimportation of medicines that were outside the manufacturer's control. We believe that Congress made the right decision in 1988, and it does not make sense to change that. When the House considered this bill on the floor last year, John Dingell said, "Make no mistake, this reckless legislation never went through the committees with expertise or experience in these matters. It is going to lead to needless injuries and deaths." We thought that then-Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala made the right decision in December 2000, when she announced that she could not implement the law because she could not certify that patients would be safe or there would be significant savings to consumers. It's possible that current HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson is going to review that decision, and that's fine by us. We believe that if he carefully reviews whether this reimportation provision can be implemented safely, if he talks to the U.S. Customs Service, the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the FBI, he will reach what we believe is an inescapable conclusion: You cannot allow reimportation of these products from overseas without putting our nation's medicine supply at risk.
MC: Thank you.Tags: Q&A

Growing Importance of Rules of Origin in a Global Market 
By Bello, Judith H.; Holmer, Alan F.

Article excerpt

Growing Importance Of Rules of Origin In a Global Market    It wasn't very long ago that a product's origin was largely irrelevant unless the label read "Made in the USSR" (or another Communist country). Now a product's origin can open or shut doors and may mean the difference between a company's skyrocketing sales or going out of business in that product line.    What changed, and what does this change mean for U.S. companies in today's global marketplace of conglomerate products with parts melded from many origins?    What has changed over the last two decades is the development of tariff preferences, which have opened markets for some countries' products; and proliferating "buy national" requirements, voluntary restraint agreements, and anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders, which have closed markets for others.    For example, in 1975 the United States instituted the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), under which eligible products of specific developing countries can enter the United States duty free. However, to ensure that these tariff preferences are not used by other parties, the Trade Act establishing the GSP program includes a strict rule of origin. This rule allows the Customs Service to determine which products are, and which are not, eligible for GSP duty-free treatment.    Normally, preferential treatment of certain countries would violate the fundamental rule of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which was signed in the late 1940s by major western developed nations and governs most international trade in goods and services. Article I of the agreement requires all GATT parties to accord each other most-favored-nation treatment in tariff matters. But because its GSP program is designed to assist maturing countries in their economic development, the United States obtained a waiver from the GATT's most-favored-nation requirements.    Another example of preferential treatment under U.S. tariff laws is the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which went into effect last year, under which all tariffs on imports from Canada will be eliminated by 1999 (MR September 1989, p. 47). To ensure that the benefits of this agreement accrue only to Canada and the United States, negotiators worked hard to develop a more objective, predictable rule of origin than the traditional, highly subjective rule of "substantial trasformation." Their success is enshrined in Chapter III of the FTA and responds to the demands of the business communities on both sides of the border for greater certainty in our bilateral trade relations. The FTA preferential tariff treatment does not violate the GATT, because one of the GATT articles authorizes more favorable treatment to countries with which a GATT party is associated in a customs union or free trade agreement.    The United States is not the only GATT party with tariff preferences for developing countries. The European Community, for example, has long accorded tariff preferences to imports from principally North African countries that formerly were colonies of EC member states, such as Morocco, formerly a colony of France.       NON-TARIFF DISCRIMINATION    Because of the growing trend to provide more favorable trade treatment of some developing countries, GATT members increasingly have had to decide how to determine a product's origin. The need is further exacerbated by several market-restricting developments, such as the proliferation of voluntary restraint agreements (VRAs). Under the VRA concept, a foreign government restricts exports of certain products to particular destinations to reduce bilateral trade tensions and avoid legislated import restraints - quotas - in the importing country. But VRA enforcement depends on being able to ascertain the imports' origin; that is, did goods arriving at the importing country's shores originate in the country that "voluntarily" restrained exports, or did they originate in third countries? …

Holmer is positioning the organization to address criticisms of the industry and convey to the world at large the benefits that drug manufacturers have achieved in saving lives and enhancing the quality of life. “I had spent my entire career preparing for the job at PhRMA.” That’s how Alan Holmer describes his experience before taking on the top job at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. The president and CEO of PhRMA finds both challenges and rewards in his position, but this is a role that Mr. Holmer is more than qualified to fill. An early introduction to politics through his father, years of experience in the political arena — serving senators, the White House, as well as various government departments — and in depth experience as a tax lawyer and later as an international trade lawyer representing, among other clients, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, now PhRMA, give Mr. Holmer the grounding he needs to represent the pharmaceutical industry. In his seven years at PhRMA, Mr. Holmer has done much to raise the profile of the organization as an advocate and lobbying body. His efforts are instrumental in positioning PhRMA to counter the industry’s critics. In spite of PhRMA’s many successes, challenges remain, including further bolstering the industry’s image in the face of very public attacks from congressional representatives and negative media coverage. To meet these challenges, Mr. Holmer draws on the advice and ideas of his staff, the collective strength of the industry, and his own experiences.BOX: Alan Holmer’s efforts are instrumental in positioning PhRMA to counter the pharmaceutical industry’s critics.BOX: Bringing it All Together IN AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH PHARMA VOICE, ALAN F. HOLMER, PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA,TALKS ABOUT HIS DEEP APPRECIATION OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY AND HIS VISION FOR BRINGING ALL HEALTH CARE ADVOCATES TOGETHER.CAN YOU TALK ABOUT SOME OF YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS AT PhRMA OF WHICH YOU ARE MOST PROUD? Last year, I did a five year retrospective on where PhRMA was compared with where the organization had been five years before. PhRMA has grown significantly — in terms of numbers of people and resources — and is much more effective as an advocacy organization today. Our critics often sum up best what strong advocates we are. Senator Charles Schumer, who sponsored a bill in 2002 that would have reduced the incentives for pharmaceutical innovation, attributed to PhRMA the fact that the bill was not enacted. He said, “Obviously, if there were no PhRMA, this bill would be law by now.PhRMA pulls out all the stops.”WHAT MOST INSPIRES YOU ABOUT THE PHARMA INDUSTRY? What the industry has done for my children.My son and daughter both have cystic fibrosis and take medicines that are inhaled into their lungs, one of which is Pulmozyme, which is manufactured by Genentech. Pulmozyme helps to liquefy the mucus in the lungs so germs don’t as readily become trapped there; this allows patients to breathe better so they can live better. My son takes an inhaled antibiotic called TOBI, which is manufactured by Chiron. These medicines have had a huge impact on my children’s health and the quality of their lives. When our son was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis on March 15, 1980, my wife and I were told that his likely life expectancy was going to be about 18 years. But through the grace of God, terrific medical care, the help of the pharmaceutical industry, and some luck he’s now in his early 20s. He teaches English and religion at DeMatha High School in Hyattsville, Md.,has been an outstanding athlete,and his lung function is more than 90% of normal.My daughter also is doing very well. She is 20 and is a sophomore at West mont College in Santa Barbara, Calif.YOU SERVE ON THE COUNCILS AND BOARDS OF A LARGE NUMBER OF HEALTHCARE AND PHARMACEUTICALORGANIZA TIONS. HOW IMPORTANT ARE THESE ROLES IN MAINTAINING A BROAD PICTURE OF INDUSTRY CHALLENGES AND ACHIEVEMENTS AS A WHOLE? In the pharmaceutical industry generally,too often we spend too much time talking to each other,and it’s very important we spend time talking to other stakeholders in the healthcare community.For example,recent ly I spent three hours at the National Health Council,which is an organization that brings together representatives from a wide variety of voluntary health agencies such as the American Heart Association, the Epilepsy Foundation, and other similar organizations. Having a broad perspective about how others perceive the pharmaceutical industry and what their priorities are in terms of a patient centered healthcare system is very beneficial.WHAT LED TO YOU BEING THE RECIPIENT OF THE 2001 MARRIOTT LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD PRESENTED BY THE ARTHRITIS FOUNDATION? AND HOW MUCH DOES THAT AWARD MEAN TO YOU PERSONALLY AND AS HEAD OFPhRMA? I was very pleased to accept that award,not on behalf of myself,but on behalf of the industry that I’m privileged to represent in Washington, D.C. Our companies have a number of medicines on the market for arthritis and have many other medicines that are in the pipeline.CHART: ENACT A COMPREHENSIVE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT IN MEDICARE. A marketbased drug benefit that gives beneficiaries a choice of competing privatesector plans will provide high quality healthcare and affordability without compromising medical innovation.AVOID NEW PHARMACEUTICAL PRICE CONTROLS. As the experience in Europe and Japan shows, price controls stifle innovation and compromise patient access to effective new medicines.MAINTAIN THE HATCH WAXMAN ACT BALANCE. This essential mechanism helps achieve a balance between the generic and innovator drugs that work for patients. Upsetting the HatchWaxman balance is unnecessary because competition in the drug market is already strong.SUPPORT COST CONTROL STRATEGIES THAT DONOT ARBITRARILY RESTRICT DRUG ACCESS. Instead of focusing on reducing the prescription drug line item,some health plans are emphasizing disease management programs, which recognize the value of medicines in both improving patient care and offsetting other healthcare expenditures.MAINTAIN A STRONG INDUSTRY/ GOVERNMENT PARTNERSHIP FOR RESEARCH. In particular, current patent policy for federally funded ideas and established mechanisms for cooperative public/ private research has hastened commercialization of technologies that otherwise might never have been used.MAINTAIN RIGOROUS,EFFICIENT, AND TRANSPARENT REGULATION OF PHARMACEUTICALS. The landmark FDA Modernization Act of 1997 was a major step forward in enabling safe and effective new drugs and biologics to be made available sooner to patients, and FDA must continue to streamline its operations.RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF PHARMACEUTICALS. Prescription drugs save lives, alleviate suffering, and improve the quality of life. They also often reduce the need for other more invasive and expensive treatments. A narrow focus on the cost of drugs, without regard to their value and their role in the health system as a whole, would discourage innovation.STRENGTHEN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION AROUND THE GLOBE. Establish the legitimacy of intellectual property protection for medicines in all countries of the world.ELIMINATE TRADE BARRIERS. Reduce foreign government actions that deny their patients access to lifesaving, life enhancing innovative medicines through bans on information and through trade barriers that limit market access.PROMOTE SOUND SCIENCE IN INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY POLICIES. Eliminate nontransparent regulatory procedures that substitute political opinion for sound science. I’ve spent my entire career preparing for the job at PhRMA.PROMOTE SOUND HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS WORLDWIDE. Clarify the importance of a sound healthcare system in ensuring healthy workers abroad — a vital element for sustained economic development. Source:Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of AmericaThe Road to Washington From a very early age, Mr. Holmer has been groomed for a life in public service. His father, Freeman Holmer, a political science professor at Willamette University in Salem, Ore., became state budget director when a fellow professor and close friend, Mark Hatfield, became governor of Oregon. “There were lots of discussions about government and politics when I was growing up,” Mr. Holmer says. “My dream then was to one day be governor of Oregon.”Among those his father got to know as a professor was his student, Bob Packwood, who later went on to be a U.S. senator. Senator Packwood was a huge influence on the young Alan Holmer’s life and career. With his heart set on public service, Mr. Holmer went to Prince ton University to study politics, and in the summer of his junior year, he went to work for Senator Packwood, then a junior member of the U.S. senate. After graduating, Mr. Holmer began working full time for Senator Packwood.“I’d been on his staff for about eight months when he made me his chief of staff at the age of 22, which is kind of crazy looking back on it,” Mr. Holmer says.Senator Packwood ultimately became chair man of the Senate finance committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicare, Medicaid, and all international trade issues. During his six years in that position, Mr. Holmer attended law school at Georgetown University at night. Then, to gain some hands on legal experience, he took a position as an associate working on tax issues at the Washington, D.C.based law firm, Steptoe and Johnson.Three years later, in 1981, Mr. Holmer was given the opportunity to go to the White House. He worked for the Reagan administration as deputy assistant to the President for intergovernmental affairs, which essentially meant being a liaison with state and local officials across the country. “When I became president of PhRMA, this experience was very helpful; I had the opportunity to work with governors, state legislators, mayors, and county officials during my time at the White House,” he says.Perhaps most importantly, the two years in the Reagan administration gave Mr. Holmer insight into how to influence policy makers most effectively. From there, Mr. Holmer was named deputy assistant secretary for import administration at the Commerce Department, with responsibility for administering the U.S. antidumping and countervailing duty laws. Two years later, he joined the U.S. Trade Rep resentative’s office as general counsel to Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, rising to the rank of deputy U.S. trade representative (with rank of Ambassador) after two years.During this tenure, Mr. Holmer had responsibility for two major legislative initiatives — the U.S.Canada free trade agreement and the 1988 trade bill, The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act.From the trade representative’s office, Mr. Holmer joined the Washington, D.C., office of the Chicagobased law firm Sidley &Austin as cochair of the international trade practice, which broadened his perspective to a range of industries and gave him a different view of how to lobby Congress and the executive branch.As Mr. Holmer continues his efforts to lobby Congress, among others, on behalf of the pharmaceutical industry, he taps into his vast experiences in facing such groups.“During my time at the Commerce Department and the U.S. Trade Representa tive Office, I testified before congressional committees more than 50 times and devel oped very strong relationships with members and staff on both sides of the political aisle, especially on the Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee,” he says.Curing the Industry’s Ills As many industry leaders have told PharmaVOICE, one of the most pressing con cerns that pharmaceutical companies face is the battle with poor public image. It is both the mission and responsibility of PhRMA, as well as the goal of Mr. Holmer, to counter criticisms of the industry.During the past year, Mr. Holmer and his colleagues at PhRMA have increasingly been on the offensive, rather than defensive. For example, Mr. Holmer counters claims that the high cost of drugs is making healthcare unaf fordable, pointing to a government study showing outpatient prescription medicines accounted for only 9.9% of total healthcare costs in 2001.In a speech to the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association in Berlin in October 2002, Mr. Holmer laid out seven principles of strategic communica tions and public affairs that PhRMA is imple menting. The first is communicating the prac tical steps the industry is taking to improve access to medicines and improve interactions with healthcare professionals, such as the Code of Interactions for Healthcare Professionals. The second step is to anticipate issues and address them early. Third is to get the message out to critics and allies alike about the indus try’s propatient, proinnovation objectives. Fourth, PhRMA’s goal is to ensure it is nimble and persistent and that it develops allies who share the industry’s objectives. The fifth goal is to raise the tone of the debate and ensure the messages, policies, and practices are sound and benefit patients. Sixth, PhRMA is working to be consistent in its messaging about the value of research, the industry’s dedication to cures, and ensuring people have access to new medicines. And the seventh goal PhRMA has set for itself is to be relentlessly creative.Mr. Holmer says going forward the goal is to turn what one PhRMA board member labeled “the cycle of doom” into a “cycle of hope,” which was the underlying theme of his speech at PhRMA’s annual meeting this March.“The `cycle of doom’ starts with the claim that rapidly increasing drug costs are making healthcare unaffordable, bankrupting America, and ruin ing the competitiveness of American business es,” he said in his address. “Doomsayers assert that drug costs are rising because pharmaceu tical companies are getting doctors to pre scribe — and patients to take — new, more costly medicines they don’t need. And that because of pharmaceutical marketing, drug costs are going up 20% per year. Our critics say that like it is one word — drug costs are going up 20% per year — and so the cycle continues. As an industry, our task is to replace the cycle of doom with the cycle of hope.”The cycle of hope, Mr. Holmer says, “starts with the recognition that as medicines improve and increasingly treat underlying diseases and not just symptoms, medical care improves with greater use of such medicines. With these changes, more Americans are getting earlier and better treatments for diseases that once con signed them to an invariable downward spiral of disability and death. The benefits grow as we tell doctors and patients — including millions of previously untreated or undertreated patients — about new medicines, allowing patients to avoid or reduce hospital izations, lost time at work, and suffering. The cycle of hope continues as part of the return on investment in each medicine is plowed back into research, giving us the opportunity to make more progress against disease, more improvements to healthcare, and new possibilities for patients.”“The cycle of hope means that medicines are a growing share of the healthcare dollar,” he continues. “The alternative is stagnation. For instance, spending on medicines would be lower without the Alzheimer’s drugs that delay nursing home admissions. But then we’d spend more on nursing homes. Not a good trade. And when we invent the even bet ter Alzheimer’s medicines that we need, spending on drugs will go up some more. That’s a big problem if you believe in the cycle of doom. It’s exactly what should happen if you believe in the cycle of hope.”In his interview with PharmaVOICE, Mr. Holmer points to medicines for the treatment of diabetes as another example of the advances made by the industry. “As a society, Americans are becoming more and more overweight, and there has been a significant increase in the num ber of Americans with diabetes,” he says. “In the last decade, spending on medicines to treat diabetes skyrocketed from $1.3 billion to $7.3 billion. That’s a 455% increase in one decade. More than threequarters of this increase went to newer oral medicines. Our critics would say, we can’t possibly afford a 455% increase in spending on diabetes medicines.”But Mr. Holmer contends that those who look at the facts will see at work the cycle of hope, rather than the cycle of doom.“Spending has increased in part because the number of patients diagnosed with diabetes increased by almost half over the past decade,” he says. “We’re treating far more patients. We’re treating them earlier and more aggres sively, since we now know that keeping blood glucose levels lower and more tightly con trolled slows or avoids the progression of this disease’s terrible complications.“As we’ve gained better understanding of diabetes, we’ve brought five new classes of medicines to patients since 1995,” he continues. “These medicines greatly expand treat ment options, allowing physicians to better tailor treatment to individual patients’ needs. Increased spending on medicines for diabetes patients can help achieve overall savings on their health costs and avoid hospitalizations. The cycle of hope continues as America’s phar maceutical companies work toward a cure for diabetes. Today, there are many new pharma ceutical treatments in development, ranging from inhaled forms of insulin that would not require injections; to compounds that modify the metabolism of fat cells; to proteins that promote increased insulin production when blood sugar levels are high; and much more.”Mr. Holmer recognizes the challenges the industry faces in winning the publicaffairs war, telling PhRMA executives that there is “no silver bullet that will allow us to replace the paradigm of doom with our vision of hope.”“Some look at the increasing use of medicines and the shift to newer medicines as problems to be solved, not solutions for patients and contributions to affordable healthcare,” Mr. Holmer said in his annual address. “They don’t want to acknowledge the data showing that even wellinsured patients underuse asthma medicines and antidepressants. They don’t want to focus on the need for more use of medicines to treat heart disease, hypertension, and other conditions. These are facts that we need to drive into policy debates. There are a number of broken axles in our healthcare system; the modern miracle of pharmaceuticals isn’t one of them.”CHART: Advocating a Path ALAN HOLMER — RESUME 1996-PRESENT.

Distinguished Community Service Award,Princeton Club of Washington,D.C.BOX: PhRMAHead Calls for “Right Kind”of Drug Benefit This Year In January of this year, Alan F. Holmer, president and CEO of the PharmaceuticalResearch and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), told the Epilepsy Foundation that PhRMA continues to strongly support a Medicare prescription drug benefit plan — one that covers all seniors and the disabled and relies on marketbased solutions to keep costs down — and urged the new Congress to pass a plan this year. While not endorsing any specific legislation, Mr. Holmer said the key ele ments of a bipartisan Medicare prescription drug plan should: .Ensure all seniors have access to the medicines they need;Promote choice;Rely on the private sector to promote competition;andRespect the doctorpatient relationship.“America’s seniors deserve access to the best medicines we can invent,” Mr. Holmer says. “That’s why PhRMA is working to help enact prescription drug coverage that gives all Medicare beneficiaries the same kind of quality, private market drug coverage that 150 million other Americans — including members of Congress — now enjoy.”Mr.Holmer also pointed out that aMedicareprescription drug ben efit shouldhelp states with their budget problems by paying for much of the drug costs of the7 million seniors eligible for both Medicareand Medicaid.According to the Congressional Budget Office,these savings would reach an estimated $41 billion between 2005 and 2012.“Prescription medicines make up only 10 cents out of the health care dollar,” Mr. Holmer says. “When you consider this, prescription drugs are an extraordinary value.”He cited examples of drugs that help more than a million epilepsy patients control their seizures, protease inhibitors that have helped reduce AIDS deaths in the United States by 80%,cholesterollowering drugs that are preventing thousands of heart attacks each year, and medicines that allow children with asthma to breathe freely and go to school, rather than to the emergency room.It is both the mission and responsibility of PhRMA, as well as the goal of Mr.Holmer, to counter criticisms of the industry.  There are a number of broken axles in our healthcare system;the modern miracle of pharmaceuticals isn’t one of them.Making Sense of it All According to Mr. Holmer, it makes no sense for pharmaceutical companies to discover and develop new medicines if doctors and patients don’t know they exist.“That’s why we work to inform doctors about treatment options,” Mr. Holmer said during his address. “We also share information about our products directly with consumers. Consumer health information on pharmaceuti cals has brought millions of patients into need ed medical care, according to research by the FDA and others. It also enhances patients’ com pliance with physiciandirected treatment. Despite these proven successes, our industry’s product advertising is often criticized in the United States. And it’s just plain forbidden in Europe, where governmentrun health systems have adopted a policy of `don’t tell, don’t ask’: Don’t tell patients about innovative medicines and they hope that patients don’t ask.“We fight for consumer health information so that all patients can get the best medicines their doctor prescribes for them with their unique medical needs,” Mr. Holmer adds. “It’s time for us to stop just defending promotion and to start calling on its critics to explain their opposition. For example, the critics should explain either that they prefer millions of patients remain untreated, or just what is their different and better way for helping them. I’ll bet their alternative has three hallmarks: more government, restricted information, and little patient choice.”The choice may be clear to Mr. Holmer, but his organization still faces opposition from industry critics, even in light of PhRMA’s establishing guidelines that outline acceptable interaction procedures between pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers.After months of discussions with pharma ceutical executives, PhRMA last year intro duced the Code of Interactions for Healthcare Professionals. Some critics, however, have raised concerns about the fact that the code is voluntary saying the initiative will only have teeth if it is mandatory. Mr. Holmer rejects that criticism, saying evidence so far shows overall compliance with the code’s objectives.“As far as I know, every PhRMA company, which is every major pharmaceutical company in America, is implementing the code,” he comments. “And I’m told from a variety of sources that they have seen a significant change in the marketplace as a result of the change in company behavior. So my sense is that the code has been very successful.”PhRMA also recently recast its strategic and public affairs division in an effort to be more aggressive in addressing indus try critics, rather than letting the media dictate the agenda. “What we want to do is build a public affairs program that real ly takes the initiative in driving messages through the earned media and paid media, and my objective is to reallocate resources so that instead of being on the defense, we spend at least onethird of our time being on the offensive and getting our positive messages out,” he says. “PhRMA needs to make sure that the people in the media and the public understand what’s driv ing healthcare costs — and it is an utterly erroneous message that the cost of drugs is making healthcare unaffordable. We also need to build common ground with a variety of allies and develop longterm committed relationships with patient groups, with doctors, with medical researchers, and with others.”Among the key initiatives Mr. Holmer and his team are pushing for this year is a Medicare prescription drug benefit plan. “Our top priority at PhRMA is making sure that Congress enacts a meaning ful Medicare prescription drug benefit for seniors and the disabled,” he says.Moving Forward Belief in what the industry does and what it is trying to achieve certainly help Mr. Holmer as he and PhRMA strive to put forward the industry’s message. But belief and determina tion alone are not enough to achieve those goals.Russel A. Bantham, executive VP and chief operating officer of PhRMA, says Mr. Holmer’s greatest gifts are his ability “to lead, establish a vision for an organization, and motivate and empower individuals to be the best they can be. He’s a good judge of character and individuals’ capabilities.”Others close to Mr. Holmer cite his abilities “in negotiation, in advocacy before the Congress, advocacy generally, and also in bringing people together.”Mr. Holmer adds, “At PhRMA I’ve hired people who are a lot smarter than I am in their individual areas of expertise. I have given them lots of running room and resources so they can succeed.”Mr. Holmer has put to good use the lessons he has learned from the influential people in his life. He says Senator Packwood taught him that loyalty in an orga nization shouldn’t only flow from the bottom up but from the top down as well. Malcolm Baldrige, the sec retary of commerce when Mr. Holmer was there, taught him the importance of taking responsibility for mistakes. Those closest to Mr. Holmer — his parents, his older brother, his wife, and his children — have provided him with extraordinarily valuable life lessons.Mr. Holmer is justifiably proud of his success in improving the effectiveness of PhRMA.“Seven years ago, I said my goal was to make PhRMA the finest advocacy organiza tion in America, and I believe that we are,” he says. “PhRMA is a model at the international level, at the federal level, and at the state level. There’s no better advocacy organization.”BOX: It’s time for us to stop just defending promotion and to start calling on its critics to explain their opposition.I’ll bet their alternative has three hallmarks:more government, restricted information,and little patient choice.PharmaVoice welcomes comments about this article.
