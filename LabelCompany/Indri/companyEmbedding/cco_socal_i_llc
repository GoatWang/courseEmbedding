What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

CommentBefore the FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSIONWashington, J?C 20554In rePetition to Show Cause KJLA, LLCAgainst CCO SoCal I, LLC) ) ) CSR-8775-M ) Docket No. 13-63 ) )To: Office ofthe Secretary Attn: Chief, Media BureauOPPOSITION TO PETITIONCCO SoCal I, LLC ("Charter" or the "Company") hereby opposes the "Petition for Issuance of Order to Show Cause" filed by KJLA, LLC, licensee of KJLA, Ventura, California ("KJLA" or the "Station") in the above-captioned proceeding. 1 The Station does not dispute that Charter is properly carrying KJLA's digital must carry signal in a digital format on its cable systems in the Los Angeles DMA. 2 Rather, it alleges that the Company discontinued carriage of KJLA's signal in analog format in violation of the Commission's 2012 Viewability Order3 by failing to provide adequate notice to either KJLA or its own subscribers. The Station also claims1 The Commission docketed the Station's "Petition for Issuance of Order to Show Cause," as a must carry complaint ("Petition"). See Special Reliefand Show Cause Petitions, Report No. 0392 (March 18, 2013).2 The Petition does not identify particular communities. Instead, it refers broadly to Charter's analog subscribers in the Los Angeles DMA. See, e.g., Petition at 1. This Opposition addresses those communities to which Charter currently retransmits KJLA's signal in digital-only format, including Big Bear Lake, Burbank, Cerritos, Glendale, Hesperia, Long Beach, Malibu, Rancho Cucamonga, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Gabriel Valley, Ventura, Victorville, and Whittier (the "Cable Communities").3 Carriage ofDigital Television Broadcast Signals: Amendment to Part 76 ofthe Commission's Rules, Fifth Report and Order, 27 FCC Red. 6529 (2012)("2012 Viewabiliity Order").DWT21458162vl 0108600-000002that Charter has failed to make affordable equipment available that would enable analog subscribers to continue to view stations (such as KJLA) subject to the digital migration. The Station's factual allegations are wrong: Charter properly notified both KJLA and its own subscribers that the Company was terminating analog delivery of KJLA's signal, and it offers digital equipment for continued viewing ofKJLA by analog subscribers free of charge.In the 2012 Viewability Order, the Commission announced the sunset ofthe "viewability" rule, which had required cable operators with hybrid analog/digital systems to carry digital must carry signals in an analog format. After December 12, 2012, operators of hybrid cable systems may avoid such "dual carriage" and instead satisfy the viewability requirements of Section 614(b)(7) ofthe Act by offering digital equipment (e.g. set-top boxes) to analog subscribers "at no cost or at an affordable cost."4 The Commission also expects cable operators to notify affected must carry stations 90 days, and affected cable subscribers 30 days, in advance of suspending analog delivery of a must carry station. 5 Charter has fully complied with these requirements and expectations. Accordingly, Charter respectfully requests the Petition be denied. I. Charter Provided Proper Notice to the Station That It Was Suspending AnalogDelivery of KJLA. The Petition initially contends that Charter failed to provide the Station with notification of the Company's plan to deliver KJLA in digital-only format. In fact, Charter sent a letter dated November 13, 2012, to the Station at the exact address identified on the FCC's website (the "November Notice"). 6 The November Notice clearly advises the Station that "on or after4 See 2012 Viewability Order at~ 11. 5 See id. at ~ 17. 6 See Exhibit 1. The same address appears on KJLA's website. See id.DWT 21458162vl 0108600-0000022February 12, 2013, Charter will convert the analog presentation of your station's primary broadcast signal into a digital format" on various identified channel lineups. 7 The November Notice further explains that KJLA "will continue to be available to ALL of [Charter's] customers ... in a digital format on the basic tier of service." 8The electronic receipt from the U.S. Postal Service, attached hereto as Exhibit 3, confirms that the November Notice was actually delivered to and received by the Station. Despite the Station's claims to the contrary, Charter did, in fact, provide the Station with proper notice that on or after February 12, 20l3, it would deliver only a digital version ofKJLA's signal on the relevant cable systems. II. Charter Properly Notified Its Subscribers That It Was Suspending Analog DeliveryofKJLA. The Petition criticizes Charter's subscriber notices as "underwhelming," but ultimately concedes that Charter did, in fact, notify subscribers of the proposed channel delivery format change. 9 Indeed, the Petition includes a copy of a Charter customer bill, which includes a message entitled "Important Notice," unambiguously advising subscribers: "Effective on or after February 12, 2013, Charter will offer the following channels [including KJLA] exclusively in a digital format." 10 The bill message is equally clear in explaining that the planned format change "will require digital equipment in order to view these channels on all of your television sets."11 Charter included the digital migration notice in the bills of all of its subscribers in the affected communities issued during the period December 13, 2012 to January 12, 2013. KJLA may not7 A copy of the November Notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 2. 8 !d. (Emphasis in original). 9 Petition at 5. 10 See Petition at 5, and Exhibit A. 11 See id.DWT 21458162vl 0108600-0000023like Charter's bill message, but it clearly satisfies the notification requirements and expectations set forth in the Commission's Rules and the 2012 Viewability Order, which does not dictate specific notification language or methodologies.The Petition erroneously contends that, beyond the billing inserts (which by themselves clearly provide adequate notification to customers), "Charter has not engaged in any more extensive efforts to educate analog subscribers of the steps that need to be taken to transition to digital service to retain the programming of must-carry stations such as KJLA."12 Again, the Station is wrong. Although not required to do so, Charter sent a separate letter on January I0, 2013, regarding the digital transition to all of its limited basic service tier subscribers, which are the subscribers most likely to be affected by Charter's delivery format change (the "January Subscriber Notice"). 13 As was the case with the bill messages, this stand-alone notification clearly advises subscribers that after February 12, Charter would deliver certain signals, including KJLA, "exclusively in digital format."14 The January Subscriber Notice goes on to explain that the format change will require digital equipment to view the channels at issue and that Charter will provide the necessary equipment at no cost.1512 Petition at 5. While the Petition is quick to criticize Charter's subscriber notification process, it says nothing about KJLA's own viewer outreach efforts. Despite the fact that the Station claims to have become aware of Charter's format change in November 2012, Charter is not aware that KJLA itself notified viewers ofthe change, as expressly contemplated by the Commission in the 2012 Viewability Order. 2012 Viewability Order at ~17 ("Advance notice about planned carriage changes will allow must-carry stations to notify their viewers - through on-air messages, website postings, mailings or other forms of communications of their choosing -about the planned change in carriage, and about the viewers' options to ensure continued access to the station's programming.").13 See Exhibit 4.14 See id.15 !d.DWT 21458162vl 0108600-0000024In addition to the bill messages and stand-alone subscriber notifications described above, Charter published a "Legal Notice" regarding Charter's proposed transition to digital-only service in each of seven newspapers available to subscribers in the affected communities, including the Big Bear Grizzly (1/16/13), the Burbank Leader (1/12/13), the Glendale News Press (1/12113), the Press Telegram (Long Beach)(l/9/13), the Press Enterprise (Riverside)(1/11/13), the San Gabriel Valley Tribune (1/16/13), and the Daily Press (Victorville)(l/11/13). 16 Thus, despite the Stations claims to the contrary, Charter's digital service transition notice to subscribers was more than adequate. III. Charter is Offering Analog Customers Free Set-Top Boxes to Assist With theTransition to Digital-Only Service. The Station also incorrectly contends that Charter does not offer viable low-cost equipment to allow analog subscribers to access digital-only stations, such as KJLA. 17 As noted above, Charter's subscriber notifications emphasize that such digital equipment is necessary for continued viewing of the subject channels and provide a phone number for subscribers to call to obtain the equipment. Charter's January Subscriber Notice also clearly indicates that Charter will provide the necessary digital equipment for free. 18 In fact, Charter has supplied its subscribers with thousands of free set-top boxes since first notifying them in December 2012 of its plans to deliver multiple channels of programming, including KJLA, in digital format only.16 The language in each newspaper notice is the same as in Charter's bill notifications. A sample "Legal Notice" from the Press Enterprise is attached hereto as Exhibit 5.17 See Petition at 6.18 See Exhibit 4.DWT21458162vl 0108600-0000025The Petition complains bitterly that Charter customer service representatives inform analog subscribers about available digital packages. 19 But, as the Station well knows, there is nothing in the Commission's rules or the 2012 Viewability Order that prohibits such marketing°efforts. 2 Charter concedes that customer service representatives may promote Charter's variousdigital packages, but it vehemently denies that its customer service representatives are instructed to present Charter's various digital packages as the only means by which analog subscribers may view recently migrated stations, as the Station claims. Charter has already distributed large numbers of set-top boxes to analog customers at no cost, and it continues to do so in response to customer calls to Charter representatives in connection with the digital channel migration. The Station's specious claims about Charter's marketing practices are further undermined by the fact that the toll-free number on the January Subscriber Notice,21 permits subscribers to order free set-top boxes without ever speaking with a customer service representative.The Commission has determined "that a range of charges for DTAs and set top boxes i.e., free or a monthly fee of no more than $2- would satisfy the requirement for affordable19 See Petition at 6.20 The Station's criticism of comments made by Charter's CEO, Thomas Rutledge, regarding the Company's plans to go all digital on a nationwide basis is similarly flawed. See Petition at 6-7. Notwithstanding the Station's views, digital transmission is the inevitable successor to analog transmission. Having itself transitioned to digital delivery several years ago, the Station can hardly criticize Charter for embarking down the same path. Indeed, the Commission has long contemplated and encouraged the cable industry's transition to all-digital operations. See 2012 Viewability Order at~ 13 ("We continue to expect most cable operators will eventually transition to all-digital systems.").21 See Exhibit 4.DWT 21458162vl 0108600-0000026equipment .. .." 22 As noted above, Charter offers to provide set-top boxes to analog customers free of charge. 23 In short, Charter is providing affordable digital equipment that allows customers continued access to channels that are no longer delivered in analog format, in full compliance with the Commission's expectations, as set forth in the 2012 Viewability Order. IV. Charter's Approach to Transitioning Its Systems to All-Digital Is Consistent withthe 2012 Viewability Order. Finally, the Petition makes much of the fact that Charter's February 12, 2013 digital channel migration included some, but not all, of the broadcast stations carried on Charter's cable systems. The Commission, however, has already considered and rejected this objection. There is no requirement under 2012 Viewability Order that a cable operator must treat all local broadcast signals consistently with regard to analog carriage. To the contrary, the 2012 Viewability Order is premised on the fundamental notion that the operator of a hybrid analog/digital cable system shall have sole discretion to determine whether it carries a particular must carry signal in analog or digital format, provided that the operator complies with the specific conditions set forth in that Order. In the end, it is clear that KJLA disagrees with the Commission's conclusion that a must carry station is no longer entitled to analog carriage simply because other programming services are delivered in analog. But the Station's disagreement with Commission rules and policy does not justify requiring Charter to resume analog carriage of KJLA.22 2012 Viewability Order at~ 14. (The Commission referenced several specific examples of compliant equipment offers, including Comcast's offering of two or three free DTAs, Time Warner's provision of "one or more" free DTAs for two years, and Bright House's offer to provide set-top boxes to basic service tier customers for $1 a month.).23 Charter is prepared to extend a free or low-cost set-top box offer if its transition to all-digital operations on any of the systems at issue extends beyond its current equipment offer period.DWT 21458162vl 0108600-0000027CONCLUSION Charter timely informed the Station and its own subscribers that it was suspending analogdelivery ofKJLA, it advised subscribers that this change would require digital equipment, and itnas provided such equipment to thousands of subscribers free of charge -- all in full compliance with the Commission's rules and stated expectations. For the foregoing reasons, Charter respectfully request that the Commission deny the Petition.April 8 2013Respectfully submitted,CCO SoCal I, LLC'By: S ven J. Horvitz rederick W.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

LLC Pricing Packages - Affordable LLC Formation Services from LegalZoomWhen you decided to form an LLC, one of your first questions may have been "how much does an LLC cost"? Fortunately, LegalZoom makes the process of starting an LLC affordable and simple. With three LLC pricing packages to choose from, there is a package to fit the needs of any business. The Economy package LLC cost includes filing of the document forming the LLC with the state, a personalized operating agreement, name availability check, a financial account authorization letter, and a 30 business day turnaround. Standard package LLC fees include everything from the Economy package with a 15 business day turnaround, plus a company seal and binder, and 20 customized membership certificates. The Express Gold LLC formation package includes everything from the Standard package with a 7-10 business day turnaround, plus a Federal Tax ID (EIN) (discounted and expedited), a tax consultation with 1-800Accountant, and a 30-day trial of attorney advice. Get started forming an LLC by answering a few questions about your business. We'll assemble your LLC documents and file them directly with the appropriate state agency and you'll receive your completed LLC package by mail. The LLC price for all packages includes a 100% satisfaction guarantee and a Peace of Mind Review.







1After the 30-day trial period, benefits to the Business Legal Plan (also Business Advantage Pro or Business Advisory Plan) continue automatically at the plan rate (currently $39.99 per month). Cancel by calling (877) 818-8787. For full details, see the Legal Plan Contract and Subscription Terms.2Some restrictions apply.

Please see the LLC Knowledge Center for examples of these fees. You may also contact the state, an accountant or LegalZoom for more information about these fees.4Once your LLC becomes legally effective, your card will automatically be charged $159.00. Service renews annually thereafter for the same fee until canceled. For full terms and conditions, click here. ** Does not include required newspaper publication fee.
