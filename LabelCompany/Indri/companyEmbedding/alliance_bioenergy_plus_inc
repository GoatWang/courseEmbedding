Company Profile







Alliance BioEnergy +, Inc. (“ALLM”) (OTCQB: ALLM) is a publicly traded company, operating through various subsidiaries and their affiliates.  ALLM’s subsidiary, AMG Energy Group, LLC (“AMG”), owns 50% of Carbolosic, LLC (in a joint venture with Thor Renewable Energy Singapore) and exclusively the territories of North America and Africa.  Carbolosic, LLC holds the exclusive worldwide license for the patented CTS™ process, developed and owned by the University of Central Florida, which converts cellulose into commercial grade sugars, fine chemicals and other highly valuable products.  ALLM intends to focus on the production of these commercial products through company-owned and licensed facilities.
Our business strategy is to joint venture, sell multiple license territories, single plant licenses, as well as own and operate company-owned facilities.  In addition, ALLM is actively exploring other “green” or renewable technologies that are beyond the development stage and already commercialized for possible acquisition or strategic partnerships.
ALLM’s commercial pilot/demonstration and research facility, Ek Laboratories, LLC (“Ek”), came online in early 2015.  Under the direction of CTS™ inventor Dr. Richard Blair this facility is running the CTS process, at a commercial scale, and is providing licensees with real time analytics.  Ek is also expanding the Company’s current portfolio of patents while exploring alternate pathways and new technologies.  The goal is to create a family of patents owned by ALLM and its affiliates.

[ACCESSWIRE]
WEST PALM BEACH, FL / ACCESSWIRE / July 25, 2017 / Alliance BioEnergy Plus, Inc. (OTCQB: ALLM), today announced that it has completed the payoff of a short term note, held by PowerUp Lending Group, providing the full $211,000 owed approximately six months ahead of the notes maturity. By paying off the loan before its due date, and within the first 180 days of issuance, the Company avoided any conversion of the debt to stock.The Company continues with its plan of retiring all of its outstanding debt prior to closing on the purchase of a bioethanol plant through its subsidiary Alliance Bio-Products, Inc. "We are pleased to be able to pay off this loan well ahead of schedule, which is a focus as we move forward toward closing on our new plant in Florida," said Daniel de Liege, CEO of Alliance BioEnergy. "By paying off the debt early, we avoided the conversion of the debt to stock, which was important for us to do for our shareholders. We will continue our efforts to eliminate existing Company debt, before it comes due, to best position ourselves moving forward as we ramp up commercialization of our product for sale." The purchase of the plant is being funded through a mixture of debt and equity. The equity portion of the investment is being done via a 506(c) filing under subsidiary Alliance Bio-Products, Inc, which is still open for investor consideration, in order to reduce as much debt as possible. For more information on that opportunity, please visit the offering page.About ALLMAlliance BioEnergy +, Inc.

Alliance Bio-Products, Inc. Awarded Approval to Purchase Cellulosic Ethanol Production Plant


United States Department of Agriculture Office of Rural Development Approved the Company's Bid to Purchase and Renovate Closed Florida Biofuel Facility for Enhanced Production of Environmentally Friendly Fuels and Products 
WEST PALM BEACH, FL / ACCESSWIRE / July 11, 2017 / Alliance Bio-Products, Inc. ("Bio-Products"), a subsidiary of Alliance BioEnergy Plus, Inc. (OTCQB: ALLM), today announced it has received approval from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Office of Rural Development ("USDA Rural Development") for the collateral purchase of the closed ethanol facility in Indian River County, Florida. The approved purchase includes the fully functional plant, 143+ acres that the plant resides on, and all related equipment and vehicles.
The Company made an offer to purchase the eight Million Gallon Per Year (8MMGY) ethanol facility with the intention of converting the current process into its patented Cellulose to Sugar (CTS) process under an agreement with Alliance BioEnergy. By renovating the plant and utilizing a state-of-the-art fermentation and distillation system already in place, and with an abundance of free feedstock available, Bio-Products believes it can increase production capacity and profitability of its sustainable, environmentally friendly alternative to petroleum-based fuels and other products. The plant also sits on a large parcel of land that would allow Bio-Products to expand as demand increases.
"Through renovation and the implementation of our revolutionary CTS process, we'll be able to expand our production capacity while also shortening turnaround times - a key to ramping up production quickly and bringing our product to market at scale," said Ben Slager, Chief Technology Officer, Alliance Bio-Products, Inc. "We have long had the most innovative technology on the market in regards to biofuel production, but did not have the means to fully utilize its potential until now. Combining our industry leading technology with a plant of this capacity will allow us to meet the growing needs of the market."
The Company's patented CTS process allows it to produce biofuels for less than $1 per gallon that are 100% CO2 neutral, because of the process, and have 85-95% less greenhouse gases than petroleum-based products. Bio-Products expects it will be able to begin production at the plant by summer of 2018, potentially generating $25 million in EBITDA and then will look to double capacity to 16 MMGY, potentially generating $54 million in EBITDA in 2020 before maximizing capacity of 34 MMGY, generating $112 million in 2023.
"We are thrilled to have been awarded approval to purchase this plant and take this significant step forward toward commercialized production at scale. By purchasing and renovating an already built facility, we'll reduce our capital expenditure significantly allowing us to market years ahead of building from scratch," said Daniel de Liege, Chairman, Alliance Bio-Products, Inc. "We have received tremendous support through our 506(c) equity offering, and expect the opportunity to close quickly now that the purchase has been approved. In combination with some of our other production partnerships in place, we believe we are in a strong position to begin generating significant revenues and bringing increased value to our shareholders."
The plant purchase will create approximately 100 permanent jobs in the short term, with additional employment opportunities created as production expands. The community will also benefit from an infusion of tax base revenue, as well as support revenue through an increase of usage of trucking, housing, restaurants, suppliers and more. The plant would also help to dispose of green waste that would otherwise fill up the landfill and release millions of tons of carbon dioxide.
The purchase of the plant is being funded through a mixture of debt and equity. The equity portion of the investment is being done via a 506(c) filing that is still open for investor consideration, in order to reduce as much debt as possible. For more information on that opportunity, please visit the offering page.

(OTCQB: ALLM) (the "Company") announced today that its wholly owned subsidiary, AMG Energy Group, has entered into a sublicensing agreement with Earth's Renewable Energy, LLC of Newport Beach, CA. The sublicense agreement permits Earth's Renewable Energy to use the Company's patented cellulose to sugar (CTS) technology at a soon-to-be-built plant in Bakersfield, CA.The single process train will be capable of processing 250 tons per day of biomass, such as almond and pistachio trees and their hulls, which will be supplied under contract by a $4 billion private agricultural conglomerate in California. The plant also has an offtake agreement with Chem-Energy Corporation, who will utilize the C5/C6 sugar mix and pure lignin to create fine chemicals and other high value bio-products. As additional feedstocks become available, the plant will expand processing to 1,000 tons per day.The sublicense fee paid to AMG Energy Group is $1.25M plus 5% of ongoing gross revenue derived from the CTS process. The cash portion of the fee will be paid in installments, with the initial payment made within the next 30 days, providing the Company with an immediate capital infusion and a longer-term revenue source."We are excited to take this step forward and to secure a sublicensing agreement that will generate both near and long term revenue for our Company, while further validating our technology as the industry standard for the economic production of energy efficient bio-products," said Daniel de Liege, CEO, Alliance BioEnergy Plus. "We look forward to delivering the technology once their plant is ready and to work with the team at Earth's Renewable Energy to ramp up processing and to deliver high quality materials to our commercialization partners.""We are pleased to be partnering with AMG Energy and Alliance for the production of more environmentally friendly bio-products," said Katherine Fabris, President of Earth's Renewable Energy. "We identified their technology as the best in the industry from both a cost and production perspective, and look forward to a productive long-term relationship."Funding for the soon-to-be-built plant in Bakersfield will be provided by Twin Rivers Group LLC, a diversified business development firm with offices in Texas and Kansas and a strong concentration in the renewable energy space. Twin Rivers Group has teamed up with Earth's Renewable Energy to develop multiple processing facilities deploying a patented proprietary processing technology under a licensing agreement with AMG Energy Group. Once the Bakersfield plant is operational, there are plans to build three additional plants and further expand processing.The Company has done extensive testing on the almond and pistachio feedstocks at its Ek Laboratories in Longwood, Florida. Initial tests show that this feedstock performs better than expected and converts quickly and easily in the CTS process.While licensing is a part of the Alliance business plan and brings the Company immediate revenue, Alliance continues to work toward closing on its own bioethanol plant through subsidiary Alliance Bio-Products, Inc., and expects to be operational in its retrofitted facility by mid 2018.About ALLMAlliance BioEnergy +, Inc.

Our business strategy is to joint venture, sell multiple license territories, single plant licenses, as well as own and operate company-owned facilities.  In addition, ALLM is actively exploring other “green” or renewable technologies that are beyond the development stage and already commercialized for possible acquisition or strategic partnerships.
ALLM’s commercial pilot/demonstration and research facility, Ek Laboratories, LLC (“Ek”), came online in early 2015.  Under the direction of CTS™ inventor Dr. Richard Blair this facility is running the CTS process, at a commercial scale, and is providing licensees with real time analytics.  Ek is also expanding the Company’s current portfolio of patents while exploring alternate pathways and new technologies.  The goal is to create a family of patents owned by ALLM and its affiliates.

Announces Filing of 506(c) to Raise Funds for New Cellulosic Ethanol Production PlantPR NewswireMarch 23, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareWEST PALM BEACH, Fla., March 23, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Alliance Bio-Products, Inc. (Bio-Products), a subsidiary of Alliance BioEnergy Plus, Inc. (OTCQB:ALLM), today announced its filing of a Regulation D (506(c)) offering with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The purpose of the filing is to secure funds through accredited investors for the purchase of a bioethanol plant in Southeast Florida that would enable the Company to increase production capacity and profitability of its sustainable, environmentally friendly alternative to petroleum-based fuels and other products through its patented Cellulose to Sugar (CTS) conversion process.Bio-Products' 506c offering will allow the company to sell 1,000,000 shares of its securities to accredited investors. The Company will offer 8% Convertible Preferred Stock at $10 per share, with a preferred minimum investment of $5,000. The offering will be conducted on a best efforts basis through the Company's website, where the Private Placement Memorandum and Accredited Investor Questionnaire are located.Bio-Products has made an offer to purchase an 8 Million Gallon Per Year (MMGY) ethanol facility in Indian River County, Florida with the intention of converting the current failed process into the Company's patented CTS process under a sub-license from Alliance BioEnergy. Pending the completion of the plant negotiations and purchase, operations are expected to reach capacity in early 2018, potentially generating $25 million in EBITDA and then will look to double capacity to 16 MMGY, potentially generating $54 million in EBITDA in 2019 before maximizing capacity of 34 MMGY, generating $112 million in 2021.The Company's patented CTS process allows it to produce cellulosic ethanol for less than $1 per gallon and have 85-95% less greenhouse gases than petroleum based products. "We look forward to taking the next steps in solidifying our purchase of our own cellulosic ethanol production plant and believe the increased demand for cheaper biofuels will continue to drive growth of the company and the industry," said Jim Brown, President, Alliance Bio-Products, Inc. "This offering will be the first step of many to expand the company's capacity and enable a faster turnaround through the production of less expensive ethanol from local agricultural and yard waste. We believe the purchase of this plant will put our Company in the best position possible to reach mass commercialization of our product and to ultimately produce revenue and bring value back to shareholders."To learn more about the Company and the investment opportunity, please visit https://www.transfer.ly/invest/alliance-bio-products.About Alliance Bio-Products, Inc.Alliance Bio-Products, Inc. was formed as a special purpose wholly-owned subsidiary of Alliance BioEnergy Plus, Inc.
