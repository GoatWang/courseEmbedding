Craig T. Bouchard
Craig is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Braidy Industries LLC.
Craig is a New York Times Best Selling author. “The Caterpillar Way. Lessons in Leadership, Growth and Shareholder Value” was released in October of 2013, reaching #1 on the Barnes & Noble Best Seller List, and #8 on the New York Times Best Seller list in the business category. James V. Koch was once again Craig’s co-author. (McGraw Hill.)
Craig became the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Real Industry, Inc., (then called Signature Group Holdings) in June, 2013 after leading a proxy battle to remove the company’s board. This was Craig’s third successful hostile take-over on Wall Street. The parent company is a publicly traded private equity type investor. Growing from $40 million of annual revenue in 2013 to roughly $1.5 billion today, Real Industry, through its subsidiary Real Alloy, became the world’s largest independent recycler of aluminum. Real Industry (RELY) joined the NASDAQ in June of 2015.
In 2010 Craig founded Shale-Inland, named for his daughter Shale, and his father’s company, Inland Steel. Shale-Inland is the nation’s leading master distributor of stainless steel pipe, valves and fittings, stamped and fabricated parts to the US energy industry. The company’s revenues grew from $10 million in 2010 to roughly $800 million by 2012.
In 2004, Craig co-founded Esmark Inc. a company that acquired nine steel companies, including the celebrated hostile takeover of Wheeling Pittsburgh Corporation on its way to becoming the 4th largest American steel company. Craig innovated the first hostile reverse tender merger in Wall Street history in 2007 when the Wheeling board and executive management team were removed at its annual shareholder meeting.  Esmark revenues grew from $4 million in 2003 to $3.5 billion in 2008. The company was sold in 2008 for $1.25 billion.  That year Esmark (ESMK) became the highest appreciating stock on either the Nasdaq or NYSE (for the full year). The story is chronicled in “America For Sale, How the Foreign Pack Circled and Devoured Esmark.” Copyright 2009 Craig T. Bouchard and James V. Koch, (ABC-CLIO.)
From 1998-2003, Craig was the President and Chief Executive Officer of New York based NumeriX, a risk management software company commanding a lead market share on Wall Street in the valuation of complex derivative instruments.
Prior to helping found NumeriX, Craig was a Senior Vice President at the First National Bank of Chicago, (now JPM/Chase). His career there spanned 19 years. In the 150-year history of the bank, Craig was the 3rd youngest individual to rise to the level of Senior Vice President. He was the Head of Asia Pacific, living in Hong Kong and Tokyo, and later became The Global Head of Derivative Trading and Quantitative Research.
Craig is a New York Times Best Selling author. “The Caterpillar Way. Lessons in Leadership, Growth and Shareholder Value” was released in October of 2013, reaching #1 on the Barnes & Noble Best Seller List, and #8 on the New York Times Best Seller list in the business category. James V. Koch was once again Craig’s co-author. (McGraw Hill.)
As a hobby, Craig’s “The Adventures of Ai” was one of the world’s popular children’s book projects of 2014. The book was translated into Japanese, Mandarin, Spanish and Arabic, with the accompanying Adventures of Ai video game, achieving 200,000 downloads globally on Apple iTunes, Google Play and Samsung. The project benefited 18 children charities around the world.
Craig holds a Bachelor’s degree from Illinois State University (1975), a Master’s Degree in Economics from Illinois State University (1977), and an MBA from the University of Chicago (1981). He is a member of the Board of Directors of New York REIT, Inc. (Nasdaq: NYRT.)  Craig has been a member of the Board of Trustees of Boston University and the Foundation of the University of Montana. He is currently a member of the leadership board of the Department of Athletics, Duke University. Craig is an alumnus of Leadership Greater Chicago, and was a finalist for the Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year award (Illinois) in 2005.
Craig was elected to the Hall of Fame of the Illinois State University College of Arts and Sciences in 2008. He is a member of the Hall of Fame of Hinsdale Central Township High School. Craig holds United States Patent 4,212,168, Power Producing Dry-Type Cooling Systems.
He is married to Melissa N. Bouchard and is the proud father of six children. Craig and his daughter Shale are ranked #3 in the 2016 US Tennis Association national rankings of Senior Father/Daughter Mixed Doubles.

Craig Bouchard being elected into the Hinsdale Central Hall of Fame (his high school):

Craig Bouchard being elected into the Hinsdale Central Hall of Fame (his high school):


HCHS Foundation Hall of Fame
2007 Inductee Craig Bouchard,
Field of Distinction: Finance and Business
James P. and Craig T. Bouchard are cut from the same cloth in many respects: The products of a close-knit and very athletic Hinsdale family which includes six state championships while at Hinsdale Central High School. Highly successful professional careers that found each brother following their own personal and family dreams. And a strong sense of community service and desire to help those in need, leaving a lasting mark on everything they touched and everyone around them.
Both Jim’s and Craig’s career success can be traced to their roots at HCHS. Craig was a two-year starter in varsity Basketball and Baseball. The owner of several hitting records, in 1971 he was on HCHS’ first West Suburban Conference championship team, earning All Conference and All Chicago honors.
Jim was a triple threat, lettering five times in varsity Football, Basketball, and Baseball. He served as Co-Captain of the Football and Baseball teams and achieved First Team All Area recognition in Football and Baseball. His three interceptions in one football game still stands in the HCHS record books. And his accomplishments on and off the field were recognized by being named recipient of the prestigious James Carmignani Award for leadership and athletics at HCHS.
While they enjoyed great success on the sports fields, it was the fields of business and philanthropy that brought these two brothers their most satisfying achievements. Following college, Craig embarked on a 20-year career in banking, finance, and mergers and acquisitions with First National Bank of Chicago (now JPMorgan/Chase). His work took him from downtown Chicago to the downtowns of Hong Kong and Tokyo. Craig at the time was the 2nd youngest to reach the level of Senior Vice President in the bank’s 150 year history. He also helped found NumeriX, a Wall St. software company known as the risk management gold-standard to global trading institutions. Craig gained industry recognition for his expertise and insights into the global financial markets.
For Jim, it was a different career path. A career path his father, Robert C. Bouchard, had blazed in the steel industry. Following graduation from college, Jim set out on a 20-year journey in the domestic and international steel industry. He joined Inland Steel (now Arcelor/Mittal) and devoted himself to learning the intricacies of the steel business. He later joined United States Steel Corporation and quickly rose through the ranks to hold senior-level positions in sales, marketing, and strategic market development.
In 2000, after U.S. Steel acquired the Slovakian National Steel Company in Kosice, Slovak Republic, Jim was dispatched to Kosice along with six other executives and charged with revitalizing the ailing Kosice operations. As Vice President of Commercial, Jim and his team were widely credited with successfully restructuring the company and turning it into U.S. Steel’s most profitable business unit.
In 2004, their careers came together with the founding of Esmark Incorporated, a family of steel services companies. Starting with their first acquisition in Chicago Heights, Illinois, they built a regional network of 10 steel service centers over the next three years to become the fastest-growing steel company in the U.S.
In 2006, they set out to do something never before attempted in the history of Wall Street: the first ever takeover and reverse tender merger of a public company by a private company. The “Brothers of Steel” led a successful proxy battle to gain control of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation. They built on that success in 2007 by acquiring one of the largest steel mills on the East Coast in Sparrows Point, Maryland. Combined with Esmark and WPSC, Jim and Craig have built in four years the fourth largest steel company in the country with more than $4 billion in revenue and a place on the Fortune 500 list.
All along the way Craig and Jim never lost sight of the strong family values and importance of community service that their parents instilled in them. In 1978 the Bouchard family instituted a scholarship program for students at HCHS in the name of their father. Today that scholarship program continues with the Helen Bouchard Scholarship for the children of Esmark employees seeking continuing education opportunities.
Jim and Craig have also supported or established two fundraising golf outings – the HCHS Foundation Golf Outing and the J. Kyle Braid Leadership Foundation – Chicago Golf Outing, the latter becoming the single largest annual fundraiser for the organization.
True to their alma mater roots, Craig and Jim have also helped finish the proposed weight room at HCHS with the single largest private donation and pledge to provide the steel construction materials for the project. In addition, they established a charity tennis tournament in Naples, Florida called “Girls are Best” benefiting local girls ages 7-17 that demonstrate high potential but need financial assistance to achieve their education and dreams.
Another philanthropic undertaking by the Bouchards was their personal donation and building of an addition on to the IMANI Christian Academy in Pennsylvania that houses the academy’s new science department and allows this entirely private funded organization to provide a better learning environment for all of its current and future students.
Together with their families, the Bouchards also devote considerable time and financial support to a number of other educational, health, and charitable organizations in Illinois, Pennsylvania and Florida, and are always there to lend a helping hand for those in need.
Their success would not be possible without the loving support of their families. For Craig, his wife Melissa and their six children: Kai, Justin, Patrick, Shale, Cambelle, and Braidy. For Jim, his wife Carolyn (HCHS Class of 1979) and their three children: Natalie, Clayton, and Aubrey.

	America for Sale by Craig T. Bouchard and James V. Koch - Praeger - ABC-CLIO













































ABC-CLIO












America for Sale
How the Foreign Pack Circled and Devoured Esmark

 
In the summer of 2008, Esmark—the nation’s fifth largest steel producer—accepted a purchase offer from the Russian firm Severstal.  It was the culmination of an intense courtship among potential suitors from three continents emboldened by the weakening dollar.  In the end, the sale was overwhelmingly endorsed by Esmark’s shareholders and union leadership, but was it good for the nation as a whole?

Exploring the issue of foreign ownership of corporate America, a leading economist and the president of the steel producer, Esmark, revisit the sale of that company to a Russian firm.
Is it a good idea to allow foreigners to purchase critical and strategic American assets? No, say authors James Koch and Craig Bouchard. In America for Sale: How the Foreign Pack Circled and Devoured Esmark, Koch and Bouchard use the sale of Esmark—a transaction that put over 50 percent of American steel production into foreign hands—to make the case that this trend presents a clear and present danger to the economic future of United States of America.America for Sale recaps the amazing, sometimes incredible events leading up to the sale of Esmark, including intense pressure from the United Steelworkers and the company's major public shareholder to make a decision not in the best interest of all shareholders. It also analyzes the efforts by the Esmark board of directors to observe its fiduciary duty, details the company's “poison pill” effort to raise its sales price, and describes the actions of Leo Gerard and Ron Bloom of the United Steelworkers Union—which led to some surprising alliances. The authors—one Esmark's president and vice chairman of the board, the other an Esmark director, preeminent American economist, and former university president—then provide their own assessment of the Esmark story. They offer legislative and policy prescriptions aimed at making sure U.S. business doesn't devolve into one big garage sale to foreigners seeking to take advantage of the coming decline of the U.S. dollar.

Previously unseen documents relating to the hostile reverse tender merger of Esmark, a historic first in unseating the board of directors of a publicly traded company in the United States A chronology of the "America for Sale" phenomenon and of key events in the American steel industry, from the 1970s to 2009Approximately 25 tables and one dozen graphs that make it easy for readers to interpret data related to the Esmark sale and the overall foreign stake in American companies Text boxes that focus on human interest stories and the amazing quirks attached to the sale of Esmark—for example, one of the Russian bidders also was interested in acquiring the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey team and preventing its star Russian hockey player from leaping from a team in the remote Ural mountains to the NHL; that star subsequently led the NHL in scoring in the 2009 NHL season
Highlights
Uses the Esmark story to chart the overall decline of the American steel industryArgues that the widespread sale of American strategic assets to foreigners at bargain prices is not in our national interestDemonstrates the intricacies of international business competition today, showing how ruthless that competition can beProposes specific legislative and policy changes aimed at preventing the overselling of American interests to foreign concerns on the cheap






Author Info

Craig T. Bouchard is the president of Esmark, Inc. He spent 19 years with the First National Bank in Chicago, Europe, and Asia, and at age 32 became the third youngest senior vice president in the bank's history. He moved to become the CEO of Numerix, a risk management software firm serving Wall Street banks and hedge funds, before cofounding Esmark in 2003.  James V. Koch is board of visitors professor of economics and president emeritus at Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA. He is a well published microeconomist who has served as a consultant to more than 100 business firms and universities.

Reviews/Endorsements
Reviews"Much of the economic discussion in the book is elementary, although at times it becomes very detailed. The details, however, are critical to understanding Esmark's position in the U.S. steel industry and provide some of the answers observers were seeking as the story of Esmark and its sale to Severstal developed. It was commonplace, for example, to hear steel industry veterans ask, 'How are they (the Bouchards) doing this?' or 'How do they think they can pull this off?' America for Sale tells how it was done, complete with all manner of emotion and activity from quiet confidence to brashness, hard negotiation to hand-wringing, threats to compliments and back-room dealing to back-stabbing. There is something in the book for students interested in economic lessons and for steel veterans wanting the inside story to sports fans wondering how Stanley Cup playoff hero Evgeni Malkin ended up playing with the Pittsburgh Penguins. . . . Readers also will be winners. America for Sale: How the Foreign Pack Circled and Devoured Esmark answers many questions and poses more. Those who read it likely will come away with a better understanding of the moods and motivations of major business leaders as they construct merger deals. . . . Such information could prove invaluable if Bouchard's and Koch's predictions of another round of  'America for sale' are realized."—American Metal Market"In this very readable book, Bouchard (President, Esmark, Inc.) and Koch (Economics, Old Dominion University) argue that the purchase by foreigners of critical and strategic U.S. assets is a danger to the nation's economic future. . . . Delivering an important message, this book will appeal to anyone interested in the global economics, the steel industry, or the decline of the U.S. industrial base."—Reference & Research Book News

Braidy Industries was created by Craig T. Bouchard to lead a national transformation in the use of efficient, eco-friendly aluminum alloys that are also lighter and stronger. Our goal is to lead the generational shift in materials science that is currently underway.

“Braidy Industries’ decision to locate in Eastern Kentucky has the potential to be as significant as any economic deal ever made in the history of Kentucky,” said Gov. Bevin. “This $1.3 billion investment will create enormous opportunity for people in the region, and would not have been possible without our recently passed right-to-work legislation. I look forward to the success of Braidy Industries as they leverage the incredible work ethic found in Eastern Kentucky. The ripple effect of this investment will be significant and will produce positive change in the region for generations to come.”
– Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin

State of Kentucky/South Shore, PartnersWorking Hard, Hard Working

We chose to build our brand new, fully integrated aluminum rolling mill in Eastern Kentucky for many reasons. The first of those reasons is the people. The region’s history of coal mining and other labor intensive pursuits has earned its people a well-deserved reputation for the kind of hard work and dedication that we covet in our workforce.
Eastern Kentucky also appealed to us because we found true partners in both public and private organizations at the local and state level. Governor Matt Bevin has worked with us closely to make this project a reality, and with his continued support, and the support of the people of this region, Braidy Industries is excited to call Eastern Kentucky home.
