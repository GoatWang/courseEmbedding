Archive NPA names LeDoux ComPLI committee chairman


    	Mark LeDoux, CEO of Natural Alternatives International, Inc., has been selected as chairman of the Natural Products Association’s Committee for Product and Label Integrity (ComPLI).
  

NPA | Sep 30, 2011



































	 

	The Natural Products Association (NPA) announces that Mark LeDoux, founder, chairman and CEO of Natural Alternatives International, Inc., has been named chairman of NPA’s Committee for Product and Label Integrity (ComPLI). LeDoux will focus on the development of NPA’s comments for the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) New Dietary Ingredient (NDI) draft guidance, as well as oversight of NPA’s self-regulatory programs. Learn more at www.NPAinfo.org.  

	ComPLI advises NPA on scientific and regulatory matters pertaining to the dietary supplement industry and governs the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certification and TruLabel programs. NPA’s GMP certification program is the first third-party GMP certification program for the manufacturing of dietary supplements and ingredients. NPA helps to ensure accuracy, quality and safety in the dietary supplement industry through TruLabel, a dietary supplement label registration and random-testing program.

	“As the leading voice of the natural products industry, NPA represents more than 1,900 members who support the health and well-being of millions of Americans. Mark’s leadership with NPA’s self-regulatory programs will benefit consumers and businesses across the country,” said John Gay, NPA executive director and CEO.  

	Mark LeDoux said, “I am honored to be asked to serve in this vital capacity for the NPA as well as the industry at large. We need to continue to strengthen our resolve to assure the finest quality of products for the millions of people who have come to rely on our research, science and technology to provide beneficial supplements and products that are beyond reproach. As we work to strengthen the proper role of the federal and state agencies to help us in that objective, we must also be ever mindful that too much regulation can stifle creativity and unnecessarily increase product costs. Since safety remains our predominant concern, we also need to work with the regulatory agencies to help protect our consumers from materials masquerading as healthful products which can be criminally altered. The goal of the ComPLI committee is to assure that the delicate balance between regulation and innovation remains intact while fostering advances in health for so many in need.”

	LeDoux has been a proud member of NPA since 1980 and serves on its board of directors. Natural Alternatives International, Inc. (NAI) is a publicly held corporation founded in 1980 with state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in the United States and Switzerland and a sales presence in Yokohama, Japan. NAI is engaged in the research, design and manufacture of customized nutritional supplement programs and products for multinational clients. For additional information about NAI, visit www.nai-online.com.

Natural Products Association

	The Natural Products Association (NPA), founded in 1936, is the largest and oldest nonprofit organization dedicated to the natural products industry. NPA represents over 1,900 members accounting for more than 10,000 locations of retailers, manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors of natural products, including foods, dietary supplements, and health/beauty aids. As the leading voice of the natural products industry, the NPA’s mission is to advocate for the rights of consumers to have access to products that will maintain and improve their health, and for the rights of retailers and suppliers to sell these products. Visit www.NPAinfo.org.

Description


The use of animal models is a key aspect of scientific research in numerous fields of medicine. Movement Disorders, Second Edition vigorously examines the important contributions and application of animal models to the understanding of human movement disorders, and serves as an essential resource for basic neuroscientists engaged in movement disorders research. Academic clinicians, translational researchers and basic scientists are brought together to connect experimental findings made in different animal models to the clinical features, pathophysiology and treatment of human movement disorders. 
The book is divided into sections on Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, dystonia, tremor, paroxysmal movement disorders, ataxia, myoclonus, restless legs syndrome, drug-induced movement disorders, multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy/corticobasal degeneration, and spasticity. This book serves as an essential resource for both clinicians interested in the science being generated with animal models and basic scientists studying the pathogenesis of particular movement disorders.




Key Features



Introduces the scientific foundations for modern movement disorders research
Contributing authors are internationally known experts
Completely revised with 20% new material
Provides a comprehensive discussion of genetics for each type of movement disorder
Covers Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, dystonia, tremors, and tics




Readership

About the Editor




                        Mark LeDoux
                      


Mark S. LeDoux, MD, PhD is a physician-scientist at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center.  At present he holds a joint appointment as Professor in the Departments of Neurology, and Anatomy and Neurobiology.  He specializes in the neurological subspecialty of movement disorders and treats patients at the University of Tennessee Medical Group and Memphis VA hospital.  As an active clinical researcher, Dr. LeDoux’s work has focused on the genetics and treatment of dystonia, Parkinson disease and Huntington disease.  He has described Huntington disease in a nonagenarian and reported one of the world’s largest pedigrees with HDL2.  In the laboratory, Dr. LeDoux has published extensively on the genetics and molecular biology of dystonia, mechanisms of cell death in Parkinson’s disease, animal models of dystonia and autism, and the neuroanatomy of motor systems. His work with the dt rat engendered paradigm shifts in dystonia and motor systems research.  Dr. LeDoux’s lab showed that familial and sporadic adult-onset primary dystonia may be associated with rare sequence variants in THAP1 and CIZ1.

Reviews


Praise for the first edition:
"The book is a timely review of animal models of movement disorders...The text is an excellent resource for neurologists and researchers specializing in movement disorders. In addition, this book will undoubtedly be a useful reference source for general neurologists, neurology residents, and basic science fellow and students." - Zbigniew K. Wszolek, Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic Jacksonville in PARKINSONISM AND RELATED DISORDERS (September 2005) "...this new textbook provides a comprehensive treatment of animal models used to study human movement disorders and should serve the neurologist, researcher, and other interested scientists very well."--Dr. A.S. Fix, Central Product Safety, The Proctor and Gamble Co, Miami Valley Innovation Center, Cincinnati, OH, in VETERINARY PATHOLOGY (43:5) 2006
