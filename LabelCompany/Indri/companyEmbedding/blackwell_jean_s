Cummins Inc. last week announced that Jean Blackwell, the company’s chief financial officer, was named executive vice president of corporate responsibility and CEO of the Cummins Foundation. Pat Ward, currently vice president and engine business controller, will become the chief financial officer, effective May 1. “In her new role, Jean will help us re-define Cummins’ commitment to corporate responsibility, which is critical to our success in this period of significant growth both in the U. S. and around the world,” said Tim Solso, Cummins chairman and CEO. “Jean’s new position also provides her with the opportunity to make a direct and significant impact on the communities where Cummins operates, which is very meaningful to her at this stage in her career and one of the primary reasons she joined Cummins 11 years ago.” Blackwell has been with the company since 1997 and has served in various roles including general counsel and vice president - human resources. Prior to joining Cummins, she was a partner with the law firm of Bose McKinney & Evans in Indianapolis. She also previously served as budget director for the State of Indiana and executive director of the State Lottery Commission. Ward has held a number of finance leadership positions in the company over the past 20 years. He joined Cummins in 1987 as a member of the finance team for Cummins Generator Technologies and moved to the Fuel Systems operation as controller in 1995. In 1996, he joined Corporate Finance as director - business planning and analysis. He became director - finance and information technology for Consolidated Diesel Company in 1998, and in 2000 was named controller for Cummins Filtration, then known as Fleetguard. He became power generation controller in 2003 and transferred to the Engine Business in 2005. He was named a Cummins vice president in 2006. “Both of these individuals are extremely talented and well qualified for their new positions,” Solso said. “We are excited to have them in these critical roles.” Cummins Inc., Columbus, Ind., is a corporation of complementary business units that design, manufacture, distribute and service engines and related technologies, including fuel systems, controls, air handling, filtration, emission solutions and electrical power generation systems.
