Daily Insider Ratings Round Up 7/5/17: Aldeyra, Corium, Sigma Designs, Zogenix, Dorchester Minerals - Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALDX) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Daily Insider Ratings Round Up 7/5/17: Aldeyra, Corium, Sigma Designs, Zogenix, Dorchester MineralsJul. 7.17 | About: Corium International, (CORI) InsiderInsights Long/short equity, research analyst, insider ownership, behavioral financeMarketplaceDaily Insider Ratings SummaryTables of the top insider purchases and sales filed with the SEC on 7/5/17, based on dollar value.Dollar values often do not equate with significance when it comes to insider trades.Proprietary Insider Company Ratings are relayed to clarify significance.InsiderInsights' Daily Round Up articles rate the "significance" of the top 10 dollar value insider purchases and sales filed at the SEC yesterday. Dollar value is only the most basic metric to assess the significance of an insider transaction, however, and there are many more "Significant" insider trades with lower dollar values every day in our comprehensive Daily Insider Ratings Reports, which also reach clients before the market opens each morning. We employ over a million lines of code programming our decades of experience analyzing insider transactions to harvest, analyze, and profitably rate insider transactions in real time. When a new insider transaction occurs, our programs mathematically score the significance of the company's 3-month insider profile based on numerous criteria. Stocks that achieve an InsiderInsights Company Rating of "Significant" and "Nearly Significant" have been independently validated to generate alpha as a group. Only stocks that achieve those Ratings on the tables below are highlighted in our article headlines, and have our articles linked to their Seeking Alpha company profiles. The intention of our Round Up articles is to both separate real insider investment intelligence from time-wasting noise and to educate investors that -- though insider transactions are indeed an excellent source of investment intelligence -- it takes much more analysis than screening by dollar values to make money from insider data. Seasonal note: Insider filing volumes are at a seasonal low point, as companies close trading windows to their executives until June-quarter financials are released. Form 4 filing volumes will continue to wane into the third week of July, before surging again in the first week of August.
 On Today's Tables: Insider trades were rated Significant at :  Sigma Designs (NASDAQ:SIGM); Corium Intl (NASDAQ:CORI), and; Aldeyra Therapeutics (NASDAQ:ALDX).  Insider trades were rated Nearly Significant at:  Dorchester Minerals (NASDAQ:DMLP), and; Zogenix (NASDAQ:ZGNX).  Insider trades were considered Insignificant at:  Northstar Real Estate Capital Income Fund (MUTF:XNAFX); Western Digital (NYSE:WDC); Netapp (NASDAQ:NTAP); Ihs Markit (NASDAQ:INFO); Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG); Fabrinet (NYSE:FN); FLEX (NASDAQ:FLEX); Extra Space Storage (NYSE:EXR); Easterly Acquisition (NASDAQ:EACQ), and; Discover Finl (NYSE:DFS).  There is a Conflicted Insider Signal (both purchases & sales) at: Wld Pnt Terminals (NYSE:WPT). There is an IPO or Known Corporate Action at: Aileron Therapeutics (NASDAQ:ALRN). It's difficult to argue significance for most transactions made during IPOs, or when insiders make trades during a known corporate action. Don't agree with our Rating?

DALLAS, June 30, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dorchester Minerals, L.P. (“DMLP” or the “Partnership”) (NASDAQ:DMLP) today consummated the acquisition of producing and nonproducing mineral, royalty and overriding royalty interests located in six counties in Texas from multiple parties.  The properties consist of 1,850 net royalty acres across 22,400 gross surface acres in Glasscock, Howard, Martin, Midland, Reagan and Upton Counties, Texas.

Dorchester Minerals, L.P. Announces Its Second Quarter Distribution
























DALLAS, Jul 20, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) --


                                        








Dorchester Minerals, L.P.                 

/quotes/zigman/90036/composite DMLP
-0.99%


 announced today the Partnership's second quarter 2017 cash distribution.  The distribution of $0.322965 per common unit represents activity for the three-month period ended June 30, 2017 and is payable on August 10, 2017 to common unitholders of record as of July 31, 2017.


                                        








Cash receipts attributable to the Partnership's Royalty Properties during the second quarter totaled approximately $10.0 million. These receipts generally reflect oil sales during March 2017 through May 2017 and gas sales during February 2017 through April 2017. Cash receipts attributable to the Partnership's Net Profits Interests during the second quarter totaled approximately $0.8 million. These receipts reflect oil and gas sales from the properties underlying the Net Profits Interests generally during February 2017 through April 2017.


                                        








Cash receipts attributable to lease bonus and other income during the second quarter totaled approximately $1.8 million.


                                        








Today's announced distribution includes second quarter cash receipts attributable to the previously announced acquisition of producing and nonproducing royalty and mineral interests located in the Midland Basin and reflects the 1,604,343 units issued to the contributors at closing, resulting in 32,279,774 total common units outstanding at June 30, 2017.


                                        








Dorchester Minerals, L.P. is a Dallas-based owner of producing and non-producing oil and natural gas mineral, royalty, overriding royalty, net profits, and leasehold interests located in 25 states. Its common units trade on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol DMLP.


                                        








This release serves as qualified notice to nominees as provided for under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1446-4(b)(4) and (d).  Please note that 100 percent of the Partnership's distributions to foreign investors are attributable to income that is effectively connected with a United States trade or business.  Accordingly, all of the Partnership's distributions to foreign investors are subject to federal income tax withholding at the highest effective tax rate for individuals or corporations, as applicable.  Nominees, and not the Partnership, are treated as withholding agents responsible for withholding distributions received by them on behalf of foreign investors.


                                        








FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS


                                        








Portions of this document may constitute "forward-looking statements" as defined by federal law. Such statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. Examples of such uncertainties and risk factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the price or demand for oil and natural gas, changes in the operations on or development of the Partnership's properties, changes in economic and industry conditions and changes in regulatory requirements (including changes in environmental requirements) and the Partnership's financial position, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations. These and other factors are set forth in the Partnership's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Dorchester Minerals, L.P. Announces Its Second Quarter Distribution






GlobeNewswire



Jul 20, 2017 12:25 PM EDT













 




























































 DALLAS, July 20, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dorchester Minerals, L.P. (NASDAQ:DMLP) announced today the Partnership's second quarter 2017 cash distribution.  The distribution of $0.322965 per common unit represents activity for the three-month period ended June 30, 2017 and is payable on August 10, 2017 to common unitholders of record as of July 31, 2017. Cash receipts attributable to the Partnership's Royalty Properties during the second quarter totaled approximately $10.0 million. These receipts generally reflect oil sales during March 2017 through May 2017 and gas sales during February 2017 through April 2017. Cash receipts attributable to the Partnership's Net Profits Interests during the second quarter totaled approximately $0.8 million. These receipts reflect oil and gas sales from the properties underlying the Net Profits Interests generally during February 2017 through April 2017. Cash receipts attributable to lease bonus and other income during the second quarter totaled approximately $1.8 million.  Today's announced distribution includes second quarter cash receipts attributable to the previously announced acquisition of producing and nonproducing royalty and mineral interests located in the Midland Basin and reflects the 1,604,343 units issued to the contributors at closing, resulting in 32,279,774 total common units outstanding at June 30, 2017. Dorchester Minerals, L.P. is a Dallas-based owner of producing and non-producing oil and natural gas mineral, royalty, overriding royalty, net profits, and leasehold interests located in 25 states. Its common units trade on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol DMLP. This release serves as qualified notice to nominees as provided for under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1446-4(b)(4) and (d).  Please note that 100 percent of the Partnership's distributions to foreign investors are attributable to income that is effectively connected with a United States trade or business.  Accordingly, all of the Partnership's distributions to foreign investors are subject to federal income tax withholding at the highest effective tax rate for individuals or corporations, as applicable.  Nominees, and not the Partnership, are treated as withholding agents responsible for withholding distributions received by them on behalf of foreign investors.
