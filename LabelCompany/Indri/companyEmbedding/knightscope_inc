Frequently Asked Questions





 







We Have the Answers

Privacy

Shipping
features + capabilities
Concerns








When was Knightscope founded?
The Company was incorporated in April 2013.





Why did you start Knightscope?
Knightscope was originally founded in response to the tragic events at Sandy Hook and the Boston Marathon. The founders believed that with a unique combination of hardware and software, they could greatly reduce crime… by as much as 50%!











How do you respond to those who insist remote presence devices/remote sensors are threats to individual privacy?
Interestingly, a person’s picture is taken approximately 30 times per day in public without threatening individual privacy. Generally speaking, an expectation of privacy in public areas is not necessarily logical (with emphasis on the word ‘public’). Privacy is recognized in areas such as one’s residence, phone booths, hotel rooms and places provided to ensure privacy like a conference room or restroom. Knightscope is focused on public areas away from those private spaces. The real threat is violence, which the Company is working hard to curtail.





What about privacy concerns? How does your company address them?
In the long-term, Knightscope intends to live stream any and all information gathered to the community and the authorities with full transparency when a safety alert is generated. By leveraging the social media infrastructure, Knightscope can make crowdsourcing security a reality. Technology will save lives and improve society.





Encryption?
Communication at the machine level is achieved using 802.11n WiFi and WPA2 with enterprise encryption, while the Knightscope Security Operations Center (KSOC) uses secure sockets layer for data transmission. Knightscope can, however, accommodate other common encryption methods as required by clients.











How much will each Knightscope machine cost?
A member of Knightscope’s sales team works directly with customers to determine the best application of machines to custom tailor a solution to their specific needs. Visit our contact page to schedule a demonstration today.











Can you ship the robots to locations outside of the US?
Knightscope is currently laser focused on the US market and, more specifically, the State of California. Expansion efforts are underway to begin scaling across the Continental U.S. in 2017. Crime is a global issue that must be addressed and future exports will be determined after the platform is proven completely successful locally.











WHAT IS A KNIGHTSCOPE ADM?
Knightscope Autonomous Data Machines (ADMs) are autonomous robots that provide a commanding but friendly physical security presence. The K3 and K5 gather important real-time, on-site data through their numerous sensors, which is then processed with advanced anomaly detection software to determine if there is a concern or threat in the area. If so, an event is created with an appropriate alert level and a notification is sent to the proper authorities through the Knightscope Security Operations Center (KSOC), a browser based user interface.





WHO WILL USE A KNIGHTSCOPE ADM?
Knightscope ADMs may be used in many industries and environments. The human attention span during monotonous, boring tasks is only 5-10 minutes. And with employee turnover rates as high as 400%, the security industry is rightfully seeking innovative solutions. Knightscope’s primary goal is to allow customers to utilize the best of Silicon Valley to put machines to work in those routine and sometimes dangerous situations, thus freeing up humans to do the more hands-on and strategic activities. Corporate campuses, data centers, shopping malls and hospitals are among the many clients already engaged today (think employee safety, corporate espionage, rogue networks, asset protection, etc.).





What is the battery life of an ADM?
The Knightscope K3 and K5 autonomously recharge themselves periodically, preventing long periods of downtime and allowing for the transfer of data to the cloud or to a server. Machines are designed to handle operation 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and provide continuous monitoring even while charging.





IS AN ADM BULLETPROOF?
Unfortunately, there is no such thing as “bulletproof.” The Knightscope K5 is ruggedized and protected against vandalism. Its size and sensor payload also contribute to its durability.  The Knightscope K3 is intended to be an “inside the fence” security apparatus, but it is still protected by the same sensor payload





ARE YOUR MACHINES WEAPONIZED?
ADMs are friendly community tools used exclusively to deliver relevant and real-time information to the appropriate authorities, not to enforce the law. Machines provide an additional set of intelligent eyes and ears used to help security and law enforcement professionals do their jobs more effectively.





HOW WILL YOU PREVENT PEOPLE FROM DEFACING OR DAMAGING AN ADM?
Knightscope identified several options such as proximity sensors, several alarm stages and vandal-proof coatings to protect the robots, but they won’t give away all of their secrets here...





ARE THERE ANY THERMAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL SENSORS AVAILABLE?
Yes!  A thermal camera that sees temperatures ranging from -30 degrees to +500 Centigrade is included on each ADM. The thermal sensor is capable of detecting variances in temperatures as little as 0.05 degrees Centigrade.





WHAT KIND OF PHOTOS OR VIDEOS IS THE ROBOT TAKING?
The Knightscope ADM visually observes its surroundings through the use of video cameras, a thermal camera and license plate recognition devices. While the ADMs are unique in appearance and delivery system, the security service that they provide are already commonly accepted in the public domain with fixed security camera systems. Machines proactively seek out anomalies that might suggest criminal activity – e.g., people in restricted areas – and alerting proper authorities when a concern is detected. 





WHERE AND HOW LONG IS THE DATA STORED?
Knightscope will work with each customer to determine the ideal location to store data and the lifespan of each data set.





What types of sensors are onboard?
The ADM sensor payload includes light detection and ranging (LIDAR) devices; high-definition, low-light video cameras; thermal imaging; automatic license plate recognition (ALPR); directional microphones; proximity sensors; inertial measurement unit; wheel encoders; and a global positioning system (GPS).





What speed does the robot travel?
Safety is critical at Knightscope, so an ADM will only operate at speeds that are reasonable and prudent for the surrounding conditions. Although the K3 and K5 are capable of faster speeds, they primarily operate in the 1-3 mph range under normal circumstances. 





How does the robot know where it is?
Each ADM operates within a predefined geo-fenced area. And much like a human, a machine does not rely solely on one sensor to determine its current location and plot a directional path. It utilizes data from multiple sensors – LIDAR, GPS, inertial and wheel odometry sensors – to develop a complete picture of its environment and determine a position within those boundaries. The ADM then carefully navigates, fully autonomously, along a random path seeking to thwart any evildoers.





How do you measure our robot's performance?
In terms of machine health, a dashboard will be provided as part of the Knightscope Security Operations Center (KSOC) offering to look at overall network health as well as the health of each individual machine.





Does it return to its charging station autonomously?
Yes. ADMs are constantly monitoring their own health and will optimize charge times and durations in order to ensure consistent power levels and performance.











Are the machines safe to operate in large, crowded environments?
Knightscope ADMs are fully autonomous and can navigate through an environment with moving objects. The technology is similar to that being utilized by the driverless cars that actively operate on the public roadways across several U.S. states today.





Will Knightscope technologies eliminate human security guards?
Absolutely not. There will always be a need for human security guards to do the strategic work. The K3 and K5 simply provide them with relevant, real-time information, thus extending the human security guards’ awareness and allowing them to make more appropriate decisions. Software + Hardware + Humans.  The ultimate combination.





Are Knightscope technologies intended to replace law enforcement officers?
No, they are intended to help and assist officers, improve response times and keep them out of harm’s way if possible.





What can you tell us about the safety of the sensors (infrared, etc)?
Knightscope utilizes commercially available, off-the-shelf sensors that are already proven safe and effective for everyday use.





Can customers remotely wipe the data in the event of robot theft?
Yes. Fail-safe measures will be implemented to ensure the security of the data.





How will you prevent people from defacing or damaging an ADM?
Knightscope ADMs have several features including proximity sensors, escalating alarm stages and the like to protect the robots, but why give away all secrets here...

        Autonomous security robots providing security professionals advanced detection capabilities.About KnightscopeKnightscope is developing technology that will predict and prevent crime. Crime has a $1+ trillion negative economic impact on the economy and our goal is to cut it in half with a combination of hardware, software and social engagement. This new profound level of technology has been widely covered by the media including the New York Times, NBC, FOX, CNET, Silicon Valley Business Journal, Mashable, Bloomberg, Forbes, TIME and numerous others.Autonomous Data Machines, a large-scale deployment of autonomous technology, sensors, robotics, big data and predictive analytics, will gather real-time on-site data and combine it with existing large data sets as well as relevant geofenced social network feeds, allowing for a breakthrough ability to map the future in a given environment. These self-driving robots will help society build safer, engaged communities while significantly reducing costs and crime.Product & ServiceMedia MentionsTeam StoryLooking for the next big idea, Stacy Dean Stephens (a former police officer) was seeking advice and help from a seasoned entrepreneur shortly after 9/11. While researching startups, he reached out to a young CEO – William Santana Li. Bill and Stacy quickly learned that they shared a passion for technology, hardware, brands, design and service. The two have worked on a number of projects together for more than 10 years and have developed a very collaborative shorthand that allows them to excel in their ventures...quickly.We started Knightscope because we were horrified by the recent shootings at schools. There are over 138,000 schools in the US and 19,000+ law enforcement agencies and it is not practical, scalable or affordable to place an armed officer in every single school. But we can use technology to help build safer, engaged communities while reducing costs and reducing crime.That spark has turned into a grander vision to cut the $1 trillion negative economic impact of crime in half!Meet the FoundersWilliam Santana LiChairman & CEOBill is an American entrepreneur with over 25 years of experience and has a broad and deep range of expertise gained from several global assignments in the automotive sector and a number of startups. During his career at Ford Motor Company, Bill held over 12 business and technical positions, focused on 4 continents, cutting across each functional area.These positions ranged from component, systems, and vehicle engineering with Visteon, Mazda, and Lincoln; to business & product strategy on the US youth market, India, and the emerging markets in Asia-Pacific and South America; as well as the financial turnaround of Ford of Europe. In addition, he was on the AMAZON team, which established an all-new modular plant in Brazil. Subsequently, he served as Director of Mergers & Acquisitions.After internally securing $250 million, Bill founded and served as COO of GreenLeaf LLC, a Ford subsidiary that became the world’s 2nd largest automotive recycler. Under his leadership, GreenLeaf grew to a 600-employee operation with $150 million in sales - now part of $8 billion LKQ Corporation.After successfully establishing GreenLeaf, Bill was recruited by SOFTBANK Venture Capital to establish Model E Corporation as its President and CEO, a new car company where the "Subscribe and Drive" philosophy was first pioneered in California. He subsequently co-founded Build-To-Order Inc. (BTO) as its President and CEO, a new car company based on the direct distribution of build-to-order products. Bill also founded Carbon Motors, and as its Chairman and CEO, focused it on developing the world's first purpose-built law enforcement patrol vehicle. He also built an advisory board comprised of senior officials that had worked directly for 3 different U.S. Presidents.Bill earned a BSEE from Carnegie Mellon University and an MBA from the University of Detroit Mercy. He is fluent in Spanish and conversant in Portuguese.Stacy StephensVP Marketing & SalesStacy was a co-founder of Carbon Motors Corporation where he led marketing operations, sales, product management, partnership marketing and customer service. As part of its marketing operations, Stacy oversaw Carbon’s branding, corporate communications, media and industry relations, advertising and licensing, as well as market and customer research. He also led the Company’s advertising responsibilities which included organizing and overseeing trade show exhibiting, printed promotions and electronic promotions such as photo shoots, video production, website development and social media.While at Carbon, Stacy was responsible for creating and launching the Carbon Council, an innovative and breakthrough customer interface and users group consisting of over 3,000 law enforcement professionals across all 50 states and actively serving over 2,200 law enforcement agencies. Upon completion of Carbon’s concept demonstration vehicle in 2008, Stacy coordinated the Pure Justice Tour – a 76-stop march across 25 U.S. States, Dubai and Abu Dhabi that introduced Carbon Motors to law enforcement agencies at the local, state, federal and international levels generating a $1.2 billion backlog of pending vehicle sales.As a former police officer for the Coppell (Texas) Police Department, Stacy brings a first-hand understanding of protecting lives and property, as well as the wants and needs of first responders. His keen attention to safety in all aspects, strict adherence to rules and regulations, and law enforcement training blend well with his over 24 years of experience in operations, customer service and account management. In recognition of his efforts, Stacy was named one of Government Technology magazine’s Top 25 Doers, Dreamers & Drivers in 2011 for his vision and commitment to advancing the law enforcement mission.Stacy studied aerospace engineering at the University of Texas in Arlington. He subsequently earned a degree in criminal justice and graduated as valedictorian from Tarrant County College in Fort Worth, Texas. He is a member of the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) and also sits on the IACP Division of State Associations of Chiefs of Police (SACOP) SafeShield Project, which seeks to critically examine existing and developing technologies for the purpose of preventing and minimizing officer injuries and fatalities.William Santana LiChairman & CEOBill is an American entrepreneur with over 25 years of experience and has a broad and deep range of expertise gained from several global assignments in the automotive sector and a number of startups.

Once Knightscope accepts your investment, and certain regulatory procedures are completed, your money will be transferred from the escrow account to Knightscope in exchange for your shares. At that point, you will be a proud owner in Knightscope.What is the difference between preferred equity and a convertible note?Preferred equity is usually issued to outside investors and carries rights and conditions that are different from that of common stock. For example, preferred equity may include rights that prevent or minimize the effects of dilution or grants special privileges in situations when the company is sold.A convertible note is a unique form of debt that converts into equity, usually in conjunction with a future financing round. The investor effectively loans money to a startup with the expectation that they will receive equity in the company in the future at a discounted price per share when the company raises its next round of financing.To learn more about startup investment types check out “How to Choose a Startup Investment” in our academy.What will I need to complete my investment?To make an investment, you will need the following information readily available:Personal information such as your current address and phone numberEmployment and employer informationNet worth and income informationSocial Security Number or government-issued identificationABA bank routing number and checking account number (typically found on a personal check or bank statement)Because Knightscope is offering its securities under Rule 506(c) of Regulation D, your status as an Accredited Investor will also need to be verified and you will be asked to provide documentation supporting your income, net worth, revenue, or net assets or a letter from a qualified advisor such as a Registered Investment Advisor, Registered Broker Dealer, Lawyer, or CPA.What if I change my mind about investing?Until a closing occurs, you may cancel your investment at any time, for any reason.
