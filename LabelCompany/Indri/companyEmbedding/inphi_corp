About Inphi
Inphi is the leader in data movement interconnects. We move big data fast, around the globe, between and inside of data centers.
Inphi is uniquely positioned to deliver ultra, high bandwidth optical platform solutions that enable the build out of hyper-scale Cloud data centers, service provider networks, and emerging virtual data centers.
We are the pioneer of advanced semiconductor and Silicon photonics solutions that enable our customers to expand the bandwidth and efficiency of their networks with each successive generation of switches, routers and transport equipment. Our leading edge linear transimpedance amplifiers, modulator drivers, optical physical layer devices, and coherent DSPs enable the exponential acceleration of big data transmissions for long haul, metro and data center applications for both service providers and Cloud operators.
With our coherent (from QPSK to 64QAM) and PAM4 modulation techniques, we are propelling the market forward from 10 Gigabit per second to Terabits per second transmission bandwidth, by making it possible for our customers to move bits from 2 to 16 times higher density per fiber compared to today’s limiting (0s and 1s) solutions.
Our innovative COLORZ® Silicon photonics and PAM DSP based Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing solution raises the bar by delivering the lowest power and most cost effective 4 Terabit per second per fiber bandwidth. Using COLORZ®, customers are able to connect multiple data centers in the same metropolitan area at distances up to 80km, enabling them to run as a single, efficient, virtual data center.
We develop innovative products and leading-edge solutions that help our customers connect hundreds of thousands of computers inside a data center as well as thousands of data centers around the globe. We believe that “The Data Center Is the Computer™” and “The Cloud is the Network™.” At Inphi, our solutions help our customers make that vision of tomorrow a reality today.
We move data fast. We allow our customers to move fast. And, as a result, our company is growing fast. Inphi has grown from $20M in communications revenue in 2012 to over $320M annual revenue run rate in the quarter ending December 2016. Join us and move fast as a customer or member of our team! Inphi – Think Fast.™

The Company's solutions provide an interface between analog signals and digital information in systems, such as telecommunications transport systems, enterprise networking equipment and datacenters. The Company is engaged in the design, development and sale of analog connectivity components that operate to maintain, amplify and manage signal integrity at high speeds in a range of applications. The Company's semiconductor solutions are designed to address bandwidth bottlenecks in networks and enable the rollout of communications and datacenter infrastructures. The Company provides 25 gigabit (G) to 600G high-speed analog semiconductor solutions for the communications market.The Company designs and develops its products for the communications and computing markets, which has two to three year design cycles, and product life cycles of five or more years. The Company is engaged in developing broadband analog semiconductors operating at frequencies of up to 100 gigahertz (GHz).The Company offers specific internal models and design kits for each process to support a uniform design methodology across all of its semiconductor solutions. The Company has an infrastructure to simulate electrical, mechanical and thermal properties of devices and packages that it integrates within its semiconductor design process and implements at its third-party packaging providers.The Company's mixed signal semiconductor solutions equate to the planes, trains and trucks used by physical delivery services to provide information from place to place. Its long haul and metro solutions are its planes, working across distances of 100s to 1000s kilometers. Products include its coherent transimpedance amplifiers (TIAs), drivers and digital signal processing (DSPs). The Company's data center edge interconnect solutions are its trains, delivering a range of packages, across 80 kilometer distances. Its ColorZ is a 100G DWDM solution in QSFP28 form factor, utilizing silicon photonics and 4-level Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM4) modulation, to deliver up to four terabits per second (Tb/s) of bandwidth over a single fiber. The Company's inside data center interconnects are trucks, working across hundreds of meters up to kilometers.As of December 31, 2016, the Company's product portfolio included products that had commercially shipped, products for which the Company had shipped engineering samples and products under development. These products performs a range of functions, such as amplifying, encoding, multiplexing, demultiplexing, retiming and buffering data and clock signals at speeds of up to 400 gigabit per second (Gbps). These products are key enablers for servers, routers, switches, storage and other equipment that process, store and transport data traffic. The Company sells its products directly to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and indirectly to OEMs through module manufacturers, original design manufacturers (ODMs) and sub-systems providers.The Company competes with Acacia Communications, Inc, Broadcom Ltd., GigaPeak Inc., M/A-COM Technology Solutions Inc., Maxlinear, Inc., Microsemi Corporation, NTT Electronics Corporation, Qorvo Inc. and Semtech Corp.

The Technology
The world of computers, communications, and instrumentation is changing constantly and fast. The demand for faster, smaller, and better keeps getting bigger. This demand makes it increasingly difficult to design components that meet the desired requirements for speed and bandwidth. These challenges did not make Inphi Corporation take a backseat. Instead, we developed a proprietary design methodology that is aimed to successfully produce products that are top-of-the-range and will perform at its maximum, no matter the semiconductor process technology.
Despite the engineering and design challenges that face Inphi Corporation in order to remain the best, we offer products that cannot be compared. Whether it is a simple timing component or a process of interconnecting high-speed analog components and still keeping its performance high, we guarantee we will find a way.
Our Products
Our products are widely used in communications, optics, microwave, and other systems. Our products are designed and engineered to be the best. Our designers and engineers work closely with our clients to design and manufacture components that will give them the edge. Our team often challenges the boundaries of possibility and creates the most innovative components in the world.
Our products have the following characteristics, no matter what the specifications:

Highest signal integrity
Lowest power dissipation
Smallest form factor
Fast speed
High performance
Lowest system costs for specifications
High-speed analog circuitry as far as possible
Fast rise and fall times
Low jitter
Great eye quality

Inphi Corporation’s high-speed components are the answer to any component requirement when it comes to optic and instrumentation systems as well as communications and data center operations. Our combination of cutting-edge technology and design and a fierce desire for success and client satisfaction, makes Inphi Corporation the best in component manufacturing.
