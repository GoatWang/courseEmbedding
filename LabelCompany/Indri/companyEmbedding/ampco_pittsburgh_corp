Ampco-Pittsburgh Corporation (American Metal Products Company) is a specialty steel manufacturer headquartered in Downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[3] It is one of several companies to bear the Ampco name, and it should not be confused with the Milwaukee-based copper base alloy producer, Ampco Metal Inc.; the Miami-based cabinetry company; the Swiss aluminum corporation; or the Dallas-based tool company. Ampco was formed in 1929 and is a conglomerate made up of several previously established small steel makers. Five small companies operate under the Ampco umbrella in two different product segments.
About the Company[edit]
The Forged and Cast Rolls portion of the corporation includes two companies: Union Electric Steel and Davy Rolling Company.[3][4] Union Electric is the world's largest producer of rolled steel, which is used in the cold rolling process of making many metals. The subsidiary offers a variety of grades of thickness and hardness for the product. Davy Rolling Company, a former British corporation, creates cast rolls, heavy duty rolls, and specialty rolls.
The Air and Liquid Processing Segment of the company comprises Aerofin, Buffalo Air Handling, and Buffalo Pumps.[4] Aerofin creates steel coils for use industrially in power plants and oil extraction and commercially in automobiles, and heating/cooling systems. Under Buffalo Air Handling, metal plating, parts, and fans for huge ventilation and refrigeration systems are manufactured. Buffalo Pumps is the maker of a variety of pumps for various industries.Ampco's Selling and administrative expenses increased from 2003 to 2005, due to higher sales commissions attributable to the higher volume of sales.[5]
In 2008, their chairman & former CEO, Robert Paul, became a minority partner in the Pittsburgh Steelers, purchasing a minority stake in order to keep controlling ownership within the Rooney family.[6] Paul and his family acquired a 16% stake in the team as part of the deal, though the Rooneys will remain as primary owners.

The Montreal-based drug company, which is still recovering from an accounting and drug pricing scandal that cost billionaire investor Bill Ackman $4 billion, has unveiled a series of actions in the last week.   On Monday, Valeant (VRX.T) announced the sale of skin care company Obagi Medical Products for $190 million in cash, proceeds it will use to repay term loan debt. Last Monday, the company said it had used the proceeds of the recent sale of Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC to pay off $811 million of term loans.  (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/valeant-pays-down-811-million-of-term-loans-shares-rise-2017-07-10)   Then on Thursday, it said it was redeeming about $500 million of outstanding 6.75% notes  (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/valeant-redeems-500-million-of-debt-on-track-to-meet-or-exceed-5-billion-debt-reduction-goal-2017-07-13)that mature in 2018 using cash on hand, a move it said put it ahead of its goal to reduce debt by $5 billion within 18 months of the first quarter of 2016. The company has no major debt maturities and no mandatory amortization requirements through 2019, giving it needed breathing room.   Analysts at Stifel said their focus has moved back to fundamentals and that prescription trends at the company's core franchises--ophthalmology, consumer, dermatology and gastrointestinal treatments--appear to be mixed, with GI regaining traction but dermatology still struggling.   "Dermatology volumes are still declining across the broad product line, and we look for updates on the efforts to reverse these trends," they wrote in a note published Monday. "We expect part of this effort will involve the launch of new product Siliq (treating moderate-to--severe psoriasis) this quarter, with complement coming from IDP-118/-122 in 2018," a treatment that is moving toward approval.   The company's GI franchise is benefiting from an expansion of its primary care sales force, and "appears to be proceeding on a steady upward trajectory," said the note. The company's Xifaxan is having greater success with the Irritable Bowel Syndrome patient community, and prescriptions rose 5% in the second quarter, according to Stifel.   See also:Valeant's stock surges after largest shareholder John Paulson elected to board (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/valeants-stock-surges-after-largest-shareholder-john-paulson-elected-to-board-2017-06-19)   Valeant's Apriso treatment for ulcerative colitis saw prescriptions grow 4% in the quarter, while its Relistor treatment for adults with opioid-induced constipation and chronic non-cancer pain saw prescriptions grow 16%.   The company's Bausch + Lomb ophthalmology product line and its consumer business are steady, and have benefited from a product refresh and demand from overseas.   Stifel has a buy rating on the stock, which has gained a stunning 85% in the last three months. That's a blow to Bill Ackman, who was a longtime investor in Valeant and stuck by the company through an embarrassing accounting scandal  (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/valeant-investigation-finished-without-a-written-report-2016-04-08)that led to the ouster of its chief executive, Michael Pearson.   Under Pearson's leadership, the company had pursued an aggressive acquisition strategy that involved buying drugs and sharply raising their prices. That strategy sent the stock to highs above $250 in 2015, before the accounting scandal broke and it collapsed to lows below $10. The stock was up 2.4% Monday at $17.65, while the S&P 500  was flat.   Ackman finally threw in the towel in March  (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bill-ackman-sells-valeant-stake-to-step-down-from-board-2017-03-13)at a $4 billion loss. The stock has gained 45% since he liquidated his position.   Read now:Ackman has 'something to prove' after Valeant mistake (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bill-ackman-has-something-to-prove-after-valeant-mistake-2017-05-18)   Some other analysts have also become more bullish on the stock of late. TD Securities raised its price target last week to $20 from $15, although it maintained a hold rating, "pending evidence of sustainable progress in two areas."   "Foremost are Valeant's core growth engines, where we are looking for reacceleration," said analyst Lennox Gibbs. "Secondarily, we are monitoring the various legacy investigations and legal proceedings for progress to resolution."   J.P. Morgan struck a more cautious tone in early July, maintaining a neutral rating with a $10 stock price target: "The recovery of Valeant's core business remains the most important component of the company's ongoing turnaround plan and we see only limited indications of an inflection in fundamentals," analyst Chris Schott wrote in a note.   See: Valeant's new finance head warns that things won't get any better in 2017 (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/valeants-new-finance-head-warns-that-things-wont-get-any-better-in-2017-2016-11-08)   Credit analysts remain bearish, however. Vicki Bryan at Gimme Credit said the equity market was overreacting to comments from Valeant management that it would consider debt-for-equity swaps as a way to reduce debt.   "Even if the rumors are true, implied outcomes of such transactions don't seem to support such enthusiastic optimism," she wrote in a note in June.   It would take a huge transaction in the order of $4 billion to even nudge Valeant's high leverage lower by just one turn, and even that would not help as EBITDA continues to fall. A deal that large would also dilute the equity.   "Instead, any debt-for-equity swap Valeant might actually achieve likely will be comparatively small and of nominal benefit at best toward easing the company's critically stressed financial condition," she wrote.   Valeant's most-active bonds, the 5.50% notes due in March of 2023, were trading at 85.25 cents on the dollar Monday, to yield 8.887%, according to MarketAxess.   -Ciara Linnane; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com    (END) Dow Jones Newswires  July 18, 2017 07:13 ET (11:13 GMT)  Copyright (c) 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.Earnings Calendar and Events Data provided by |Terms of Use| © 2017 Wall Street Horizon, Inc.Market data accompanied by  is delayed by at least 15 minutes for NASDAQ, NYSE MKT, NYSE, and options.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
