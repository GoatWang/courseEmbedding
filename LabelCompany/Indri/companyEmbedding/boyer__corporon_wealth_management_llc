Read the Latest Investment Commentary 

Energy Independenceby BCWM11 July, 2017Recently, we attended a couple of industry conferences… conferences loaded with “knowledgeable experts” who somehow manage to disagree with each other from time to time. Disagreements aside, we came away with several nuggets that we feel will help us negotiate the securities markets today. Here are several of them: Our long-held view that interest rates will remain low has not changed. Even though 222,000 new jobs were created in June and unemployment remains low at 4.4%, massive global debt will continue to be an insurmountable hurdle to robust global economic activity. Fuel prices will remain under control. Shale fracking has made the United States virtually energy independent; a concept we couldn’t even imagine 15-20 years ago. This has several important implications: Companies that rely on fuel as a major component of their expense structure should experience more predictable earnings results. A good example of this is airlines that have always been at the mercy of unpredictable jet fuel costs. Not so much anymore. The United States will have less need  (...)

Talking Heads



by Richard Boyer, CFP®, CFA
 / 
 Thursday, 22 September 2016






Aside from Super Bowls, the first 2016 presidential debate to be held on September 26th figures to be the most watched prime time program in the history of television. Which is really odd because when I talk to people, I don’t seem to run into very many “undecided” voters. With rare exception, virtually every person is either voting for Hillary Clinton because they think she is the most qualified (or because they can’t stand Donald Trump) or voting for Donald because they can’t stand Hillary.
Ostensibly, debates are conducted to help voters decide who is the most qualified candidate. So if everyone already has made up his or her mind, why would the debate have such a large audience? Because it is going to be INCREDIBLY ENTERTAINING, that’s why! 
Viewers will be glued to their TVs to see if Donald can be successful dragging the debate into playground banter. Meanwhile they will be watching to see if Hillary can maintain her composure better than the Republican candidates did during the primary debates.
We frequently get asked our opinion about the effects of the election on investments. We’re not even sure how to respond to that question today. Our first thought when asked that question is that presidents get way too much credit when the economy and markets are good, and they get way too much blame when they are bad. There are global and geo-political forces at work that have a much greater effect than the results of Election Day.
Ultimately, fiscal policy does become important, but we’re not yet sure what to be concerned about. Yes, Hillary has made it clear that she wants to bring down the cost of health care, particularly pharmaceutical costs. But can she be successful and will that overcome the massive wave of aging baby boomers’ demand for health care? If drug stocks declined after Election Day, we might use that as a buying opportunity.
If Donald is elected president should we own more defense stocks? And should we invest in companies that manufacture bricks? (Because it will take a lot of bricks to build that wall.)
When watching the debates, there are several important issues that should concern you as a U.S. citizen and registered voter. I wrote about two of them in the August Investment Commentary VOTE!
One major issue is the Supreme Court and how many vacancies might open during the next presidential term.
The other issue is jobs (or lack thereof). You should try to ascertain which candidate will be most successful creating quality jobs for the middle class. The gap between the “haves” and the “have-nots” has grown wider than ever, and it is beginning to threaten the political ideology of this country.
We need a more vibrant economy that generates jobs for the average American.

Markets took the month of August off and went to the beach. Neither the S&P 500, nor the All World Index nor the Barclays Aggregate Bond Index was up or down more than 1%. The two stock indexes were up a smidge, and bonds were down a smidge. Maybe the calm before the storm? We didn’t say that.
For the calendar year, U.S. stocks are up 7.8% while the All World (ex U.S.) Index was up 4.53%. Bonds are up just under 6%. Not a bad year so far in spite of August sitting this one out.

We know this is a slight exaggeration, but it seems as if almost every minute of every day, the drones at CNBC obsess about whether or not the Fed is going to raise interest rates. All day long someone is opining about the odds that the Fed will or will not raise interest rates. And the amount of interest rate hike they are obsessing about is .25%.
So what? Who cares?
We realize this is in part due to the fact that they have very little else to talk about. But we are here to tell you this is much ado about nothing.
For the record, our opinion is that they won’t raise rates. But even if they do, what’s the big deal? It’s a non-event. If the stock market reacts significantly to a rate increase, it will be short-lived… as short as the BREXIT reaction.
So quit worrying about a rate increase by the Fed and worry about fiscal policy that will foster an economy that will create good jobs… lots of good jobs.
At Boyer & Corporon Wealth Management, we are not yet seeing signs of a recession and are not yet hedging our equity positions. This year, we’ve been beefing up our allocations to emerging markets (particularly Brazil, Chile, Russia, India and South Africa) as well as our allocations to gold and gold mining companies.
We are not shortening our durations in bonds, but are finding it difficult to locate good quality bonds with any kind of decent yield.

VOTE!



by Richard Boyer, CFP®, CFA
 / 
 Tuesday, 16 August 2016






In what will easily be the most bizarre presidential campaign in our lives (maybe in history), I am telling you today that it is important that you vote. I’m not telling you which candidate should receive your vote. My Investment Commentary remains impartial for a reason.
But never in my life have I heard so many people say, “I hate them both, so I’m not going to vote.” And it’s a fair statement. Both of them are not very likable, each for their own special reasons.
Although there may be other good reasons for you to cast a ballot (foreign policy, deficit spending, fiscal policy, she’s a liar, he’s a loose cannon), the most important reason is the Supreme Court. Over the next four years, there are likely to be as many as four new vacancies on the Supreme Court.
The president of the United States gets to choose who fills those vacancies. Yes, Congress has to confirm the selection, but they only vote on who the president chooses.
And whoever gets selected and confirmed serves on the Supreme Court for THE REST OF HIS or HER LIFE! Which means whoever wins in November will likely have a large impact on this country and our lives for the next 30 to 40 years.
If you would like for the Supreme Court to become very liberal, then you probably should cast your vote for Hillary Clinton. If you would like for the Supreme Court to become more conservative, you should probably cast your vote for Donald Trump.
You might think, “It doesn’t matter if I vote because my state (be it California or Kansas) is so heavily Democratic or Republican, my vote won’t even matter.” Ordinarily that’s probably a true statement, but I think this is a year that traditional voting trends could get turned upside-down. Just a feeling.
However, if you live in one of the traditional “swing states” (Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Florida, etc.), you DEFINITELY NEED TO VOTE.

The biggest red flag to come out of this presidential campaign is that Bernie Sanders generated as much support as he did. Either Hillary underestimated his potential and ran a really bad campaign or Bernie’s message is starting to sound really good to a lot of people. Maybe a little bit of both. At the Democratic Convention, the crowd cheered when Bernie was introduced. And they kept cheering for about three to four minutes. This is scary.
When socialist ideology begins to sound like a better system, a capitalist society needs to LISTEN! The reality is that the gap between the “haves” and the “have nots” in the United States has gradually grown wider and wider over the past three decades.
If it continues to grow wider, the next “Bernie Sanders” will likely garner even more support and may actually become the Democratic nominee. It’s conceivable that a Socialist candidate could become president someday….unless the “haves” sit up and listen….and vote for the candidate that will create meaningful jobs for the middle class and narrow the gap between ultra-rich and everyone else.
I’m not sure I know who that candidate is, but in the long run, it is the candidate who says he or she intends to shrink the size of the government. For the past sixteen years or more, we have watched the government grow dramatically under both a Republican (Bush) and a Democratic (Obama) president.
Governments don’t create meaningful jobs. The private sector does. The larger the government, the smaller the private sector. Vote for the candidate who outlines well how he or she intends to create private sector jobs. Otherwise, brace yourself for an even larger government than we already have….and eventually a socialist government. You won’t want to own stocks if that happens.

The stock market loved last month. During July, the S&P 500 increased 3.68%, and it has increased 5.59% for the past 12 months. Since the recession ended in February, 2009 it is up 245%, an annual rate of 18.1%. Of course, that’s cherry picking from the bottom of the stock market crash. If you dial the returns back to the end of October, 2007, the S&P is only up 6.23% annually.
As I’m writing this, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ are all three hitting record highs, the first time that has happened since December, 1999. If I recall correctly, what happened shortly after December, 1999 was not pretty. The S&P 500 peaked in March, 2000 and fell over 36% over the next 18 months. And those were the good stocks. Because this was a “Tech Stock Bubble,” the technology laden NASDAQ declined over 70%!
We are not necessarily predicting a 35% – 70% market crash in the next two years. The NASDAQ, while it has had a nice run, is trading nowhere near the ridiculous valuations at which it was trading in 2000.
(Although there were many insane tech stock stories, one of my favorites involves a stock called JDS Uniphase. At the peak of investor tech stock insanity/euphoria, it traded at $666 per share, adjusted for splits. In 2008, at its nadir, it traded at $1.25 per share. They have since changed the name of the company. Probably so that we would quit talking about them.)
We do, however, feel that stocks are not cheap. They are not horribly expensive but they are not cheap. Markets have traded at much higher prices (relative to earnings) than they are today. And seldom have we experienced interest rates this low. When the risk free rate of return remains low, the temptation to invest in risky assets becomes more attractive. Many stocks today pay dividends greater than the interest rate on the 30-year Treasury Bond.
In an environment where interest rates are very low, stocks can become very expensive….and more expensive….and even more expensive. And if investor perception is that interest rates might go even lower, stocks can get ridiculously expensive as investors misprice risk in order to get a reasonable return. This has the potential to end very badly.
Meanwhile, interest rates remain ridiculously low and will remain ridiculously low for a long time. Earlier this month, the Bank of England (BOE) reduced interest rates by .25% to .25%. The BOE also pledged to purchase billions of pounds of high grade corporate bonds in order to keep rates low.
The U.S. Bond market continues its 35-year bull run, interest rates declining in July. The 30-year US Treasury bond traded as low as 2.09%, closing the last day of July at 2.28%. The 10-year closed the month at 1.45% after trading as low as 1.35%.
At Boyer & Corporon Wealth Management, we have increased the duration of our fixed income securities since we feel interest rates will remain low and possibly go lower.
Although we are not yet reducing or hedging our equity positions, we are nervous. But as long as interest rates remain low and trend even lower, investors will probably continue to drive stock prices higher.
