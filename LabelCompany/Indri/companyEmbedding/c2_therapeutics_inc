One Balloon.  Highly Conformable.  No Sizing. 









The C2 CryoBalloon® Focal Ablation System sets a new standard for simplicity in ablation of Barrett’s esophagus. The device is a through-the-scope, highly compliant balloon catheter that is simultaneously inflated and cooled by an inert refrigerant delivered from a small disposable handheld unit.
The balloon conforms to the shape of the esophageal lumen without exerting excessive tension on the esophageal wall.
The cryo spray delivers a precise focal application.
Operation is intuitive, fast, and cost-effective. The C2 CryoBalloon® Ablation System eliminates the need for precise sizing, multiple deployment steps, and large controller units.

C2 Therapeutics, Inc. Key Developments

C2 Therapeutics Announces Initiation of Coldplay III Trial Validating the C2 CryoBalloon™ Focal Ablation System for Primary Treatment of Barrett’s Esophagus
Jun 7 16
C2 Therapeutics announced the initiation of its Coldplay III trial with treatment of the first patient at University Hospitals in northeast Ohio. The patient was treated with the C2 CryoBalloon Focal Ablation System by John Dumot, D.O., Director, Digestive Health Institute, University Hospitals, commencing the clinical trial to validate the efficacy and safety of the system in patients with Barrett's esophagus. The prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, single arm study (NCT02514525) will enroll 60 patients with multifocal Barrett's esophagus less than 6 cm in full circumferential size and no previous treatment. The primary outcomes measure is eradication of any grade Barrett's esophagus at 12 months post-treatment. This will be evaluated by using the Seattle protocol surveillance strategy that involves targeted biopsies of mucosal abnormalities, plus four-quadrant biopsies obtained at every 1 cm. The presence of Barrett's esophagus and degree of disease will be confirmed by histopathologic analysis. Participating trial centers include: Columbia University Medical Center in New York, New York; Geisinger Medical Center in Danville, Pennsylvania; John Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland; Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; University Hospitals Ahuja Medical Center in Beachwood, Ohio; University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, North Carolina; and University of Rochester Medical Center in Rochester, New York.

C2 Therapeutics Receives FDA 510(K) Clearance for the Coldplay Cryoballoon Full and Swipe Ablation Systems
Jul 29 15
C2 Therapeutics announced US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance for the Coldplay Cryoballoon™ Full Ablation System and the Coldplay Cryoballoon™ Swipe Ablation System. Barrett’s Esophagus develops as a result of chronic injury from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Over time, the normal esophageal lining is replaced with abnormal cells (Barrett’s Esophagus), putting patients at greater risk of developing cancer of the esophagus.

It is a cryosurgical system with a nitrous oxide cooled balloon that is compatible with a commercially available endoscope with a minimum working channel inner diameter (ID) of 3.7 mm and length of 100 cm. The C2 CryoBalloon System is a system comprised of a Catheter (sterile), Controller (non-sterile), and Cartridge (non-sterile). The Device is used to ablate unwanted tissue by application of extreme cold. The balloon at the distal end of the Catheter comes in contact with tissue and is inflated with nitrous oxide. Tissue is visualized through the inflated balloon, and the treatment site is selected by adjusting the endoscope and Controller position. The nitrous oxide spray cools the balloon to ablate the unwanted tissue, and the nitrous oxide exhausts through the Controller.

Who Is C2 TherapeuticsDelivering A Better Approach to Barrett’s: CryoBalloon® Ablation Systems for ablation of Barrett’s esophagus
About Us
Founded in 2007 and headquartered in Redwood City, California, C2 Therapeutics developed the C2 CryoBalloon® Ablation System for use as a cryosurgical tool in the field of general surgery, specifically for endoscopic applications, to include ablation of Barrett’s esophagus with dysplasia. Acquired by Pentax Medical – a division of HOYA Group – in January 2017, C2 Therapeutics continues to innovate and enhance its C2 CryoBalloon® Ablation System as a new standard for simplicity in the eradication of esophageal disease.

Our Technology
The technology comprises a through-the-scope, highly compliant balloon catheter that is simultaneously inflated and cooled by an inert cryogen delivered through a small disposable handheld unit. Operation is intuitive, fast and cost-effective. The C2 CryoBalloon® Ablation System eliminates the need for precise sizing, multiple deployment steps, and controller units.

When your car's battery is old, drained or otherwise not working properly, you may experience problems ranging from a sluggish engine start to leaking battery acid or a "check engine" light on your dashboard. Whether you're performing routine maintenance or trying to quickly solve an unexpected battery problem, Walmart has the supplies you need to get the job done at Every Day Low Prices. Walmart's automotive department offers a variety of car battery options in different sizes and voltages in addition to useful battery-related accessories such as portable battery chargers, jumper cables and charging system monitors. Many of the batteries and accessories are available with free two-day shipping or same-day in-store pickup so you can quickly get your car or truck back up and running. Other options Car and truck batteries aren't the only vehicle battery options available. You can a find a variety of battery options for other vehicles, adding convenience and efficiency to your shopping experience. You don't have to look anywhere else for your vehicle battery shopping needs. Marine batteries: From small motor boats to large yachts, we offer batteries that can suit a large variety of boat types and sizes in a range of different voltages, amperages and dimensions. We also offer both lead acid and lithium-ion marine batteries, giving you the ability to choose just the right replacement for your boat. Some of these batteries are also designed for crossover use with recreational vehicles (RV). Lawn and garden batteries: Though they usually aren't as large as a car battery, lawnmowers and other lawn equipment have batteries that need to be replaced periodically. Our assortment of lawn and garden batteries includes those for both riding and walking electric lawn mowers. Batteries come from a range of different manufacturers, including Snapper, Black & Decker, Sears, Yard Man and Toro. Power sport batteries: Motorcycles, scooters, ATVs and snowmobiles need batteries, too, and we've got a great selection of batteries that are specially made for these power sport vehicles. Find replacement batteries for power sport vehicles made by brands including Yamaha, Honda and Harley-Davidson in this department. Other batteries: Walmart also offers assorted batteries for vehicles and motorized electronic devices not listed above. From wheelchairs to kids' toy ride-on cars, we offer the same convenient in-store or home-delivery service for these assorted specialty batteries as we do for all our other battery options in the Car Batteries department. Replacing your car battery In most cases, a car battery should be properly disposed of and replaced with a brand-new battery after three years of use. If your battery is three years old or older and you're experiencing issues like sluggish engine ignition or a complete electrical failure caused by a dead battery, it's worth it to simply replace the old model rather than trying to jump start or charge. In some cases, your car's battery may need to be replaced sooner. For example, if your battery is being drained by a faulty electrical component in the car's audio system, that could lead to the need for early replacement. Multimeters and other battery testers can tell you when your battery is nearing the end of its lifespan, but you can also err on the side of caution and opt for replacement if you know your battery is nearing the three year mark or if you have some sort of electrical system issue that's causing a drain. Recommended replacement times for other vehicle battery types may vary. Battery selection assistance While you can often determine what kind of battery to buy for your vehicle by looking at what's currently under the hood, that's not always sufficient. If you aren't sure what kind of replacement battery you need for a given car, truck, lawnmower, boat or power sport vehicle, Walmart offers assistance both online and in store. Our online Walmart Battery Finder tool allows you to input information like vehicle type, make, model and engine type to determine the right battery match for your needs. It's a simple way to ensure you don't accidentally pick out the wrong battery, which can actually be dangerous to install.Show moreElectrode, Comp-138129722, DC-prod-dfw1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

Keep your car rolling with automotive tires and parts With the right equipment and the proper care, you can keep your car running like new for many years. Walmart carries the tires, oils, fluids and auto parts and accessories you need to stay on the road without worry. Plus, auto tools make it easy to find the right products for your car. With Walmart's convenient, affordable auto services, you can get your car serviced while you shop. Car and truck tires If you're looking for tires for your car or truck, be sure to pick out a set that's right for your vehicle and driving conditions. For the optimal performance at all times, consider buying tires for the worst weather and driving conditions you're likely to encounter in a specific season, and use Walmart's Tire Finder to select the right size for your vehicle. It's a good idea to get multiple sets of tires for different seasons if you live in an area with extreme weather conditions. Winter tires Winter tires are made with a softer compound and feature more rubber than summer tires. They need to stay soft and flexible so they can grip the road better, even in colder conditions. When the temperature hits 44 degrees Fahrenheit, summer and all-season tires become hard and lose their effectiveness. Look for winter tires for better traction and safer handling in the cold months. Lawn and tractor tires When it comes to lawn and tractor tires, there are three main kinds to choose from: Turf tires are the least aggressive of the three styles and are meant primarily for mowing your yard. Worksite (also known as R4) tires are used on hard surfaces like asphalt, concrete and gravel. They're a bit wider so they distribute the weight they re carrying more evenly, which means less stress on the tire but also less traction. They're best used in dry conditions. Agriculture tires are the most aggressive of the three, providing better traction for soft fields and loose dirt. They're recommended for working in the snow, mud and general farm use. Trailer tires Trailer tires aren't like car and truck tires. They don t need to be steered and aren't connected to complex suspension, steering and braking systems. Don t use car and truck tires on a trailer; it s a safety hazard. Instead, look for Special Trailer (ST) tires. They provide a heavy-duty load capacity, and the stiff sidewalls help to prevent your vehicle from swaying. Also, they re designed for trailer wheels, which are typically narrower than the wheels on a car. ATV tires The first step to choosing the right ATV tire is knowing the type of terrain you'll be riding on. All-purpose tires are good for year-round riding in "non-extreme" conditions. If you re going to be riding around in yards and woods and other normal terrain, this is the tire for you. Sand tires are probably the most recognizable ATV tires. The rear tires look like paddles and the front tires provide a rib down the middles or sides to assist with steering. You won t get far on the sand without these. Mud tires have deep, thick lugs to offer traction and support in extreme mud conditions. There are also motocross tires, offering traction and speed for dirt race tracks with jumps. Off-road tires are great for everything from mountainous terrain to racing across a wide-open desert. Golf cart tires If you have your own golf cart, you'll eventually need to get new tires, especially if you play a lot of golf. Modern golf cart tires are tubeless and come in a variety of sizes and tread patterns. Standard golf cart tires measure 18 inches tall (outer diameter) by 8.5 inches wide (across the tread) by 8 inches at the bead (inner diameter). They're designated as NHS, which means "non-highway service," and aren't designed to withstand heavy loads or high speeds. Tire accessories Walmart makes it easy to shop for motor oil, transmission fluid and car lubricants too. When choosing motor oil, be sure to consult your car's owner's manual for specifications and choose the best viscosity for your conditions. Low-viscosity oil is good for easier starts in cold weather, while high-viscosity oil is good for higher temperatures and maintaining proper oil pressure under loads. Walmart also carries car batteries, replacement parts, interior and exterior car accessories, and everything you need for auto detailing and car care, from auto paint to car wax and polish. Be sure to shop for car safety and security devices for that extra peace of mind. Save money.

Battery selection assistance While you can often determine what kind of battery to buy for your vehicle by looking at what's currently under the hood, that's not always sufficient. If you aren't sure what kind of replacement battery you need for a given car, truck, lawnmower, boat or power sport vehicle, Walmart offers assistance both online and in store. Our online Walmart Battery Finder tool allows you to input information like vehicle type, make, model and engine type to determine the right battery match for your needs. It's a simple way to ensure you don't accidentally pick out the wrong battery, which can actually be dangerous to install.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147366600, DC-prod-dfw1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

Get your purchases fast with our free two-day shipping programThere's so much convenience when it comes to online shopping. It's easy to find exactly what you're looking for all in one place when you shop with Walmart online. Plus, you can see all the items that you want to purchase and know immediately whether they're in stock or not. However, two issues that arise   that you don't deal with when you're shopping in store   is that you sometimes have to wait several days to get your purchases or pay a higher additional fee to get your purchases shipped faster. However, thanks to Walmart, you don t have to deal with either problem. We offer free two-day shipping on millions of the items that we sell, and it's all available to you without joining a membership club or paying extra fees for the privilege. Combine this with our low prices, every day, on everything, and you can get the things you want quickly at prices that fit your budget.How Walmart's free two-day shipping worksWhen you're looking at our website to find the types of items that you're interested in purchasing, the first step is to look for the logo that says 2-Day Shipping on the product page. Many of these items will also state Free store pickup or Free store pickup today below the free shipping information. If you see these words on the product page for your item, you have the additional option to pick the item up for free at your chosen Walmart location or receive it at your designated location for free as long as you spend $35 or more. If your purchase is less than $35, you can upgrade to free shipping for $5.99.On the left-hand side of all the pages on our website, you'll see a section that section labeled Shipping & Pickup. Beneath that, you'll find the option for 2-Day Shipping. Click the radio button next to 2-Day Shipping and the page will reload, displaying only items that are available for free two-day shipping. As long as you place your order by 2 p.m., you can expect delivery in two business days. This means that, if you order your item after 2 p.m. on a Friday, you won't receive it until the following Wednesday. However, if you order it on Tuesday before 2 p.m., you can expect to get it by the following Friday. Keep in mind that weekends and holidays don't count as business days for shipping. Also, be sure to note that the 2 p.m. cutoff time is relative to the time zone where we're shipping your item from, not the time zone from where you're ordering it.Other shipping optionsRemember that any item that's marked with 2-Day Shipping on its page is also eligible for free shipping on qualifying purchase amounts. Most of these items are also eligible for in-store pickup   many of them that same day   even if you order after 2 p.m. If you select an item that's not eligible for our free two-day shipping program, there are many others that are eligible for free three- to five-day shipping. Again, this free shipping is only for purchases of $35 or more. Items that are part of this shipping promotion include Marketplace and freight items, but shipping costs are based on location on a case-by case basis for these products.If you're ordering an item that we're not shipping to you   but one of our trusted partners is   it's possible that they might offer free shipping too. However, it might not be for a specific time frame. To verify, check the shipping information found on the product page, located below the item's price.What you should know about the free two-day shipping programHere's some additional information about Walmart's free two-day shipping program:Residents of Hawaii and Alaska aren't eligible for the free 2-Day Shipping program; it's only available in the contiguous United StatesRecipients who have their packages sent to these locations   AA, AE, AK, AP, AS, FM, GU, HI, MP, PK, PW and VI or any APO or FPO in the continental U.S.   will receive free three- to five-day shipping for their items on purchases of more than $35. There may be additional surcharges to ship to one of these areas, and this information will appear when you check out with your purchase.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147384878, DC-prod-dfw2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-
