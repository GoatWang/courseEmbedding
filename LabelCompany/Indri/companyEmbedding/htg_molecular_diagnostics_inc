 HTG EdgeSeq system
The HTG EdgeSeq system automates our novel target capture and library prep chemistry and helps enable fast and easy use of next-generation sequencers (NGS) for microRNA (miRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA) and fusions analysis. The HTG EdgeSeq system simplifies library and sample prep for targeted sequencing enhancing productivity and ease of use.  The HTG EdgeSeq extraction-free chemistry also can significantly reduce sample input requirements, especially from formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples. By using the HTG EdgeSeq system, scientist can go from raw sample to sequencing-ready libraries in ~28 hours with less than a few hours of hands-on time. The HTG EdgeSeq system also eliminates biases associated with DNA/RNA extraction, size selection, cDNA synthesis, and adapter ligation. This helps ensure libraries prepared from precious samples like FFPE tissue, or plasma, can be generated reproducibly. The HTG EdgeSeq informatics package greatly simplifies data analysis.

 HTG EdgeSeq Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Cell of Origin Assay (DLBCL COO)
The HTG EdgeSeq DLBCL Cell of Origin Assay provides a simple, automated gene expression-based assay to subtype diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) tissues.
DLBCL is a broad grouping of lymphomas generally diagnosed by cell morphology and immuno-phenotype. The traditional diagnosis of DLBCL does not, however, establish the DLBCL sub-type of the tumor.
The HTG EdgeSeq DLBCL Cell of Origin Assay provides a subtype classifier that identifies Activated B-Cell like (ABC), Germinal Center B-cell like (GCB) or “unclassified”. The classification software was trained and validated on over 250 samples previously sub-typed by microarray-based gene expression profiling.
In addition to DLBCL classification, a single section of 5 µm FFPE tissue provides expression data for many potential drug targets and lymphoma lineage markers.
For additional questions regarding the HTG EdgeSeq DLBCL COO Assay please contact us at dlbcl@htgmolecular.com or orders@htgmolecular.com

 miRNA Profiling
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ~22nt non-coding strands of expressed RNA that are used by the cell for gene regulation. While research in this area is still young, these molecules have been implicated in various forms of disease, which makes miRNA profiling a viable method for biomarker discovery.
miRNA profiling has traditionally been performed using microarrays, RT-PCR, and sRNA sequencing. These methods can suffer from tedious workflows and sample quality issues.  Learn more about the HTG EdgeSeq miRNA Whole Transcriptome Assay product.
Example
Profiling miR-205 with an HTG EdgeSeq system reliably differentiates between squamous and non-squamous lung carcinoma.

 
miR-205 expression is a highly specific marker for squamous cell carcinoma in lung cancer. The HTG EdgeSeq system differentiates nicely between Sq/non-Sq. let7a-5p expression is shown as a comparison. Data were normalized to all counts and plotted in R.
HTG has developed and commercialized the HTG EdgeSeq miRNA Whole Transcriptome Assay to enable tumor profile screening and discovery.

Performance
Specificity
 

Closely related synthetic miRNA pools from ABRF were split between pools. All possible probes were used to profile individual pools. 3-11% of NPA probes bound to off-target sequences with a 1-base difference (Figure 1A) while only 0.1-0.3% of NPA probes bound to off-target sequences with a 2-base difference (Figure 1B). In both examples, the on-target hybridization signal is at least 8X greater than off-target hybridization. Data was generated using the Illumina MiSeq v2 1x50 reagent kit.
Sensitivity
 

The HTG EdgeSeq miRNA Whole Transcriptome Assay comparison of matched FFPE vs Fresh Su-DHL6 B-cell lymphoma tissue was performed (Figure 2A). A matched sample correlation plot is shown demonstrating a Pearson Correlation (R) of >0.98. We also demonstrate little-to-no loss of information when using FFPE tissue compared to fresh frozen tissue.
To further demonstrate sensitivity, the dynamic range of 46 housekeeper genes was measured after 3 separately-barcoded sample replicates were profiled using the HTG EdgeSeq miRNA Whole Transcriptome Assay coupled sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq platform (Figure 2B). We demonstrate at least 4 logs of dynamic range with coefficients of variation at ~3%.
Sample Flexibility
 


The HTG EdgeSeq miRNA Whole Transcriptome Assay was run with Heart FFPE (Figure 3A) and plasma samples (Figure 3B). Technical replicate correlation plots are shown. Data were filtered for signals under 70 and log(2) transformed before plotting. We demonstrate that the HTG EdgeSeq miRNA Whole Transriptome Assay coupled with NGS produces robust profiling for many tissue sources.

HTG Molecular Diagnostics Has Its Own Niche - HTG Molecular Diagnostics (NASDAQ:HTGM) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»HTG Molecular Diagnostics Has Its Own NicheJul.18.17 | About: HTG Molecular (HTGM) Thomas Pangia Value, dividend investing, contrarian, biotechSummaryHTG Molecular may be a takeover target.QGEN has taken an ownership stake in HTGM.HTGM’s platform may fit well with QGEN’s molecular diagnostics segment.QGEN and HTGM have entered into a statement of work agreement to advance their partnership.HTGM’s price has been choppy, recent increases might be precursors for a takeover bid.Author’s Note: HTG Molecular Diagnostics (HTGM) is a nanocap stock with a market cap of under $30 million. This perspective is not an endorsement to buy, sell, or trade HTGM, but instead should be taken as an exercise in due diligence. Caution should be taken if investing in such a security, which may be volatile and may result in substantial and rapid changes to investor principal. Some Major Movement Ahead? Sometimes the market moves suddenly on stocks, which if an investor can get ahead of it, may result in significant returns. While many investors are skilled at timing movements like this, particularly in small-cap stocks, I’m not one of them. I prefer a larger stock with substantial earnings and even a nice dividend. But I may be here at the right time to watch a big move. HTG Molecular Overview HTG Molecular Diagnostics (HTGM) is a small cap company with a focus on molecular profiling rather than in-house drug discovery. The company’s primary thrust is the delivery of mechanisms that can aid in cancerous tumor profiling, combining several different advances to aid in identification and subsequent treatment. HTGM is taking on an issue with current testing, which isn’t as efficient as it could be. Previously diagnostic workup required between 5-10 specially prepared tissue samples. As technology has advanced and more information is both needed and accessible from a tumor (subtypes, mutation status, etc), even more samples are required. But the more samples required, the more invasive these tests become with respect to the patient. For certain cancer types, using NSCLC (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer) an example, these aforementioned tests are performed using several different methods. The full profile isn’t compiled until the end of the testing, which takes time.
 Standard Tissue Profiling 

 Source: HTGM Additionally each testing method is a multi-step process. Virtually all methods require nucleic acid extraction, with the exception of FISH (Fluorescent in-Situ Hybridization, which uses fluorescent markers to identify certain features in chromosomes). Nucleic acid extraction is a multi-step process which is also time-consuming. Not only that, but inherent inefficiencies result in some sample specimen losses, and may even cause biases in the results. These limits of the current conventional methodology have led HTGM to develop improvements. The company’s HTG Edge technology platform allows multi-parameter tumor profiling from very few samples. With just one sample, the HTG Edge platform is capable of exceeding industry performance in comparable tests. 

 Source: HTGM The HTG Edge platform is able to reduce both sample prep time and quantity required since it does not require the complicated nucleic acid extractions which have hampered efficiencies of other testing methods. HTGM’s Streamlined Procedure 

Source: HTGM  The company’s approach has a significant level of automation while reducing need for some complicated techniques (mainly the aforementioned nucleic acid extraction). The advances brought about by the recently-launched HTG Edge platform are estimated to bring a $1.5 billion market opportunity within reach of the company. 
 Other Eyes on the Prize? HTGM has made some important advances in streamlining tumor profiling techniques, which have attracted the attention of another company. Qiagen (QGEN) is also interested in the progress that HTGM is making. Such a platform might fit well in QGEN’s own molecular diagnostics segment. If current trends are an indication, QGEN’s comparable oncology testing capabilities lag behind HTGM’s, while requiring roughly 6 times the sample tissue, according to the above figures. With $273 million in cash on hand, QGEN might just decide to buy HTGM (or its Edge technology platform) outright. This advance would place QGEN as a potential leader in molecular diagnostics. Regardless of whether a takeover is imminent, QGEN is slowly extending tendrils of control over HTGM. In November of 2016, QGEN announced the purchase of 833,333 shares of HTGM, roughly 8% of the current shares outstanding. In addition to a (still significant) minority stake, QGEN has also been exerting control over HTGM in another way. Recently QGEN and HTGM inked a statement of work, SOW, agreement which will lay groundwork for a potentially multi-phase project for development and commercialization of a next-generation diagnostic assay. HTGM will be initially paid “low single digit millions” in the initial phase, as well as a share in net profits. Depending on the performance of the partnership, QGEN may decide that HTGM will be an excellent addition to its own molecular diagnostics segment. Any Value Here? HTGM is a company with a highly competitive technology, which may be in the sights of QGEN as a possible acquisition target. It might be useful to see a value estimate by discounted cash flow for HTGM. The next 10 years were forecast and used in the model. An interactive model is included here. All values are in millions except for final share price estimates. The company’s products were estimated as one offering, the HTG EdgeSeq. The market for cancer diagnostics is estimated at $130 billion, with an annual growth rate of 7.6%. This growth rate was used in the forecast. With HTGM projecting their HTG Edge platform to bring access to a $1.5 billion market, it appears that HTGM might be able to capture roughly 1% of the overall global cancer diagnostics market. Additionally with the statement of work agreement with QGEN, it was estimated that HTGM would split revenues 50/50 with QGEN. Although the takeover of HTGM by QGEN is a possibility, this situation was not considered in the cash flow model. HTGM’s EBITDA margins were estimated to rise to 25% of revenue over the course of the projection. To maintain its product development, R&D was projected at 30% of revenue, leveling off at 25% as the company matures. Depreciation and amortization, D&A, was estimated at 24% of revenue, a bit lower than the company’s historical average. Net working capital, NWC, was estimated at a negative 12% of revenue, concurrent with historical average. Free cash flow, FCF, was obtained from subtracting D&A from EBITDA to give EBIT. Taxes (projected at 15% to account for future growth in company earnings) were subtracted from EBIT to find NOPAT (net operating profit after taxes). NOPAT was adjusted by subtraction of R&D an NWC investment, followed by addition of D&A to bring FCF.
 WACC, weighted average cost of capital, was found from comparison of adjusted betas of comparable companies. High and low estimated of un-levered beta were found and combined with estimates of equity and debt percentages of capital. The estimated tax rate of HTGM was used to find the company’s re-levered beta estimates, which were used as multipliers for market risk premium (5.5%). The adjusted risk premium was combined with the risk free rate (4%) and further adjusted to account for inherent risk of HTGM (somewhat significant since HTGM is both small and volatile). Historical EBIT/interest expense ratios for HTGM were averaged, showing interest rate coverage to indicate a high default spread (estimated at 12%). The default spread was added to the risk free rate to give an estimate of HTGM’s implied cost of debt. This was adjusted according to HTGM’s tax rate to give an after-tax cost of debt. High and low estimates of WACC were obtained by scaling costs of debt and equity by debt and equity percentages of capital respectively, and summing the factors. The midrange of the estimates, 14.51%, was selected as the discount rate and adjusted in increments of 100 basis points to give a range. The mid-year convention was used to find discounting periods, which were then used in conjunction with the discount rates to form an array of present value scaling factors. This scaling array was combined with FCF estimates for each projected year to obtain discrete present values that were summed to give a net value. A perpetuity growth rate range was estimated, from moderate decline to higher growth (as HTGM seems to have a significant growth opportunity with its product line). The growth rates were used with terminal FCF, discount factor, and discount rate to give a terminal value estimate. The present value of the terminal value was combined with the present value of cash flows to give an enterprise value estimate. Each of the selected enterprise value estimates were adjusted by addition of cash, equivalents, and other investments, while debt was subtracted to give values of common equity. Common equity estimates were divided by the number of HTGM shares outstanding (11 million used here) to give several implied fair vale estimates. Modified sensitivity analysis gave a distribution of fair value estimates. My fair value estimate of $3.58 lies close to the largest cluster of distributions in the projected range.

 Source: Author’s Projections. Final Thoughts HTGM has developed a product that may have an “Edge” over the competition in diagnostic testing. This could lead the company to significantly grow its revenues in the near future. While HTGM appears to be set to grow with its potentially superior product, it may even be a takeover target in the sights of QGEN, which has both purchased a stake in and partnered with HTGM. My price target for HTGM, $3.58, is roughly 40% above the current price. Whether HTGM is purchased by QGEN, or if it just sits on its own merits HTGM appears to have some potential for upside. I consider it worth holding in my own portfolio as part of the speculative portion since HTGM is such a small company.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  You should read the following discussion and analysis together with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements due to various factors, including those set forth under the caption "Item 1A. Risk Factors."  Overview  We are a commercial stage company that develops and markets products and services based on a proprietary technology that facilitates the routine use of targeted molecular profiling. Molecular profiling is the collection of information about multiple molecular targets, such as DNA and RNA, also called biomarkers, in a biological sample. Molecular profiling information has many important applications, from basic research to molecular diagnostics in personalized medicine. Our technology can be used throughout that range of applications, which is just one of its many benefits. Our focus is on clinical applications. Our primary customer segments include biopharmaceutical companies, academic research centers and molecular testing laboratories.  As part of our business model, we seek to leverage key business drivers in molecular profiling, including the acceleration of precision medicine, the migration of molecular testing to next generation sequencing, the movement to less invasive biopsies, the need for greater diagnostic sensitivity, the need to conform to changing healthcare economics and the need for automation and an easily deployable workflow. Our products include instrumentation (or platforms), consumables, including assay kits, and software analytics that, as an integrated system, automate sample processing and can quickly, robustly and simultaneously profile tens, hundreds or thousands of molecular targets from samples a fraction of the size required by prevailing technologies. Our objective is to establish our solutions as the standard in molecular profiling, and to make their benefits accessible to all molecular labs from research to the clinic. We believe that our target customers desire high quality molecular profiling information in a multiplexed panel format from increasingly smaller and less invasive samples, with the ability to collect such information locally to minimize turnaround time and cost.  In 2014, we launched our HTG EdgeSeq technology, which generates a molecular profiling library for detection of RNA using NGS. Our HTG EdgeSeq assays are automated on either our HTG Edge or HTG EdgeSeq platform. Our HTG Edge platform is capable of running both our original, plate-based assays and our NGS-based HTG EdgeSeq assays. We continue to support a small number of customers interested in utilizing our plate-based assays (on a custom manufacturing basis); however, in 2016, based on market trends and customer feedback, we shifted our product focus fully to our NGS-based HTG EdgeSeq system. Our innovative platforms and menu of molecular profiling panels are being utilized by a wide range of customers including biopharmaceutical companies, academic institutions and molecular labs to simultaneously analyze a comprehensive set of molecular information from valuable clinical samples and improve the lab's workflow efficiency. Customers can also obtain the advantages of our proprietary technologies by engaging our VERI/O laboratory for pre-clinical and clinical research-related services. We currently market several proprietary molecular profiling panels that address the needs of customers in translational research, biomarker discovery and potentially companion diagnostics. In addition, we have a focused development pipeline that includes planned panels for translational research, drug development and molecular diagnostics. Our product strategy is to develop a suite of profiling panels with initial focus in immuno-oncology and next generation pathology.  We have incurred significant losses since our inception, and we have never been profitable. We incurred net losses of $26.0 million and $21.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and had an accumulated deficit of $115.6 million as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had available cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately $7.5 million and investments in highly liquid corporate and government debt securities totaling $4.3 million and had current liabilities of approximately $10.0 million plus an additional $14.0 million in long-term liabilities primarily attributable to our growth term loan and NuvoGen obligation. We believe that these factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. While we believe that our existing cash resources are sufficient to fund our operations until mid-way through the second quarter of 2017, we cannot provide assurances that changed circumstances will not result in the depletion of our capital resources more rapidly than we currently anticipate.  We will need to raise additional capital in the near future to fund our continued operations. Additional capital may not be available in amounts needed by us. Even if sufficient capital is available to us, it might be available only on unfavorable terms. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly reduce expenses, sell assets (potentially at a discount to their fair value or carrying value), enter into relationships with third parties to develop or commercialize products or technologies that we otherwise would have sought to develop or commercialize independently, cease operations altogether, pursue an acquisition of our company at a price that may result in up to a total loss on investment to our stockholders, file for bankruptcy, seek other protection from creditors, or liquidate all of our assets. In addition, if we default under our term loan agreement, our lenders could foreclose on our assets, including substantially all of our cash which is held in accounts with our lenders.  Factors Affecting our Performance  Our business model has evolved and expanded since our IPO was completed in May 2015 primarily due to our success in the development of a biopharmaceutical customer base, entry into collaboration agreements with certain biopharmaceutical customers and changing customer demand from product sales to service offerings in our VERI/O laboratory. We believe the mix of product- and service-based revenues will continue to evolve over time as our product menu expands and, particularly, if we successfully develop one or more companion diagnostic products as a result of our work with biopharmaceutical customers. We believe that our future results of operations are dependent on several factors discussed below. While each of these areas present significant opportunities for us, they also pose significant risks and challenges that we must successfully address. See the section entitled "Risk Factors" for further discussion of these risks.  Biopharmaceutical Biomarker and Companion Diagnostic Solutions  Biopharmaceutical companies are working to improve the efficacy of their drugs by better targeting appropriate patients for specific therapies. Our products and services are being used by our biopharmaceutical company customers to identify molecular biomarkers that can help determine which patients will or will not respond to a drug candidate. These customers can obtain the benefits of our technology by purchasing our platform and assays for their internal use or by engaging us to perform certain services. Due to the increasing demand of our biopharmaceutical customers for services throughout 2016, we announced and branded our VERI/O service laboratory. Our VERI/O laboratory offers support for our biopharmaceutical customers in biomarker research and companion diagnostic development, and further expands our traditional service offerings, including molecular profiling of retrospective cohorts to support development of targeted and immuno-oncology therapies, building custom research-use-only panels to support early stage clinical programs and developing investigational-use companion diagnostic assays for use in Phase 3 registration trials. We believe our product and service solutions provide us with a growing number of opportunities to collaborate with biopharmaceutical companies in their drug development programs. Because our technology is being used for biomarker detection and, ultimately, patient registration in such programs, we believe we are well positioned to manufacture and commercialize high-value companion diagnostic assays required in the corresponding drug approvals. We track our pipeline of biopharmaceutical company programs as well as the number of such customers with whom we are working to measure our progress.  Customer Adoption of HTG Technology  Today we believe the primary measure of adoption for our technology is our companion diagnostic pipeline with biopharmaceutical companies discussed above. In the future, we expect increased sales of our instruments and consumables to our pharma customers or their contractors to support their internal research and drug development efforts and, as discussed below, to other customer segments as we add to our assay menu and, especially, as we launch high value diagnostic, including companion diagnostic, products. We currently market and sell on a limited and targeted basis our research use only applications to biopharmaceutical companies, academic translational research centers and in Europe, molecular testing labs.  Our ability to increase instrument and consumable revenue depends on several factors, including (i) adoption of our HTG EdgeSeq platforms by our customer base, including increasing market share for our proprietary panels for the research market; (ii) the efforts of our sales and marketing teams to demonstrate the utility of our products and technology; (iii) our ability to develop and market novel molecular profiling panels designed to meet customer needs, including unmet medical needs; (iv) our ability to demonstrate the benefits of our products to key opinion leaders so they will publish information supporting those benefits; (v) pricing and reimbursement; (vi) our ability to expand the addressable market of our HTG EdgeSeq platform through the development of new applications; (vii) our product capabilities compared with competition; and (viii) successful outcomes to our companion diagnostic collaborations. Given the length of our sales cycle, we have in the past experienced, and will likely in the future experience, fluctuations in our instrument and consumables sales on a period-to-period basis.  A key element of increasing adoption of our technology measured by instrument placements is our assay and panel "menu." Menu is defined as what assays are available for use on the instruments to satisfy customer needs. To sell additional instruments, grow our installed base and drive larger consumable annuities we must develop and commercialize new assays. Our arrangements with biopharmaceutical companies are expected to generate new menu items as well as our diagnostic development strategies in immuno-oncology and next generation pathology. As of December 31, 2016, we had an installed base of 47 HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq systems in various stages of use, including units that are under evaluation. We are focused on high quality instrument placements and consumable pull through as the primary indicators of commercial adoption and success in our business.  Timing and effectiveness of research and development expenses  Our spending on research and development may vary substantially from period to period due to the availability and cost of clinical samples, prioritization of research and development projects or timing of milestone payments under technology development  agreements. We have instituted a stage-gate based method of new product development managed by an innovation council which is led by our Chief Executive Officer. All programs are reviewed by time, quality and budgetary metrics at each phase of the project.

Together, all such consumables may be referred to as assays, assay kits or kits. We also generate revenue through the sale of services related to our proprietary technology, such as sample processing, custom research-use-only assay development and, pursuant to collaboration agreements with our biopharmaceutical customers, development of IVD assays. Because of increased demand for sample processing by our biopharmaceutical customers, a trend that we expect to continue in future reporting periods, we announced and branded of our VERI/O laboratory service in the second quarter of 2016. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by 27% to $5.1 million compared with total revenue of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Product revenue  Product revenue includes revenue from the sale of our HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq instruments and related consumables, and was $2.8 million compared with $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and was comprised of the following:   Years Ended December 31, Change 2016 2015 $ % Instruments $ 522,813 $ 789,231 $ (266,418 ) (34 %) Consumables 2,237,129 2,742,797 (505,668 ) (18 %) Total product sales $ 2,759,942 $ 3,532,028 $ (772,086 ) (22 %)  Revenue from the sale of our instruments for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $523,000 compared with $789,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, and represented 10% and 20% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in instrument revenue from 2016 to 2015 is primarily attributable to our focus on biopharmaceutical  customers whose preference has been to access our technology via services through our VERI/O laboratory. We expect our revenue mix to continue to contain a higher portion of biopharmaceutical service revenue in the near term until we enter the commercial clinical diagnostic market.  Revenue from the sale of consumables is derived from the sale of our research-use-only molecular profiling assays for use on our HTG EdgeSeq platform and from the sale of custom molecular profiling assays that we have developed for customers. Consumable revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $2.2 million compared with $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and represented 44% and 68% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition to the increase in biopharmaceutical customer demand for services discussed above, we also experienced a significant reduction in consumable sales to a single customer from 2015 to 2016. The customer completed a large, retrospective sample analysis project in late 2015. While this customer continues to place orders for our miRNA panel, its 2016 consumable orders were significantly below their 2015 levels. We believe this is not an unusual occurrence in the research market where orders are project driven. Our total consumable sales to all other customers increased from 2015 to 2016.  Service revenue  Service revenue consists primarily of sample processing and molecular profiling of retrospective cohorts through our VERI/O laboratory, though it also includes the design of custom panels for biopharmaceutical customers and research services, resulting from research and development collaboration agreements with biopharmaceutical customers. Service revenue represented 46% and 5% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and was comprised of the following:   Years Ended December 31, Change 2016 2015 $ % Custom assay development $ 235,818 $ 101,792 $ 134,026 132 % Sample processing 2,136,970 81,966 2,055,004 2507 % Total service revenue $ 2,372,788 $ 183,758 $ 2,189,030 1191 %  The increase in service revenue for the period ended December 31, 2016 compared with 2015 reflects our success in continuing to grow our biopharmaceutical customer base and expand our ability to serve the needs of those customers through our VERI/O laboratory. We have been able to enter into new and expanding biopharmaceutical collaborations, partnering with biopharmaceutical company customers who have chosen the HTG EdgeSeq system for use in their drug development programs, and who primarily prefer to access our technology via services in our VERI/O laboratory. Because of existing development agreements with biopharmaceutical customers such as BMS and Merck KGaA, which were entered into in 2016, and continued efforts to expand our services to biopharmaceutical customers going forward, we expect our service revenue may continue to increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue in 2017.  Cost of revenue and gross margin  Cost of revenue includes the aggregate costs incurred in manufacturing, delivering, installing and servicing instruments and consumables, as well as the costs incurred for services performed for customers in our VERI/O laboratory. The components of our 2016 cost of revenue are material, subcomponent and service costs, manufacturing costs incurred internally (which include direct labor costs), and equipment and infrastructure expenses associated with the manufacturing and distribution of our products. Additionally, internal costs incurred in our VERI/O laboratory, including direct labor and consumables, are included in cost of revenue.  For the year ended December 31, 2015, cost of revenue also included manufacturing costs that were paid to third-party manufacturers who were responsible for the manufacturing of our instruments at that time. We completed capital improvements to our manufacturing facilities the first quarter of 2016, at which point we began manufacturing our instruments internally. Further, cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 included costs associated with our NIH grant program.  For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, cost of revenue included significant fixed costs comprised primarily of manufacturing and service headcount, field service engineers and facilities. Due to the fixed nature of expenses associated with direct labor, equipment and infrastructure, we expect our cost of revenue as a percentage to decrease over time as we increase product and service revenue, further absorbing these fixed costs.  Cost of revenue increased by $800,000, or 24% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with the year ended December 31, 2015. Since 2014, we have directed most of our commercial and marketing efforts to our HTG EdgeSeq products that do not utilize our chemiluminescent reader technology. Based on market demand, we discontinued the active marketing of our original HTG Edge technology in December 2016; provided that we will continue to support HTG Edge consumable needs for a limited  number of customers on an as-requested custom manufacturing basis for some period of time. The increased cost of revenue in 2016 was primarily due to the write off of the remaining $360,000 value of our HTG Edge Reader inventory, the recording of a $133,000 excess inventory reserve for our original HTG Edge system and additional inventory write offs to cost of product revenue of approximately $167,000 relating to our HTG Edge and plate-based consumables technology during the year ended December 31, 2016.  Despite these non-cash charges, gross margin as a percentage of total revenue improved from 17% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 19% for the year ended December 31, 2016. This percent improvement reflects an increase in product and service revenues, allowing us to further absorb our largely fixed manufacturing costs and an overall the reduction of manufacturing costs resulting from a change to internally manufactured instruments, which began early in 2016.  Research and development expenses  Research and development expenses represent costs to develop new proprietary panels and corresponding assays, to obtain FDA approval for our first U.S. IVD assay and to continue to develop and improve our HTG EdgeSeq platform. These expenses include payroll and related expenses, consulting expenses, laboratory supplies and equipment and amounts incurred under collaborative supply or development agreements. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses increased by $3.3 million, or 72%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with the year ended December 31, 2015. We expect research and development costs to continue to increase in 2017 due to the ongoing development of our V2 chemistry and the possible resumption of our Project JANUS development efforts in the second half of 2017. In addition, we expect higher costs from collaboration projects under agreements with our biopharmaceutical customers and costs associated with the fourth and final submission for our first PMA.  Selling, general and administrative expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our sales and marketing, regulatory, legal, executive management and finance and accounting functions. The expenses also include third-party professional and consulting fees incurred by these functions, promotional expenses and facility and overhead costs for our administrative offices. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $2.4 million, or 16%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with the year ended December 31, 2015. This year over year increase was primarily a result of operating as a public company for a full year, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and The NASDAQ Global Market, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, additional director and officer insurance costs, investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services. This increase also included higher sales and marketing costs related to a reorganization of our US-based commercial sales team, increased commercial sales activities in Europe, expansion of marketing efforts to accelerate market adoption of our products and commissions on overall increased revenue generated in 2016.  Loss from change in stock warrant valuation  Loss from the change in stock warrant valuation for the year ended December 31, 2015 was a result of an increase in the fair value of our preferred stock warrants just prior to the exercise of Series D preferred stock warrants, and the conversion to common stock warrants of our Series C-2 preferred stock warrants, convertible note warrants and growth term loan warrants at the time of our initial public offering. The increase in the fair value of our preferred stock warrants until their conversion to common stock warrants was primarily attributable to the proximity to and increased likelihood of completing an initial public offering. There was no loss from change in stock warrant valuation for the year ended December 31, 2016.  Interest expense  As of December 31, 2016, we had an obligation due to NuvoGen Research, LLC, or NuvoGen, in the amount of $8.6 million under an asset purchase agreement and an obligation due to a syndicate of two lending institutions of $11.8 million, net of discount and deferred financing costs under a growth term loan entered into in August 2014 and amended in August 2015 and June 2016.  Interest expense relating to borrowings under our term loan agreements and non-cash interest expense related to our obligation to NuvoGen increased by $148,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2015. The year over year increase was primarily the result of interest, discount and final fee premium recognized in 2016 on the $5.0 million growth term loan borrowed in March 2016, partially offset by reduced interest on the original growth term loan and the NuvoGen obligation as principal payments were made on both liabilities in 2016.  Loss on settlement of convertible debt  With completion of our initial public offering in May 2015, our remaining convertible note debt discount and deferred financing costs relating to the convertible notes totaling $0.7 million were charged to loss on settlement of convertible debt with the issuance of common stock in settlement of the convertible notes and related accrued interest. There were no convertible notes outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2016.  Cash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 The following table summarizes the primary sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented: . . .
