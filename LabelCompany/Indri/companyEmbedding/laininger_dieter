Frequently Asked Questions
Q: How many boxes should I order?
We recommend you stock up while today's savings are available by choosing either our three- or six-box money-saving packages. These “Special Discount” bundle packages will have you saving up to 20% off the single box price when you purchase your BioTrust Protein Cookies today. Additionally, these packages allow you to take advantage of our lowest possible prices while supplies last, without the worry of increasing prices and/or additional shipping fees later.
Q: What specifically makes BioTrust Protein Cookies such a premium, healthy, fat-burning snack?
BioTrust Protein Cookies…

Each cookie contains 12 grams of fat-fighting, time-released quality protein.
The proteins are hormone-free, sourced from cows not treated with dangerous, genetically engineered growth hormones like rBGH and rBST (not the case for the majority of all other protein products).
BioTrust Protein Cookies are free of artificial sweeteners, colors, and flavors.
They’re also gluten-free and GMO-free.
Did we mention they taste AMAZING? :-)

Q: What flavors are available?
BioTrust Protein Cookies come in two outrageously delicious flavors: Frosted Oatmeal Raisin and Chewy Chocolate Chip.
Q: How many cookies come in a box?
Each box of BioTrust Protein Cookies contains 12 large, individually wrapped high-protein cookies.
Q: What are the nutrition facts?

Q: What is the best way to use this product? 
Use 2 BioTrust Protein Cookies as a full meal replacement or snack. Each large cookie is individually wrapped, so they're ultra-convenient and portable on top of being extraordinarily delicious and healthy.
Q: Are there any allergy concerns with this product? 
Like every BioTrust product, BioTrust Protein Cookies are made with natural ingredients. Our cookie recipes do not include any ingredients from fish, or Crustacean shellfish. Independent laboratory testing ensures potency and purity. GMP quality assured. No sugar, artificial sweeteners, flavors, colors or preservatives added. It’s also Gluten-Free and non-GMO.
Oatmeal Raisin CONTAINS: Milk, egg and soy (lecithin).
Chewy Chocolate Chip CONTAINS: Milk, egg, tree nut (coconut) and soy (lecithin).
These products are manufactured in a facility that also processes peanuts and wheat. Of note, soy lecithin serves as an emulsifier and is purified to effectively reduce the allergenic components associated with soy products.
Q: Should I keep taking this product after I achieve my weight goal? 
BioTrust Protein Cookies are a healthy, nutritious snack that can be used as part of your weight loss plan or a weight maintenance plan.  They are a true, good-for-you delicious snack that your entire family will enjoy!

“As a trainer who works with professional athletes it's critically important that I have a brand of nutrition products I trust to recommend to my clients—that brand is BioTrust Nutrition. The testing and research that goes in to each product, along with NSF and GMP quality certifications make them the only brand I'll send my million dollar players to.”
-Dan Long
Tampa, Florida


“At my practice here in Indiana, and with all my weight loss clients all over the world, we trust BioTrust. With the quality control they have in place, along with the extraordinary amount of time and research that goes in to each product formulation, it's a no-brainer for me to recommend BioTrust to both my clients and patients alike.”
-Dr. Charlie Livingston
Carmel, Indiana


“As a Nutrition Specialist, I'm extremely picky about which supplements I recommend to my clients. The poor standards of many supplement companies and low quality ingredients are a joke, but Biotrust is different, with some of the highest quality ingredients in the industry. Also, their formulas are top notch, all backed 100% with legitimate science.”
-Mike Geary
Author, Truth About Abs


“When you take extreme dedication to being on the cutting edge of health information and combine that with an unwavering commitment to designing and testing products backed by laboratory-research and real-world results, you have something special: a supplement company that's actually worth your time. BioTrust IS that company.”
-John Romaniello, CPT
New York City, New York


“I've been working with the owners of BioTrust for years, and I'm blown away by the “quality filter” on every product they produce. You can rest assured that the ingredients chosen for BioTrust products are top of the line and customer service is their #1 priority. A supplement company needs to see your health as their #1 priority, and these guys do.”
-Dr. Kareem Samhouri
San Francisco, CA

Apidren has jumped to the top of the ratings in just about every category as the #1 diet pill! Recognized by ConsumerPriceWatch as the most powerful diet pill on the market for close to a decade, this all-natural formula makes controlling your appetite and regaining your confidence as easy as possible. With the results users are seeing from Apidren, we were not surprised to see Apidren has the highest re-order rate. Apidren has dominated the effectiveness and ingredient ratings because of its unique ingredients.

We see Fenphedra as the most “controversial” and powerful diet pill we have ever reviewed. Fenphedra notoriously claims to have revealed the secret to lasting weight loss. While such claims have yet to be verified, we know the science behind leptin and NPY to be solid.  The fat loss potential of these two chemical processes is mind-boggling and may be the focus of future weight loss research!
Fenphedra could have easily been our #1 rated diet pill if not for its safety concerns. There have been rumors Fenphedra contains phentermine. Any rumors of such claims are completely false, but Fenphedra does contain Chromax. Fenphedra combines Green Coffee Bean and Caffeine, which have been shown to significantly reduce body fat,  BMI and trigger fat oxidation. Finding bottles of Fenphedra in the U.S. can be difficult because rumors are flourishing that it may be taken off the market. Fenphedra retails for $130 per bottle and comes with a 100% money-back guarantee. The cheapest place to buy online occasionally has bottles available for as low as $69.95. Read More

Fenphedra is the most “controversial” and powerful diet pill for women we have ever reviewed. It stimulates what is known in the scientific community as CART, inhibiting NPY. The fat loss results of these two chemical processes are mind-boggling.
Fenphedra could have easily been our #1 rated diet pill for women  if not for its safety concerns. There have been rumors Fenphedra contains phentermine and prescription-strength pain relievers. Any rumors of such claims are completely false, but Fenphedra does contain phenylethylamine. Often referred to as the “Love Drug,” phenylethylamine is extracted from cocoa and responsible for the “chocolate high” sensation. Fenphedra also contains Green Coffee Bean, Chromax and Dicaffeine Malate, which dramatically burn fat, suppress appetite, and increase energy. Finding bottles of Fenphedra in the U.S. can be difficult because rumors are flourishing that it may be taken off the market like banned diet pills for women. Fenphedra retails for $130 per bottle and comes with a 100% money-back guarantee. The cheapest place to buy online occasionally has bottles available for as low as $69.95. Read More

We see Fenphedra as the most “controversial” and powerful diet pill we have ever reviewed. Fenphedra notoriously claims to have revealed the secret to lasting weight loss. While such claims have yet to be verified, we know the science behind leptin and NPY to be solid.  The fat loss potential of these two chemical processes is mind-boggling and may be the focus of future weight loss research!
Fenphedra could have easily been our #1 rated diet pill if not for its safety concerns. There have been rumors Fenphedra contains phentermine. Any rumors of such claims are completely false, but Fenphedra does contain Chromax. Fenphedra combines Green Coffee Bean and Caffeine, which have been shown to significantly reduce body fat,  BMI and trigger fat oxidation. Finding bottles of Fenphedra in the U.S. can be difficult because rumors are flourishing that it may be taken off the market. Fenphedra retails for $130 per bottle and comes with a 100% money-back guarantee. The cheapest place to buy online occasionally has bottles available for as low as $69.95. Read More
