Simulation for Supply Chain Management

Caroline Thierry (Editor), Andre Thomas (Editor), Gerard Bel (Editor) 
ISBN: 978-1-84821-090-5
360 pages
September 2008, Wiley-ISTE



















Description
This book provides a detailed insight into the simulation approaches employed in the study of supply chain management and control. It begins by examining the types of simulation models (continuous simulation, discrete-event systems and simulation games) before moving on to the distribution levels of systems and models. It concludes with a thorough discussion of simulation products. Simulation methodologies and techniques are also covered throughout the text and case studies are included to highlight the pivotal role played by simulation in the decision-making processes of those working in this field.
