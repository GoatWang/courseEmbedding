501® ORIGINAL
Started by us. Finished by you.

                        In 1873, workers who’d flocked to the American West in search of fortune needed pants that could work and endure, so Levi Strauss and Jacob Davis combined quality denim and rivet reinforcements, creating the first pair of blue jeans: the Levi’s® 501® Original.
                    
Shop Men
Shop Women










                        Created before the invention of the zipper, the signature button fly is a key detail which defines the 501® Jean,the perfect union of function and style.

                        The iconic Two Horse patch stitched on to the back of every pair of 501® Jeans illustrates the original promise made by Levi Strauss: “It’s no use, they can’t be ripped” and celebrates the strength and quality of the riveted denim.
                    











                        “It started out being purely functional. And became a style leader.”

                        "We're acutely aware of people customizing their jeans—making them a little bit tapered, taking a lot out of the leg and then vacuum-packing themselves into vintage Levi's®. That was really the beginning of the 501® Skinny."
                    
– JONATHAN CHEUNG, SVP DESIGN






























                    "Leaner and meaner than ever before."

                    “After hemming, tapering the leg of the 501® jeans is the most requested alteration in Levi’s® stores and tailor shops around the world, so we decided to do it for you, creating the 501® Taper and the perfect custom taper.”

Levi Jeans for Guys at JCPenney
The inventor of blue jeans has the market cornered, and when it comes to Levi jeans for guys, JCPenney has every style, every cut, every color and every option for every man. Like you, Levi Strauss & Co is driven by hard work, creativity and strong values. When you zip on a pair of Levis, you feel the work and innovation that went into the making of comfort and style.

Guys Levis by the Number
The best way to find the best fit for you is by checking out the number. Levi uses a classic three-digit numbering system to organize fits, cuts and styles so you know at a glance exactly how that pair will fit you. For guys, the number is pretty straightforward and accounts for the overall fit—waist rise, leg opening and seat fit. For the most classic, straight leg style, try out the 501 Original, complete with a slim fit and the original button fly. From the original 501’s to the loose fitting 569’s, you’ll find a style of guys Levi’s that you’ll love enough to buy over and over again. More likely, you’ll find that many different styles give you the fit and look you want. So get them, the 501’s and the 517’s. Get more than one of every style, because when you’re shopping at JCPenney, you know you don’t have to wait for a sale. You can get great deals on Levi jeans for guys every day.

In addition to the many styles and cuts of guys Levi’s we have, JCPenney also offers a full line of guys Levi clothing, including twill pants, denim and cargo shorts, shrink-to-fit jeans and denim and faux-leather jackets. Whether you’re completing your wardrobe or completely starting over, Levi has got your number. Come get yours at our men’s clothing collection.

Give Into the Timeless Comfort and Style of Women's Levi Jeans
Women's Levi's are iconic—full-stop, point-blank, end of sentence. Take advantage of the brand's reputation and explore the wide world of Levi's clothing for women. You'll find jeans that fit every imaginable shape, size, and taste level, but the fashion doesn't stop there—uncover a selection of tops, skirts, shorts, and jackets, as well.
Jeans for Days
It doesn't matter what style of jeans you like best; you'll find them here. Skinny jeans are still going strong in the world of trending fashion. Stonewashed, white, black, distressed—pick your poison. Relaxed fit and boot cut jeans abound. Cool off in denim shorts in various lengths or capris that give off a carefree, preppy vibe. Denim leggings are even more fitted than skinny jeans, but it's easier to move around in them, so you get the best of both worlds. Clearly, you're spoiled for choices. You've got denim for days.
Every Type of Top
You might not realize the stunning selection of tops that Levi's has to offer. T-shirts emblazoned with pleasing on-brand designs are ideal for casual days. Wear them to the gym, or let them do double duty as pajama tops. Cozy flannels in vivid plaid palettes embrace the grunge look that's coming back with such a comfortable vengeance. Why not layer them with a Levi's tee? You can even find fashion tops, such as off-the-shoulder pieces with a distinct Boho chic vibe.
A Little Extra
Denim is a versatile material. It's also timeless, so it's no surprise that Levi's has a variety of other denim items. Why not up your fashion game and step out wearing a denim vest? Pins and patches are optional. Take your love for retro fashion to a new, higher level. Remember when you used to wear your denim jacket everywhere? Pick up the habit again. All you have to do is pick out a modern version of your vintage favorite.
Jean skirts are having a huge trending moment, as well. You might want to stick with black, but you'll wear it more often than you think. You can't go wrong with denim shorts, either. From Bermuda shorts to thigh-skimming options, you'll find a style you love.
Browse jeans, jackets, tops, and more to satisfy your cravings for denim. Check out JCPenney's collection of women's Levi's clothing and indulge yourself.

We view fashion as a merging of art, innovation and sustainability. After all, Levi’s® jeans are what the next generation wears — and we take that role to heart. We like to say that our company and our products are Made of Progress, in part because we have a long history of firsts. Of leading. Of innovating. Of making a difference.
Innovation is embedded throughout our clothing, from our rivet patent in 1873 to the more recent development of the Water<Less™, Waste<Less™ and Wellthread collections.
Water‹Less™Water‹Less™
Our lifecycle studies illustrate how essential water is to our business. We’re extremely dependent on it: every step of the process to create a garment requires water, from the cotton fields to manufacturing facilities.
In an era of increasing water scarcity, we recognize that water is an essential raw material for agriculture and many industries besides apparel. We must decouple the growth of our business and our water needs if we want to continue leading into the future.
The Water<Less™ process approaches the decisions made in the design process in a different way, reducing the amount of water used in the finishing process. It’s not rocket science, but it is innovative. For instance, by simply removing water from stone washes or combining multiple wet cycle processes, we can significantly reduce water usage — up to 96 percent for some styles. At the same time, we still deliver the same great look and feel that you know and love.
Since launching the Water<Less™ process in 2011, we have saved more than 1 billion liters of water in the manufacturing of LS&Co. products, including 30 million liters of fresh water saved through reuse and recycling. By 2020, the Levi’s brand aims to make 80 percent of its products using Water<Less™ techniques, up from nearly 25 percent today.

SHOP WATER<LESS™Levi’s® Wellthread™ CollectionRecognizing that true innovation is best achieved by rethinking the entire apparel making process, we are breaking down the silos of design, sourcing and production to develop more sustainable practices. Our collaborative approach to sustainable design has produced a number of important breakthroughs for our enduring brands.
Our latest Levi’s® Wellthread™ Collection represents a fundamental reinvention of the design process to incorporate sustainability into every stage of the development process. The end results are durable products with timeless, enduring style that are more responsible for both the people who wear them and the planet.
The Levi’s® Wellthread™ Collection is the first ever to feature Levi’s® Water<Less™ fabric, which saves more than 65 percent of the water in the dye process than conventional dyeing. For this collection, Water<Less™ finishes use up to 50 percent less water than traditional finishing.
Also integral to the Wellthread approach is the creation of products from a single fiber-cotton. Made of 100% cotton, the fabric, thread, pocketing, and labels are all designed for recyclability, with a future state of closed loop recycling in mind.
The collection is produced in factories where we’re implementing a new approach to improving the lives of apparel workers. From Haiti to Sri Lanka, Levi’s® Wellthread™ garments were made at facilities that invest in the well-being of the people who crafted the garments. Examples include programs that help promote financial literacy and women’s health and family wellness.
SHOP THE LEVI'S® WELLTHREAD™ COLLECTIONWaste‹Less™Levi’s® Waste‹Less™ Collection
Water is just one example of the resource constraints we are facing across the planet. Looking into the future, there’s no guarantee that there will enough land available to meet global demand for cotton, the main input for our apparel.
So to be a successful company in a world that is increasingly resource-constrained, we need to continue down the road toward achieving closed-loop apparel — while incorporating other alternatives to virgin raw materials.
This is why we launched the Levi’s® Waste<Less™ collection of products that are made of 20 percent post-consumer waste- specifically, recycled plastic bottles. That works out to an average of three to eight plastic bottles per pair.

To date (since the collection launched in Spring 2013), we’ve used 11.9 million recycled bottles for products such as Levi’s® 511™ Skinny jeans, Levi’s® Trucker jackets and the women’s Levi’s® Boyfriend Skinny jeans.

OUR FEATURED SUPPLIERS
For more than 155 years, Levi Strauss & Co. has worked to honor the pioneering spirit of hard work, individuality and authenticity in how we make our products and how we run our company. We’ve dedicated ourselves to elevating the dignity of the people who work to bring our clothing to market. And we’ve invested our time, energy, heart and resources in improving the future of these communities.
In October 2005, we were the first apparel company to release the names and locations of all our active, approved owned-and-operated, contract and licensee factories that manufacture and finish Levi’s®, Dockers® and Signature by Levi Strauss™ products. We believe that making our factory list public fosters collaboration with other brands and leads to sector-wide improvement on supplier performance on improving workplace conditions.


View Full Supplier ListBETTER WORK PROGRAM
We actively support the International Labor Organization’s Better Work program to improve working conditions in apparel factories. Better Work brings local enterprises, international buyers, governments and NGOs together to build partnerships and create a rigorous cycle of improvement.
IMPROVING WORKER CONDITIONS
In 1991, we were the first multinational apparel company to establish a comprehensive workplace code of conduct, known as our Terms of Engagement, for our manufacturing suppliers. Our Sustainability Guidebook spells out in detail these labor, health and safety, and environmental requirements. It is based on United Nations documents such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Labor Organization (ILO) Core Conventions.
Over the years, many companies have adopted similar codes of conduct, and today most of those reflect our original Terms of Engagement.
In 1995, we added strict water quality standards as part of our environmental requirements. Between 1999 and 2005, we strengthened protections of workers’ rights to form unions and conduct collective bargaining. And in 2014, we included new guidelines regarding, migrant workers, fire safety and building integrity.
FACTORY ASSESSMENTS
Over the years, we have established a strong program to assess how well our suppliers are meeting our code and, when we identify problems, how to remedy.
We have also learned that monitoring our suppliers is only one part of improving working conditions. In addition to working directly with our suppliers, we have programs in their communities to strengthen worker rights. We also work with governments to strengthen labor laws and their enforcement. Ultimately, improving working conditions in our supplier factories requires the involvement of our suppliers, local organizations, governments and other buyers that may be sourcing in those factories.
We employ full-time headcount in select geographical areas, located around the world where our suppliers are. They are responsible to manage our external monitor qualification program as well as local partnerships like the International Labor Organization’s Better Work program. These external monitors understand the scope of our labor and environment, health and safety standards and know the local languages, laws, culture and business context of each country in which we operate. They conduct regular assessments in cycles of 12 to 15 months of every factory contracted to manufacture our products. These assessments are based on standards found in our Sustainability Guidebook. Assessments involve on-site and off-site discussions with workers using specific guidelines developed by Ask called Gathering Information from Workers, management interviews, review of factory records (such as timecards and payroll) and environment, health and safety inspections.
Each assessment identifies areas for improvement and a detailed corrective action plan, including actions, responsible parties, and timelines. Regular follow-up visits are also conducted to ensure suppliers are completing their corrective action plans on a timely basis.  Public attention surrounding the situation in Bangladesh prompted us to share our building stability reports publicly.
Over the years, we have learned that while the factory assessment process is important, the key to lasting improvement in working conditions is for our suppliers themselves to understand and appreciate the importance of operating a responsible workplace. Today, we are spending more time and resources working with our suppliers to improve their human resource and environment, health and safety programs, training their personnel and developing the systems to operate a responsible workplace.
COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT
The Levi Strauss Foundation focuses on funding programs that strengthen worker rights and improve the working and living conditions for the people who make our products. Through these grants, we support innovative local, regional and global nonprofit organizations that encourage the enforcement of labor laws, increase awareness around health care issues and promote access to asset-building and life skills training for our employees, contractors and their families.
GOVERNMENT ADVOCACY
As pioneers in the fight for fair employment practices, we firmly believe that workplace standards and worker rights should be an integral part of all bilateral, regional or multilateral trade negotiations.
Levi Strauss & Co. was the first and only major multinational company to publicly advocate for linkage of trade and labor, incorporating key workplace standards and worker rights provisions within the context of trade agreements. And we continue to do so whenever and wherever we can — through congressional testimony, meetings with senior government officials, trade negotiations and multi-stakeholder initiatives.
INDUSTRY COLLABORATION
In many cases, we are not the only apparel company working with a given supplier. One of the reasons we are transparent about our suppliers is to reach out to other apparel brands and organizations to see how we can work together in the factories we share. By getting the rest of the industry involved, we are able to send a stronger message to our suppliers about the importance of operating a responsible workplace. View a full list of our collaborators.
We are a member of and are program partners actively engaged in supporting the International Labor Organization’s Better Work program.

Levi Strauss & Co. /ˌliːvaɪ ˈstraʊs/ is a privately owned American clothing company known worldwide for its Levi's /ˌliːvaɪz/ brand of denim jeans. It was founded in May 1853[4] when Levi Strauss came from Buttenheim, Bavaria, to San Francisco, California to open a west coast branch of his brothers' New York dry goods business.[5] The company's corporate headquarters is located in the Levi's Plaza in San Francisco.[6]

History[edit]
Origin and formation (1853–1890s)[edit]
Levi Strauss started the business at the 90 Sacramento Street address in San Francisco. He next moved the location to 62 Sacramento Street then 63 & 65 Sacramento Street.[citation needed] Jacob Davis, a Latvian Jewish immigrant, was a Reno, Nevada [7] tailor who frequently purchased bolts of cloth made from denim from Levi Strauss & Co.'s wholesale house. After one of Davis' customers kept purchasing cloth to reinforce torn pants, he had an idea to use copper rivets to reinforce the points of strain, such as on the pocket corners and at the base of the button fly.[8] Davis did not have the required money to purchase a patent, so he wrote to Strauss suggesting that they go into business together. After Levi accepted Jacob's offer, on May 20, 1873, the two men received U.S. Patent 139,121 from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The patented rivet was later incorporated into the company's jean design and advertisements. Contrary to an advertising campaign suggesting that Levi Strauss sold his first jeans to gold miners during the California Gold Rush (which peaked in 1849), the manufacturing of denim overalls only began in the 1870s. The company created their first pair of Levis 501 Jeans in the 1890s.
Growth in popularity (1910s–1950s)[edit]

Modern jeans began to appear in the 1920s, but sales were largely confined to the working people of the western United States, such as cowboys, lumberjacks, and railroad workers. Levi’s jeans apparently were first introduced to the East during the dude ranch craze of the 1930s, when vacationing Easterners returned home with tales (and usually examples) of the hard-wearing pants with rivets. Another boost came in World War II, when blue jeans were declared an essential commodity and were sold only to people engaged in defense work.
Between the 1950s and 1980s, Levi's jeans became popular among a wide range of youth subcultures, including greasers, mods, rockers, and hippies. Levi's popular shrink-to-fit 501s were sold in a unique sizing arrangement; the indicated size referred to the size of the jeans prior to shrinking, and the shrinkage was substantial.[9] The company still produces these unshrunk, uniquely sized jeans, and they are still Levi's number one selling product. Although popular lore (abetted by company marketing) holds that the original design remains unaltered, this is not the case: the crotch rivet and waist cinch were removed during World War II to conform to War Production Board requirements to conserve metal, and was not replaced after the war. Additionally, the back pocket rivets, which had been covered in denim since 1937, were removed completely in the 1950s due to complaints they scratched furniture.[10] From a company with fifteen salespeople, two plants, and almost no business east of the Mississippi in 1946, the organization grew in thirty years to include a sales force of more than 22,000, with 50 plants and offices in 35 countries.[11]

From the early 1960s through the mid-1970s, Levi Strauss experienced significant growth in its business as the more casual look of the 1960s and 1970s ushered in the "blue jeans craze" and served as a catalyst for the brand. Levi's, under the leadership of Walter Haas, Peter Haas Sr., Paul Glasco and George P. Simpkins Sr., expanded the firm's clothing line by adding new fashions and models, including stone-washed jeans through the acquisition of Great Western Garment Co. (GWG), a Canadian clothing manufacturer acquired by Levi's. The acquisition led to the introduction of the modern "stone washing" technique, still in use by Levi Strauss. Simpkins is credited with the company's record-paced expansion of its manufacturing capacity from 16 plants to more than 63 plants in the United States from 1964 to 1974 and 23 overseas. Levi's' expansion under Simpkins was accomplished without a single unionized employee as a result of Levi's' and the Haas family's strong stance on human rights and Simpkins' use of "pay for performance" manufacturing from the sewing machine operator level up. As a result, Levi's' plants were perhaps the highest performing, best organized and cleanest textile facilities of their time.
In the 1980s, The company closed around 60 of its manifacturing plants because of financial difficulties and strong competition from competitors.[12]
The Dockers brand, launched in 1986 and which is sold largely through department store chains, helped the company grow through the mid-1990s, as denim sales began to fade. Dockers were introduced into Europe in 1996 and led by CEO Jorge Bardina. Levi Strauss attempted to sell the Dockers division in 2004 to relieve part of the company's $2.6 billion outstanding debt.
Brand competition (1990s)[edit]




Levi's 506 inside


By the 1990s, Levi's faced competition from other brands and cheaper products from overseas, and began accelerating the pace of its US factory-closures and its use of offshore subcontracting agreements. In 1991, Levi Strauss became implicated in a scandal involving pants made in the Northern Mariana Islands: some 3% of Levi's jeans sold annually with the Made in the USA label were shown[by whom?] to have been made by Chinese laborers under what the United States Department of Labor called "slavelike" conditions. As of 2016[update], most Levi's jeans are made outside the US, though a few of the higher-end, more expensive styles are still made in the U.S.
Cited for sub-minimum wages, seven-day work weeks with 12-hour shifts, poor living conditions and other indignities, Tan Holdings Corporation, Levi Strauss' Marianas subcontractor, paid what were then the largest fines in U.S. labor history, distributing more than $9 million in restitution to some 1,200 employees.[13][14][15] Levi Strauss claimed no knowledge of the offenses, then severed ties to the Tan family and instituted labor reforms and inspection practices in its offshore facilities.
The activist group Fuerza Unida (United Force) formed following the January 1990 closure of a plant in San Antonio, Texas, in which 1,150 seamstresses, some of whom had worked for Levi Strauss for decades, saw their jobs exported to Costa Rica.[16] During the mid- and late-1990s, Fuerza Unida picketed the Levi Strauss headquarters in San Francisco and staged hunger strikes and sit-ins in protest at the company's labor policies.[17][18][19]
The company took on multibillion-dollar debt in February 1996 to help finance a series of leveraged stock buyouts among family members. Shares in Levi Strauss stock are not publicly traded; the firm as of 2016[update] is owned almost entirely by indirect descendants and collateral relatives of Levi Strauss, whose four nephews inherited the San Francisco dry-goods firm after their uncle's death in 1902.[20] The corporation's bonds are traded publicly, as are shares of the company's Japanese affiliate, Levi Strauss Japan K.K.
In June 1996, the company offered to pay its workers an unusual dividend of up to $750 million in six years' time, having halted an employee-stock plan at the time of the internal family buyout. However, the company failed to make cash-flow targets, and no worker dividends were paid.[21]
Recent developments (2000–present)[edit]

In 2002, Levi Strauss began a close business collaboration with Walmart, producing a special line of "Signature" jeans and other clothes for exclusive sale in Walmart stores until 2006.[22] Levi Strauss leads the apparel industry in trademark infringement cases, filing nearly 100 lawsuits against competitors since 2001.[23] Most cases center on the alleged imitation of Levi's back pocket double arc stitching pattern (U.S. trademark #1,139,254), which Levi filed for trademark in 1978.[24] Levi's has successfully sued Guess?, Polo Ralph Lauren, Esprit Holdings, Zegna, Zumiez, and Lucky Brand Jeans, among other companies.[23]
In 2002, the company closed its Valencia Street plant in San Francisco, which had opened the same year of the city's April 1906 earthquake.[25][26] By the end of 2003, the closure of Levi's last U.S. factory in San Antonio ended 150 years of jeans made in the USA. Production of a few higher-end, more expensive styles of jeans resumed in the US several years later.[26]
By 2007, Levi Strauss was again profitable after declining sales in nine of the previous ten years.[27] Its total annual sales, of just over $4 billion, were $3 billion less than during its peak performance[26] in the mid-1990s.[28] After more than two decades of family ownership, rumors of a possible public stock offering were floated[by whom?] in the media in July 2007.[29] In 2009, it was noted[by whom?] in the media for selling jeans on interest-free credit, due to the global recession.[30][31] In 2010, the company partnered with Filson, an outdoor-goods manufacturer in Seattle, to produce a high-end line of jackets and workwear.[32]
On May 8, 2013, the NFL's San Francisco 49ers announced that Levi Strauss & Co. had purchased the naming rights to their new stadium in Santa Clara, California. The naming-rights deal called for Levi's to pay $220.3 million to the city of Santa Clara and to the 49ers over twenty years, with an option to extend the deal for another five years for around $75 million.[33] As of 2016[update], Levi Strauss Signature jeans sell at several[quantify] stores in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.
Cultural impact[edit]
Levi's has been worn by people from all walks of life, from miners to Nobel Prize recipients including Albert Einstein himself, whose famous leather jacket was made by Levi Strauss & Co in the 30's and has recently been sold at auction house Christies for £110,500.[34]
Corporate structure and staff[edit]




Levi's Plaza, corporate headquarters

Levi's marketing has often made use of old recordings of popular music in television commercials, ranging from traditional pop to punk rock. Notable examples include Ben E King ("Stand By Me"), Percy Sledge ("When a Man Loves a Woman"), Eddie Cochran ("C'mon Everybody!"), The Ronettes ("Be My Baby"), Marc Bolan ("20th Century Boy"), Screamin' Jay Hawkins ("Heart Attack & Vine"), The Clash ("Should I Stay or Should I Go?").
Many of these songs were re-released by their record labels as a tie-in with the ad campaigns, resulting in increased popularity and sales of the recordings and the creation of iconic visual associations with the music, such as the use of a topless male model wearing jeans underwater in the 1986 adverts featuring "Wonderful World" and "Mad about the Boy" and the puppet, Flat Eric, in the ads featuring music by Mr. Oizo.

David Bergen, Levi's senior vice president and CIO, says his company is caught in the "jaws of death." "We're getting squeezed," he says in his office in Levi's Plaza, which has a startling view of San Francisco Bay and is about a 30-minute walk away from the Post Street store. But Levi's thinks it may have found a way to cheat a retail demise. Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, is where moms go to stock up on Max and Maddy's school supplies, their juice boxes and, of course, their jeans. So if you want the kids, and the rest of their families, you need to sell at Wal-Mart. And you need a new product for this new customer. This month, Levi's is introducing its new, less expensive Signature jeans line. (The jeans, for men, women and children, sell for around $23. They have fewer detail finishes than Levi's other lines. They don't have the company's trademark red tab or stitching on the pocket.) Of course, there's something in it for Wal-Mart. The company, already the largest clothing retailer in the world, wants more affluent customers. To lure them in, it needs big brands. Acknowledging that the company's customers come from a "cross-section of income levels and lifestyles", Wal-Mart Senior Vice President Lois Mikita says the company "continues to tailor its selection to meet the needs of those customers".

As part of Levi's continuing move to cut costs by unloading what little in- house manufacturing it still does, the company said yesterday that it will close six U.S. plants by October. That will leave just two Levi plants operating on U.S. soil, both located in San Antonio. Levi Strauss & Co.'s 96-year-old Valencia Street plant will close by summer, perhaps becoming a museum but definitely staying in company hands even after its production lights go out, its stewards said....

History[edit]
Origin and formation (1853–1890s)[edit]
Levi Strauss started the business at the 90 Sacramento Street address in San Francisco. He next moved the location to 62 Sacramento Street then 63 & 65 Sacramento Street.[citation needed] Jacob Davis, a Latvian Jewish immigrant, was a Reno, Nevada [7] tailor who frequently purchased bolts of cloth made from denim from Levi Strauss & Co.'s wholesale house. After one of Davis' customers kept purchasing cloth to reinforce torn pants, he had an idea to use copper rivets to reinforce the points of strain, such as on the pocket corners and at the base of the button fly.[8] Davis did not have the required money to purchase a patent, so he wrote to Strauss suggesting that they go into business together. After Levi accepted Jacob's offer, on May 20, 1873, the two men received U.S. Patent 139,121 from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The patented rivet was later incorporated into the company's jean design and advertisements. Contrary to an advertising campaign suggesting that Levi Strauss sold his first jeans to gold miners during the California Gold Rush (which peaked in 1849), the manufacturing of denim overalls only began in the 1870s. The company created their first pair of Levis 501 Jeans in the 1890s.
Growth in popularity (1910s–1950s)[edit]

Modern jeans began to appear in the 1920s, but sales were largely confined to the working people of the western United States, such as cowboys, lumberjacks, and railroad workers. Levi’s jeans apparently were first introduced to the East during the dude ranch craze of the 1930s, when vacationing Easterners returned home with tales (and usually examples) of the hard-wearing pants with rivets. Another boost came in World War II, when blue jeans were declared an essential commodity and were sold only to people engaged in defense work.
Between the 1950s and 1980s, Levi's jeans became popular among a wide range of youth subcultures, including greasers, mods, rockers, and hippies. Levi's popular shrink-to-fit 501s were sold in a unique sizing arrangement; the indicated size referred to the size of the jeans prior to shrinking, and the shrinkage was substantial.[9] The company still produces these unshrunk, uniquely sized jeans, and they are still Levi's number one selling product. Although popular lore (abetted by company marketing) holds that the original design remains unaltered, this is not the case: the crotch rivet and waist cinch were removed during World War II to conform to War Production Board requirements to conserve metal, and was not replaced after the war. Additionally, the back pocket rivets, which had been covered in denim since 1937, were removed completely in the 1950s due to complaints they scratched furniture.[10] From a company with fifteen salespeople, two plants, and almost no business east of the Mississippi in 1946, the organization grew in thirty years to include a sales force of more than 22,000, with 50 plants and offices in 35 countries.[11]

From the early 1960s through the mid-1970s, Levi Strauss experienced significant growth in its business as the more casual look of the 1960s and 1970s ushered in the "blue jeans craze" and served as a catalyst for the brand. Levi's, under the leadership of Walter Haas, Peter Haas Sr., Paul Glasco and George P. Simpkins Sr., expanded the firm's clothing line by adding new fashions and models, including stone-washed jeans through the acquisition of Great Western Garment Co. (GWG), a Canadian clothing manufacturer acquired by Levi's. The acquisition led to the introduction of the modern "stone washing" technique, still in use by Levi Strauss. Simpkins is credited with the company's record-paced expansion of its manufacturing capacity from 16 plants to more than 63 plants in the United States from 1964 to 1974 and 23 overseas. Levi's' expansion under Simpkins was accomplished without a single unionized employee as a result of Levi's' and the Haas family's strong stance on human rights and Simpkins' use of "pay for performance" manufacturing from the sewing machine operator level up. As a result, Levi's' plants were perhaps the highest performing, best organized and cleanest textile facilities of their time.
In the 1980s, The company closed around 60 of its manifacturing plants because of financial difficulties and strong competition from competitors.[12]
The Dockers brand, launched in 1986 and which is sold largely through department store chains, helped the company grow through the mid-1990s, as denim sales began to fade. Dockers were introduced into Europe in 1996 and led by CEO Jorge Bardina. Levi Strauss attempted to sell the Dockers division in 2004 to relieve part of the company's $2.6 billion outstanding debt.
Brand competition (1990s)[edit]




Levi's 506 inside


By the 1990s, Levi's faced competition from other brands and cheaper products from overseas, and began accelerating the pace of its US factory-closures and its use of offshore subcontracting agreements. In 1991, Levi Strauss became implicated in a scandal involving pants made in the Northern Mariana Islands: some 3% of Levi's jeans sold annually with the Made in the USA label were shown[by whom?] to have been made by Chinese laborers under what the United States Department of Labor called "slavelike" conditions. As of 2016[update], most Levi's jeans are made outside the US, though a few of the higher-end, more expensive styles are still made in the U.S.
Cited for sub-minimum wages, seven-day work weeks with 12-hour shifts, poor living conditions and other indignities, Tan Holdings Corporation, Levi Strauss' Marianas subcontractor, paid what were then the largest fines in U.S. labor history, distributing more than $9 million in restitution to some 1,200 employees.[13][14][15] Levi Strauss claimed no knowledge of the offenses, then severed ties to the Tan family and instituted labor reforms and inspection practices in its offshore facilities.
The activist group Fuerza Unida (United Force) formed following the January 1990 closure of a plant in San Antonio, Texas, in which 1,150 seamstresses, some of whom had worked for Levi Strauss for decades, saw their jobs exported to Costa Rica.[16] During the mid- and late-1990s, Fuerza Unida picketed the Levi Strauss headquarters in San Francisco and staged hunger strikes and sit-ins in protest at the company's labor policies.[17][18][19]
The company took on multibillion-dollar debt in February 1996 to help finance a series of leveraged stock buyouts among family members. Shares in Levi Strauss stock are not publicly traded; the firm as of 2016[update] is owned almost entirely by indirect descendants and collateral relatives of Levi Strauss, whose four nephews inherited the San Francisco dry-goods firm after their uncle's death in 1902.[20] The corporation's bonds are traded publicly, as are shares of the company's Japanese affiliate, Levi Strauss Japan K.K.
In June 1996, the company offered to pay its workers an unusual dividend of up to $750 million in six years' time, having halted an employee-stock plan at the time of the internal family buyout. However, the company failed to make cash-flow targets, and no worker dividends were paid.[21]
Recent developments (2000–present)[edit]

In 2002, Levi Strauss began a close business collaboration with Walmart, producing a special line of "Signature" jeans and other clothes for exclusive sale in Walmart stores until 2006.[22] Levi Strauss leads the apparel industry in trademark infringement cases, filing nearly 100 lawsuits against competitors since 2001.[23] Most cases center on the alleged imitation of Levi's back pocket double arc stitching pattern (U.S. trademark #1,139,254), which Levi filed for trademark in 1978.[24] Levi's has successfully sued Guess?, Polo Ralph Lauren, Esprit Holdings, Zegna, Zumiez, and Lucky Brand Jeans, among other companies.[23]
In 2002, the company closed its Valencia Street plant in San Francisco, which had opened the same year of the city's April 1906 earthquake.[25][26] By the end of 2003, the closure of Levi's last U.S. factory in San Antonio ended 150 years of jeans made in the USA. Production of a few higher-end, more expensive styles of jeans resumed in the US several years later.[26]
By 2007, Levi Strauss was again profitable after declining sales in nine of the previous ten years.[27] Its total annual sales, of just over $4 billion, were $3 billion less than during its peak performance[26] in the mid-1990s.[28] After more than two decades of family ownership, rumors of a possible public stock offering were floated[by whom?] in the media in July 2007.[29] In 2009, it was noted[by whom?] in the media for selling jeans on interest-free credit, due to the global recession.[30][31] In 2010, the company partnered with Filson, an outdoor-goods manufacturer in Seattle, to produce a high-end line of jackets and workwear.[32]
On May 8, 2013, the NFL's San Francisco 49ers announced that Levi Strauss & Co. had purchased the naming rights to their new stadium in Santa Clara, California. The naming-rights deal called for Levi's to pay $220.3 million to the city of Santa Clara and to the 49ers over twenty years, with an option to extend the deal for another five years for around $75 million.[33] As of 2016[update], Levi Strauss Signature jeans sell at several[quantify] stores in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.
Cultural impact[edit]
Levi's has been worn by people from all walks of life, from miners to Nobel Prize recipients including Albert Einstein himself, whose famous leather jacket was made by Levi Strauss & Co in the 30's and has recently been sold at auction house Christies for £110,500.[34]
Corporate structure and staff[edit]




Levi's Plaza, corporate headquarters


Levi Strauss & Co. is a worldwide corporation organized into three geographic divisions: Levi Strauss Americas (LSA), headquartered in San Francisco; Levi Strauss Europe (LSE), based in Brussels; and Levi Strauss Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa (LSAMA), based in Singapore. The company employs a staff of approximately 16,000 people worldwide.
Current products[edit]
Products include jeans, trousers, shorts, shirts, jackets, sweaters, sweatshirts, T-shirts, underwear,socks, accessories, shoes, dresses, skirts, belts, overalls, jumpsuits and a "big and tall" range. Jeans are categorised by fit as: skinny, slim, straight, bootcut, taper, relaxed, flare and big & tall. Most of the adult denim jeans are identifiable by trademarked three digit style numbers. 501s are available in styles for both men and women, the rest of the 500 series are marketed for men and the 300, 400, 700, and 800 series for women, with the exception of 751s which are classic straight zip fly jeans.[35]

Levi's marketing has often made use of old recordings of popular music in television commercials, ranging from traditional pop to punk rock. Notable examples include Ben E King ("Stand By Me"), Percy Sledge ("When a Man Loves a Woman"), Eddie Cochran ("C'mon Everybody!"), The Ronettes ("Be My Baby"), Marc Bolan ("20th Century Boy"), Screamin' Jay Hawkins ("Heart Attack & Vine"), The Clash ("Should I Stay or Should I Go?").
Many of these songs were re-released by their record labels as a tie-in with the ad campaigns, resulting in increased popularity and sales of the recordings and the creation of iconic visual associations with the music, such as the use of a topless male model wearing jeans underwater in the 1986 adverts featuring "Wonderful World" and "Mad about the Boy" and the puppet, Flat Eric, in the ads featuring music by Mr. Oizo.

David Bergen, Levi's senior vice president and CIO, says his company is caught in the "jaws of death." "We're getting squeezed," he says in his office in Levi's Plaza, which has a startling view of San Francisco Bay and is about a 30-minute walk away from the Post Street store. But Levi's thinks it may have found a way to cheat a retail demise. Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, is where moms go to stock up on Max and Maddy's school supplies, their juice boxes and, of course, their jeans. So if you want the kids, and the rest of their families, you need to sell at Wal-Mart. And you need a new product for this new customer. This month, Levi's is introducing its new, less expensive Signature jeans line. (The jeans, for men, women and children, sell for around $23. They have fewer detail finishes than Levi's other lines. They don't have the company's trademark red tab or stitching on the pocket.) Of course, there's something in it for Wal-Mart. The company, already the largest clothing retailer in the world, wants more affluent customers. To lure them in, it needs big brands. Acknowledging that the company's customers come from a "cross-section of income levels and lifestyles", Wal-Mart Senior Vice President Lois Mikita says the company "continues to tailor its selection to meet the needs of those customers".

History[edit]
Origin and formation (1853–1890s)[edit]
Levi Strauss started the business at the 90 Sacramento Street address in San Francisco. He next moved the location to 62 Sacramento Street then 63 & 65 Sacramento Street.[citation needed] Jacob Davis, a Latvian Jewish immigrant, was a Reno, Nevada [7] tailor who frequently purchased bolts of cloth made from denim from Levi Strauss & Co.'s wholesale house. After one of Davis' customers kept purchasing cloth to reinforce torn pants, he had an idea to use copper rivets to reinforce the points of strain, such as on the pocket corners and at the base of the button fly.[8] Davis did not have the required money to purchase a patent, so he wrote to Strauss suggesting that they go into business together. After Levi accepted Jacob's offer, on May 20, 1873, the two men received U.S. Patent 139,121 from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The patented rivet was later incorporated into the company's jean design and advertisements. Contrary to an advertising campaign suggesting that Levi Strauss sold his first jeans to gold miners during the California Gold Rush (which peaked in 1849), the manufacturing of denim overalls only began in the 1870s. The company created their first pair of Levis 501 Jeans in the 1890s.
Growth in popularity (1910s–1950s)[edit]

Modern jeans began to appear in the 1920s, but sales were largely confined to the working people of the western United States, such as cowboys, lumberjacks, and railroad workers. Levi’s jeans apparently were first introduced to the East during the dude ranch craze of the 1930s, when vacationing Easterners returned home with tales (and usually examples) of the hard-wearing pants with rivets. Another boost came in World War II, when blue jeans were declared an essential commodity and were sold only to people engaged in defense work.
Between the 1950s and 1980s, Levi's jeans became popular among a wide range of youth subcultures, including greasers, mods, rockers, and hippies. Levi's popular shrink-to-fit 501s were sold in a unique sizing arrangement; the indicated size referred to the size of the jeans prior to shrinking, and the shrinkage was substantial.[9] The company still produces these unshrunk, uniquely sized jeans, and they are still Levi's number one selling product. Although popular lore (abetted by company marketing) holds that the original design remains unaltered, this is not the case: the crotch rivet and waist cinch were removed during World War II to conform to War Production Board requirements to conserve metal, and was not replaced after the war. Additionally, the back pocket rivets, which had been covered in denim since 1937, were removed completely in the 1950s due to complaints they scratched furniture.[10] From a company with fifteen salespeople, two plants, and almost no business east of the Mississippi in 1946, the organization grew in thirty years to include a sales force of more than 22,000, with 50 plants and offices in 35 countries.[11]

From the early 1960s through the mid-1970s, Levi Strauss experienced significant growth in its business as the more casual look of the 1960s and 1970s ushered in the "blue jeans craze" and served as a catalyst for the brand. Levi's, under the leadership of Walter Haas, Peter Haas Sr., Paul Glasco and George P. Simpkins Sr., expanded the firm's clothing line by adding new fashions and models, including stone-washed jeans through the acquisition of Great Western Garment Co. (GWG), a Canadian clothing manufacturer acquired by Levi's. The acquisition led to the introduction of the modern "stone washing" technique, still in use by Levi Strauss. Simpkins is credited with the company's record-paced expansion of its manufacturing capacity from 16 plants to more than 63 plants in the United States from 1964 to 1974 and 23 overseas. Levi's' expansion under Simpkins was accomplished without a single unionized employee as a result of Levi's' and the Haas family's strong stance on human rights and Simpkins' use of "pay for performance" manufacturing from the sewing machine operator level up. As a result, Levi's' plants were perhaps the highest performing, best organized and cleanest textile facilities of their time.
In the 1980s, The company closed around 60 of its manifacturing plants because of financial difficulties and strong competition from competitors.[12]
The Dockers brand, launched in 1986 and which is sold largely through department store chains, helped the company grow through the mid-1990s, as denim sales began to fade. Dockers were introduced into Europe in 1996 and led by CEO Jorge Bardina. Levi Strauss attempted to sell the Dockers division in 2004 to relieve part of the company's $2.6 billion outstanding debt.
Brand competition (1990s)[edit]




Levi's 506 inside


By the 1990s, Levi's faced competition from other brands and cheaper products from overseas, and began accelerating the pace of its US factory-closures and its use of offshore subcontracting agreements. In 1991, Levi Strauss became implicated in a scandal involving pants made in the Northern Mariana Islands: some 3% of Levi's jeans sold annually with the Made in the USA label were shown[by whom?] to have been made by Chinese laborers under what the United States Department of Labor called "slavelike" conditions. As of 2016[update], most Levi's jeans are made outside the US, though a few of the higher-end, more expensive styles are still made in the U.S.
Cited for sub-minimum wages, seven-day work weeks with 12-hour shifts, poor living conditions and other indignities, Tan Holdings Corporation, Levi Strauss' Marianas subcontractor, paid what were then the largest fines in U.S. labor history, distributing more than $9 million in restitution to some 1,200 employees.[13][14][15] Levi Strauss claimed no knowledge of the offenses, then severed ties to the Tan family and instituted labor reforms and inspection practices in its offshore facilities.
The activist group Fuerza Unida (United Force) formed following the January 1990 closure of a plant in San Antonio, Texas, in which 1,150 seamstresses, some of whom had worked for Levi Strauss for decades, saw their jobs exported to Costa Rica.[16] During the mid- and late-1990s, Fuerza Unida picketed the Levi Strauss headquarters in San Francisco and staged hunger strikes and sit-ins in protest at the company's labor policies.[17][18][19]
The company took on multibillion-dollar debt in February 1996 to help finance a series of leveraged stock buyouts among family members. Shares in Levi Strauss stock are not publicly traded; the firm as of 2016[update] is owned almost entirely by indirect descendants and collateral relatives of Levi Strauss, whose four nephews inherited the San Francisco dry-goods firm after their uncle's death in 1902.[20] The corporation's bonds are traded publicly, as are shares of the company's Japanese affiliate, Levi Strauss Japan K.K.
In June 1996, the company offered to pay its workers an unusual dividend of up to $750 million in six years' time, having halted an employee-stock plan at the time of the internal family buyout. However, the company failed to make cash-flow targets, and no worker dividends were paid.[21]
Recent developments (2000–present)[edit]

In 2002, Levi Strauss began a close business collaboration with Walmart, producing a special line of "Signature" jeans and other clothes for exclusive sale in Walmart stores until 2006.[22] Levi Strauss leads the apparel industry in trademark infringement cases, filing nearly 100 lawsuits against competitors since 2001.[23] Most cases center on the alleged imitation of Levi's back pocket double arc stitching pattern (U.S. trademark #1,139,254), which Levi filed for trademark in 1978.[24] Levi's has successfully sued Guess?, Polo Ralph Lauren, Esprit Holdings, Zegna, Zumiez, and Lucky Brand Jeans, among other companies.[23]
In 2002, the company closed its Valencia Street plant in San Francisco, which had opened the same year of the city's April 1906 earthquake.[25][26] By the end of 2003, the closure of Levi's last U.S. factory in San Antonio ended 150 years of jeans made in the USA. Production of a few higher-end, more expensive styles of jeans resumed in the US several years later.[26]
By 2007, Levi Strauss was again profitable after declining sales in nine of the previous ten years.[27] Its total annual sales, of just over $4 billion, were $3 billion less than during its peak performance[26] in the mid-1990s.[28] After more than two decades of family ownership, rumors of a possible public stock offering were floated[by whom?] in the media in July 2007.[29] In 2009, it was noted[by whom?] in the media for selling jeans on interest-free credit, due to the global recession.[30][31] In 2010, the company partnered with Filson, an outdoor-goods manufacturer in Seattle, to produce a high-end line of jackets and workwear.[32]
On May 8, 2013, the NFL's San Francisco 49ers announced that Levi Strauss & Co. had purchased the naming rights to their new stadium in Santa Clara, California. The naming-rights deal called for Levi's to pay $220.3 million to the city of Santa Clara and to the 49ers over twenty years, with an option to extend the deal for another five years for around $75 million.[33] As of 2016[update], Levi Strauss Signature jeans sell at several[quantify] stores in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.
Cultural impact[edit]
Levi's has been worn by people from all walks of life, from miners to Nobel Prize recipients including Albert Einstein himself, whose famous leather jacket was made by Levi Strauss & Co in the 30's and has recently been sold at auction house Christies for £110,500.[34]
Corporate structure and staff[edit]

Levi's marketing has often made use of old recordings of popular music in television commercials, ranging from traditional pop to punk rock. Notable examples include Ben E King ("Stand By Me"), Percy Sledge ("When a Man Loves a Woman"), Eddie Cochran ("C'mon Everybody!"), The Ronettes ("Be My Baby"), Marc Bolan ("20th Century Boy"), Screamin' Jay Hawkins ("Heart Attack & Vine"), The Clash ("Should I Stay or Should I Go?").
Many of these songs were re-released by their record labels as a tie-in with the ad campaigns, resulting in increased popularity and sales of the recordings and the creation of iconic visual associations with the music, such as the use of a topless male model wearing jeans underwater in the 1986 adverts featuring "Wonderful World" and "Mad about the Boy" and the puppet, Flat Eric, in the ads featuring music by Mr. Oizo.

"We're getting squeezed," he says in his office in Levi's Plaza, which has a startling view of San Francisco Bay and is about a 30-minute walk away from the Post Street store. But Levi's thinks it may have found a way to cheat a retail demise. Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, is where moms go to stock up on Max and Maddy's school supplies, their juice boxes and, of course, their jeans. So if you want the kids, and the rest of their families, you need to sell at Wal-Mart. And you need a new product for this new customer. This month, Levi's is introducing its new, less expensive Signature jeans line. (The jeans, for men, women and children, sell for around $23. They have fewer detail finishes than Levi's other lines. They don't have the company's trademark red tab or stitching on the pocket.) Of course, there's something in it for Wal-Mart. The company, already the largest clothing retailer in the world, wants more affluent customers. To lure them in, it needs big brands. Acknowledging that the company's customers come from a "cross-section of income levels and lifestyles", Wal-Mart Senior Vice President Lois Mikita says the company "continues to tailor its selection to meet the needs of those customers".

Levi Strauss started the business at the 90 Sacramento Street address in San Francisco. He next moved the location to 62 Sacramento Street then 63 & 65 Sacramento Street.[citation needed] Jacob Davis, a Latvian Jewish immigrant, was a Reno, Nevada [7] tailor who frequently purchased bolts of cloth made from denim from Levi Strauss & Co.'s wholesale house. After one of Davis' customers kept purchasing cloth to reinforce torn pants, he had an idea to use copper rivets to reinforce the points of strain, such as on the pocket corners and at the base of the button fly.[8] Davis did not have the required money to purchase a patent, so he wrote to Strauss suggesting that they go into business together. After Levi accepted Jacob's offer, on May 20, 1873, the two men received U.S. Patent 139,121 from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The patented rivet was later incorporated into the company's jean design and advertisements. Contrary to an advertising campaign suggesting that Levi Strauss sold his first jeans to gold miners during the California Gold Rush (which peaked in 1849), the manufacturing of denim overalls only began in the 1870s. The company created their first pair of Levis 501 Jeans in the 1890s.

From the early 1960s through the mid-1970s, Levi Strauss experienced significant growth in its business as the more casual look of the 1960s and 1970s ushered in the "blue jeans craze" and served as a catalyst for the brand. Levi's, under the leadership of Walter Haas, Peter Haas Sr., Paul Glasco and George P. Simpkins Sr., expanded the firm's clothing line by adding new fashions and models, including stone-washed jeans through the acquisition of Great Western Garment Co. (GWG), a Canadian clothing manufacturer acquired by Levi's. The acquisition led to the introduction of the modern "stone washing" technique, still in use by Levi Strauss. Simpkins is credited with the company's record-paced expansion of its manufacturing capacity from 16 plants to more than 63 plants in the United States from 1964 to 1974 and 23 overseas. Levi's' expansion under Simpkins was accomplished without a single unionized employee as a result of Levi's' and the Haas family's strong stance on human rights and Simpkins' use of "pay for performance" manufacturing from the sewing machine operator level up. As a result, Levi's' plants were perhaps the highest performing, best organized and cleanest textile facilities of their time.
In the 1980s, The company closed around 60 of its manifacturing plants because of financial difficulties and strong competition from competitors.[12]
The Dockers brand, launched in 1986 and which is sold largely through department store chains, helped the company grow through the mid-1990s, as denim sales began to fade. Dockers were introduced into Europe in 1996 and led by CEO Jorge Bardina. Levi Strauss attempted to sell the Dockers division in 2004 to relieve part of the company's $2.6 billion outstanding debt.
Brand competition (1990s)[edit]

By the 1990s, Levi's faced competition from other brands and cheaper products from overseas, and began accelerating the pace of its US factory-closures and its use of offshore subcontracting agreements. In 1991, Levi Strauss became implicated in a scandal involving pants made in the Northern Mariana Islands: some 3% of Levi's jeans sold annually with the Made in the USA label were shown[by whom?] to have been made by Chinese laborers under what the United States Department of Labor called "slavelike" conditions. As of 2016[update], most Levi's jeans are made outside the US, though a few of the higher-end, more expensive styles are still made in the U.S.
Cited for sub-minimum wages, seven-day work weeks with 12-hour shifts, poor living conditions and other indignities, Tan Holdings Corporation, Levi Strauss' Marianas subcontractor, paid what were then the largest fines in U.S. labor history, distributing more than $9 million in restitution to some 1,200 employees.[13][14][15] Levi Strauss claimed no knowledge of the offenses, then severed ties to the Tan family and instituted labor reforms and inspection practices in its offshore facilities.
The activist group Fuerza Unida (United Force) formed following the January 1990 closure of a plant in San Antonio, Texas, in which 1,150 seamstresses, some of whom had worked for Levi Strauss for decades, saw their jobs exported to Costa Rica.[16] During the mid- and late-1990s, Fuerza Unida picketed the Levi Strauss headquarters in San Francisco and staged hunger strikes and sit-ins in protest at the company's labor policies.[17][18][19]
The company took on multibillion-dollar debt in February 1996 to help finance a series of leveraged stock buyouts among family members. Shares in Levi Strauss stock are not publicly traded; the firm as of 2016[update] is owned almost entirely by indirect descendants and collateral relatives of Levi Strauss, whose four nephews inherited the San Francisco dry-goods firm after their uncle's death in 1902.[20] The corporation's bonds are traded publicly, as are shares of the company's Japanese affiliate, Levi Strauss Japan K.K.
In June 1996, the company offered to pay its workers an unusual dividend of up to $750 million in six years' time, having halted an employee-stock plan at the time of the internal family buyout. However, the company failed to make cash-flow targets, and no worker dividends were paid.[21]
Recent developments (2000–present)[edit]

In 2002, Levi Strauss began a close business collaboration with Walmart, producing a special line of "Signature" jeans and other clothes for exclusive sale in Walmart stores until 2006.[22] Levi Strauss leads the apparel industry in trademark infringement cases, filing nearly 100 lawsuits against competitors since 2001.[23] Most cases center on the alleged imitation of Levi's back pocket double arc stitching pattern (U.S. trademark #1,139,254), which Levi filed for trademark in 1978.[24] Levi's has successfully sued Guess?, Polo Ralph Lauren, Esprit Holdings, Zegna, Zumiez, and Lucky Brand Jeans, among other companies.[23]
In 2002, the company closed its Valencia Street plant in San Francisco, which had opened the same year of the city's April 1906 earthquake.[25][26] By the end of 2003, the closure of Levi's last U.S. factory in San Antonio ended 150 years of jeans made in the USA. Production of a few higher-end, more expensive styles of jeans resumed in the US several years later.[26]
By 2007, Levi Strauss was again profitable after declining sales in nine of the previous ten years.[27] Its total annual sales, of just over $4 billion, were $3 billion less than during its peak performance[26] in the mid-1990s.[28] After more than two decades of family ownership, rumors of a possible public stock offering were floated[by whom?] in the media in July 2007.[29] In 2009, it was noted[by whom?] in the media for selling jeans on interest-free credit, due to the global recession.[30][31] In 2010, the company partnered with Filson, an outdoor-goods manufacturer in Seattle, to produce a high-end line of jackets and workwear.[32]
On May 8, 2013, the NFL's San Francisco 49ers announced that Levi Strauss & Co. had purchased the naming rights to their new stadium in Santa Clara, California. The naming-rights deal called for Levi's to pay $220.3 million to the city of Santa Clara and to the 49ers over twenty years, with an option to extend the deal for another five years for around $75 million.[33] As of 2016[update], Levi Strauss Signature jeans sell at several[quantify] stores in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.
Cultural impact[edit]
Levi's has been worn by people from all walks of life, from miners to Nobel Prize recipients including Albert Einstein himself, whose famous leather jacket was made by Levi Strauss & Co in the 30's and has recently been sold at auction house Christies for £110,500.[34]
Corporate structure and staff[edit]

Levi's marketing has often made use of old recordings of popular music in television commercials, ranging from traditional pop to punk rock. Notable examples include Ben E King ("Stand By Me"), Percy Sledge ("When a Man Loves a Woman"), Eddie Cochran ("C'mon Everybody!"), The Ronettes ("Be My Baby"), Marc Bolan ("20th Century Boy"), Screamin' Jay Hawkins ("Heart Attack & Vine"), The Clash ("Should I Stay or Should I Go?").
Many of these songs were re-released by their record labels as a tie-in with the ad campaigns, resulting in increased popularity and sales of the recordings and the creation of iconic visual associations with the music, such as the use of a topless male model wearing jeans underwater in the 1986 adverts featuring "Wonderful World" and "Mad about the Boy" and the puppet, Flat Eric, in the ads featuring music by Mr. Oizo.

"We're getting squeezed," he says in his office in Levi's Plaza, which has a startling view of San Francisco Bay and is about a 30-minute walk away from the Post Street store. But Levi's thinks it may have found a way to cheat a retail demise. Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, is where moms go to stock up on Max and Maddy's school supplies, their juice boxes and, of course, their jeans. So if you want the kids, and the rest of their families, you need to sell at Wal-Mart. And you need a new product for this new customer. This month, Levi's is introducing its new, less expensive Signature jeans line. (The jeans, for men, women and children, sell for around $23. They have fewer detail finishes than Levi's other lines. They don't have the company's trademark red tab or stitching on the pocket.) Of course, there's something in it for Wal-Mart. The company, already the largest clothing retailer in the world, wants more affluent customers. To lure them in, it needs big brands. Acknowledging that the company's customers come from a "cross-section of income levels and lifestyles", Wal-Mart Senior Vice President Lois Mikita says the company "continues to tailor its selection to meet the needs of those customers".

History[edit]
Origin and formation (1853–1890s)[edit]
Levi Strauss started the business at the 90 Sacramento Street address in San Francisco. He next moved the location to 62 Sacramento Street then 63 & 65 Sacramento Street.[citation needed] Jacob Davis, a Latvian Jewish immigrant, was a Reno, Nevada [7] tailor who frequently purchased bolts of cloth made from denim from Levi Strauss & Co.'s wholesale house. After one of Davis' customers kept purchasing cloth to reinforce torn pants, he had an idea to use copper rivets to reinforce the points of strain, such as on the pocket corners and at the base of the button fly.[8] Davis did not have the required money to purchase a patent, so he wrote to Strauss suggesting that they go into business together. After Levi accepted Jacob's offer, on May 20, 1873, the two men received U.S. Patent 139,121 from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The patented rivet was later incorporated into the company's jean design and advertisements. Contrary to an advertising campaign suggesting that Levi Strauss sold his first jeans to gold miners during the California Gold Rush (which peaked in 1849), the manufacturing of denim overalls only began in the 1870s. The company created their first pair of Levis 501 Jeans in the 1890s.
Growth in popularity (1910s–1950s)[edit]

Modern jeans began to appear in the 1920s, but sales were largely confined to the working people of the western United States, such as cowboys, lumberjacks, and railroad workers. Levi’s jeans apparently were first introduced to the East during the dude ranch craze of the 1930s, when vacationing Easterners returned home with tales (and usually examples) of the hard-wearing pants with rivets. Another boost came in World War II, when blue jeans were declared an essential commodity and were sold only to people engaged in defense work.
Between the 1950s and 1980s, Levi's jeans became popular among a wide range of youth subcultures, including greasers, mods, rockers, and hippies. Levi's popular shrink-to-fit 501s were sold in a unique sizing arrangement; the indicated size referred to the size of the jeans prior to shrinking, and the shrinkage was substantial.[9] The company still produces these unshrunk, uniquely sized jeans, and they are still Levi's number one selling product. Although popular lore (abetted by company marketing) holds that the original design remains unaltered, this is not the case: the crotch rivet and waist cinch were removed during World War II to conform to War Production Board requirements to conserve metal, and was not replaced after the war. Additionally, the back pocket rivets, which had been covered in denim since 1937, were removed completely in the 1950s due to complaints they scratched furniture.[10] From a company with fifteen salespeople, two plants, and almost no business east of the Mississippi in 1946, the organization grew in thirty years to include a sales force of more than 22,000, with 50 plants and offices in 35 countries.[11]

A pair of Levi's 501 raw jeans


From the early 1960s through the mid-1970s, Levi Strauss experienced significant growth in its business as the more casual look of the 1960s and 1970s ushered in the "blue jeans craze" and served as a catalyst for the brand. Levi's, under the leadership of Walter Haas, Peter Haas Sr., Paul Glasco and George P. Simpkins Sr., expanded the firm's clothing line by adding new fashions and models, including stone-washed jeans through the acquisition of Great Western Garment Co. (GWG), a Canadian clothing manufacturer acquired by Levi's. The acquisition led to the introduction of the modern "stone washing" technique, still in use by Levi Strauss. Simpkins is credited with the company's record-paced expansion of its manufacturing capacity from 16 plants to more than 63 plants in the United States from 1964 to 1974 and 23 overseas. Levi's' expansion under Simpkins was accomplished without a single unionized employee as a result of Levi's' and the Haas family's strong stance on human rights and Simpkins' use of "pay for performance" manufacturing from the sewing machine operator level up. As a result, Levi's' plants were perhaps the highest performing, best organized and cleanest textile facilities of their time.
In the 1980s, The company closed around 60 of its manifacturing plants because of financial difficulties and strong competition from competitors.[12]
The Dockers brand, launched in 1986 and which is sold largely through department store chains, helped the company grow through the mid-1990s, as denim sales began to fade. Dockers were introduced into Europe in 1996 and led by CEO Jorge Bardina. Levi Strauss attempted to sell the Dockers division in 2004 to relieve part of the company's $2.6 billion outstanding debt.
Brand competition (1990s)[edit]




Levi's 506 inside


By the 1990s, Levi's faced competition from other brands and cheaper products from overseas, and began accelerating the pace of its US factory-closures and its use of offshore subcontracting agreements. In 1991, Levi Strauss became implicated in a scandal involving pants made in the Northern Mariana Islands: some 3% of Levi's jeans sold annually with the Made in the USA label were shown[by whom?] to have been made by Chinese laborers under what the United States Department of Labor called "slavelike" conditions. As of 2016[update], most Levi's jeans are made outside the US, though a few of the higher-end, more expensive styles are still made in the U.S.
Cited for sub-minimum wages, seven-day work weeks with 12-hour shifts, poor living conditions and other indignities, Tan Holdings Corporation, Levi Strauss' Marianas subcontractor, paid what were then the largest fines in U.S. labor history, distributing more than $9 million in restitution to some 1,200 employees.[13][14][15] Levi Strauss claimed no knowledge of the offenses, then severed ties to the Tan family and instituted labor reforms and inspection practices in its offshore facilities.
The activist group Fuerza Unida (United Force) formed following the January 1990 closure of a plant in San Antonio, Texas, in which 1,150 seamstresses, some of whom had worked for Levi Strauss for decades, saw their jobs exported to Costa Rica.[16] During the mid- and late-1990s, Fuerza Unida picketed the Levi Strauss headquarters in San Francisco and staged hunger strikes and sit-ins in protest at the company's labor policies.[17][18][19]
The company took on multibillion-dollar debt in February 1996 to help finance a series of leveraged stock buyouts among family members. Shares in Levi Strauss stock are not publicly traded; the firm as of 2016[update] is owned almost entirely by indirect descendants and collateral relatives of Levi Strauss, whose four nephews inherited the San Francisco dry-goods firm after their uncle's death in 1902.[20] The corporation's bonds are traded publicly, as are shares of the company's Japanese affiliate, Levi Strauss Japan K.K.
In June 1996, the company offered to pay its workers an unusual dividend of up to $750 million in six years' time, having halted an employee-stock plan at the time of the internal family buyout. However, the company failed to make cash-flow targets, and no worker dividends were paid.[21]
Recent developments (2000–present)[edit]

In 2002, Levi Strauss began a close business collaboration with Walmart, producing a special line of "Signature" jeans and other clothes for exclusive sale in Walmart stores until 2006.[22] Levi Strauss leads the apparel industry in trademark infringement cases, filing nearly 100 lawsuits against competitors since 2001.[23] Most cases center on the alleged imitation of Levi's back pocket double arc stitching pattern (U.S. trademark #1,139,254), which Levi filed for trademark in 1978.[24] Levi's has successfully sued Guess?, Polo Ralph Lauren, Esprit Holdings, Zegna, Zumiez, and Lucky Brand Jeans, among other companies.[23]
In 2002, the company closed its Valencia Street plant in San Francisco, which had opened the same year of the city's April 1906 earthquake.[25][26] By the end of 2003, the closure of Levi's last U.S. factory in San Antonio ended 150 years of jeans made in the USA. Production of a few higher-end, more expensive styles of jeans resumed in the US several years later.[26]
By 2007, Levi Strauss was again profitable after declining sales in nine of the previous ten years.[27] Its total annual sales, of just over $4 billion, were $3 billion less than during its peak performance[26] in the mid-1990s.[28] After more than two decades of family ownership, rumors of a possible public stock offering were floated[by whom?] in the media in July 2007.[29] In 2009, it was noted[by whom?] in the media for selling jeans on interest-free credit, due to the global recession.[30][31] In 2010, the company partnered with Filson, an outdoor-goods manufacturer in Seattle, to produce a high-end line of jackets and workwear.[32]
On May 8, 2013, the NFL's San Francisco 49ers announced that Levi Strauss & Co. had purchased the naming rights to their new stadium in Santa Clara, California. The naming-rights deal called for Levi's to pay $220.3 million to the city of Santa Clara and to the 49ers over twenty years, with an option to extend the deal for another five years for around $75 million.[33] As of 2016[update], Levi Strauss Signature jeans sell at several[quantify] stores in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.
Cultural impact[edit]
Levi's has been worn by people from all walks of life, from miners to Nobel Prize recipients including Albert Einstein himself, whose famous leather jacket was made by Levi Strauss & Co in the 30's and has recently been sold at auction house Christies for £110,500.[34]

Levi's marketing has often made use of old recordings of popular music in television commercials, ranging from traditional pop to punk rock. Notable examples include Ben E King ("Stand By Me"), Percy Sledge ("When a Man Loves a Woman"), Eddie Cochran ("C'mon Everybody!"), The Ronettes ("Be My Baby"), Marc Bolan ("20th Century Boy"), Screamin' Jay Hawkins ("Heart Attack & Vine"), The Clash ("Should I Stay or Should I Go?").
Many of these songs were re-released by their record labels as a tie-in with the ad campaigns, resulting in increased popularity and sales of the recordings and the creation of iconic visual associations with the music, such as the use of a topless male model wearing jeans underwater in the 1986 adverts featuring "Wonderful World" and "Mad about the Boy" and the puppet, Flat Eric, in the ads featuring music by Mr. Oizo.

David Bergen, Levi's senior vice president and CIO, says his company is caught in the "jaws of death." "We're getting squeezed," he says in his office in Levi's Plaza, which has a startling view of San Francisco Bay and is about a 30-minute walk away from the Post Street store. But Levi's thinks it may have found a way to cheat a retail demise. Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, is where moms go to stock up on Max and Maddy's school supplies, their juice boxes and, of course, their jeans. So if you want the kids, and the rest of their families, you need to sell at Wal-Mart. And you need a new product for this new customer. This month, Levi's is introducing its new, less expensive Signature jeans line. (The jeans, for men, women and children, sell for around $23. They have fewer detail finishes than Levi's other lines. They don't have the company's trademark red tab or stitching on the pocket.) Of course, there's something in it for Wal-Mart. The company, already the largest clothing retailer in the world, wants more affluent customers. To lure them in, it needs big brands. Acknowledging that the company's customers come from a "cross-section of income levels and lifestyles", Wal-Mart Senior Vice President Lois Mikita says the company "continues to tailor its selection to meet the needs of those customers".

Levi Strauss & Co.'s 96-year-old Valencia Street plant will close by summer, perhaps becoming a museum but definitely staying in company hands even after its production lights go out, its stewards said....

About Levi’s® Products

Size Guides





    About Levi’s® Products    Craftsmanship Clothing made finer,      stronger, better  Learn how we craft     clothing to fit     your life    Innovation Uniforms of progress  Learn how we’re     innovating for the     next generation    Sustainability Made with purpose  Learn how we’re     Creating products that benefit     people and the planet      OUR STORY IS BEHIND EVERY SEAM Strength. That’s the meaning behind our iconic Two Horses logo — and it still resonates today, more than a century since it was first branded into a leather patch of 501® jeans in 1886. When Levi Strauss co-invented the blue jean in 1873, he didn’t know that he was creating a global brand that would become known for self-expression and classic American cool. And that’s the beauty of the Levi’s® story.    Craftsmanship Levi’s® clothing is crafted for life. Unrivalled construction. Tried and tested. American originals. No matter how you say it, every piece of Levi’s® clothing embodies a sense of craft and quality — from the classic fit of Levi’s® 501® jeans to the refined details of Levi’s® Made & Crafted collection. For us, craftsmanship translates to design with purpose. From fabric to stitching, here’s just a slice of how Levi’s® products are crafted with care.  Levi’s® clothing starts with quality components EVERY PAIR OF LEVI’s® IS MADE WITH THE BEST FABRIC FOR FIT: NATURAL COTTON. Because we’re committed to doing good for people and the earth, we support sustainably grown cotton and the Better Cotton Initiative to improve the cotton production process. CLICK TO READ MORE ABOUT OUR WORK WITH THE BETTER COTTON INITIATIVE GETTING THE COLOR JUST RIGHT From deep blues to faded indigos, for us, denim is equal parts fashion, art and function. The colors you choose are an expression of who you are. That’s why we offer a range of colors to suit all your wearing occasions. LEVI’s® RIVETS: MADE STRONG ENOUGH FOR AMERICAN COWBOYS AND MINERS. The Levi’s® rivet has become a standard in quality design around the world — and it all started with two American entrepreneurs joining forces during the Gold Rush era. As the owner of a San Francisco general-goods store in 1872, Levi Strauss supplied denim to Jacob Davis, a tailor who had created copper rivets to fasten pockets to pants. With the goal of making workpants as strong as possible, Jacobs’ invention was so good that he couldn’t keep up with demand. Enter Strauss, who pioneered product development and manufacturing of the original Levi’s® blue jeans.     DETAILS MAKE THE DESIGN  We’re a bit obsessed with selvedge. Selvedge or selvage (meaning “self-edge”) — the natural edge of a roll of denim fabric — is part of our DNA. As an ode to the original Levi’s® signature red-stitched selvedge, we created Levi’s® Selvedge, a collection known for its heavyweight, raw denim and khaki and red stitching on its inside seam. Woven on traditional shuttle looms that operate at a slow speed, the time-consuming process of making selvedge denim ranks it the highest quality in the world.  Learn more about selvedge WATCH THE VIDEO Denim and the machine: Our looms keep up with global demand. Rooting back to the 1870s, denim was produced on 29” looms, which operated at a relatively slow speed. Due to increased demand for denim, in the 1950s, Levi Strauss & Co. replaced the old shuttle-style looms with modern projectile looms. The new looms produce wider fabric at a faster speed. We take every stitch seriously. Whether you favor the single-needle stitching found in Skinny Men’s Jeans, double-needle stitching in Levi’s® Vintage 501XX® 1947 Big E Redline Selvage “Rodeo Hero” Jeans or the double felled inseam characteristic of Levi’s® 606 (Janis Joplin’s favorite), we take pride in paying attention to the details. You make our classics classic. We’re honored that denim aficionados pay thousands of dollars for vintage Levi’s® jeans. But we also want to make the vintage looks you love more accessible. Enter the Levi’s® Classics Upgrade collection, which resurrects the craftsmanship, durability and simplicity of vintage styles. Made with slightly heavier-weight denim dyed with a deeper indigo and high-quality reinforcements in areas like back pockets, Levi’s® Classics Upgrades are the same as ever — but like never before.    Innovation Wear the uniform of progress A wise person once said that the best way to have a good idea is to have lots of them. Luckily, we have no shortage of ideas — and they’re largely inspired by you. From our rivet patent in 1873 to the Levi’s® Commuter series antimicrobial protective fabric to environmental advances of the Water<LESS™ collection, every Levi’s® innovation starts when we ask ourselves, “What can we do better?” As an international team who wears our own designs, we view fashion as a merger of art, innovation and sustainability. After all, Levi’s® jeans are what the next generation wears — and we take that role to heart. Here are a few examples of how we’re constantly reimagining the Levi’s® brand…  Water<LESS™ — Start small, think big. In 2011, we launched Levi’s® Water<LESS™, a collection produced with significantly less water. Instead of using water during the stonewash process, we use a dry-stone process that produces similar results in more than a dozen classic Levi’s® jeans, including 501® jeans, 511TM jeans and the Levi’s® Trucker Jacket. We’ve already saved over 170 million liters of water with Water<LESS™. And this is just the beginning — we’re committed to doing right by the planet in as many ways possible.  Want to help save water? Watch this video. WATCH THIS VIDEO    Sta-Prest — Permanent. Sharp. Crease. In 1964, Levi Strauss & Co. patented the Sta-Prest process at our plant in Knoxville, Tennessee — giving a permanent, sharp front crease to fine trousers and shirts. Engineered with a resin-coated twill/polyester blend to prevent wrinkling, Sta-Prest was reintroduced in spring 2012.  Levi’s® Commuter — Form. Function. Cycling. Masterminded for cyclists and people with active lifestyles, the Levi’s® Commuter series is designed to stay stronger longer, with reinforced fabric that wicks sweat and repels water and dirt. Constructed with protective features — including a U-lock storage waistband, reflective tape for nighttime visibility and antimicrobial technology — these jeans, shirts and jackets are the epitome of functionality with uncompromised style.     MADE OF PROGRESS Our global commitment to responsible craftsmanship We believe that meaningful progress is about getting better at creating less impact on the planet and supporting programs designed to benefit the greater good. And that’s why we’re proactive about developing sustainable products and business practices. From the integration of our factories in the 1940s to our outspoken advocacy for equality and civil rights, we’ve always been agents of progress. Since the early 1990s, through efforts like establishing one of the first Restricted Substance Lists (RSL), that set a standard for chemical management, to most recently making jeans from Better cotton, we’ve taken a leadership role in attempting to minimize the adverse environmental impacts of our business.We can’t do this work without you. Together we can make a difference. Here’s how we’re making progress, and we invite you to join us…  LESS IMPACT > < GREATER GOOD AS OBSESSED AS WE ARE WITH DESIGN DETAILS, WE ALSO TAKE A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO MAKING LEVI’S® CLOTHING; FROM CONCEPTION TO THE RETIREMENT OF JEANS AND DEFINING OUR TERMS OF ENGAGEMENT TO PROVIDE A SAFE WORKING ENVIRONMENT. DOING RIGHT SUSTAINABLY To design with awareness of the greater impact is an ethos that continues to drive our progress in creating less impact on the planet and our achieve mission to help restore the environment.We’re proud to have created one of the first set of requirements for suppliers that include water quality and chemicals used in our products.Because 95 percent of Levi’s® products are made of cotton, the first stage in making our products sustainable, throughout the Levi’s® Lifecycle of a Jean, is assuring best practices for farmers growing cotton. We collaborate with the Better Cotton Initiative, a non-profit that aims to make global cotton production better for the environment and the 300 million people who grow cotton. In 2012, we created 20 million pairs of Levi’s® and Denizen™ jeans made with a blend of Better Cotton.Through participation in the Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy (BICEP), we’ve joined other global companies in calling for leadership and support from U.S. Congress to develop energy and climate legislation that promotes energy efficiency and reduces overall greenhouse gas emissions. <Read more about how we’re saving energy here.> The Water<Less™ Challenge — Less is more In 2011, we launched Levi’s® Water<Less™, a collection produced  using less water during finishing. Levi’s denim finishing experts innovated new techniques with an eye to reduce water consumption while achieving the same great style and look that our customers expect.  For example, instead of using water during the stonewash process, Water<Less™ products use a dry-stone process that produces similar results in more than a dozen classic Levi’s® jeans, including 501® jeans, 511™ jeans and the Levi’s® Trucker Jacket. In 2012 we produced 29 million Water<Less™ products saving over 360 million liters of water. And this is just the beginning — we’re committed to doing right by the planet in as many ways possible. <Click here to learn how you can help us stay heavy on style, lighter on water.> In 2012, we partnered with Water.org to ask a simple question: If you could give someone clean water for life, would you? Thousands of people in more than 1,300 cities around the world rose to the Go Water<Less™ Challenge. As a result, we helped provide clean drinking water for life to 4,110 people around the world. But, with nearly one billion people on our planet lacking access to clean drinking water, the crisis is far from over. Making a difference is easier than you think.  Here’s how you can help:  Standing up for workers’ rights In 1991, Levi’s® implemented its <Terms of Engagement>to help improve the lives of apparel workers in factories around the world. As the first apparel company to set standards for suppliers globally, Levi’s® terms have become known as the code that launched a thousand codes, remaking the way the apparel industry is run. On the 20th anniversary of our first TOE, we recently recommitted to not only enforce our current requirements for factories but to take our programs one step further through pilot programs that seek to improve the lives of workers outside the factory walls.We also created the  Social and Environmental Sustainability Guidebookto benefit members of the Levi’s® family. The guidebook covers topics ranging from safety guidelines for garment makers to Freedom of Association. Engaged with the community In the spirit of our founder Levi Strauss, our employees have been giving back to our communities for more than 150 years — by mobilizing volunteer teams that work year round to support charitable organizations, by rushing to help when disaster strikes and by supporting special events to raise awareness and funding for important causes. <Learn more about our community and volunteer efforts.>>   WE SET THE BAR HIGH WITH OUR MATERIALS Global bottled water consumption is over 29 liters per person, per year. Unfortunately, many of these bottles are not recycled – in the US, only 29% of PET bottles are recycled; in Europe, only 48%; and in Japan, 72%. Garbage is piling up. These disposable bottles are not going to just disappear.Municipal recycling programs use new technology to recover plastic bottles and food trays across the U.S. They are cleaned, sorted, crushed and made into a polyester fiber, which is then blended with cotton and woven into the denim of Waste<Less™ jeans and Trucker jackets.Recycled brown, green, blue and clear plastic bottles, as well as black food trays have become a new resource efficient material that also provides a unique color and finish. The lightweight, non-stretch White Oak Cone denim, found in our 2013 collection, is also remarkably soft and flexible.By incorporating post-consumer waste into our Waste<Less™ denim we use less virgin cotton and virgin polyester and, in turn, less natural resources. In the spring of 2013, we’ll recycle approximately 3.5 million PET plastic bottles, and that’s just the start. In seasons to come, look for more impact-reducing Waste<Less™ apparel. BETTER COTTON Cotton accounts for 40% of the world’s fiber production and generates a $40 billion a year textile market. Though we are a big consumer of cotton, we use less than 1% of the world’s annual cotton crop. But regardless of the size of our cotton consumption, we're committed to promoting more sustainable practices and have done so by joining forces with other brands and retailers to form the Better Cotton Initiative. Click here to learn more ADDITIONAL FIBERS Within our product offering, we also use organic cotton, which requires no pesticides to grow, and Tencel®, a natural fiber made from wood pulp that takes less energy to produce. RECYCLED PACKAGING CONTENT Because we want to use recycled materials as much as possible, in 2009, we introduced clothing made with post-consumer fiber. In 2010, we committed to a Sustainable Forest Product Procurement Policy, which states that we promote sustainable forestry practices, and we will not knowingly purchase wood and paper products from endangered forests and other highly controversial sources such as high-risk regions for illegal logging. We created a Care Tag for our Planet Did you know that you can reduce the full lifecycle climate change impact of your jeans by up to 50 percent by line drying and washing them in cold water? We were surprised, too.In 2010, we created the Care Tag for our Planet initiative with this simple message: Machine wash cold, line dry when possible, donate to Goodwill.Donating your used Levi’s® jeans to Goodwill helps reduce the approximately 23.8 billion pounds of clothing and textiles that go into U.S. landfills each year, said Jim Gibbons, president and CEO of Goodwill Industries International. Check out these clever ways to air-dry clothing, from our Care to Air Contest.

 When Bavarian immigrant Levi Strauss opened his wholesale dry goods warehouse on the San Francisco waterfront in 1853, he likely had no inkling that his business would become one of the world’s largest clothing companies. Levi Strauss & Co. started with imported clothing, bedding, and notions to supply the many small stores serving the Gold Rush and the expanding American West. By 1873, he and partner Jacob Davis invented the very first blue jeans, which were soon worn by working men from Los Angeles to Laramie. Strauss parlayed his business acumen into social progress by giving back to his community and embedding a company culture committed to positively impacting society. In this spirit, the Levi Strauss Foundation was created after World War II, formalizing the philanthropic work started by Strauss himself a century earlier. All the while, the company has evolved with successive generations of family owners, expanding product lines to meet the ever-changing needs of consumers around the world.

Title: Levi Strauss historian speaks at Museum MondayPublisher: Wickenburg SunAuthor: Staff WriterDate: 11/20/2008The first corporate historian hired for Levi Strauss & Co. will speak at the Desert Caballeros Western Museum Monday (Nov. 24) at 5 p.m.Lynn Downey was hired as the first historian for Levi & Strauss Co. in 1989, after receiving her master’s degree in library and information science from the University of California, Berkeley, specializing in archives administration. Downey manages the Levi & Strauss Corporate Archives in San Francisco, which includes clothing, marketing materials, photographs and artifacts.One archival item in particular will be of interest to Wickenburg residents: a pair of Levi’s jeans purchased by a miner named Homer Campbell at Brayton’s Commercial Co. in Wickenburg in 1917. The fascinating story of how this pair of jeans found its way to the Levi Strauss & Co. archives will be revealed in her lecture this Monday.Downey has published a number of books, articles and book reviews on historical subjects, including “This is a Pair of Levi’s¨ Jeans” (1995), and “Levi Strauss & Co., a corporate history for Arcadia Publishing’s Images of America series” (2007). Her next project is a biography of company founder Levi Strauss.Downey is the media spokesperson for company history and has appeared on numerous global television shows, including “The Oprah Winfrey Show” and “Today”. She frequently goes on press tours with vintage products for fashion journalists. She is also a regular speaker at the Fashion Institute for Design and Merchandising and the California College of the Arts in San Francisco.Downey’s presentation begins at 5 p.m. at the Desert Caballeros Western Museum and is free to the public.

The company is very lucky to have such a illustrious history and ending up producing the most appealing jeans of all time.  Today no other manufacturer produces as appealing jeans, shirts and other clothing products.  I have worn their products for many years with complete satisfaction.  This is a great book to learn how the company operated with changing times.  Levi's jeans are one of the really few and true American icons.  I am glad they are still available today.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse3.0 out of 5 starsBasic history of LeviByZack Gilmoreon January 22, 2013Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseBasic History of Levi.

501® ORIGINAL
Started by us. Finished by you.

                        In 1873, workers who’d flocked to the American West in search of fortune needed pants that could work and endure, so Levi Strauss and Jacob Davis combined quality denim and rivet reinforcements, creating the first pair of blue jeans: the Levi’s® 501® Original.
                    
Shop Men
Shop Women










                        Created before the invention of the zipper, the signature button fly is a key detail which defines the 501® Jean,the perfect union of function and style.
                    









Now available in stretch denim.

Shop Women's 501® Stretch





                        The iconic Two Horse patch stitched on to the back of every pair of 501® Jeans illustrates the original promise made by Levi Strauss: “It’s no use, they can’t be ripped” and celebrates the strength and quality of the riveted denim.
                    











                        “It started out being purely functional. And became a style leader.”

                        "We're acutely aware of people customizing their jeans—making them a little bit tapered, taking a lot out of the leg and then vacuum-packing themselves into vintage Levi's®. That was really the beginning of the 501® Skinny."

                    “After hemming, tapering the leg of the 501® jeans is the most requested alteration in Levi’s® stores and tailor shops around the world, so we decided to do it for you, creating the 501® Taper and the perfect custom taper.”

Levi Jeans for Guys at JCPenney
The inventor of blue jeans has the market cornered, and when it comes to Levi jeans for guys, JCPenney has every style, every cut, every color and every option for every man. Like you, Levi Strauss & Co is driven by hard work, creativity and strong values. When you zip on a pair of Levis, you feel the work and innovation that went into the making of comfort and style.

Guys Levis by the Number
The best way to find the best fit for you is by checking out the number. Levi uses a classic three-digit numbering system to organize fits, cuts and styles so you know at a glance exactly how that pair will fit you. For guys, the number is pretty straightforward and accounts for the overall fit—waist rise, leg opening and seat fit. For the most classic, straight leg style, try out the 501 Original, complete with a slim fit and the original button fly. From the original 501’s to the loose fitting 569’s, you’ll find a style of guys Levi’s that you’ll love enough to buy over and over again. More likely, you’ll find that many different styles give you the fit and look you want. So get them, the 501’s and the 517’s. Get more than one of every style, because when you’re shopping at JCPenney, you know you don’t have to wait for a sale. You can get great deals on Levi jeans for guys every day.

In addition to the many styles and cuts of guys Levi’s we have, JCPenney also offers a full line of guys Levi clothing, including twill pants, denim and cargo shorts, shrink-to-fit jeans and denim and faux-leather jackets. Whether you’re completing your wardrobe or completely starting over, Levi has got your number. Come get yours at our men’s clothing collection.

Give Into the Timeless Comfort and Style of Women's Levi Jeans
Women's Levi's are iconic—full-stop, point-blank, end of sentence. Take advantage of the brand's reputation and explore the wide world of Levi's clothing for women. You'll find jeans that fit every imaginable shape, size, and taste level, but the fashion doesn't stop there—uncover a selection of tops, skirts, shorts, and jackets, as well.
Jeans for Days
It doesn't matter what style of jeans you like best; you'll find them here. Skinny jeans are still going strong in the world of trending fashion. Stonewashed, white, black, distressed—pick your poison. Relaxed fit and boot cut jeans abound. Cool off in denim shorts in various lengths or capris that give off a carefree, preppy vibe. Denim leggings are even more fitted than skinny jeans, but it's easier to move around in them, so you get the best of both worlds. Clearly, you're spoiled for choices. You've got denim for days.
Every Type of Top
You might not realize the stunning selection of tops that Levi's has to offer. T-shirts emblazoned with pleasing on-brand designs are ideal for casual days. Wear them to the gym, or let them do double duty as pajama tops. Cozy flannels in vivid plaid palettes embrace the grunge look that's coming back with such a comfortable vengeance. Why not layer them with a Levi's tee? You can even find fashion tops, such as off-the-shoulder pieces with a distinct Boho chic vibe.
A Little Extra
Denim is a versatile material. It's also timeless, so it's no surprise that Levi's has a variety of other denim items. Why not up your fashion game and step out wearing a denim vest? Pins and patches are optional. Take your love for retro fashion to a new, higher level. Remember when you used to wear your denim jacket everywhere? Pick up the habit again. All you have to do is pick out a modern version of your vintage favorite.
Jean skirts are having a huge trending moment, as well. You might want to stick with black, but you'll wear it more often than you think. You can't go wrong with denim shorts, either. From Bermuda shorts to thigh-skimming options, you'll find a style you love.
Browse jeans, jackets, tops, and more to satisfy your cravings for denim. Check out JCPenney's collection of women's Levi's clothing and indulge yourself.

Levi Strauss & Co. /ˌliːvaɪ ˈstraʊs/ is a privately owned American clothing company known worldwide for its Levi's /ˌliːvaɪz/ brand of denim jeans. It was founded in May 1853[4] when Levi Strauss came from Buttenheim, Bavaria, to San Francisco, California to open a west coast branch of his brothers' New York dry goods business.[5] The company's corporate headquarters is located in the Levi's Plaza in San Francisco.[6]

History[edit]
Origin and formation (1853–1890s)[edit]
Levi Strauss started the business at the 90 Sacramento Street address in San Francisco. He next moved the location to 62 Sacramento Street then 63 & 65 Sacramento Street.[citation needed] Jacob Davis, a Latvian Jewish immigrant, was a Reno, Nevada [7] tailor who frequently purchased bolts of cloth made from denim from Levi Strauss & Co.'s wholesale house. After one of Davis' customers kept purchasing cloth to reinforce torn pants, he had an idea to use copper rivets to reinforce the points of strain, such as on the pocket corners and at the base of the button fly.[8] Davis did not have the required money to purchase a patent, so he wrote to Strauss suggesting that they go into business together. After Levi accepted Jacob's offer, on May 20, 1873, the two men received U.S. Patent 139,121 from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The patented rivet was later incorporated into the company's jean design and advertisements. Contrary to an advertising campaign suggesting that Levi Strauss sold his first jeans to gold miners during the California Gold Rush (which peaked in 1849), the manufacturing of denim overalls only began in the 1870s. The company created their first pair of Levis 501 Jeans in the 1890s.
Growth in popularity (1910s–1950s)[edit]

Modern jeans began to appear in the 1920s, but sales were largely confined to the working people of the western United States, such as cowboys, lumberjacks, and railroad workers. Levi’s jeans apparently were first introduced to the East during the dude ranch craze of the 1930s, when vacationing Easterners returned home with tales (and usually examples) of the hard-wearing pants with rivets. Another boost came in World War II, when blue jeans were declared an essential commodity and were sold only to people engaged in defense work.
Between the 1950s and 1980s, Levi's jeans became popular among a wide range of youth subcultures, including greasers, mods, rockers, and hippies. Levi's popular shrink-to-fit 501s were sold in a unique sizing arrangement; the indicated size referred to the size of the jeans prior to shrinking, and the shrinkage was substantial.[9] The company still produces these unshrunk, uniquely sized jeans, and they are still Levi's number one selling product. Although popular lore (abetted by company marketing) holds that the original design remains unaltered, this is not the case: the crotch rivet and waist cinch were removed during World War II to conform to War Production Board requirements to conserve metal, and was not replaced after the war. Additionally, the back pocket rivets, which had been covered in denim since 1937, were removed completely in the 1950s due to complaints they scratched furniture.[10] From a company with fifteen salespeople, two plants, and almost no business east of the Mississippi in 1946, the organization grew in thirty years to include a sales force of more than 22,000, with 50 plants and offices in 35 countries.[11]

A pair of Levi's 501 raw jeans


From the early 1960s through the mid-1970s, Levi Strauss experienced significant growth in its business as the more casual look of the 1960s and 1970s ushered in the "blue jeans craze" and served as a catalyst for the brand. Levi's, under the leadership of Walter Haas, Peter Haas Sr., Paul Glasco and George P. Simpkins Sr., expanded the firm's clothing line by adding new fashions and models, including stone-washed jeans through the acquisition of Great Western Garment Co. (GWG), a Canadian clothing manufacturer acquired by Levi's. The acquisition led to the introduction of the modern "stone washing" technique, still in use by Levi Strauss. Simpkins is credited with the company's record-paced expansion of its manufacturing capacity from 16 plants to more than 63 plants in the United States from 1964 to 1974 and 23 overseas. Levi's' expansion under Simpkins was accomplished without a single unionized employee as a result of Levi's' and the Haas family's strong stance on human rights and Simpkins' use of "pay for performance" manufacturing from the sewing machine operator level up. As a result, Levi's' plants were perhaps the highest performing, best organized and cleanest textile facilities of their time.
In the 1980s, The company closed around 60 of its manifacturing plants because of financial difficulties and strong competition from competitors.[12]
The Dockers brand, launched in 1986 and which is sold largely through department store chains, helped the company grow through the mid-1990s, as denim sales began to fade. Dockers were introduced into Europe in 1996 and led by CEO Jorge Bardina. Levi Strauss attempted to sell the Dockers division in 2004 to relieve part of the company's $2.6 billion outstanding debt.
Brand competition (1990s)[edit]




Levi's 506 inside


By the 1990s, Levi's faced competition from other brands and cheaper products from overseas, and began accelerating the pace of its US factory-closures and its use of offshore subcontracting agreements. In 1991, Levi Strauss became implicated in a scandal involving pants made in the Northern Mariana Islands: some 3% of Levi's jeans sold annually with the Made in the USA label were shown[by whom?] to have been made by Chinese laborers under what the United States Department of Labor called "slavelike" conditions. As of 2016[update], most Levi's jeans are made outside the US, though a few of the higher-end, more expensive styles are still made in the U.S.
Cited for sub-minimum wages, seven-day work weeks with 12-hour shifts, poor living conditions and other indignities, Tan Holdings Corporation, Levi Strauss' Marianas subcontractor, paid what were then the largest fines in U.S. labor history, distributing more than $9 million in restitution to some 1,200 employees.[13][14][15] Levi Strauss claimed no knowledge of the offenses, then severed ties to the Tan family and instituted labor reforms and inspection practices in its offshore facilities.
The activist group Fuerza Unida (United Force) formed following the January 1990 closure of a plant in San Antonio, Texas, in which 1,150 seamstresses, some of whom had worked for Levi Strauss for decades, saw their jobs exported to Costa Rica.[16] During the mid- and late-1990s, Fuerza Unida picketed the Levi Strauss headquarters in San Francisco and staged hunger strikes and sit-ins in protest at the company's labor policies.[17][18][19]
The company took on multibillion-dollar debt in February 1996 to help finance a series of leveraged stock buyouts among family members. Shares in Levi Strauss stock are not publicly traded; the firm as of 2016[update] is owned almost entirely by indirect descendants and collateral relatives of Levi Strauss, whose four nephews inherited the San Francisco dry-goods firm after their uncle's death in 1902.[20] The corporation's bonds are traded publicly, as are shares of the company's Japanese affiliate, Levi Strauss Japan K.K.
In June 1996, the company offered to pay its workers an unusual dividend of up to $750 million in six years' time, having halted an employee-stock plan at the time of the internal family buyout. However, the company failed to make cash-flow targets, and no worker dividends were paid.[21]
Recent developments (2000–present)[edit]

In 2002, Levi Strauss began a close business collaboration with Walmart, producing a special line of "Signature" jeans and other clothes for exclusive sale in Walmart stores until 2006.[22] Levi Strauss leads the apparel industry in trademark infringement cases, filing nearly 100 lawsuits against competitors since 2001.[23] Most cases center on the alleged imitation of Levi's back pocket double arc stitching pattern (U.S. trademark #1,139,254), which Levi filed for trademark in 1978.[24] Levi's has successfully sued Guess?, Polo Ralph Lauren, Esprit Holdings, Zegna, Zumiez, and Lucky Brand Jeans, among other companies.[23]
In 2002, the company closed its Valencia Street plant in San Francisco, which had opened the same year of the city's April 1906 earthquake.[25][26] By the end of 2003, the closure of Levi's last U.S. factory in San Antonio ended 150 years of jeans made in the USA. Production of a few higher-end, more expensive styles of jeans resumed in the US several years later.[26]
By 2007, Levi Strauss was again profitable after declining sales in nine of the previous ten years.[27] Its total annual sales, of just over $4 billion, were $3 billion less than during its peak performance[26] in the mid-1990s.[28] After more than two decades of family ownership, rumors of a possible public stock offering were floated[by whom?] in the media in July 2007.[29] In 2009, it was noted[by whom?] in the media for selling jeans on interest-free credit, due to the global recession.[30][31] In 2010, the company partnered with Filson, an outdoor-goods manufacturer in Seattle, to produce a high-end line of jackets and workwear.[32]
On May 8, 2013, the NFL's San Francisco 49ers announced that Levi Strauss & Co. had purchased the naming rights to their new stadium in Santa Clara, California. The naming-rights deal called for Levi's to pay $220.3 million to the city of Santa Clara and to the 49ers over twenty years, with an option to extend the deal for another five years for around $75 million.[33] As of 2016[update], Levi Strauss Signature jeans sell at several[quantify] stores in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.
Cultural impact[edit]
Levi's has been worn by people from all walks of life, from miners to Nobel Prize recipients including Albert Einstein himself, whose famous leather jacket was made by Levi Strauss & Co in the 30's and has recently been sold at auction house Christies for £110,500.[34]
Corporate structure and staff[edit]




Levi's Plaza, corporate headquarters


Levi Strauss & Co. is a worldwide corporation organized into three geographic divisions: Levi Strauss Americas (LSA), headquartered in San Francisco; Levi Strauss Europe (LSE), based in Brussels; and Levi Strauss Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa (LSAMA), based in Singapore. The company employs a staff of approximately 16,000 people worldwide.
Current products[edit]
Products include jeans, trousers, shorts, shirts, jackets, sweaters, sweatshirts, T-shirts, underwear,socks, accessories, shoes, dresses, skirts, belts, overalls, jumpsuits and a "big and tall" range. Jeans are categorised by fit as: skinny, slim, straight, bootcut, taper, relaxed, flare and big & tall. Most of the adult denim jeans are identifiable by trademarked three digit style numbers. 501s are available in styles for both men and women, the rest of the 500 series are marketed for men and the 300, 400, 700, and 800 series for women, with the exception of 751s which are classic straight zip fly jeans.[35]

Levi's marketing has often made use of old recordings of popular music in television commercials, ranging from traditional pop to punk rock. Notable examples include Ben E King ("Stand By Me"), Percy Sledge ("When a Man Loves a Woman"), Eddie Cochran ("C'mon Everybody!"), The Ronettes ("Be My Baby"), Marc Bolan ("20th Century Boy"), Screamin' Jay Hawkins ("Heart Attack & Vine"), The Clash ("Should I Stay or Should I Go?").
Many of these songs were re-released by their record labels as a tie-in with the ad campaigns, resulting in increased popularity and sales of the recordings and the creation of iconic visual associations with the music, such as the use of a topless male model wearing jeans underwater in the 1986 adverts featuring "Wonderful World" and "Mad about the Boy" and the puppet, Flat Eric, in the ads featuring music by Mr. Oizo.

David Bergen, Levi's senior vice president and CIO, says his company is caught in the "jaws of death." "We're getting squeezed," he says in his office in Levi's Plaza, which has a startling view of San Francisco Bay and is about a 30-minute walk away from the Post Street store. But Levi's thinks it may have found a way to cheat a retail demise. Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, is where moms go to stock up on Max and Maddy's school supplies, their juice boxes and, of course, their jeans. So if you want the kids, and the rest of their families, you need to sell at Wal-Mart. And you need a new product for this new customer. This month, Levi's is introducing its new, less expensive Signature jeans line. (The jeans, for men, women and children, sell for around $23. They have fewer detail finishes than Levi's other lines. They don't have the company's trademark red tab or stitching on the pocket.) Of course, there's something in it for Wal-Mart. The company, already the largest clothing retailer in the world, wants more affluent customers. To lure them in, it needs big brands. Acknowledging that the company's customers come from a "cross-section of income levels and lifestyles", Wal-Mart Senior Vice President Lois Mikita says the company "continues to tailor its selection to meet the needs of those customers".

As part of Levi's continuing move to cut costs by unloading what little in- house manufacturing it still does, the company said yesterday that it will close six U.S. plants by October. That will leave just two Levi plants operating on U.S. soil, both located in San Antonio. Levi Strauss & Co.'s 96-year-old Valencia Street plant will close by summer, perhaps becoming a museum but definitely staying in company hands even after its production lights go out, its stewards said....

Levi Strauss & Co. /ˌliːvaɪ ˈstraʊs/ is a privately owned American clothing company known worldwide for its Levi's /ˌliːvaɪz/ brand of denim jeans. It was founded in May 1853[4] when Levi Strauss came from Buttenheim, Bavaria, to San Francisco, California to open a west coast branch of his brothers' New York dry goods business.[5] The company's corporate headquarters is located in the Levi's Plaza in San Francisco.[6]

History[edit]
Origin and formation (1853–1890s)[edit]
Levi Strauss started the business at the 90 Sacramento Street address in San Francisco. He next moved the location to 62 Sacramento Street then 63 & 65 Sacramento Street.[citation needed] Jacob Davis, a Latvian Jewish immigrant, was a Reno, Nevada [7] tailor who frequently purchased bolts of cloth made from denim from Levi Strauss & Co.'s wholesale house. After one of Davis' customers kept purchasing cloth to reinforce torn pants, he had an idea to use copper rivets to reinforce the points of strain, such as on the pocket corners and at the base of the button fly.[8] Davis did not have the required money to purchase a patent, so he wrote to Strauss suggesting that they go into business together. After Levi accepted Jacob's offer, on May 20, 1873, the two men received U.S. Patent 139,121 from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The patented rivet was later incorporated into the company's jean design and advertisements. Contrary to an advertising campaign suggesting that Levi Strauss sold his first jeans to gold miners during the California Gold Rush (which peaked in 1849), the manufacturing of denim overalls only began in the 1870s. The company created their first pair of Levis 501 Jeans in the 1890s.
Growth in popularity (1910s–1950s)[edit]

Modern jeans began to appear in the 1920s, but sales were largely confined to the working people of the western United States, such as cowboys, lumberjacks, and railroad workers. Levi’s jeans apparently were first introduced to the East during the dude ranch craze of the 1930s, when vacationing Easterners returned home with tales (and usually examples) of the hard-wearing pants with rivets. Another boost came in World War II, when blue jeans were declared an essential commodity and were sold only to people engaged in defense work.
Between the 1950s and 1980s, Levi's jeans became popular among a wide range of youth subcultures, including greasers, mods, rockers, and hippies. Levi's popular shrink-to-fit 501s were sold in a unique sizing arrangement; the indicated size referred to the size of the jeans prior to shrinking, and the shrinkage was substantial.[9] The company still produces these unshrunk, uniquely sized jeans, and they are still Levi's number one selling product. Although popular lore (abetted by company marketing) holds that the original design remains unaltered, this is not the case: the crotch rivet and waist cinch were removed during World War II to conform to War Production Board requirements to conserve metal, and was not replaced after the war. Additionally, the back pocket rivets, which had been covered in denim since 1937, were removed completely in the 1950s due to complaints they scratched furniture.[10] From a company with fifteen salespeople, two plants, and almost no business east of the Mississippi in 1946, the organization grew in thirty years to include a sales force of more than 22,000, with 50 plants and offices in 35 countries.[11]

From the early 1960s through the mid-1970s, Levi Strauss experienced significant growth in its business as the more casual look of the 1960s and 1970s ushered in the "blue jeans craze" and served as a catalyst for the brand. Levi's, under the leadership of Walter Haas, Peter Haas Sr., Paul Glasco and George P. Simpkins Sr., expanded the firm's clothing line by adding new fashions and models, including stone-washed jeans through the acquisition of Great Western Garment Co. (GWG), a Canadian clothing manufacturer acquired by Levi's. The acquisition led to the introduction of the modern "stone washing" technique, still in use by Levi Strauss. Simpkins is credited with the company's record-paced expansion of its manufacturing capacity from 16 plants to more than 63 plants in the United States from 1964 to 1974 and 23 overseas. Levi's' expansion under Simpkins was accomplished without a single unionized employee as a result of Levi's' and the Haas family's strong stance on human rights and Simpkins' use of "pay for performance" manufacturing from the sewing machine operator level up. As a result, Levi's' plants were perhaps the highest performing, best organized and cleanest textile facilities of their time.
In the 1980s, The company closed around 60 of its manifacturing plants because of financial difficulties and strong competition from competitors.[12]
The Dockers brand, launched in 1986 and which is sold largely through department store chains, helped the company grow through the mid-1990s, as denim sales began to fade. Dockers were introduced into Europe in 1996 and led by CEO Jorge Bardina. Levi Strauss attempted to sell the Dockers division in 2004 to relieve part of the company's $2.6 billion outstanding debt.
Brand competition (1990s)[edit]




Levi's 506 inside


By the 1990s, Levi's faced competition from other brands and cheaper products from overseas, and began accelerating the pace of its US factory-closures and its use of offshore subcontracting agreements. In 1991, Levi Strauss became implicated in a scandal involving pants made in the Northern Mariana Islands: some 3% of Levi's jeans sold annually with the Made in the USA label were shown[by whom?] to have been made by Chinese laborers under what the United States Department of Labor called "slavelike" conditions. As of 2016[update], most Levi's jeans are made outside the US, though a few of the higher-end, more expensive styles are still made in the U.S.
Cited for sub-minimum wages, seven-day work weeks with 12-hour shifts, poor living conditions and other indignities, Tan Holdings Corporation, Levi Strauss' Marianas subcontractor, paid what were then the largest fines in U.S. labor history, distributing more than $9 million in restitution to some 1,200 employees.[13][14][15] Levi Strauss claimed no knowledge of the offenses, then severed ties to the Tan family and instituted labor reforms and inspection practices in its offshore facilities.
The activist group Fuerza Unida (United Force) formed following the January 1990 closure of a plant in San Antonio, Texas, in which 1,150 seamstresses, some of whom had worked for Levi Strauss for decades, saw their jobs exported to Costa Rica.[16] During the mid- and late-1990s, Fuerza Unida picketed the Levi Strauss headquarters in San Francisco and staged hunger strikes and sit-ins in protest at the company's labor policies.[17][18][19]
The company took on multibillion-dollar debt in February 1996 to help finance a series of leveraged stock buyouts among family members. Shares in Levi Strauss stock are not publicly traded; the firm as of 2016[update] is owned almost entirely by indirect descendants and collateral relatives of Levi Strauss, whose four nephews inherited the San Francisco dry-goods firm after their uncle's death in 1902.[20] The corporation's bonds are traded publicly, as are shares of the company's Japanese affiliate, Levi Strauss Japan K.K.
In June 1996, the company offered to pay its workers an unusual dividend of up to $750 million in six years' time, having halted an employee-stock plan at the time of the internal family buyout. However, the company failed to make cash-flow targets, and no worker dividends were paid.[21]
Recent developments (2000–present)[edit]

In 2002, Levi Strauss began a close business collaboration with Walmart, producing a special line of "Signature" jeans and other clothes for exclusive sale in Walmart stores until 2006.[22] Levi Strauss leads the apparel industry in trademark infringement cases, filing nearly 100 lawsuits against competitors since 2001.[23] Most cases center on the alleged imitation of Levi's back pocket double arc stitching pattern (U.S. trademark #1,139,254), which Levi filed for trademark in 1978.[24] Levi's has successfully sued Guess?, Polo Ralph Lauren, Esprit Holdings, Zegna, Zumiez, and Lucky Brand Jeans, among other companies.[23]
In 2002, the company closed its Valencia Street plant in San Francisco, which had opened the same year of the city's April 1906 earthquake.[25][26] By the end of 2003, the closure of Levi's last U.S. factory in San Antonio ended 150 years of jeans made in the USA. Production of a few higher-end, more expensive styles of jeans resumed in the US several years later.[26]
By 2007, Levi Strauss was again profitable after declining sales in nine of the previous ten years.[27] Its total annual sales, of just over $4 billion, were $3 billion less than during its peak performance[26] in the mid-1990s.[28] After more than two decades of family ownership, rumors of a possible public stock offering were floated[by whom?] in the media in July 2007.[29] In 2009, it was noted[by whom?] in the media for selling jeans on interest-free credit, due to the global recession.[30][31] In 2010, the company partnered with Filson, an outdoor-goods manufacturer in Seattle, to produce a high-end line of jackets and workwear.[32]
On May 8, 2013, the NFL's San Francisco 49ers announced that Levi Strauss & Co. had purchased the naming rights to their new stadium in Santa Clara, California. The naming-rights deal called for Levi's to pay $220.3 million to the city of Santa Clara and to the 49ers over twenty years, with an option to extend the deal for another five years for around $75 million.[33] As of 2016[update], Levi Strauss Signature jeans sell at several[quantify] stores in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.
Cultural impact[edit]
Levi's has been worn by people from all walks of life, from miners to Nobel Prize recipients including Albert Einstein himself, whose famous leather jacket was made by Levi Strauss & Co in the 30's and has recently been sold at auction house Christies for £110,500.[34]
Corporate structure and staff[edit]




Levi's Plaza, corporate headquarters


Levi Strauss & Co. is a worldwide corporation organized into three geographic divisions: Levi Strauss Americas (LSA), headquartered in San Francisco; Levi Strauss Europe (LSE), based in Brussels; and Levi Strauss Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa (LSAMA), based in Singapore. The company employs a staff of approximately 16,000 people worldwide.
Current products[edit]
Products include jeans, trousers, shorts, shirts, jackets, sweaters, sweatshirts, T-shirts, underwear,socks, accessories, shoes, dresses, skirts, belts, overalls, jumpsuits and a "big and tall" range. Jeans are categorised by fit as: skinny, slim, straight, bootcut, taper, relaxed, flare and big & tall. Most of the adult denim jeans are identifiable by trademarked three digit style numbers. 501s are available in styles for both men and women, the rest of the 500 series are marketed for men and the 300, 400, 700, and 800 series for women, with the exception of 751s which are classic straight zip fly jeans.[35]

Levi's marketing has often made use of old recordings of popular music in television commercials, ranging from traditional pop to punk rock. Notable examples include Ben E King ("Stand By Me"), Percy Sledge ("When a Man Loves a Woman"), Eddie Cochran ("C'mon Everybody!"), The Ronettes ("Be My Baby"), Marc Bolan ("20th Century Boy"), Screamin' Jay Hawkins ("Heart Attack & Vine"), The Clash ("Should I Stay or Should I Go?").
Many of these songs were re-released by their record labels as a tie-in with the ad campaigns, resulting in increased popularity and sales of the recordings and the creation of iconic visual associations with the music, such as the use of a topless male model wearing jeans underwater in the 1986 adverts featuring "Wonderful World" and "Mad about the Boy" and the puppet, Flat Eric, in the ads featuring music by Mr. Oizo.

David Bergen, Levi's senior vice president and CIO, says his company is caught in the "jaws of death." "We're getting squeezed," he says in his office in Levi's Plaza, which has a startling view of San Francisco Bay and is about a 30-minute walk away from the Post Street store. But Levi's thinks it may have found a way to cheat a retail demise. Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, is where moms go to stock up on Max and Maddy's school supplies, their juice boxes and, of course, their jeans. So if you want the kids, and the rest of their families, you need to sell at Wal-Mart. And you need a new product for this new customer. This month, Levi's is introducing its new, less expensive Signature jeans line. (The jeans, for men, women and children, sell for around $23. They have fewer detail finishes than Levi's other lines. They don't have the company's trademark red tab or stitching on the pocket.) Of course, there's something in it for Wal-Mart. The company, already the largest clothing retailer in the world, wants more affluent customers. To lure them in, it needs big brands. Acknowledging that the company's customers come from a "cross-section of income levels and lifestyles", Wal-Mart Senior Vice President Lois Mikita says the company "continues to tailor its selection to meet the needs of those customers".

As part of Levi's continuing move to cut costs by unloading what little in- house manufacturing it still does, the company said yesterday that it will close six U.S. plants by October. That will leave just two Levi plants operating on U.S. soil, both located in San Antonio. Levi Strauss & Co.'s 96-year-old Valencia Street plant will close by summer, perhaps becoming a museum but definitely staying in company hands even after its production lights go out, its stewards said....

Levi Strauss & Co. /ˌliːvaɪ ˈstraʊs/ is a privately owned American clothing company known worldwide for its Levi's /ˌliːvaɪz/ brand of denim jeans. It was founded in May 1853[4] when Levi Strauss came from Buttenheim, Bavaria, to San Francisco, California to open a west coast branch of his brothers' New York dry goods business.[5] The company's corporate headquarters is located in the Levi's Plaza in San Francisco.[6]

History[edit]
Origin and formation (1853–1890s)[edit]
Levi Strauss started the business at the 90 Sacramento Street address in San Francisco. He next moved the location to 62 Sacramento Street then 63 & 65 Sacramento Street.[citation needed] Jacob Davis, a Latvian Jewish immigrant, was a Reno, Nevada [7] tailor who frequently purchased bolts of cloth made from denim from Levi Strauss & Co.'s wholesale house. After one of Davis' customers kept purchasing cloth to reinforce torn pants, he had an idea to use copper rivets to reinforce the points of strain, such as on the pocket corners and at the base of the button fly.[8] Davis did not have the required money to purchase a patent, so he wrote to Strauss suggesting that they go into business together. After Levi accepted Jacob's offer, on May 20, 1873, the two men received U.S. Patent 139,121 from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The patented rivet was later incorporated into the company's jean design and advertisements. Contrary to an advertising campaign suggesting that Levi Strauss sold his first jeans to gold miners during the California Gold Rush (which peaked in 1849), the manufacturing of denim overalls only began in the 1870s. The company created their first pair of Levis 501 Jeans in the 1890s.
Growth in popularity (1910s–1950s)[edit]

Modern jeans began to appear in the 1920s, but sales were largely confined to the working people of the western United States, such as cowboys, lumberjacks, and railroad workers. Levi’s jeans apparently were first introduced to the East during the dude ranch craze of the 1930s, when vacationing Easterners returned home with tales (and usually examples) of the hard-wearing pants with rivets. Another boost came in World War II, when blue jeans were declared an essential commodity and were sold only to people engaged in defense work.
Between the 1950s and 1980s, Levi's jeans became popular among a wide range of youth subcultures, including greasers, mods, rockers, and hippies. Levi's popular shrink-to-fit 501s were sold in a unique sizing arrangement; the indicated size referred to the size of the jeans prior to shrinking, and the shrinkage was substantial.[9] The company still produces these unshrunk, uniquely sized jeans, and they are still Levi's number one selling product. Although popular lore (abetted by company marketing) holds that the original design remains unaltered, this is not the case: the crotch rivet and waist cinch were removed during World War II to conform to War Production Board requirements to conserve metal, and was not replaced after the war. Additionally, the back pocket rivets, which had been covered in denim since 1937, were removed completely in the 1950s due to complaints they scratched furniture.[10] From a company with fifteen salespeople, two plants, and almost no business east of the Mississippi in 1946, the organization grew in thirty years to include a sales force of more than 22,000, with 50 plants and offices in 35 countries.[11]

From the early 1960s through the mid-1970s, Levi Strauss experienced significant growth in its business as the more casual look of the 1960s and 1970s ushered in the "blue jeans craze" and served as a catalyst for the brand. Levi's, under the leadership of Walter Haas, Peter Haas Sr., Paul Glasco and George P. Simpkins Sr., expanded the firm's clothing line by adding new fashions and models, including stone-washed jeans through the acquisition of Great Western Garment Co. (GWG), a Canadian clothing manufacturer acquired by Levi's. The acquisition led to the introduction of the modern "stone washing" technique, still in use by Levi Strauss. Simpkins is credited with the company's record-paced expansion of its manufacturing capacity from 16 plants to more than 63 plants in the United States from 1964 to 1974 and 23 overseas. Levi's' expansion under Simpkins was accomplished without a single unionized employee as a result of Levi's' and the Haas family's strong stance on human rights and Simpkins' use of "pay for performance" manufacturing from the sewing machine operator level up. As a result, Levi's' plants were perhaps the highest performing, best organized and cleanest textile facilities of their time.
In the 1980s, The company closed around 60 of its manifacturing plants because of financial difficulties and strong competition from competitors.[12]
The Dockers brand, launched in 1986 and which is sold largely through department store chains, helped the company grow through the mid-1990s, as denim sales began to fade. Dockers were introduced into Europe in 1996 and led by CEO Jorge Bardina. Levi Strauss attempted to sell the Dockers division in 2004 to relieve part of the company's $2.6 billion outstanding debt.
Brand competition (1990s)[edit]




Levi's 506 inside


By the 1990s, Levi's faced competition from other brands and cheaper products from overseas, and began accelerating the pace of its US factory-closures and its use of offshore subcontracting agreements. In 1991, Levi Strauss became implicated in a scandal involving pants made in the Northern Mariana Islands: some 3% of Levi's jeans sold annually with the Made in the USA label were shown[by whom?] to have been made by Chinese laborers under what the United States Department of Labor called "slavelike" conditions. As of 2016[update], most Levi's jeans are made outside the US, though a few of the higher-end, more expensive styles are still made in the U.S.
Cited for sub-minimum wages, seven-day work weeks with 12-hour shifts, poor living conditions and other indignities, Tan Holdings Corporation, Levi Strauss' Marianas subcontractor, paid what were then the largest fines in U.S. labor history, distributing more than $9 million in restitution to some 1,200 employees.[13][14][15] Levi Strauss claimed no knowledge of the offenses, then severed ties to the Tan family and instituted labor reforms and inspection practices in its offshore facilities.
The activist group Fuerza Unida (United Force) formed following the January 1990 closure of a plant in San Antonio, Texas, in which 1,150 seamstresses, some of whom had worked for Levi Strauss for decades, saw their jobs exported to Costa Rica.[16] During the mid- and late-1990s, Fuerza Unida picketed the Levi Strauss headquarters in San Francisco and staged hunger strikes and sit-ins in protest at the company's labor policies.[17][18][19]
The company took on multibillion-dollar debt in February 1996 to help finance a series of leveraged stock buyouts among family members. Shares in Levi Strauss stock are not publicly traded; the firm as of 2016[update] is owned almost entirely by indirect descendants and collateral relatives of Levi Strauss, whose four nephews inherited the San Francisco dry-goods firm after their uncle's death in 1902.[20] The corporation's bonds are traded publicly, as are shares of the company's Japanese affiliate, Levi Strauss Japan K.K.
In June 1996, the company offered to pay its workers an unusual dividend of up to $750 million in six years' time, having halted an employee-stock plan at the time of the internal family buyout. However, the company failed to make cash-flow targets, and no worker dividends were paid.[21]
Recent developments (2000–present)[edit]

In 2002, Levi Strauss began a close business collaboration with Walmart, producing a special line of "Signature" jeans and other clothes for exclusive sale in Walmart stores until 2006.[22] Levi Strauss leads the apparel industry in trademark infringement cases, filing nearly 100 lawsuits against competitors since 2001.[23] Most cases center on the alleged imitation of Levi's back pocket double arc stitching pattern (U.S. trademark #1,139,254), which Levi filed for trademark in 1978.[24] Levi's has successfully sued Guess?, Polo Ralph Lauren, Esprit Holdings, Zegna, Zumiez, and Lucky Brand Jeans, among other companies.[23]
In 2002, the company closed its Valencia Street plant in San Francisco, which had opened the same year of the city's April 1906 earthquake.[25][26] By the end of 2003, the closure of Levi's last U.S. factory in San Antonio ended 150 years of jeans made in the USA. Production of a few higher-end, more expensive styles of jeans resumed in the US several years later.[26]
By 2007, Levi Strauss was again profitable after declining sales in nine of the previous ten years.[27] Its total annual sales, of just over $4 billion, were $3 billion less than during its peak performance[26] in the mid-1990s.[28] After more than two decades of family ownership, rumors of a possible public stock offering were floated[by whom?] in the media in July 2007.[29] In 2009, it was noted[by whom?] in the media for selling jeans on interest-free credit, due to the global recession.[30][31] In 2010, the company partnered with Filson, an outdoor-goods manufacturer in Seattle, to produce a high-end line of jackets and workwear.[32]
On May 8, 2013, the NFL's San Francisco 49ers announced that Levi Strauss & Co. had purchased the naming rights to their new stadium in Santa Clara, California. The naming-rights deal called for Levi's to pay $220.3 million to the city of Santa Clara and to the 49ers over twenty years, with an option to extend the deal for another five years for around $75 million.[33] As of 2016[update], Levi Strauss Signature jeans sell at several[quantify] stores in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.
Cultural impact[edit]
Levi's has been worn by people from all walks of life, from miners to Nobel Prize recipients including Albert Einstein himself, whose famous leather jacket was made by Levi Strauss & Co in the 30's and has recently been sold at auction house Christies for £110,500.[34]
Corporate structure and staff[edit]




Levi's Plaza, corporate headquarters

The company employs a staff of approximately 16,000 people worldwide.
Current products[edit]

Jeans are categorised by fit as: skinny, slim, straight, bootcut, taper, relaxed, flare and big & tall. Most of the adult denim jeans are identifiable by trademarked three digit style numbers. 501s are available in styles for both men and women, the rest of the 500 series are marketed for men and the 300, 400, 700, and 800 series for women, with the exception of 751s which are classic straight zip fly jeans.[35]

Levi's marketing has often made use of old recordings of popular music in television commercials, ranging from traditional pop to punk rock. Notable examples include Ben E King ("Stand By Me"), Percy Sledge ("When a Man Loves a Woman"), Eddie Cochran ("C'mon Everybody!"), The Ronettes ("Be My Baby"), Marc Bolan ("20th Century Boy"), Screamin' Jay Hawkins ("Heart Attack & Vine"), The Clash ("Should I Stay or Should I Go?").
Many of these songs were re-released by their record labels as a tie-in with the ad campaigns, resulting in increased popularity and sales of the recordings and the creation of iconic visual associations with the music, such as the use of a topless male model wearing jeans underwater in the 1986 adverts featuring "Wonderful World" and "Mad about the Boy" and the puppet, Flat Eric, in the ads featuring music by Mr. Oizo.

David Bergen, Levi's senior vice president and CIO, says his company is caught in the "jaws of death." "We're getting squeezed," he says in his office in Levi's Plaza, which has a startling view of San Francisco Bay and is about a 30-minute walk away from the Post Street store. But Levi's thinks it may have found a way to cheat a retail demise. Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, is where moms go to stock up on Max and Maddy's school supplies, their juice boxes and, of course, their jeans. So if you want the kids, and the rest of their families, you need to sell at Wal-Mart. And you need a new product for this new customer. This month, Levi's is introducing its new, less expensive Signature jeans line. (The jeans, for men, women and children, sell for around $23. They have fewer detail finishes than Levi's other lines. They don't have the company's trademark red tab or stitching on the pocket.) Of course, there's something in it for Wal-Mart. The company, already the largest clothing retailer in the world, wants more affluent customers. To lure them in, it needs big brands. Acknowledging that the company's customers come from a "cross-section of income levels and lifestyles", Wal-Mart Senior Vice President Lois Mikita says the company "continues to tailor its selection to meet the needs of those customers".

As part of Levi's continuing move to cut costs by unloading what little in- house manufacturing it still does, the company said yesterday that it will close six U.S. plants by October. That will leave just two Levi plants operating on U.S. soil, both located in San Antonio. Levi Strauss & Co.'s 96-year-old Valencia Street plant will close by summer, perhaps becoming a museum but definitely staying in company hands even after its production lights go out, its stewards said....

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

About Levi's


The iconic Levi’s® jean comes from a time-tested tradition of tough, durable workwear. Originally founded as a dry goods company supplying the miners, pioneers, and farmers through the Gold Rush and settling of California, Levi Strauss & Co. introduced their patented rivet process, evolving the blue jean from a standard piece of frontier gear into the timeless, versatile piece that is a staple of every modern wardrobe.
Generations have passed between the company’s establishment and the present day, but some things remain the same – durable, resilient denim, and the 501® Original Fit jean. The men’s collection has always provided the perfect fit for whatever style you’re seeking. Whether you’re looking for a modern straight leg, timeless bootcut, a scene-stealing slim or skinny, or a more contemporary, tapered cut, the 500 series has the right fit for your style. When you’re looking for a more dialed-in, personalized look, the 501® Shrink-To-Fit, along with the wide selection of button-down shirts, sweatshirts and hoodies, and trucker, insulated, and jean jackets are there to finish off your kit.
The Levi’s® women’s collection is an expansive curation of signature fits that cater to an endless variety of silhouettes. The Lot 700 collection offers a stunning variety of chic, fashion-forward jeans in skinny, slim, and bootcut fits. The 300 Series hugs curves and perfectly complements silhouettes with shaping leggings, skinny jeans, and bootcuts. Ladies, you get your own 501® Original featuring a score of subtle, modern updates for a boyfriend look, while jean jackets, classic, trucker, moto, and military field jackets, pieces round out the collection.
With an eye for the future, LS&Co fills out their collection with a footwear series that perfectly complements the classic look of their jeans. If you’re looking for sneakers, there’s a wide selection of vulcanized, cap-toe sneakers, canvas plimsolls, and high tops. If you’re interested in something a little burlier, there’s a wide assortment of workwear, military, moc-toe and Chelsea boots that round out the footwear collection.
Like the iconic two-horse trademark image implies, Levi’s® are built tough enough to last the punishment you can put them through, and still stand the test of time and of style.

I love the look of this jacket and the fit. I am 5'9" and have trouble finding coats that fit in the arms as well "around." The medium fit nicely without being too baggy. I haven't worn it yet because of the weather. I got the army green and I like the deeper, darker color than most traditional muted greens.

This XXL has a surprisingly short cut. My t-shirt sleeves underneath stick out far past this shirt and it untucks every time I bent over. The picture shows sleeves halfway down biceps, more like top of bicep on me.

Fabulous spring jacket for when you don't need something warm, but it's just a little too chilly to go it alone with a shirt.  Got it for myself but am now having trouble keeping my teenage daughter's grubby paws off it!  I do agree with a previous reviewer that it can be a little tight across the upper arms/back when you reach forward (they probably should have cut it a little more generously or put in a gusset at the back of the arms) but it is so great otherwise that I am willing to forgive it that small issue.

Love this light weight jacket. Will look great with skinny jeans and even shorts for those breezy summer nights. Also having a hood is a plus...just in case. Color is very nice, deep navy. Jacket is true to size.

        Comfort:
        


        Look:
        

Overall, I was really pleased with this item.  The design looks amazing in person, and the lightweight knit of the tank is super comfy on hot days.

Things to note that I thought were hard to see in the photo that I noticed upon opening:

There is a tiny red Levi's tag on the medial side of the chest pocket.  I think it's really noticeable in person, so I removed that.
The shirttail hem means that the front and back parts of the tank are longer, and the sides are shorter.  A little funky, not entirely preferable, but it doesn't bother me too much.  Helps the tank fit more slimly at the waist, which is nice.
There is a seam going down the very middle of your back.  I really dislike this, and it's why I docked a star from style.  There are seams on the sides, so this seam is literally just for show and serves no purpose.  Looks really bad.  Fortunately the bolder design hides it a bit.

I have had this jacket now for 6 weeks and I love it!  I am a size 6 to 8, 5'6" tall.  I tried S and M but stuck with the M which is comfy and roomy enough.  It is perfect for walking the dog.  There are so many pockets for my phone, doggie bags, keys, treats, etc. The color is a rich green khaki and goes with everything.  I love the hood because it is light weight, a generous size, and perfect if it starts to rain.  I hardly ever take the time to write reviews -- so this truly is a winner!  I am thinking of purchasing a second one - put it away for the day this one wears out!

        Look:
        

This is a cute jacket and the Olive green is so pretty. I sized down based on others' reviews saying it ran large, but still found it a little bit tight in the shoulders. If I wore a long sleeve shirt that would've been a little too tight in the sleeves. I really liked all of the pockets but wish that the jacket was lined up as well so that It was a little warmer. The roll up sleeves were a plus with cute lining and the drawstring allowed you to accentuate your waist and not make it so baggy. I would have never paid the original $150 that this jacket cost though.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
