                    Michael DePasquale Featured on Podcast's Interview of the Week
                    



                    BIO-key Chairman and CEO Michael DePasquale was recently featured as Biometric Authentication's Interview of the Week. During the interview, he discusses a range of topics including BIO-key's history, standards for security, and the role of biometric authentication in our changing world. Listen in and learn more about the real-world applications of this rapidly growing industry!
                  






















                    March 20th, 2017       
                  


                    Meet the “Biometric of Things” or BoT
                    



                    A few years ago, the company exited the business of providing biometric technology for law enforcement to focus on the broader enterprise business opportunity. That’s right, long before Apple embedded a fingerprint sensor on the iPhone, BIO-key envisioned a world where both the enterprise and consumers would find practical applications for fingerprint technology....
                  






















                    March 6th, 2017       
                  


                    More Bad News for Password Security...
                    



                    According to a new survey of 1,000 respondents by Keeper Security, more than 80 percent of folks ages 18 and up reuse the same password across multiple accounts...
                  






















                    February 22th, 2017       
                  


                    Frost & Sullivan is predicting a significant boom of biometrics in the automotive industry
                    



                   In a statement announcing its new report, “Biometrics in the Global Automotive Industry, 2016-2025,” the company asserts that advancing biometric technology “will radically transform the driving experience, Health Wellness and Wellbeing (HWW), and security of vehicles by 2025.”...
                  






















                    December 29th, 2016       
                  


                    CES 2017
                    



                   When something is intriguing enough to attract 180,000 people from all over the world there must be something to it. Take a moment to think about the town that you grew up in and ask yourself what the population was? In my case the answer is 26,000, then imagine “everyone” in town attending the 4th of July barbeque? It would be insane.  Next, picture making 180,000 hamburgers for a much larger audience which is what CES is expecting this year. A task even too large for White Castle...

BIO-key for Windows | Fingerprint Authentication Software












































              BIO-key is a Microsoft Partner and was the exclusive fingerprint biometric technology company to be included in the national Ignite Your Business enterprise launch of Windows® 10.  BIO-key’s line of compact readers SideSwipe, SideTouch and EcoID all offer plug and play one touch biometric fingerprint sign-in with Windows Hello.








ID Director for Microsoft Active Directory

                BIO-key ID Director for Windows is an advanced fingerprint authentication solution designed to support biometric fingerprint logon to Windows for Microsoft Active Directory domain users.  This technology allows users to enroll their fingerprint biometric credentials into a secure, centralized repository, and authenticate to a Microsoft® domain from any authorized Windows device using their domain username and a fingerprint only, fingerprint + PIN, or fingerprint + domain password, depending upon the security policies enforced for the device. ID Director for Windows supports fingerprint authentication on dedicated workstations as well as shared workstations and kiosks.  Computers may be connected to the corporate network via LAN, WAN, VPN, etc. with access to the authentication servers and domain controllers, or they may authenticate offline using an encrypted local cache, to allow full support for mobile users.
                





Supported Platforms
Users are able to perform authentication with fingerprint readers on all currently supported Windows® operating systems, including Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 devices, as well as Server 2008 R2, Server 2012 R2 and Server 2016.  ID Director for Windows is integrated into Windows as a Credential Provider (CP), which supports the use of fingerprint for primary authentication, as well as other system authentication scenarios where the Windows® Credential Provider is presented to the user for logon to Active Directory. 
                  
                  For example, BIO-key's fingerprint logon will activate when:

Connecting to Remote Desktop Services (Terminal Services)
Running applications that require administrator-level permission required by User Account Control (UAC) settings
Running applications using “Run as Administrator”
Accessing network resources, or any time the Windows Security window is presented
Any Microsoft or custom applications that support or require authentication to Active Directory via the Windows® Credential Provider, such as Microsoft Outlook® and SharePoint®, will prompt for fingerprint authentication.

                Adding a strong layer of fingerprint biometric authentication which not only provides assured identity but also provides a time stamp of each transaction dissuades those with bad intentions.

Typically a rep agency will handle products from many different manufacturers. The key in hiring and engaging a rep agency is finding agencies that have synergy in the product lines they carry, customers, both OEM and user along with complementary products that they handle.   Now that BIO-key is playing in both the OEM, user and consumer market, there may be a need to have two different styles of rep agencies representing the company. One that focuses on OEM and user and the other with that focuses on consumer retail.   The OEM and user rep would typically be charged with developing the industrial and electronic distribution channel, consumer, will develop the retail distribution channel along with the web based sales. They are typically handled very differently.   I continue to struggle with the reason why we have not engaged rep agencies to handle our products. It essentially cost us anywhere between five and 7% of the sale but by doing so you do not need to have a direct sales force expense which would be quite significant for our company. Primarily you use sales management personnel like regional managers to develop the rep agencies and the rep agency develops the sales channels as well as target markets and OEMs. It would be by far the most cost-effective way to take our product to market and develop a wide range of customers opportunities.

BIO-Key: Biometrics' Hidden Gem - BIO-key International, Inc. (OTCMKTS:BKYI) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»BIO-Key: Biometrics' Hidden GemNov.14.14 | About: BIO-key International, (BKYI) Edward Schwartz Long/short equitySummaryBIO-key is poised for growth.BIO-key is an undervalued stock.Leading player in a rapidly growing industry that could lead to explosive growth.BIO-key has multiple quality partnerships.BIO-key International (OTCQB:BKYI) is a leading provider of fingerprint biometric authentication technologies and identity transaction security platforms.
The Bio-key fingerprint algorithm is among the most accurate and fastest available. This was validated by The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (part of the US Dept. of Commerce). NIST is statutorily mandated to verify biometric technologies for performance bench marking and standards compliance.
Bio-key's algorithm is the only fingerprint sensor and operating system agnostic matching algorithm available. This means that it works with any fingerprint sensor, including Idex (NYSE:IEX), Synaptics (NASDAQ:SYNA), Fingerprint Cards (FINGB:SS) and others. It is also inter-operable between operating systems and server architecture. This combination of attributes makes the Bio-key platform more flexible and less expensive to deploy in the market.
Bio-key's patented web-key platform is used to securely release authentication data from the secure zone of a device (eg. Smartphone), to a network environment including the internet or the cloud, where it can be processed more securely than on the device. No other technology enables both on device authentication with any fingerprint sensor and enables identification capabilities in databases that reside in the cloud. As a result, Bio-Key's capabilities are applicable to the entire spectrum of authentication security required by industry stakeholders.
According to the Verizon enterprise services 2013 breach report, 76% of all hacking attempts include the exploitation of weak user authentication technologies. Thus, to solve the rapid rise of hacking experienced by the likes of Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Target (NYSE:TGT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and others, a global upgrade of user authentication technologies has begun. This is evidenced by Apple, Samsung (SNLLF) and other handset manufacturer's adoption of fingerprint technologies in their smart phones.

The Gartner Group has recently placed biometrics in the early stages of what they call a "hype cycle" in the digital banking sector. Their definition of the Digital Banking Hype Cycle is focused on potentially game-changing technologies.
As stated in the Gartner Group, August 4th Digital Banking Hype Cycle Research, Biometric mobile banking authentication is one of the four game changing technologies just beginning the hype cycle as they call it.
"Biometric Mobile Banking Authentication - This describes the reuse of on-device biometric authentication solutions to enable customers to access mobile banking applications and services."
BIO-key's cloud based authentication platform could become the standard as enterprises in banking and healthcare seek to rollout biometrics.
The value proposition
BIO-key is the cheapest way to play the rapid growth in Biometrics. As a software company, it's 85% gross margins give it tremendous operating leverage. This year, based on guidance, BIO-key will generate over 4 million in revenue, nearly double last year. BIO-key is cheap at only 4X sales when compared to other biometric companies such as ImageWare Systems (OTCQB:IWSY), which trades for 30X sales.
When you look at BIO-key's website, you will scratch your head and wonder how this company has less then a $20 million dollar market cap given the abundance of marquis customers and partners. I am going to argue that it is grossly undervalued. One reason for the disconnect is a shareholder base that is so tired of waiting for Biometrics to arrive, while living through dilutive raise after dilutive raise over the last couple of years. Now that it has finally arrived they just don't care. As a shareholder you get so angry with management you only look at the annoying stock price and not what they have actually accomplished in the last couple of years. This is what makes opportunities, the ability to put aside emotion and look at the facts.
So here are the facts:
Revenue, as just reported, for nine months, increased 84% In Q3 the company lost a mere $50K. With gross margins in the eighties, you can see how they become extremely profitable from here if they continue the sales momentum.

Experian partners with BIO-key to use BIO-key's technology in their ID verification for their multiple product lines. Think about that for a minute - EXPERIAN. How many customers does Experian have? And if they roll out Biometrics to only a fraction, what would that mean for BIO-key? Recurring license revenue.
BIO-key's ID Director is pre integrated into Allscripts EHR solutions and sold to healthcare customers such as hospitals, clinics, etc. Add to that Epic, CA, Caradigm and a host of other companies that sell to the hospitals using BIO-key as their biometrics solution. Healthcare industry requirements driven by state mandates, DEA, and HIPAA, as it pertains to Electronic Health Records and E- Prescriptions play right into BIO-key's sweet spot. The industry has only just scraped the surface at keeping pace with these mandates and BIO-key is going to be a direct beneficiary. BIO-key can just focus on the healthcare market, where they are the leader, and create value that is multiples of the current stock price.
IDEX, one of the leading developers of biometric readers to the cell phone market is licensing Biokey's algorithm.
NCR is using Biokey in P.O.S. terminals at Wendy's (NYSE:WEN) and Arby's (which is owned by Wendy's).
IBM resellers are selling Biokey to their customers.
Interdigital (NASDAQ:IDCC), one of the leading IP companies in the wireless industry, has not only invested in BIO-key, but has jointly developed with BIO-key an authentication product for smartphones.
BIO-key has brought on three new Board members, one of which is an executive at Experian. All three have been very active in guiding the company and have instituted the controls and discipline necessary to show more consistent growth.
An open letter by the Board to shareholders in response to an activist proves that the Board is engaged and that there is pressure to increase shareholder value. It also suggests that BIO-key may be a likely takeover candidate. With this type of market cap and the growth potential, it wouldn't surprise me.

Because BIO-key technology is software and not hardware based (like competing technologies) their gross margin is substantially higher, often exceeding 90%.
Thus the company can generate operating profits today, with quarterly revenue above 1.5m according to management.
So, what are the risks? As with any micro cap stock, there's a greater degree of failure. I'm not worried, as the three new board members have a high degree of knowledge and presence in the biometrics field. Furthermore, the new board has instituted tight cost control measures (as reported in the Q3 2014 Financial Results Conference Call). Moreover, the product sales cycle can be a long period of time, so future revenue may appear "lumpy" at times. For those investors who understand the industry, this should not be a problem.

The accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these statements.

A recent capital raise of over $1.4M subsequent to the end of Q3 2014 from existing shareholders has solidified the company's balance sheet. As long as BKYI can produce additional quarterly revenue results at the high end of recent quarterly guidance ($1.7M), I do not anticipate any future need for capital within the next year. As stated in the recent quarterly conference call, BIO-key will increase investment in further research and development and sales and marketing in 2015. I believe that BIO-key will be able to fund this investment from internal growth, and not have to tap the capital markets.
Look for revenue acceleration to begin as the market matures.
