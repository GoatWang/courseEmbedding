Coty Inc., the beauty products and fragrance manufacturer, has won an auction to purchase two related businesses from Procter & Gamble, The Post has learned.
Coty, whose stable of products includes Calvin Klein and Marc Jacobs fragrances and New York Color cosmetics, has also won a third auction — for P&G’s hair-care lines, which includes its Wella brand — that will expand its business into that category, sources familiar with the deal believed.
The value of the three deals could reach $12 billion, sources added. Coty, with a stable of brands, can achieve savings through synergies that other bidders, like private-equity firms, are unable to do.
Coty for years has been acquiring brands waiting for the chance to join the big leagues in the consumer space. Winning the P&G auctions would catapult Coty into a much larger playing field.
“It’s rare you have brands of this size coming to market,” said one banker who knows Coty well.
P&G put the three business lines, including its Max Factor and CoverGirl brands, on the block earlier this year to concentrate on its core operations.
P&G alerted Coty over the weekend that it had won the auction and has begun calling the losing bidders to inform them, sources said, cautioning that the outcomes could still change as the deals weren’t finalized.
Coty, when including debt and equity, is worth $12 billion. It has spoken to bankers in recent days about buying P&G’s divisions through a Reverse Morris Trust, a source said.
Such a move would save P&G from paying capital gains taxes on the deal. Under such a move, P&G would sell just under a majority stake to Coty and let Coty run the combined operations.
P&G tried a similar, tax-free sale of its Pringles brand recently but the deal with Diamond Foods collapsed.
For Coty Chairman and Interim CEO Bart Becht, winning the P&G auction would be something of a homecoming.
Becht held a variety of marketing, sales and finance positions at P&G before becoming CEO of Reckitt Benckiser, a leading British global consumer goods company, from 1995 to 2011.
P&G and Coty both declined comment.

History[edit]
1930s, 1940s and 1950s[edit]
In 1904, François Coty founded Coty in Paris, with a goal to revolutionize the fragrance industry. In 1912, Coty opened subsidiaries in London and New York. Coty, Inc., became a publicly traded company in 1925 and acquired a majority interest in the European Coty companies in 1929.
During the Great Depression, sales in the United States fell from US$50 million in 1929 to $3.5 million in 1933. According to The New York Times, management 'compounded its mounting problems by slashing prices in a desperate effort to gain a mass market ... a near-fatal move in a field in which prestige and the luxury symbol were vital.' With World War II imminent, the foreign companies were folded into the newly created Panama-based Coty International Corporation in 1939. The ownership remained the same, and the two corporations had interlocking directorships.
The ownership transferred from Coty to his ex-wife Yvonne, who had, by then, married Leon Cotnareanu. The management was taken over by the Cotnareanu family and passed on to Philip Cotnareanu, who changed his name to Philip Cortney, over time.
After the Great Depression, Philip secured bank financing to keep Coty going and, in one of his first decisions, raised prices for the entire line. In spite of a long-range program to double the company's retail business, he cut off drugstores carrying Coty products if they would not agree to provide display space of at least 16 feet in length for exclusive stocking of these goods. Production lines were automated, packaging restyled, and new lines of goods added periodically, including, in 1955, a new toilet-goods line for men named 'Preferred Stock'. Research laboratories were established in Morris Plains, New Jersey, and overseas.
In 1946, Coty's first postwar year, sales nearly doubled from the 1941 total, to US$19.1 million, and net profit reached $1.24 million. The company lost money in 1947, however, and, although it returned to profitability, sales stagnated. Fiscal 1955 (the year ended June 30, 1955) was Coty's best postwar year, with net income of $1.61 million on sales of $22.76 million. The firm lost money in fiscal 1957 and 1958, with management blaming the results on the high cost of advertising, which rose from 7% to 16% of sales in this period. Moreover, firms like Revlon, Inc., which reaped huge publicity from its sponsorship of television's The $64,000 Question, seemed to be getting better results for the money. In fiscal 1962, Coty had net income of only $386,985 on sales of $25.46 million. Coty International had a profit of $319,331 on sales of $7.38 million.
1960s and 1970s[edit]
Coty and Coty International were sold in 1963 to Chas. Pfizer & Co. for about US$26 million and became divisions in the pharmaceuticals company's consumer products group. In 1965 Coty introduced Imprevu, its first new perfume in 25 years. This became the leading Coty fragrance by the end of 1968.
Coty and Coty International were united in 1973. Among the new products introduced in the early 1970s were the Styx, Sweet Earth, and Wild Musk fragrances and the Equatone beauty-treatment line. The production facility was moved from New York City to Sanford, North Carolina, at this time. Coty products were being marketed to franchised accounts, including distributors, independent drugstores, mass merchandisers, and department stores. Results were not meeting expectations, however, for the subsidiary was reported to be on the block in 1974 for possibly as little as $20 million—less than Pfizer had paid a decade earlier.
1990s[edit]
Coty was purchased in 1992 by Benckiser Consumer Products, the U.S. arm of a family-owned German household-products giant named Joh. A. Benckiser GmbH (now known as JAB Holding Company).[4] In 1993 Benckiser merged into Coty its Quintessence Inc. unit, which it had acquired the previous year. Coty, Inc., grew into a US$1.5-billion-a-year company in 1996, when Benckiser made its Lancaster Group a Coty division. (The existing Coty, renamed Coty Beauty, became the other division.) Lancaster, founded in Monaco in 1946 and acquired from SmithKline Beecham plc in 1990.
During the year of 1998, 45 percent of the company's sales were in mass fragrances, 24 percent in mass cosmetics, and 31 percent in prestige-market beauty products. Fifty-five percent of sales volume came from Western Europe and 30 percent from North America.
Recent history[edit]
In May 2005, Unilever announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell its global prestige fragrance business, Unilever Cosmetics International (UCI), to Coty, Inc., of the United States.[5] However, several major brands were sold to Elizabeth Arden.
Unilever reportedly received a consideration of US$800 million in cash at the closing, with the opportunity for further deferred payments contingent upon future sales.
The business included the perfume licenses for Calvin Klein, Cerruti, Vera Wang, Chloé and Lagerfeld, as well as a manufacturing and distribution center in Mount Olive, New Jersey, which was later closed in June 2007 as operations were transferred to the existing Coty-Sanford, North Carolina, facility.
Sales for the global prestige fragrance business for 2004 were in excess of $600 million (€490m). In December 2007, Coty announced the acquisition of DLI Holding Corp.[6]
The Calgon and Healing Garden brands were purchased by Ascendia Brands on 9 February 2007.[7]
In August 2009, Coty, Inc., announced that it had entered into a license agreement with global lifestyle brand GUESS?, Inc., to develop and market new GUESS fragrance lines. As part of the partnership, Coty would also distribute existing GUESS fragrances, effective January 2010.[8]
In November 2010, Coty, Inc., announced that Coty has entered into an agreement to acquire philosophy, inc., from the Carlyle group.[9] In early 2011, Coty, Inc., announced that it had officially concluded the acquisitions of Dr. Scheller Cosmetics,[10] OPI Products, Inc.,[11] and TJoy.[12]
In July 2012, Coty, Inc., appointed Michele Scannavini as the new CEO. Scannavini has been president of Coty Prestige for the last 10 years.[13]
On June 13, 2013, Coty, Inc., became a public company via the initial public offering of its Class A shares on the NYSE.[14] Coty raised $1.0 billion in the largest consumer IPO since Arcos Dorados' $1.3 billion IPO in 2011. The company operates in three segments: fragrances, color cosmetics and skin and body care.[15]
In June 2014, Coty discontinued TJoy.[16] On September 29, 2014, Michele Scannavini had stepped down from the CEO position, and Bart Becht named interim CEO.[17]
On July 9, 2015, Coty announced it had reached a definitive agreement to purchase some of Procter & Gamble's beauty brands for $12.5 billion in a deal that would more than double its sales and transform it into one of the world’s largest cosmetics companies.[18]
In October 2015, Coty acquired leading global digital marketing platform Beamly, providing Coty with a step change across digital marketing capabilities [19]
In November 2015, Coty acquired Hypermarcas’ Beauty & Personal Care Business, providing Coty a strong position in Brazilian beauty & personal care market, the third-largest beauty market in the world [20]
In July 2016, Coty named Camillo Pane as CEO and member of the Coty Board, each effective as of the day following the closing of the merger with P&G Specialty Beauty. [21]
In October 2016, Coty completed its merger with P&G Specialty Beauty Business, transforming Coty into one of the world’s leading beauty companies with the number one position in fragrances, and number two and three positions in salon hair and color cosmetics, respectively. [22]
In October 2016, the company confirmed it had reached an agreement with Lion Capital LLP to buy Good Hair Day (GHD), a manufacturer of hair care products, for $522 million in cash. GHD will be run by its existing management team.[23] The sale was completed on 21 November 2016.[24]

Style Scores:



C Value | D Growth | C Momentum | D VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score

VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Best Stocks in Beauty Products: Estee Lauder Companies Inc. and Coty Inc.
Will these two stocks beautify your portfolio?











                Leo Sun
            

                (TMFSunLion)



            
            Sep 29, 2015 at 8:45AM
            
            





Beauty product companies generally aren't known for explosive growth. Yet the industry is a fairly stable and non-cyclical one, which has grown at a pace of 3% to 5% annually over the past four years, according to cosmetics giant L'Oreal. Let's take a look at two of the best stocks in this sector -- Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL) and Coty (NYSE:COTY).
Estee LauderEstee Lauder's portfolio includes well-known brands like Aveda, Donna Karan, MAC, Bobbi Brown, Clinique, La Mer, and various licensed products for fashion houses.

Source: Estee Lauder.
In fiscal 2015, Estee Lauder's revenue declined 2% annually to $10.8 billion, net earnings fell 9% to $1.09 billion, and diluted earnings per share dropped 8% to $2.82. That doesn't sound great, but those declines were mainly caused by foreign currency fluctuations, since 58% of Estee Lauder's revenue came from outside the Americas. Excluding currency impacts, sales actually rose 3%, and diluted earnings remained flat. Stripping out the impact of accelerated orders and one-time charges, sales and diluted earnings would have respectively risen 6% and 12% over the year -- not bad for a mature personal products company. The company also pays a forward annual dividend yield of 1.2%.
Estee Lauder's business is split into four main categories: makeup, fragrances, hair care products, and skin care products. In 2015, sales from the first three categories rose annually on a constant currency basis, but skin care sales slipped 2%. Skin care weakness has been an ongoing issue over the past few quarters, especially with its smaller and mid-sized brands overtaking sales of its flagship Estee Lauder and Clinique brands, which have broader distribution channels. Slower department stores sales in the U.S. and China, which recently lowered its import taxes on skin care products, also weighed down sales.





Despite its skin care struggles, Estee Lauder remains a "best in breed" stock in the beauty products industry, and its growth should return once the dollar cools off. The stock has risen about 7% over the past 12 months, easily outperforming the S&P 500's 3% decline. However, the stock isn't cheap at 28 times earnings, which is significantly higher than the industry average of 23 for the personal products sector, so investors should probably keep this one on their watchlists for now.
CotyInvestors looking for a more aggressive investment than Estee Lauder should check out Coty, which has rallied nearly 60% over the past 12 months. Coty produces fragrances, color cosmetics, and skin care products, which are sold under licensed brands. Its top brands include Calvin Klein, Chloe, Davidoff, Marc Jacobs, Adidas, and Playboy.

Source: Coty.
In fiscal 2015, Coty's revenues declined 3% annually to $4.4 billion, but remained flat on a like-for-like basis (which only includes activities which were in effect during both periods). Excluding currency impacts, revenue -- 60% of which came from outside the Americas -- rose 2%. Coty's adjusted net income rose 14% to $360 million.





During the year, sales of Coty's color cosmetics, which accounted for a third of its top line, rose 12% annually on a constant currency basis. Sales of fragrances and skin/body care products, which accounted for the rest, both declined by single digits. 
Coty plans to fill in those gaps by buying Procter & Gamble's (NYSE:PG) perfume, hair care, and cosmetic businesses in a massive $12.5 billion merger. After that deal closes next year, Coty will overtake L'Oreal as the biggest perfume maker in the world, and become the third largest makeup company behind L'Oreal and Estee Lauder. It would gain the perfume licenses of Gucci, Hugo Boss, and Dolce & Gabbana, along with the Cover Girl and Max Factor make-up brands. The new company would more than double its size and generate annual revenues exceeding $10 billion. The merger would result in $550 million in savings, but Coty must assume P&G Beauty's $2.9 billion in debt. 
Even as it evolves into a much larger company, Coty hasn't forgotten about boosting shareholder value. It announced a new $700 million buyback plan in August, and boosted its dividend by 25% to $0.25 per share in September, which gives it a forward annual yield of 0.9%. Although Coty seems to be evolving into the next L'Oreal or Estee Lauder, it's much pricier than either company, with a trailing P/E of 42. Therefore, investors should keep a close eye on Coty, but be aware that its valuation could limit its upside potential.
The key takeawayEstee Lauder and Coty are two solid ways to invest in beauty products. Both companies have non-cyclical portfolios which hold up well during downturns, as well as strong premium brands to ward off cheaper competitors.





However, investors should be aware of the near-term risks. A strong dollar is bad for both companies, and problems across Europe and Asia could curb spending on premium beauty products. More importantly, neither stock looks cheap compared to the market or other personal care stocks, so we could see lower prices ahead.

Boxes focus on seasonal essentials, so you can get ready for new looks and changing beauty maintenance needs throughout the year.Shopping for makeup onlineBrowsing through the products on our site offers a quick and easy way for you to find new favorites. However, if you aren't sure exactly what color you need to match your skin tone, you may want to pick out a few different options that look like they may work for your skin tone. If free store pickup is an option for your chosen products, you can take a look at the shades in person when you pick them up from the store and complete your return on the options that don't work for your skin tone without having to bring them home.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147349557, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.15.0, SHA-06ca1a9068b558bd33bd1add57a0b13a52090f9f, CID-

These tips can help. Whether you are looking for a quick fix to tighten your skin and reduce the signs of aging or simply for some everyday skincare essential, the selection available at Every Day Low Prices at Walmart makes it easy to find the right kind of product for your skin type. Day and night moisturizers Moisturizer is an essential step in your daily skin-care routine, so you should look for a formula that best suits your skin type. Determine whether your skin is oily, dry, or sensitive as this impacts the way a moisturizer interacts with your skin. Moreover, keep in mind that repetition is essential when it comes to skin care products, so it is important to establish a daily routine. Do your research before buying a moisturizer by reading the labels to find out the active ingredients and what they claim to do for your skin.  If you have sensitive skin, you should always go for products that are hypoallergenic and free from fragrances and dyes. A day moisturizer with a 15-30 SPF range is a good choice for those with fair skin that gets sunburned easily. Consider your age when choosing a night moisturizing cream. A cream with natural ingredients such as honey and aloe vera works well in your 20s, while an anti-wrinkle cream is a good choice in your 40s. cleansers and toners Your skin type is also essential when shopping for cleansers and toners. These products allow you to clean and tone your skin, while also removing your makeup. Our range of cleansers and toners suits various skin types and is often efficient even on waterproof makeup.  The main skin types cleansers and toners are suitable for include oily, dry and sensitive. By using a cleanser followed by a toner, you will enjoy skin that is free from impurities and dead cells while being soft and smooth. Cleansers come in multiple forms, with common types being foam and lotions. The choice is up to what you prefer. Acne and rosacea treatments If you have a long-term skin problem such as acne or rosacea, you need specific products that can address this issue. We stock a wide range of treatment creams and cleansers for these and other skin troubles. Rosacea usually develops on the central portion of the face and requires a gentle, but persistent routine. Wash your face every morning with a gentle cleanser and lukewarm water, and apply an anti-redness treatment cream, followed by sunscreen with SPF 15 or higher. At night, cleanse and moisturize again. Acne skin requires targeted treatment, and it is essential to steer clear of any skin care product that contains menthol, alcohol or fragrance. Opt for skin care that is specifically designed for acne, such as products containing silicone that lock moisture into the skin, and products with natural ingredients that calm the skin. Sun care Prolonged exposure to the sun can be brutal on your skin, so make sure the entire family gets the correct level of protection against the harmful rays. Applying sunscreen and SPF protective lip balm should be a part of your daily routine as the mercury rises. Broad-spectrum sunscreen products protect your skin from both UVA and UVB rays. Remember to apply sunscreen every time you get out of the house in the hot months. Reapply as needed after swimming or exercising. In winter, sunscreen may be needed when skiing or other times you're out in the sun and reflective snow for longer periods of time. Children need extra protection against the rays of sun, so opt for sun care products with a higher SPF that are designed specifically for little ones. Face masks Deep cleansing is essential for your skin regularly, and a face mask is the easiest way to do so at home. Consider your skin s requirements before buying a face mask, paying specific attention to the listed ingredients if you have skin problems. Clay face masks are ideal for giving your skin a deep cleanse. They work well on acne prone skin or on oily complexions because they draw out impurities while soaking up the grease. If you have dry skin, opt for a hydrating mask that comes packed with moisture-active ingredients and soothing agents. Anti-aging masks work well on mature skin, and they often offer a mix of hydration and cell renewal therapy.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147332926, DC-prod-dal1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.15.0, SHA-06ca1a9068b558bd33bd1add57a0b13a52090f9f, CID-

    Coty                           (Designer)   


 








	    					Franois Coty crafted a genius marketing campaign by wrapping a quality product in beautiful packaging at a fair price. This made him a millionaire in 1904 through his first fragrance, La Rose Jaqueminot. 

A native Corsican, Coty studied perfume under a pharmacist. Coty sought to shake the foundations of the industry, and he did just that by partnering with jeweler Rene Lalique to market perfume packaged in ornate bottles. 

One of Coty's early perfumes, L'Origan, was sold in intricate bottles with gilded labels. Coty Inc. was among the first to market these perfumes to middle and working class women. The marketing ploy was a success, skyrocketing the company to international fame. The fragrance that truly placed Coty on the map in 1917 was Chypre, a concoction of oakmoss, bergamot and labdanum. It became a best seller, and it was a perfume other companies sought to emulate. 

Coty's international standing allowed him to set up shop in the United States after World War I, and he established subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Romania. Divorce and the Wall Street Crash of 1929 put a heavy strain on his fortune, and he died in 1934. His former wife sold the company to Pfizer in 1963. Pfizer sold Coty perfumes exclusively through retailers and drug stores until the 1990s. Joh. A. Benckiser GmbH acquired the Coty brand in 1992, operating it under two departments, Coty Prestige and Coty Beauty.
