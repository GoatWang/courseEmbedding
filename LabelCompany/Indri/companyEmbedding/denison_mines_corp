2 Top Uranium Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2017
The price of uranium is far below its peak, but there are reasons to expect it triple in coming years, which could send Cameco Corp. and Denison Mines Corp. shares soaring.











                Matthew DiLallo
            

                (TMFmd19)



            
            Jul 12, 2017 at 7:33PM
            
            





Uranium prices are currently only in the low-$20s per pound, which is a far cry from the $150 per pound that it fetched at its peak a decade ago. That said, a recent report from RBC Capital Markets suggests that better days could lie ahead for the metal's prices. While that rising tide would lift the entire sector, the two uranium stocks that investors should consider buying today with that future in mind are Cameco Corp. (NYSE:CCJ) and Denison Mines Corp. (NYSEMKT:DNN). 
The coming bull run
According to RBC Capital Markets, the price of uranium will likely be relatively range-bound in the near term, generally holding between $20 to $25 per pound over the next two years as the market works through its current supply issues. Beyond that, though, it foresees prices starting to creep up to the $30 to $40 per pound range from 2019 through 2021 due to the impending roll-off of contracts.
Then things get interesting: RBC believes that prices will start to spike after 2021 because the uranium mining industry isn't expected to be producing enough uranium to meet market demand, which should spur the development of new mines. In RBC's view, prices could hit $70 a pound by 2028.

Propelling the rising demand for uranium is the fact that countries continue to build nuclear reactors. In fact, there are currently 57 nuclear reactors under construction around the world, 20 of them in China. Those new reactors will increase that country's nuclear power generating capacity from 35 GWe up to 58 GWe by 2020. The expectation is that as all of these new reactors worldwide come online, it will start driving up the price of uranium. 
The assets to survive and thrive
That looming bull run in prices plays right into the hands of Cameco, which is currently the world's second largest uranium producer. While it has struggled due to the lower prices its production has commanded in recent years, CEO Tim Gitzel had this to say to investors last quarter:

Once the uncertainty clears and uranium demand picks up, we expect prices will move significantly higher, and we will be in the enviable position of being able to respond with expanded capacity at our low-cost, world-class assets. 

These top-tier assets include its McArthur River mine in Canada, the world's largest high-grade uranium mine, which the company estimates has more than 258.1 million pounds of uranium remaining. In addition, Cameco owns a stake in Cigar Lake, where uranium grades are 100 times the world average, and Inkai, which is a significant source of low-cost uranium. In addition, the company has other sites where it has curtailed production due to market conditions, and thus the ability to ramp up output when demand rises. Finally, it has several growth projects in development that it could bring online when conditions permit. All of this makes Cameco a top option for investors seeking to profit from the steady improvement in uranium prices that is likely to occur in the coming years.

Image source: Getty Images.






The long-term bet on higher prices
One of the many mines that Cameco has in development is the Wheeler River project. However, since Cameco only holds a 30% stake in it, investors could capture a much higher reward by going with its developer Denison Mines, which owns a 60% stake that could rise to 66% by the end of next year. While the project is only in the pre-feasibility study phase, it is the largest undeveloped uranium project in the Athabasca Basin of Canada, which is home to both the McArthur River and Cigar Lake mines. If everything goes according to plan, this new mine could start producing by 2025, just in time to catch the expected surge in uranium prices. 
Even if prices don't top $70 a pound in the coming years, Denison Mines could still do very well. It expects that Wheeler River's average production cost would be about $19 per pound, so it could earn a healthy return on its investment in the project even at today's prices, and exponentially higher profit margins if prices match RBC's expectations. 
That said, Denison Mines is a much higher risk investment than Cameco. What makes the company a huge gamble is that, as a development stage miner, it isn't yet generating any cash flow, meaning it needs to secure outside financing just to fund its share of the construction at Wheeler River. Finding that funding will be tough given the uranium market's current doldrums.
Investor takeaway
If RBC Capital Markets is right, uranium prices could skyrocket in the coming years, which should take uranium stocks along for the ride. The best-positioned company to ride that wave is Cameco, thanks to its top-tier portfolio of low-cost mines and the tools it has to expand its capacity. One of those tools is Denison Mines' Wheeler River project, which has the potential to be a tremendous value creator. It's a mine that could fuel explosive growth in Denison's stock price -- if the company can scrape together the cash to build it without diluting current shareholders into the ground.

Skyharbour Announces Plans for Upcoming Summer 2017 Drill Program and Commences Comprehensive Data Compilation on the Moore Uranium Project


VANCOUVER, British Columbia, July 13, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Skyharbour Resources Ltd. (TSX-V:SYH) (OTCQB:SYHBF) (Frankfurt:SC1P) (the "Company") is pleased to announce plans for its upcoming summer 2017 drill program at its flagship 35,705 hectare Moore Uranium Project, located approx. 15 kilometres east of Denison Mine's Wheeler River project and near regional infrastructure on the southeast side of the Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan. The Company is planning a 2,500 metre diamond drill program commencing in August to follow up on the success of the recently completed winter 2017 drill program with planned drill targets located on the Maverick Corridor as well as other regional targets planned for drill testing. The Company is also carrying out a comprehensive data compilation program at Moore to aggregate all of the historical and ongoing exploration results and plans to use new and innovative techniques to analyze this data to enhance the discovery potential and resource delineation at the project going forward. Moore Uranium Project Claims Map:http://skyharbourltd.com/_resources/maps/MooreLakeRegionalTenure.jpg Upcoming Summer 2017 Dill Program at Moore Uranium Project: Given the success of Skyharbour's first phase of drilling at the Moore Project in the winter of 2017, the Company has planned for a 2,500 metre summer drill program to commence in August. Drill targets will include several regional targets at the property as well as the Maverick corridor where previous drilling has intersected high grade uranium mineralization at the Main Maverick Zone including 6.0% U3O8 over 5.9 metres at 265 metres depth in hole ML-199, as well as the discovery of new, high grade mineralized lenses along strike from this Main Maverick Zone. The Maverick corridor is over 4 kilometres long yet only 1.5 kilometres have been systematically drilled with most of this drilling and known high grade uranium hosted at or near the unconformity leaving strong discovery potential along strike but also at depth in the basement rocks. The Company has received the necessary permits and is fully funded for this upcoming drill program with over $3.7 million in the treasury. Additional news is forthcoming on the drill program. Moore Uranium Project Data Compilation and Analysis: Skyharbour is carrying out an extensive data compilation program on its Moore Uranium Project to aggregate all of the historical and ongoing exploration results and geological information. Over $35 million in historical exploration has been carried out over several decades including airborne and ground electromagnetic and magnetic surveys, ground gravity, seismic, IP/resistivity and geochemical surveys, mapping, prospecting, lake sediment sampling programs and the drilling of more than 380 diamond drill holes. The Company is compiling all of this data into a comprehensive, modern, user-friendly proprietary database that will help streamline geological analysis and target evaluation for future exploration programs. Reinterpretation of historical data led to the new discovery of a high grade uranium lens at the Maverick East Zone in the 2017 winter drill program which included 4.17% U3O8over 4.5m in hole ML-202. Skyharbour will utilize new techniques and innovative analysis with the database to enhance the discovery potential at Moore going forward. Moore Uranium Project Regional Drill Targets Map:http://skyharbourltd.com/_resources/maps/Moore-Lake-Property-Wide.jpg Winter 2017 Dill Program Results at Moore Uranium Project: Skyharbour recently reported results from its 5,450 metre, 15 drill hole, winter 2017 diamond drilling program at its Moore Uranium Project (see May 23rd, 2017 news release). Multiple drill holes intersected high grade uranium mineralization at the 4 kilometre long Maverick structural corridor. Previously reported high grade results included 20.8% U3O8 over 1.5 metres within an interval returning 6.0% U3O8 over 5.9 metres in hole ML-199; 9.12% U3O8 over 1.4 metres within an interval returning 4.17% U3O8 over 4.5 metres in hole ML-202; 5.29% U3O8 over 2.5 metres within an interval returning 2.99% U3O8 over 5.0 metres in hole ML-200; and 2.25% U3O8 over 3.0 metres in hole ML-208. This high grade mineralization within the Maverick corridor is relatively shallow ranging from 250 metres to 275 metres vertical depth. Also of note is that hole ML-202 represents the discovery of a new high grade mineralized lens on the corridor. Only 1.5 kilometres of the total 4 kilometre long Maverick corridor have been systematically drill tested leaving robust discovery potential along strike as well as at depth in the underlying basement rocks which have seen limited drill testing historically. Moore Uranium Project Winter 2017 Drill Program Map:http://skyharbourltd.com/_resources/projects/Moore-Lake-Drilling-Update_20170515.pdf Qualified Person: The technical information in this news release has been prepared in accordance with the Canadian regulatory requirements set out in National Instrument 43-101 and reviewed and approved by Richard Kusmirski, P.Geo., M.Sc., Skyharbour's Head Technical Advisor and a Director, as well as a Qualified Person. About Skyharbour Resources Ltd.: Skyharbour holds an extensive portfolio of uranium and thorium exploration projects in Canada's Athabasca Basin and is well positioned to benefit from improving uranium market fundamentals with five drill-ready projects. In July 2016, Skyharbour acquired an option from Denison Mines, a large strategic shareholder of the Company, to acquire 100% of the Moore Uranium Project which is located approx. 15 kilometres east of Denison's Wheeler River project and 39 kilometres south of Cameco's McArthur River uranium mine. Moore is an advanced stage uranium exploration property with high grade uranium mineralization at the Maverick Zone with drill results returning 6.0% U3O8 over 5.9 metres including 20.8% U3O8 over 1.5 metres at a vertical depth of 265 metres. Skyharbour recently signed option agreements with AREVA Resources Canada and Azincourt Uranium whereby AREVA and Azincourt can earn in 70% on the Preston Project through a combined $9,800,000 in total exploration expenditures, as well as $1,700,000 in total cash payments and 4,500,000 Azincourt shares. Preston is a large, geologically prospective property proximal to Fission Uranium's Triple R deposit as well as NexGen Energy's Arrow deposit. The Company also owns a 100% interest in the Falcon Point Uranium Project on the eastern perimeter of the Basin which contains an NI 43-101 inferred resource totaling 7.0 million pounds of U3O8 at 0.03% and 5.3 million pounds of ThO2 at 0.023%. The project also hosts a high grade surface showing with up to 68% U3O8 in grab samples from a massive pitchblende vein, the source of which has yet to be discovered. The Company's 100% owned Mann Lake Uranium project on the east side of the Basin is strategically located adjacent to the Mann Lake Joint Venture operated by Cameco, where high grade uranium mineralization was recently discovered. Skyharbour's goal is to maximize shareholder value through new mineral discoveries, committed long-term partnerships, and the advancement of exploration projects in geopolitically favourable jurisdictions.

Skyharbour Resources Ltd 
                Skyharbour Announces Plans for Upcoming Summer 2017 Drill Program and Commences Comprehensive Data Compilation on the Moore Uranium Project


VANCOUVER, British Columbia, July 13, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Skyharbour Resources Ltd. (TSX-V:SYH) (OTCQB:SYHBF) (Frankfurt:SC1P) (the "Company") is pleased to announce plans for its upcoming summer 2017 drill program at its flagship 35,705 hectare Moore Uranium Project, located approx. 15 kilometres east of Denison Mine's Wheeler River project and near regional infrastructure on the southeast side of the Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan. The Company is planning a 2,500 metre diamond drill program commencing in August to follow up on the success of the recently completed winter 2017 drill program with planned drill targets located on the Maverick Corridor as well as other regional targets planned for drill testing. The Company is also carrying out a comprehensive data compilation program at Moore to aggregate all of the historical and ongoing exploration results and plans to use new and innovative techniques to analyze this data to enhance the discovery potential and resource delineation at the project going forward. Moore Uranium Project Claims Map:http://skyharbourltd.com/_resources/maps/MooreLakeRegionalTenure.jpg Upcoming Summer 2017 Dill Program at Moore Uranium Project: Given the success of Skyharbour's first phase of drilling at the Moore Project in the winter of 2017, the Company has planned for a 2,500 metre summer drill program to commence in August. Drill targets will include several regional targets at the property as well as the Maverick corridor where previous drilling has intersected high grade uranium mineralization at the Main Maverick Zone including 6.0% U3O8 over 5.9 metres at 265 metres depth in hole ML-199, as well as the discovery of new, high grade mineralized lenses along strike from this Main Maverick Zone. The Maverick corridor is over 4 kilometres long yet only 1.5 kilometres have been systematically drilled with most of this drilling and known high grade uranium hosted at or near the unconformity leaving strong discovery potential along strike but also at depth in the basement rocks. The Company has received the necessary permits and is fully funded for this upcoming drill program with over $3.7 million in the treasury. Additional news is forthcoming on the drill program. Moore Uranium Project Data Compilation and Analysis: Skyharbour is carrying out an extensive data compilation program on its Moore Uranium Project to aggregate all of the historical and ongoing exploration results and geological information. Over $35 million in historical exploration has been carried out over several decades including airborne and ground electromagnetic and magnetic surveys, ground gravity, seismic, IP/resistivity and geochemical surveys, mapping, prospecting, lake sediment sampling programs and the drilling of more than 380 diamond drill holes. The Company is compiling all of this data into a comprehensive, modern, user-friendly proprietary database that will help streamline geological analysis and target evaluation for future exploration programs. Reinterpretation of historical data led to the new discovery of a high grade uranium lens at the Maverick East Zone in the 2017 winter drill program which included 4.17% U3O8over 4.5m in hole ML-202. Skyharbour will utilize new techniques and innovative analysis with the database to enhance the discovery potential at Moore going forward. Moore Uranium Project Regional Drill Targets Map:http://skyharbourltd.com/_resources/maps/Moore-Lake-Property-Wide.jpg Winter 2017 Dill Program Results at Moore Uranium Project: Skyharbour recently reported results from its 5,450 metre, 15 drill hole, winter 2017 diamond drilling program at its Moore Uranium Project (see May 23rd, 2017 news release). Multiple drill holes intersected high grade uranium mineralization at the 4 kilometre long Maverick structural corridor. Previously reported high grade results included 20.8% U3O8 over 1.5 metres within an interval returning 6.0% U3O8 over 5.9 metres in hole ML-199; 9.12% U3O8 over 1.4 metres within an interval returning 4.17% U3O8 over 4.5 metres in hole ML-202; 5.29% U3O8 over 2.5 metres within an interval returning 2.99% U3O8 over 5.0 metres in hole ML-200; and 2.25% U3O8 over 3.0 metres in hole ML-208. This high grade mineralization within the Maverick corridor is relatively shallow ranging from 250 metres to 275 metres vertical depth. Also of note is that hole ML-202 represents the discovery of a new high grade mineralized lens on the corridor. Only 1.5 kilometres of the total 4 kilometre long Maverick corridor have been systematically drill tested leaving robust discovery potential along strike as well as at depth in the underlying basement rocks which have seen limited drill testing historically. Moore Uranium Project Winter 2017 Drill Program Map:http://skyharbourltd.com/_resources/projects/Moore-Lake-Drilling-Update_20170515.pdf Qualified Person: The technical information in this news release has been prepared in accordance with the Canadian regulatory requirements set out in National Instrument 43-101 and reviewed and approved by Richard Kusmirski, P.Geo., M.Sc., Skyharbour's Head Technical Advisor and a Director, as well as a Qualified Person. About Skyharbour Resources Ltd.: Skyharbour holds an extensive portfolio of uranium and thorium exploration projects in Canada's Athabasca Basin and is well positioned to benefit from improving uranium market fundamentals with five drill-ready projects. In July 2016, Skyharbour acquired an option from Denison Mines, a large strategic shareholder of the Company, to acquire 100% of the Moore Uranium Project which is located approx. 15 kilometres east of Denison's Wheeler River project and 39 kilometres south of Cameco's McArthur River uranium mine.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
