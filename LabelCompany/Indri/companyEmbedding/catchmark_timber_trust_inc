CatchMark (NYSE: CTT) is a public company that strives to deliver superior risk-adjusted returns for all stakeholders through disciplined acquisitions, sustainable harvests, and well-timed sales. 





Strategy
Our objective is to maximize total returns for our shareholders by providing ongoing dividends derived from sustainable harvesting from our existing portfolios of high-quality U.S. timberlands.  We also intend to selectively pursue timberland acquisition opportunities with focused efforts in the most commercially desirable timber-producing regions of the U.S. South and U.S. Pacific Northwest, although we may also pursue opportunistic acquisitions outside of these regions. The current housing market recovery and supply disruptions in Canadian timber markets bode well for increasing demand for our timber products from domestic as well as offshore users over the long-term. We do not engage in timber-related manufacturing operations, which allows us to focus on optimal management of our timberlands and prevents us from being exposed to the risks inherent in direct ownership of timber-related manufacturing operations. More




Property Highlights
CatchMark manages approximately 496,800 acres of high-quality commercial timberland located in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. The portfolio is well diversified by species and product mix (74% pine/26% hardwood by acreage and 49% sawtimber/51% pulpwood by volume).  Our timberlands are located in proximity to a variety of established wood products, pulp, and paper manufacturing facilities, which provide a steady source of competitive demand for both pulpwood and higher-value sawtimber products.  More
All data as of 03/31/2017.




Sustainability
Conscientious forest management serves investors by preserving the integrity of the land and forest habitats, which enhances the market value of timberland assets while promoting a healthier environment. CatchMark is committed to sustainable forest practices across our entire portfolio and we are proud that since 2008 our timberlands have been certified by the Sustainable Forestry Initiative®. More

Sustainability
Conscientious forest management serves investors in two ways: It promotes a healthier environment and enhances the potential market value of timberland assets. That’s why CatchMark is proud that its timberland has been certified as a sustainable forest according to the high standards of the Sustainable Forestry Initiative® (SFI). We have been SFI-certified since 2008 and are committed to maintaining this certification across our portfolio.
CatchMark also has been honored over multiple years by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources for our stewardship in land management and practices benefiting the state’s wildlife. The Forestry for Wildlife Partnership is a voluntary program that promotes sustainable forest and wildlife conservation in corporate forestry practices.

Catchmark Timber Trust :: Advantages

OverviewKey FactsAdvantagesStrategyLeadershipCareers 

Advantages

Exclusively Invested in U.S. Timberlands: CatchMark is the only “pure-play” publicly traded timber REIT – we own and harvest timberlands, but we do not own any pulp, paper or wood products manufacturing assets to avoid exposure to the risks and volatility inherent in manufacturing operations.
High-Quality Existing Portfolio: CatchMark’s timberlands are strategically located in the “U.S. South Fiber Basket,” a competitive and dynamic timber region convenient to woods products, pulp, and manufacturing facilities, which provide a steady source of demand for CatchMark’s harvests of pulpwood and higher-value saw timber products. Nearby interstates and state highways provide excellent access to CatchMark timberlands, ensuring efficient delivery routes to manufacturers.
Positioned for Growth: The ongoing recovery in the U.S. housing market and disruptions in timber supply in Canada –caused by a beetle infestation in British Columbia – create opportunities from meeting demand for timber products in markets facing more constrained supplies. The company’s strong capital position and ample liquidity provide opportunity for CatchMark to undertake prime timberland acquisitions to help propel future growth and ensure prospects for enhancing dividends and shareholder value over the long-term.
Proven Management Team: Chief Executive Officer and President Jerry Barag has more than 30 years of real estate and timberland investment experience, including expertise in acquisitions, divestitures, asset management, property management and financing. Chief Operating Officer John F. Rasor has more than 45 years of experience in the timberland and forest products industries with expertise in forest management, wood products manufacturing, fiber procurement and log merchandising, sales and distribution.

CatchMark also benefits from attractive long-term fiber supply agreements with a major manufacturer, providing a stable demand outlet for a significant portion of our timber production at competitive prices. The company’s scalable infrastructure – management team, information technology, and internal reporting systems – can be deployed over a larger asset base without significant additional incremental cost or personnel. As a result, the company can quickly and efficiently evaluate, execute and capitalize on timberland acquisition opportunities.

Potlatch downgraded after disappointing timber tariff news, valuation concerns
Shares of Potlatch Corp.  dropped 1.7% in morning trade Tuesday, after the real estate investment trust which owns timberlands was downgraded at Raymond James, which cited valuation in the wake of underwhelming regulatory announcement regarding tariffs on Canadian lumber. Analyst Colin Mings cut his rating to market perform from outperform and removed his stock price target. The stock closed Monday at a four-year high of $48.20, above Mings' previous price target of $48. Late Monday, the Commerce Department announced it was considering additional fees on Canadian lumber imports that would mean some products could face duties as high as 30.88%. The announcement comes two months after the Trump administration moved to impose a 20% tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber. Mings said that while protectionist trade policies are a positive for the timber REIT sector, the preliminary duty rates were within expectations. "However, there was no upside surprise in yesterday's announcement relative to our forecast, and we believe the preliminary finding will underwhelm some investors expecting a more aggressive stance on the issue," Mings wrote in a note to clients. July lumber futures  tumbled 1.8%. Among other timber REITs, shares of CatchMark Timber Trust Inc.  slipped 0.3%, Deltic Timber Corp.  lost 0.7% and Rayonier Inc.  edged up 0.1%. Potlatch's stock has climbed 14% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.8%.

Potlatch downgraded after disappointing timber tariff news, valuation concerns
Shares of Potlatch Corp.  dropped 1.7% in morning trade Tuesday, after the real estate investment trust which owns timberlands was downgraded at Raymond James, which cited valuation in the wake of underwhelming regulatory announcement regarding tariffs on Canadian lumber. Analyst Colin Mings cut his rating to market perform from outperform and removed his stock price target. The stock closed Monday at a four-year high of $48.20, above Mings' previous price target of $48. Late Monday, the Commerce Department announced it was considering additional fees on Canadian lumber imports that would mean some products could face duties as high as 30.88%. The announcement comes two months after the Trump administration moved to impose a 20% tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber. Mings said that while protectionist trade policies are a positive for the timber REIT sector, the preliminary duty rates were within expectations. "However, there was no upside surprise in yesterday's announcement relative to our forecast, and we believe the preliminary finding will underwhelm some investors expecting a more aggressive stance on the issue," Mings wrote in a note to clients. July lumber futures  tumbled 1.8%. Among other timber REITs, shares of CatchMark Timber Trust Inc.  slipped 0.3%, Deltic Timber Corp.  lost 0.7% and Rayonier Inc.  edged up 0.1%. Potlatch's stock has climbed 14% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.8%.

CatchMark Timber Trust Is Poised To Profit - CatchMark Timber Trust, Inc. (NYSE:CTT) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»CatchMark Timber Trust Is Poised To ProfitSep.30.15 | About: CatchMark Timber (CTT) Brad Thomas Dividend growth investing, REITs, newsletter provider, valueMarketplaceREIT BeatSummaryCTT is the smallest Timber REIT (with a market cap of ~$386 million) and based on its smaller size, the company should grow at a much faster pace.CTT is positioned to grow at a much more rapid pace since pulpwood is a base-line product and is best positioned for saw timber recovery.I’m initiating a BUY but with a disclaimer that this stock is a small-cap REIT with limited public operating experience.Yesterday, I wrote an article announcing my new Small Cap REIT Portfolio and I explained my primary objectives:

(1) the REITs in the portfolio must all be between $100 million and $1.5 billion
(2) they must be deemed safe based upon my thorough analysis

The master list for my initial portfolio consists of a growing number of REITs, but to be inducted into my small-cap portfolio, a company must demonstrate that the dividend is safe and management is disciplined.
In other words, I'm not just looking for that "one hit wonder" that turns into an overnight success and then fades into the sunset. Instead, I'm looking to capitalize on unmined gems that are buried below ground that can be polished and eventually shine.
In order to find these gems, one must dig deep in hopes of uncovering stocks that promise the best alpha. That means it's important to cover a broad spectrum of sectors and sub-sectors that includes data centers, casinos, prisons, solar farms, ordinary farms, and tree farms.
In my upcoming (October) newsletter, I intend to begin covering the Timber REITs. Up until now, I have not covered this sector, but I decided that it's time to include this growing sector in my Intelligent REIT Lab. As illustrated below, the Timber sector has a market cap in excess of $25 billion:

The Timber Performance YTD

As illustrated below, the Timber REIT sector was one of the worst sectors in 2014 and YTD (2015):

Rayonier (NYSE:RYN) has been the worst Timber REIT this year with a total return of -29.4%.

Small-cap REIT, CatchMark Timber (NYSE:CTT) has been the worst performer over the last 90 days, and in this article, I intend to examine the company in greater detail. It appears that CTT could be a small-cap poised to profit, and I intend to add the company to my REIT lab, commencing with this article.
The History of CatchMark
In December 2014, CTT completed its public offering of 10.526 million shares of Class A stock at $13.50 per share and raised gross proceeds of around 142 million. Following the offering, the stock was listed on the NYSE under the ticker CTT. The company's shares of class B-1, B-2 and B-3 common stock will convert to listed shares of class A common stock in phases.
Previously, CTT was a non-traded REIT known as Wells Timberland REIT, Inc. sponsored by Wells Capital Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wells Real Estate Funds Inc., and advised by Wells Timberland Management Organization LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wells Capital. Since listing on the NYSE, CTT has returned -18.8%.


Unlike other Timber REIT peers CTT was not born out of the industrial REIT complex (i.e. paper mills and other forest products) but instead the Atlanta-based company has focused on raw materials only. In other words, unlike Weyerhaeuser (NYSE:WY) that originated next to the paper mills, CTT was formed to own timberland.
Another differentiator for CTT is that the company has opted to focus on high-demand southeastern US markets - 'the fiber markets" - where the company owns around 407,600 acres of timberlands. As of Q2-15, CTT owned 378,400 fee acres and 28,300 leased acres. These markets consist of 14.6 million tons if merchantable timber with a well-diversified product mix that includes pine (74%) and hardwood (26%). CTT's key markets include TX/LA, GA/AL, and South GA.

CTT's pipeline for growth is in excess of $500 million (for 2015) and includes key southeastern markets (the pine belt) where the company targets deal sizes of 10,000-40,000 acres.

CTT focuses on the micro markets (as identified below) that offer favorable current and long-term supply and demand fundamentals. These attractive markets provide robust pulpwood and dimensional lumber opportunities.


CTT has acquired approximately 139,000 acres since listing shares, expanding its holdings by around 46%, which will increase sustainable harvest volumes, improve product mix, and enhance long-term earnings. In Waycross/Panola, CTT purchased around 38,300 acres for around $74 million. In Oglethorpe/Satilla River, CTT purchased around 55,600 acres at a cost of $111 million. In Beauregard, CTT purchased around 21,000 acres at a cost of $38 million.

The Timber Growth REIT
As noted above, CTT is the smallest Timber REIT (with a market cap of ~$386 million) and based on its smaller size, the company should grow at a much faster pace. Timberland transaction volume totaled over $33 billion (between 2003 and 2008) and the majority was acquired by TIMOs. This indicates that there will be significant M&A growth as TIMOs look to monetize (by pension funds and endowments) over the next 10 to 15 years. This chart provides valuable visibility as it relates to the pipeline for growth:

CTT's recent acquisitions exhibit strong productivity traits which enhance its overall portfolio productivity (this chart illustrates the tons/acre/year and volume per acre for each REIT - on the left - and CTT's latest transactions - on the right)


The next chart illustrates how CTTs harvest production can yield increased cash flow, particularly when timber prices recover. The 3 primary drivers for timber are (1) volume, (2) mix of product, and (3) price. As the previous chart (above) illustrates CTT has demonstrated its capital proficiency as it generates ~25% more production than the peer group. The chart below illustrates the volume differential.

In the second quarter, CTT purchased 9,700 acres of prime timberlands in two separate transactions for $12.8 million. That brings the total acquisitions for the year through June 30 to 17,400 acres paying out $27.9 million in five separate transactions.
The purchases have added 600,000 tons for the company's merchantable inventory comprising 72% pine plantations by acreage and 56% saw timber by tons. Since the IPO, CTT has grown acreage by 46%.

In terms of CTT's balance sheet, I find the capitalization to be sound: Assets of ~$577 million and total debt of ~$138 million with a total debt to total capitalization of 23.2%. In December, CTT refinanced its existing credit facilities through a syndicate led by CoBank ACB, increasing its total credit availability to $410 million from $240 million.


The new debt facilities include a $35 million, five-year revolving line of credit; a $275 million, seven-year multidraw term loan; and a $100 million, 10-year term loan. The company noted that the refinancing effectively reduces the company's annual cash interest expense by approximately 55 to 65 basis points, or approximately $700,000 based on its current debt levels. Additionally, the company entered into a hedging transaction for $35 million, effectively fixing the rate at 4.145% before patronage.
Also, the company said it is now eligible to receive annual patronage refunds, which are profit distributions made by CoBank and other Farm Credit System banks. The refinancing provides the company additional capital for future acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, including share repurchases.
Is CatchMark Poised To Profit?
As referenced above, CTT has lost steam since listing in December 2013. Here's the performance since January 1, 2014:

Is CTT poised to profit?
I think so, especially when you consider the fact there is muted downside risk and tremendous upside opportunity. Certainly, we can see volatility in stumpage prices but the historic trends indicate significant price recovery:

One of the biggest indicators are housing starts, that's what drives saw timber prices: 1.5mm starts = $40+ saw timber (vs. $25 today).


Now let's see how annual housing starts compare with real saw timber prices:

A new "super-cycle" peak (+27% vs. 2005) should drive significantly higher saw timber prices:

Here's how I would play this one: CTT is a small cap and shares clearly trade alongside the larger peers. Much like tree farming, Timber REITs should be held for the long term (trees take 25 years to harvest/mature) and CTT is positioned to grow at a much more rapid pace since pulpwood is a base-line product and is best positioned for saw timber recovery.
I favor CTT over the others based on simplicity. There is minimal cap-ex (so CTT has a higher payout ratio) and as noted, CTT does not own sawmills. CTT shares are currently trading at $10.46 and there are three analysts now covering the company (with a consensus NAV of ~$14.00). Also, CTT is tax-advantaged with 90% of dividends paid as ROC and 10% capital appreciation.
I really like CTT's liquidity that stands at around $300 million and that's a big signal that the company will be taking advantage of the wave of consolidation and growing housing starts. I'm initiating a BUY but with a disclaimer that this stock is a small-cap REIT with limited public operating experience. The dividend appears safe (based on its payout ratio), and I see value in the highest paying dividend yield in the sector:

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

CatchMark (NYSE: CTT) is a public company that strives to deliver superior risk-adjusted returns for all stakeholders through disciplined acquisitions, sustainable harvests, and well-timed sales. 





Strategy
Our objective is to maximize total returns for our shareholders by providing ongoing dividends derived from sustainable harvesting from our existing portfolios of high-quality U.S. timberlands.  We also intend to selectively pursue timberland acquisition opportunities with focused efforts in the most commercially desirable timber-producing regions of the U.S. South and U.S. Pacific Northwest, although we may also pursue opportunistic acquisitions outside of these regions. The current housing market recovery and supply disruptions in Canadian timber markets bode well for increasing demand for our timber products from domestic as well as offshore users over the long-term. We do not engage in timber-related manufacturing operations, which allows us to focus on optimal management of our timberlands and prevents us from being exposed to the risks inherent in direct ownership of timber-related manufacturing operations. More




Property Highlights
CatchMark manages approximately 496,800 acres of high-quality commercial timberland located in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. The portfolio is well diversified by species and product mix (74% pine/26% hardwood by acreage and 49% sawtimber/51% pulpwood by volume).  Our timberlands are located in proximity to a variety of established wood products, pulp, and paper manufacturing facilities, which provide a steady source of competitive demand for both pulpwood and higher-value sawtimber products.  More
All data as of 03/31/2017.




Sustainability
Conscientious forest management serves investors by preserving the integrity of the land and forest habitats, which enhances the market value of timberland assets while promoting a healthier environment. CatchMark is committed to sustainable forest practices across our entire portfolio and we are proud that since 2008 our timberlands have been certified by the Sustainable Forestry Initiative®. More
