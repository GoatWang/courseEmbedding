(NASDAQ:CPLP) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»MLP Bottom Fishing 3: Capital Products PartnersMar.28.16 | About: Capital Product (CPLP) Philip Mause Long-term horizon, Deep Value, dividend investingSummaryCPLP is a shipping partnership operating a variety of ships, but primarily crude oil and product tankers.CPLP's performance is not directly tied to the price of crude oil, but CPLP unit seems to have been driven down in the general energy rout.CPLP currently yields 31.2% and trades at roughly 3.5 times cash flow.CPLP faces some challenges, but also should experience some positive developments in 2016.At a current price of $3.06 per unit, CPLP is a bargain.
Capital Product Partners, L.P., (NASDAQ:CPLP) charters ships -- primarily crude and product tankers, and closed Thursday at $3.06 per unit. Based on its most recent dividend, annual dividends should be 95.4 cents for a yield of 31.2% at the current unit price. CPLP seems to have been taken out and shot with the rest of the MLP sector even though it is not dependent on the price of oil or gas for its economic performance. The weak oil market may even be somewhat of a plus for tanker owners as low prices stimulate additional demand and that demand requires more transportation resources. And in the United States market, lower prices really mean that domestic production is going to be replaced with imported oil leading to more demand for tanker transportation.
Financials - CPLP has recently reported its full year 2015 results. Earnings were $55.4 million or 38 cents per unit so that the price earnings ratio is currently 8.0. Depreciation was $62.7 million and I calculated EBITDA at $138.1 million. Year-end cash was $90.2 million and debt was $568 million. Net debt was just 3.5 times EBITDA, which is a very attractive leverage level. CPLP's debt covenants (a big issue in the MLP sector) are structured based on the value of the ships secured by the debt and CPLP is in very good shape in terms of covenant compliance. Cash flow was $118.1 million so that (based on a total unit count of 135 million units of all kinds) the units are selling for roughly 3.5 times cash flow. On the other hand, for shipping companies, depreciation is not merely an accounting fiction -- the vessels do actually depreciate over time. Thus, to compare the cash flow of a shipping company with the cash flow of a normal company can be deceptive. Still the current low price of the stock suggests that CPLP could reduce distributions and still maintain an attractive yield while setting aside substantial funds to finance the replacement of aging vessels. As noted, CPLP has been aggressive in its distributions and one concern may be the need to establish a reserve to replace vessels as they age. On the other hand, distributions could be reduced by two-thirds and still leave a double-digit yield at this unit price level. If this were done, an enormous reserve fund could be built up to replace vessels. If it is not done, buyers at the current price level will get all of their money back in a little more than 3 years.
Stress Test - One concern about CPLP has been that it is leasing five vessels to Hyundai Merchant Marine (HMM) and HMM is having financial difficulties. I have examined CPLP's financials and made some stress test calculations. Even if charter rates on all five of these vessels were reduced by 30%, CPLP's earnings and cash flow would remain strong. I calculate that CPLP would lose $15.6 million in annual revenue and, while this would negatively impact the bottom line, cash flow would still support a 75 cent per year distribution so that yield would still be well over 20 per cent.
It is important to note that CPLP also has some offsetting positive developments as discussed in CPLP's most recent conference call. A new ship (the "Magdalena") was delivered in February and it is chartered at an attractive rate. In addition, two container ships, which had been idle have now been chartered. I do not anticipate a distribution reduction although the current pricing of the units at a yield of over 30% clearly reflects the market's anticipation of a distribution cut.
No K-1 - Unlike many MLPs, CPLP has elected to be taxed as a "C" corporation so that no K-1s are issued and the tax complexities often associated with MLPs can be avoided.
Risks - I generally have not been a big fan of this sector. Charter and spot rates can vary enormously over time due to excess capacity and a glutted market can produce disastrously low revenue. CPLP currently avoids this problem with long-term charters, but there is always a risk that financial distress on the part of customers can lead to renegotiations or demands for lower rates in bankruptcy proceedings.
We have been in a phase in which oil has been put into storage at a rapid rate and this may mean that we are headed into a period in which the volume shipped may decline. In addition, the container and bulk markets have been weak and CPLP does have significant exposure to the container market. On balance, however, at this price CPLP is a bargain. It should crank out attractive distributions and very likely return half of its current price in less than 2 years in the form of those distributions.

Key Features & Innovations







Glass Bin Storage

Included in each plumbing drawer, glass bins are designed specifically for quick access to small items.










Organization Kit

Adjustable glass drawer dividers provide storage right where you need it and prevent items from moving or sliding in the drawer.










Push to Open or Slow Close

Choose between a contemporary look with hand-free operation drawers that open with a gentle push (push-to-open) or a more traditional design featuring a stylish ergonomically designed handle in brushed aluminum trim and slow-close drawers.










Glass Shelf

Storing bathroom essentials has never been so stylish. This glass shelf keeps everything you need right where you need it.










Vanity Tops and Sinks

Stone vanity tops are available in Lava Black, Stone Gray or Quartz White and include a separate white rectangle sink. White glass vanity tops with integrated glass sinks can help you build a look you'll love. Available with single or three hole 8" widespread faucet drillings.










Premium Construction

Free-standing vanity with signature brushed aluminum legs and trim. Durable rust-free anodized aluminum space frame construction resists intense moisture and ensures long-lasting beauty.










Night Light

The night light provides a soft light that illuminates the drawer interiors to help locate items in the middle of the night.










Towel Bars

Clean, modern design puts towels conveniently close at hand. This smart design maximizes space and offers a luxurious feel while separating items from plumbing. Available for left side, right side or both. Single towel bar adds 2" to overall of vanity, towel bars on both sides add 4" to overall width.










Slim Drawer Insert

Drawer within a drawer keeps makeup and small items where you need them most - right at your fingertips.










In Drawer Electrical Outlets

Convenient 110-volt in-drawer electrical outlet supplies power to electric razors and curling irons. Three plugs and a switch that turns off power to the entire unit to keep appliances safely plugged in. This add-on accessory needs to be installed within the vanity drawer. This outlet can be paired with an optional hair dryer organizer. The hair dryer organizer fits all vanity drawers except 24" plumbing drawer and cannot be used in combination with slim drawer insert. Fits most hair dryers and curling irons.

Key Features & Innovations







Glass Bin Storage

Included in each plumbing drawer, glass bins are designed specifically for quick access to small items.










Organization Kit

Adjustable glass drawer dividers provide storage right where you need it and prevent items from moving or sliding in the drawer.










Push to Open or Slow Close

Choose between a contemporary look with hand-free operation drawers that open with a gentle push (push-to-open) or a more traditional design featuring a stylish ergonomically designed handle in brushed aluminum trim and slow-close drawers.










Glass Shelf

Storing bathroom essentials has never been so stylish. This glass shelf keeps everything you need right where you need it.










Vanity Tops and Sinks

Stone vanity tops are available in Lava Black, Stone Gray or Quartz White and include a separate white rectangle sink. White glass vanity tops with integrated glass sinks can help you build a look you'll love. Available with single or three hole 8" widespread faucet drillings.










Premium Construction

Free-standing vanity with signature brushed aluminum legs and trim. Durable rust-free anodized aluminum space frame construction resists intense moisture and ensures long-lasting beauty.










Night Light

The night light provides a soft light that illuminates the drawer interiors to help locate items in the middle of the night.










Towel Bars

Clean, modern design puts towels conveniently close at hand. This smart design maximizes space and offers a luxurious feel while separating items from plumbing. Available for left side, right side or both. Single towel bar adds 2" to overall of vanity, towel bars on both sides add 4" to overall width.










Slim Drawer Insert

Drawer within a drawer keeps makeup and small items where you need them most - right at your fingertips.










In Drawer Electrical Outlets

Convenient 110-volt in-drawer electrical outlet supplies power to electric razors and curling irons. Three plugs and a switch that turns off power to the entire unit to keep appliances safely plugged in. This add-on accessory needs to be installed within the vanity drawer. This outlet can be paired with an optional hair dryer organizer. The hair dryer organizer fits all vanity drawers except 24" plumbing drawer and cannot be used in combination with slim drawer insert. Fits most hair dryers and curling irons.

LP OSB Sheathing Benefits

A cost-effective, high performance structural panel, LP® OSB is designed for optimal performance and stability. It contains only low-emitting safe resins and is offered in a comprehensive range of performance categories. Features include:

Easy Installation: Installs consistently flat and stable.
Quality: Consistent quality throughout a comprehensive line of sheathing products, it’s uniform, workable and remarkably strong.
Peace of Mind: No cupping, warping or splitting.
Availability: Widely distributed, LP OSB products are available when you need them.
Sustainability: Wood sourced through programs certified under the Sustainable Forestry Initiative®.
20-Year Transferable Limited Warranty: Backed by a long-term warranty so you can build with confidence.








How It’s Made

The largest OSB producer in the world, LP uses an innovative manufacturing process to ensure a reliable, consistent product that outperforms traditional lumber:

Rectangular wood strands blended with thermal-set, waterproof adhesives are arranged in cross-directional layers.
Layers are consolidated under extreme pressure, creating a stiff, strong and durable panel.





Product Specifications

Available sizes: 47-7/8˝ x 95-7/8˝ panels (Longer panels and custom thicknesses are also available. Please call (800) 964-6310 for more info.)
Available performance categories: from 3/8 to 1-1/8*
For additional strength and stiffness in shear wall applications, specify our APA Rated Struc-1® sheathing
LP OSB panels are certified by the APA – The Engineered Wood Association and are manufactured in conformance with U.S. Voluntary Product Standard PS2.
