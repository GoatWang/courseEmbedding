HARP Loan

What is the HARP Program?
When you have little equity in your home, or owe as much or more on your mortgage than your home is worth, it can be difficult to find a lender willing to help you refinance.
                            But for borrowers who have remained current on their mortgages, and have loans owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, there is hope. It’s called Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP).
                        
Introduced in March 2009, HARP enables borrowers with little or no equity to refinance into more affordable mortgages without new or additional mortgage insurance.
                            HARP targets borrowers with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios equal to or greater than 80 percent and who have limited delinquencies over the 12 months prior to refinancing.







Significant changes have been made to HARP since the program was first introduced. For example, in 2011 the LTV ceiling was removed, property appraisal requirements were waived in certain circumstances, certain risk fees for borrowers
                            selecting shorter amortization terms were eliminated, and certain representations and warranties were waived. In 2013, the eligibility date was changed from the date the loan was acquired by Fannie Mae                            or Freddie Mac to the date on the note, increasing the pool of eligible borrowers.
                        
Through HARP, you can get a lower interest rate (which means less out-of-pocket costs each month), get a shorter loan term, or change from an adjustable to fixed-rate
                            mortgage. There’s no minimum credit score needed, either.
                        
And now that HARP guidelines are simpler, even people who were formerly turned down may now be eligible for HARP refinancing.
                        
Find out if you qualify for HARP!




How can HARP help me?
If you are current on your mortgage; have a mortgage that is owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and owe as much or more than your home is currently worth, you may be eligible for HARP refinancing. That can mean significant savings
                            by: 

Lowering your monthly payment
Reducing your interest rate
Securing a fixed-rate mortgage that won’t change over time
Building equity faster—shorter term options may be available
Lower closing costs because an appraisal is not usually required
Check your HARP eligibility‎!





HARP program includes:


No underwater limits
Borrowers will now be able to refinance regardless of how far their homes have fallen in value. Previous loan-to-value limits were set at 125 percent.
                                


No appraisals or underwriting
Most homeowners will not have to get an appraisal or have their loan underwritten, making their refinance process smoother and faster.


Modified fees
Certain risk-based fees for borrowers who refinance into shorter-term loans have been reduced.


Less paperwork
Lenders now need less paperwork for income verification, and have the option of qualifying a borrower by documenting that the borrower has at least 12 months
                                    of mortgage payments in reserve.


Program Deadline
The end date to get a HARP refinance is September 30, 2017.


Check if you qualify for HARP before it's gone!

How cash-out refinancing works



The cash out refinance is designed to accomplish two goals — to improve on the terms of an existing home loan and deliver additional funds at a low interest rate. Other types of mortgage refinance include the rate and term refinance, in which the new loan amount is equal to the remaining balance on the old mortgage, and the limited cash out refinance, in which the closing costs are added wrapped into the new loan, increasing its balance.It only makes sense to undertake a cash-out refinance if the new loan comes with a better refinance rate or more favorable terms (replacing an adjustable rate home loan with a fixed rate mortgage, for example).

Refinance with cash out: conforming loans
It is important to note that cash out refinancing generally costs more than rate and term or limited cash out refinancing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, require lenders to collect surcharges for these loans (called “conforming” mortgages) because they are considered riskier.
The added costs of cash out refinancing can be substantial and should be considered carefully. If, for example, a homeowner wishes to refinance a $200,000 mortgage and take an additional $10,000 cash out, there may be no extra costs (the new loan amount is less than 60 percent of the home’s value and the borrower has a 700 FICO score, for example). On the other hand, if the homeowner has a 650 FICO and the new loan amount is 83 percent of the property value, it would cost an extra $6,300 to borrow $10,000!
In general, cash out refinancing is likely to be the lowest cost option when the amount of additional cash is relatively high. In the above example, the added costs come to 63 percent of the amount borrowed. If the homeowner were to take $100,000 cash out, however, the added costs come to nine percent of the amount borrowed — a considerably lower figure. The chart below shows the added costs, which depend on the borrower’s credit score and the loan-to-value ratio. Notice cash out is limited to 85 percent of the property value.




What is cash-out refinancing?
A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

Glossary Terms
​ Cash-Out Refinancing

A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

​ Equity

The difference between the fair market value of an asset (like a home) and the amount of debt against that asset (like a mortgage balance).

​  Rate and Term Refinancing

A mortgage refinance that replaces the existing mortgage with a new one but does not disburse cash to the borrower. Rate and term refinancing is undertaken simply to improve on the terms of the old loan – reducing the interest rate is a popular goal.

​  Refinance 

Refinancing means replacing one loan with a new, better loan. Improving the terms of a loan can mean obtaining a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment, replacing an adjustable or variable rate loan with a fixed-rate loan or increasing the size of the loan and taking the difference in cash.

Cash-Out Refinance Pros
Cash out refinancing offers a few advantages over other sources of funds:

Because it’s secured by real estate, the interest rate is lower than rates for unsecured financing.
Because it’s a first mortgage, the interest rate is lower than rates for home equity loans, which are usually second mortgages.
The interest may be tax-deductible. Check with a tax pro.



Cash-Out Refinance Cons

Underwriting guidelines are stricter than for rate and term refinancing.
Costs are higher because surcharges are assessed against the entire refinance, not just the amount of cash out.
Cash out refinancing takes longer than setting up a home equity loan or personal (unsecured) loan.
Increasing the loan-to-value to over 80 percent requires mortgage insurance.







 



Alternatives to cash-out refinancing
Homeowners considering a cash out refinance should compare the costs of all available options:

Rate and term refinance plus a home equity loan (if terms of existing loan can be bettered)
Adding just a home equity loan (if existing loan cannot be improved)
Taking a personal loan (if credit rating is good and costs are low)
Consolidating debt with a debt management plan or balance transfer card

Cash out refinancing is a valid strategy for financing anything from college tuition to debt consolidation to home improvements. However, homeowners should run the numbers and consider the total cost of borrowing — lender fees, interest rates and third party costs — before committing.

Will you save money by refinancing your current loan?
A mortgage refinance can mean big savings, but it may come at a price in the short term. The decision to refinance generally comes down to whether you'll be in your home long enough for your monthly savings to outweigh the upfront refinancing costs. Our Refinance Calculator can help you determine the amount of time you'll need to stay in your home after refinancing your mortgage to breakeven and cover your costs.

Breakeven Analysis







                                    Monthly Payment
                                    ?
There are several ways to calculate your refinance breakeven. The "quick and dirty" method involves dividing the difference in your monthly payment by the refinancing costs. That isn't necessarily the most accurate method, and the longer you've been paying your current loan, the less accurate that breakeven calculation is. In addition, this method won't help you if your refinancing from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year loan.










                                    Interest Expense
                                    ?
The next method is based on the difference in  interest expense between your current loan and a refinance mortgage. Your breakeven is that point in which the total interest savings equals the cost of refinancing. This method allows you to compare loans with different terms.










                                    Mortgage Tax Deduction
                                    ?
If you itemize your deductions when you file your taxes, it affects your breakeven point. Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage deductions. Refinancing to a lower rate decreases your mortgage interest deduction.










                                    Pay Down Existing Mortgage
                                    ?
You can choose to refinance or leave your mortgage alone, but you have another option -- use your cash to pay down your mortgage balance instead of spending it on refinancing. You can reamortize your loan to reduce your payment or accelerate your repayment. This breakeven method measures how long it would take for your refinance payment less the reamortized payment on your current mortgage to cover the costs of refinancing.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Certificates as follows:

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on eleven P&I Classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable ranges.




The rating on the exchangeable class PEZ was affirmed due to the weighted 
average rating factor (WARF) of the exchangeable classes.




The ratings on two IO Classes, Classes X-A and X-B, 
were affirmed based on the credit performance (or the weighted average 
rating factor or WARF) of their referenced classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 5.0% 
of the current balance, compared to 3.6% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 4.9% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 3.6% at Moody's last review. Moody's 
provides a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion 
CMBS transactions on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating US and Canadian 
Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. The methodology 
used in rating the exchangeable class, Cl. PEZ was "Moody's 
Approach to Rating Repackaged Securities" published in June 2015. 
Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of these methodologies.




Additionally, the methodology used in rating Cl. X-A 
and Cl. X-B was "Moody's Approach to Rating Structured 
Finance Interest-Only Securities" published in October 2015. 
Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




Please note that on February 27, 2017, Moody's released a 
"Request for Comment" in which it has requested market feedback on proposed 
changes to its methodology for rating structured finance interest-only 
(IO) securities called "Moody's Approach to Rating Structured Finance 
Interest-Only Securities," dated October 20, 2015. 
If Moody's adopts the new methodology as proposed, the changes could 
affect the ratings of COMM 2014-CCRE17. Please see "Moody's 
Proposes Revised Approach to Rating Structured Finance Interest-Only 
(IO) Securities", which is available at www.moodys.com, 
for more information about the implications of the proposed changes to 
the methodology on Moody's ratings.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is . The pool has a Herf of 20, 
compared to 21 at Moody's last review.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the March 10, 2017 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 2.1% to $1.16 
billion from $1.19 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 59 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 12% of the pool, with the top ten 
loans constituting 55% of the pool. There are no loans that 
have investment-grade structured credit assessments. Four 
loans, constituting 2.4% of the pool, have defeased 
and are secured by US Government securities.




Seven loans, constituting 7.6% of the pool, 
are on the master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes 
loans that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part 
of the CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As 
part of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




There are currently no loans in special servicing and no loans have been 
liquidated from the pool since securitization.




Moody's received full year 2015 operating results for 96% of the 
pool and full or partial year 2016 operating results for 95% of 
the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 106.8%, 
compared to 102.2% at Moody's last review. 
Moody's conduit component excludes loans with structured credit 
assessments, defeased and CTL loans, and specially serviced 
and troubled loans. Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects 
a weighted average haircut of 15.7% to the most recently 
available net operating income (NOI). Moody's value reflects 
a weighted average capitalization rate of 9.5%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.52X and 0.98X, 
respectively, compared to 1.59X and 1.03X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and the loan's 
actual debt service. Moody's stressed DSCR is based on Moody's 
NCF and a 9.25% stress rate the agency applied to the loan 
balance.




The top three conduit loans represent 32% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the Bronx Terminal Market Loan ($140.0 
million -- 12.0% of the pool), which represents 
a pari-passu portion of a $380.0 million mortgage 
loan. The loan is secured by a borrower's leasehold interest in 
a 912,333 square foot (SF) anchored retail power center located 
in Bronx, New York. The center is of Class A quality and 
anchored by Target, BJs and Home Depot. The property is subject 
to a ground lease which expires in September 2055. As of December 
2016, the collateral was 99% leased, the same at the 
last review and securitization. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 
108% and 0.80X, respectively, the same at the 
last review. 




The second largest loan is the 25 Broadway Loan ($130.0 
million -- 11.1% of the pool), which represents 
a pari-passu portion of a 250.0 million mortgage loan. 
The loan is secured by a 22-story, Class B office building 
located in the financial district submarket of Manhattan, New York. 
The largest tenants are Claremont Preparatory School (19% of NRA) 
and Deloitte & Touche (15% of NRA). As of September 
2016, the property was 96% leased, the same at last 
review and securitization. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 119% 
and 0.80X, respectively, the same at the last review. 





The third largest loan is the Cottonwood Mall Loan ($101.3 
million -- 8.6% of the pool), which is secured 
by 410,452 SF portion of a 1.06 million SF super-regional 
mall located in western Albuquerque, New Mexico. The property 
is anchored by Dillard's, Macy's, JC Penney, Sears, 
Conn's HomePlus and a 16-screen Regal Cinema, with only the 
Regal Cinema contributed as part of the collateral. The property 
is one of two regional mall in the area primarily serving the area west 
of Interstate 25 and the Rio Grande River, including the Rio Grande 
submarket. The competition, Coronado Mall is located only 
12 miles southwest of the property and is considered the dominant mall 
in the market. As of March 2017, the total mall was 96% 
leased compared to 99% in September 2016 and 94% in December 
2015. Despite the high occupancy, Macy's has announced 
its plan to close its store at this property and several other national 
retailers have either recently vacated or indicated plans to vacate. 
These tenants include Wet Seal, LensCrafters, The Limited, 
Footaction, the Body Shop and Sports Authority. Due to the 
store closure, property performance is expected to decline and Moody's 
LTV and stressed DSCR are 122% and 0.95X, respectively, 
compared to 87% and 1.27X at securitization.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.

HARP Loan















Advertorial






 (877) 792-9388

What is the HARP Program?
When you have little equity in your home, or owe as much or more on your mortgage than your home is worth, it can be difficult to find a lender willing to help you refinance.
                            But for borrowers who have remained current on their mortgages, and have loans owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, there is hope. It’s called Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP).
                        
Introduced in March 2009, HARP enables borrowers with little or no equity to refinance into more affordable mortgages without new or additional mortgage insurance.
                            HARP targets borrowers with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios equal to or greater than 80 percent and who have limited delinquencies over the 12 months prior to refinancing.







Significant changes have been made to HARP since the program was first introduced. For example, in 2011 the LTV ceiling was removed, property appraisal requirements were waived in certain circumstances, certain risk fees for borrowers
                            selecting shorter amortization terms were eliminated, and certain representations and warranties were waived. In 2013, the eligibility date was changed from the date the loan was acquired by Fannie Mae                            or Freddie Mac to the date on the note, increasing the pool of eligible borrowers.
                        
Through HARP, you can get a lower interest rate (which means less out-of-pocket costs each month), get a shorter loan term, or change from an adjustable to fixed-rate
                            mortgage. There’s no minimum credit score needed, either.
                        
And now that HARP guidelines are simpler, even people who were formerly turned down may now be eligible for HARP refinancing.
                        
Find out if you qualify for HARP!




How can HARP help me?
If you are current on your mortgage; have a mortgage that is owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and owe as much or more than your home is currently worth, you may be eligible for HARP refinancing. That can mean significant savings
                            by: 

Lowering your monthly payment
Reducing your interest rate
Securing a fixed-rate mortgage that won’t change over time
Building equity faster—shorter term options may be available
Lower closing costs because an appraisal is not usually required
Check your HARP eligibility‎!





HARP program includes:


No underwater limits
Borrowers will now be able to refinance regardless of how far their homes have fallen in value. Previous loan-to-value limits were set at 125 percent.
                                


No appraisals or underwriting
Most homeowners will not have to get an appraisal or have their loan underwritten, making their refinance process smoother and faster.


Modified fees
Certain risk-based fees for borrowers who refinance into shorter-term loans have been reduced.


Less paperwork
Lenders now need less paperwork for income verification, and have the option of qualifying a borrower by documenting that the borrower has at least 12 months
                                    of mortgage payments in reserve.


Program Deadline
The end date to get a HARP refinance is September 30, 2017.


Check if you qualify for HARP before it's gone!






Might you be eligible?
See if you meet these basic eligibility requirements:

You are current on your mortgage, with no 30-day+ late payments in the last six months and no more than one in the past 12 months
Your home is your primary residence, a 1-unit second home or a 1- to 4-unit investment property.
Your loan is owned by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. You can use the Loan Look-up Tools below if you are unsure.
Your loan was originated on or before May 31, 2009.
Your current loan-to-value (LTV) ratio must be greater than 80%.
Verify your HARP eligibility now‎!











Gather your financial information
Make sure you have your basic financial and loan information on hand when you call your mortgage company. You’ll need:

Your mortgage statements, including information on a second mortgage (if applicable).
Your income details (paystub or income tax return).






Connect with us
The licensed lending officer will also explain all the steps–from getting started, to locking in your low rate, to closing your loan quickly. Because we are a direct lender, if you have any questions during the loan process,
                                you will have one direct number enabling you to get quick answers straight from the source.

You will also be responsible for the cost of any mortgage or deed of trust filing fee imposed by a state or other taxing authority.

Please note title insurance fees and escrow fees are not included in 'Other Fees' due to significant cost differences across the country. These fees will be included in your Loan Estimate.

Your personal information will only be transmitted to the lender(s) you have selected to receive your loan request. You will only receive correspondence from those same lender(s) when you start the loan process.

We respect your privacy. Your information will never be sold to a third party.

Estimated Total Cost is a combination of lender fees including application, commitment and processing fees, as well as other third party fees such as appraisal, flood certification, credit report, etc. Due to the complexity of state by state charges, this does not include title, escrow, transfer tax, or recording fees. Lender fees are not to exceed $350 per transaction for Costco Executive Members, and $650 for Gold Star and Business Members

Other Fees include 3rd party fees such as appraisal, flood certification, credit report, etc, points, and upfront mortgage insurance premiums ("Upfront MIP"). Depending on the type of loan you select, fees may vary.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
