If you own the mineral rights in one or more of these areas, and if your rights are not leased or currently producing, you may well qualify.Q: What kind of dollar amount can I expect to receive for a lump sum one time payment from my mineral rights interest?A: The final amount depends on several variables. Each of these is subject to your particular property. Unleased and open mineral acreage is always of greater worth. If that is the current status of your acreage, you currently stand at a greater advantage to profit.Oklahoma Oil and Gas Mineral Rights Buyer offers TOP PAYMENT  for their client's mineral rights. Call us today to see what that means to you.If your mineral rights are currently Leased we must review your current langued of the negotiated lease. How much was your bonus per acre, How much did you negotiate for the royalty interest if they ever drill a will how much will you receive from the production.If it is Leased or Unleased the main factor can be the are of your minerals. For example their are areas of intrest in oklahoma and in texas at this time the can bring 3 or 4 times of some areas that may only have a value of $300 or $400 per net mineral acre.Oklahoma oil and gas mineral rights buyers and Oil Gas investors also have a team of experts including a world renowned geologists. Before we can Risk Large sums of up Front we will research and yes some times we may not be able to offer any payment not all mineral rights have a perception or value. Their is no risk you the mineral owner we incur all risk we pass no cost on to you we will review and evaluate if we can make an offer completely at are own cost. Q: Are there any limits to the amount of acreage you're interested in?A: Whether you have a few acres or several thousand, we are interested in talking with you. Call us for a free no-obligation consultation.Q: If I have only a few acres, will I get the same type treatment as a large mineral owner?A: Regardless of the size of your Net mineral acreage or royalty income position, we treat every clientwith the same importance and respect. Oklahoma Oil and Gas Mineral Rights Buyer prides themselves on their professional approach in serving their many clients.Q: How long of a wait should I expect before seeing any profits?A: If you prefer a quick turnaround, it is best to sell your oil, gas, and mineral rights for their current per acre value. This is fastest way to receive a profit for your mineral ownership. Leasing your mineral rights is another way to profit for your mineral ownership, but that return is subject to future exploration and production volumes.Q: Why can't I represent my own oil, gas, and mineral rights interests?A: Maximizing your mineral rights profits requires an advanced knowledge of the oil, gas, and gas liquids industry. This includes being knowledgeable with each aspect of preproduction, production, transportation, and sales. Being unfamiliar with these issues will grossly affect the ability to maximize your available mineral rights profits. As far as self-production, keep in mind that Oil and gas companies pay a proportionate share of the cost of every well. This usually equates to hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars. You may be in a position to dothe very same thing, but for the vast majority of mineral rights owners that type of investment is out of the question. The best choice is having Oklahoma Oil and Gas Mineral Rights Buyer act as your expert. Our involvement will help insure that you receive the highest profits from your mineral rights.Purchasing your rights is worth more to us. This is because my call us today and find out what' we could pay now for your rights.Q: Is there any tax benefits to selling your oil, gas, and mineral rights versus collecting royalty income?A: One of the things we hear more than any other is weighing the taxation pros and cons regarding selling minerals verses waiting on the royalty income. Selling these rights is considered a sale of real property, and is taxed at capital gains rates. An example of how this works is found in for 2012 capital gains taxes. These taxes have a 15 cap, and if you happen to be in the bottom 2 brackets you will not pay any taxes. Given the current tax law, the capital gains cap is set to increase in 2013 as much as 20 Regardless of whether you are in the lowestincome tax brackets, the capital gains tax will be raised up to 10. Any royalty income is taxed according to ordinary income tax rates, which in many cases can more than double your tax liability. Consequently, there are real, significant tax advantages associated with selling minerals, compared to the greater burden and liabilities created with simply collecting royalty income.Q: Will my bonus and royalty income exceed the proceeds of selling to become a consistent source of income?A: The answer to that question depends solely on the following five points: (1) If you can lease your interest, and lease it every 3-5 years, so you could collect a new signing bonus each time. (2) If a well is drilled. (3) If that well is not a dry hole. (4) If that well is operated in a prudent manner. (5) And, most importantly, if oil, natural gas, and gas liquids pricing sustains both continued production and the risk of new exploration. Please, remember that no one person or company has control over these variables.Q: What about "pooling"?A: Pooling issues are best answered on an individual basis. Call us at this number for additional answers to this issue: (405) 819-6170Q: Don't I need legal counsel before making such a decision?A: Legal counsel is generally indispensable, however, Attorneys tend to drag their feet, thereby causing their clients to miss valuable, time sensitive opportunities. We have seen this happen more times than not. Usually after waiting several weeks or months, we finally receive a phone call asking if the opportunity in question is still available. Sadly, 99 of the time, too much time has elapsed and the monies available back then are no longer appropriated. In this type case, the Attorney profits, not the mineral owner. However, leasing directly with Oklahoma Oil and Gas Mineral Rights Buyer allows for the negotiation of terms that might otherwise not be possible.Q: What makes your company any better than the others doing the same thing?A: First and foremost because of our many years of experience. How this helps you is that we know what it takes to achieve the best possible profits for your mineral rights. We know about the many factors associated with mineral leasing and royalty payments. This knowledge doesn't come through guesswork, but through our many years of hands-on experience. Let us show why partnering your mineral rights with our experience can bring you profitable success.If you want information about selling or leasing your oil, gas, and mineral rights, contacts us at: (405) 819-6170     Zip Code   Sell Mineral Rightsbuyers in Oklahoma and Mineral Rights in West Virginia Oklahoma Mineral Rights Buyers Are Buying and Leasing Mineral rights​Sell your royalty income From Oil or Gas Production in Carter County, Kingfisher County OK, Stephens County;Garvin county mineral rights, McClain Oklahoma, Grady County Mineral rights, Blaine County Ok, Canadian County, Caddo county Mineral Rights .

Sadly, 99% of the time, I have to tell them it is not.If a lease is to be negotiated in this case, then the terms would be competitive, relative to the options above, however, there are some unavoidable and pertinent questions that must be asked:Will your bonus and royalty income exceed the proceeds of selling, and be a consistent source of income. The answer to that question depends solely on the answers to the next 5.- If you can lease your interest, and lease it every 3-5 years, so you could collect a new signing bonus each time.- If a well is drilled.- If that well is not a dry hole.- If that well is operated in a prudent manner.- And, most importantly, IF oil, natural gas, and gas liquids prices will sustain continued production, and the risk of new exploration.These are questions that are often not asked, and not one, or any combination of these is guaranteed, and no one person or company has control of these variables.Here are some of the tax benefits of selling versus collecting royalty income:One of the things I hear more than any other is weighing the pros/cons regarding taxation when selling minerals vs. waiting on the royalty income. Selling is considered a sale of real property, and is taxed at capital gains rates.Things to Consider:- For 2012, capital gains taxes have a 15% cap, and if you happen to be in the bottom 2 brackets you will not pay any taxes.- Given the current tax law, the capital gains cap is set to increase in 2013 as much as 20% Regardless of whether you are in the lowest income tax brackets, the capital gains tax will be raised up to 10%.- Any royalty income is taxed according to ordinary income tax rates, which in many cases, can more than double your tax liability.- Consequently, there are real, significant tax advantages associated with selling minerals, compared to the greater burden and liabilities created with simply collecting royalty income.​Again, unleased, open mineral acreage is always worth more, and that is the current status of your acreage in Section 32. If you are asking yourself why it would be worth more to my company, then that is because my company would then pay it's proportionate share of the cost of a well, which is usually hundreds of thousands, if not millions to participate. You may be in a position to do the very same thing, but most are not.    call us today and find out what' we could  pay now for your rights     Mineral Rights and RoyaltiesWe can convert your mineral rights now into a lump sum Call (405) 819-6170Sell Your Oil and Gas Royalties and Mineral Rights:Oklahoma mineral rights and royalty Buyers are experts and will guide you through the often complex procedure of selling your royalties OIL AND GAS  Mineral Rights will evaluate your property ( Land ,Lease terms  ) in a friendly, professional manner .

The article is called Aeg Mineral  $2.50 million  Financing. Anthoni Visconsi II  Published Aug 18  SEC Filing and is was published by Octafinance.com at http://www.octafinance.com/aeg-mineral-2-50-million-financing-anthoni-visconsi-ii-published-aug-18-sec-filing/164909/.CaptchaSubmit
Aeg Mineral  Financing
Aeg Mineral, Llc, Limited Liability Company just  filed form D  for $2.50 million equity financing. This is a new filing. Aeg Mineral  was able to  fundraise $1.30 million so far. That is 52.00% of the  round of financing. The total  offering amount was $2.50 million.  The form was filed on 2015-08-18. The reason for the financing was: unspecified.  The fundraising still has about $1.20 million more and is not closed yet. We have to wait more to see if the offering will be fully taken.
 Aeg Mineral  is based in Ohio. The  filler’s business is Investing. The  form was  signed by Anthoni Visconsi II Manager.  The company was incorporated in 2015. The filler’s address is: 30050 Chagrin Blvd., Ste. 360, Pepper Pike, Oh, Ohio, 44124.  Anthoni Visconsi Ii is the related person in the form and it has address: 30050 Chagrin Blvd., Ste. 360, Pepper Pike, Oh, Ohio, 44124. Link to Aeg Mineral  Filing: 000165130315000001.
Analysis of Aeg Mineral  Offering
On average,  startups in the Investing sector, sell 66.70% of the total offering  amount. Aeg Mineral  sold 52.00% of the offering.  The financing is still open. The average  financing size for companies in the Investing industry is $1.41 million. The offering was 7.74% smaller than the average of $1.41 million.  Of course this should not be  interpreted as negative.  Firms  raise funds for  a variety of  reasons and needs. The minimum investment for this  fundraising  is set at $100000. If you know more about the reasons for the  financing, please comment below.
What is Form D? What It Is Used For
Form D disclosures could be used to track and understand better your competitors. The information in Form D is usually highly confidential for ventures and startups and they don’t like revealing it. This is because it reveals amount raised or planned to be raised as well as reasons for the financing. This could help competitors. Entrepreneurs usually want to keep their financing a ‘secret’ so they can stay in stealth mode for longer.
Why Fundraising Reporting Is Good For Aeg Mineral  Also
The Form D signed by Anthoni Visconsi II might help Aeg Mineral, Llc’s sector. First, it helps potential customers feel more safe to deal with a firm that is well financed. The odds are higher that it will stay in the business. Second, this could attract other investors such as venture-capital firms, funds and angels. Third, positive PR effects could even bring leasing firms and venture lenders.

If you own the mineral rights in one or more of these areas, and if your rights are not leased or currently producing, you may well qualify.Q: What kind of dollar amount can I expect to receive for a lump sum one time payment from my mineral rights interest?A: The final amount depends on several variables. Each of these is subject to your particular property. Unleased and open mineral acreage is always of greater worth. If that is the current status of your acreage, you currently stand at a greater advantage to profit.Oklahoma Oil and Gas Mineral Rights Buyer offers TOP PAYMENT  for their client's mineral rights.

How much was your bonus per acre, How much did you negotiate for the royalty interest if they ever drill a will how much will you receive from the production.If it is Leased or Unleased the main factor can be the are of your minerals. For example their are areas of intrest in oklahoma and in texas at this time the can bring 3 or 4 times of some areas that may only have a value of $300 or $400 per net mineral acre.Oklahoma oil and gas mineral rights buyers and Oil Gas investors also have a team of experts including a world renowned geologists.

Call us for a free no-obligation consultation.Q: If I have only a few acres, will I get the same type treatment as a large mineral owner?A: Regardless of the size of your Net mineral acreage or royalty income position, we treat every clientwith the same importance and respect. Oklahoma Oil and Gas Mineral Rights Buyer prides themselves on their professional approach in serving their many clients.Q: How long of a wait should I expect before seeing any profits?A: If you prefer a quick turnaround, it is best to sell your oil, gas, and mineral rights for their current per acre value. This is fastest way to receive a profit for your mineral ownership. Leasing your mineral rights is another way to profit for your mineral ownership, but that return is subject to future exploration and production volumes.Q: Why can't I represent my own oil, gas, and mineral rights interests?A: Maximizing your mineral rights profits requires an advanced knowledge of the oil, gas, and gas liquids industry. This includes being knowledgeable with each aspect of preproduction, production, transportation, and sales. Being unfamiliar with these issues will grossly affect the ability to maximize your available mineral rights profits. As far as self-production, keep in mind that Oil and gas companies pay a proportionate share of the cost of every well. This usually equates to hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars. You may be in a position to dothe very same thing, but for the vast majority of mineral rights owners that type of investment is out of the question. The best choice is having Oklahoma Oil and Gas Mineral Rights Buyer act as your expert. Our involvement will help insure that you receive the highest profits from your mineral rights.Purchasing your rights is worth more to us. This is because my call us today and find out what' we could pay now for your rights.Q: Is there any tax benefits to selling your oil, gas, and mineral rights versus collecting royalty income?A: One of the things we hear more than any other is weighing the taxation pros and cons regarding selling minerals verses waiting on the royalty income. Selling these rights is considered a sale of real property, and is taxed at capital gains rates. An example of how this works is found in for 2012 capital gains taxes. These taxes have a 15 cap, and if you happen to be in the bottom 2 brackets you will not pay any taxes. Given the current tax law, the capital gains cap is set to increase in 2013 as much as 20 Regardless of whether you are in the lowestincome tax brackets, the capital gains tax will be raised up to 10. Any royalty income is taxed according to ordinary income tax rates, which in many cases can more than double your tax liability. Consequently, there are real, significant tax advantages associated with selling minerals, compared to the greater burden and liabilities created with simply collecting royalty income.Q: Will my bonus and royalty income exceed the proceeds of selling to become a consistent source of income?A: The answer to that question depends solely on the following five points: (1) If you can lease your interest, and lease it every 3-5 years, so you could collect a new signing bonus each time. (2) If a well is drilled. (3) If that well is not a dry hole. (4) If that well is operated in a prudent manner. (5) And, most importantly, if oil, natural gas, and gas liquids pricing sustains both continued production and the risk of new exploration. Please, remember that no one person or company has control over these variables.Q: What about "pooling"?A: Pooling issues are best answered on an individual basis. Call us at this number for additional answers to this issue: (405) 819-6170Q: Don't I need legal counsel before making such a decision?A: Legal counsel is generally indispensable, however, Attorneys tend to drag their feet, thereby causing their clients to miss valuable, time sensitive opportunities. We have seen this happen more times than not. Usually after waiting several weeks or months, we finally receive a phone call asking if the opportunity in question is still available. Sadly, 99 of the time, too much time has elapsed and the monies available back then are no longer appropriated. In this type case, the Attorney profits, not the mineral owner. However, leasing directly with Oklahoma Oil and Gas Mineral Rights Buyer allows for the negotiation of terms that might otherwise not be possible.Q: What makes your company any better than the others doing the same thing?A: First and foremost because of our many years of experience. How this helps you is that we know what it takes to achieve the best possible profits for your mineral rights. We know about the many factors associated with mineral leasing and royalty payments. This knowledge doesn't come through guesswork, but through our many years of hands-on experience.

Sadly, 99% of the time, I have to tell them it is not.If a lease is to be negotiated in this case, then the terms would be competitive, relative to the options above, however, there are some unavoidable and pertinent questions that must be asked:Will your bonus and royalty income exceed the proceeds of selling, and be a consistent source of income. The answer to that question depends solely on the answers to the next 5.- If you can lease your interest, and lease it every 3-5 years, so you could collect a new signing bonus each time.- If a well is drilled.- If that well is not a dry hole.- If that well is operated in a prudent manner.- And, most importantly, IF oil, natural gas, and gas liquids prices will sustain continued production, and the risk of new exploration.These are questions that are often not asked, and not one, or any combination of these is guaranteed, and no one person or company has control of these variables.Here are some of the tax benefits of selling versus collecting royalty income:One of the things I hear more than any other is weighing the pros/cons regarding taxation when selling minerals vs. waiting on the royalty income. Selling is considered a sale of real property, and is taxed at capital gains rates.Things to Consider:- For 2012, capital gains taxes have a 15% cap, and if you happen to be in the bottom 2 brackets you will not pay any taxes.- Given the current tax law, the capital gains cap is set to increase in 2013 as much as 20% Regardless of whether you are in the lowest income tax brackets, the capital gains tax will be raised up to 10%.- Any royalty income is taxed according to ordinary income tax rates, which in many cases, can more than double your tax liability.- Consequently, there are real, significant tax advantages associated with selling minerals, compared to the greater burden and liabilities created with simply collecting royalty income.​Again, unleased, open mineral acreage is always worth more, and that is the current status of your acreage in Section 32. If you are asking yourself why it would be worth more to my company, then that is because my company would then pay it's proportionate share of the cost of a well, which is usually hundreds of thousands, if not millions to participate.
