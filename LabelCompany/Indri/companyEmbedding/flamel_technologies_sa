                                Flamel Technologies and Digna Biotech enter multiple product development agreement





                                Lyon, France

                                Wednesday, June 29, 2011, 12:00 Hrs  [IST]









                                Flamel Technologies SA and Digna Biotech SL announced that the two companies have entered into a joint development agreement for the pre-clinical and clinical development of multiple products. The agreement has been structured to leverage Digna's ground breaking research, preclinical and clinical development efforts, and Flamel's formulation expertise in creating safer, more efficacious products using its innovative proprietary drug delivery platforms, Medusa and Micropump.Flamel will be primarily responsible for the formulation and manufacturing process development and Digna will be primarily responsible for the preclinical and clinical development. The three initial Digna products that have been identified for development under the agreement are P144, P17, and Methylthiadenosine (MTA). All of these molecules have shown significant activity in preclinical studies involving multiple indications with high unmet medical need. Both companies expect that the achievement of clinical proof of concept data under the joint development agreement will result in significant additional value creation for the parties.P144 (Disitertide) is a Transforming Growth Factor beta-1 (TGF-beta1) inhibitor. A topical formulation of P144 has been studied in a phase II trial involving the treatment of systemic sclerosis or scleroderma, a multi-system disorder characterized by the excessive synthesis and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins that result in the fibrosis of skin and visceral organs.The data indicated a statistically significant increase in the number of patients that noticed improvements of the treated skin area (p<0.034).  P144 has also been successfully evaluated in pre-clinical animal models of organ fibrosis and macular degeneration. A Medusa-enabled formulation of Digna's P144 for controlled release via subcutaneous injection will be developed by Flamel for initial evaluation by Digna in pulmonary fibrosis.P17 is another TGF-beta1 inhibitor which has been evaluated in preclinical studies and has shown promising activity for potential application in the treatment of cirrhosis, as well as to prevent angiogenesis and metastasis. A Medusa-enabled formulation of Digna's P17 for controlled release via subcutaneous injection will be developed by Flamel for evaluation by Digna for the potential treatment of multiple indications. The joint development agreement anticipates that clinical development of one of the two TGF-beta1 inhibitors will be prioritized based on preclinical data from the two formulations.Methylthiadenosine (MTA) is an oral immunomodulator that has also been shown to have neuroprotective properties in a variety of animal models.  These combined properties make it a strong candidate for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. A Micropump-enabled formulation, designed specifically to increase both solubility and stability of Digna's Methylthiadenosine (MTA), will be developed by Flamel for evaluation by Digna in Multiple Sclerosis.Stephen H Willard, Flamel's chief executive officer, stated, “This agreement has been designed to allow both companies to focus on our respective comparative advantages so that we may develop these projects further before partnering. This could generate potential greater economic returns for both companies in the three initial products we will be developing. As previously announced, Flamel is reaching out, as a complement to our core activities with large pharmaceutical companies, to identify and partner with smaller companies with exceptional potential in early stage molecules. This can create greater value for shareholders and investors of both companies by advancing highly promising candidates into proof of concept clinical trials. We are pleased to be working with Digna Biotech in the development of these three products, which we believe may offer important advantages to patients suffering from a number of serious indications.”“All of the molecules subject to this agreement have the potential to become first in class products serving large areas of unmet medical need,” commented Dr Pablo Ortiz, Digna Biotech's chief executive officer. “Our extensive preclinical work on the three molecules has convinced us that each may be applicable in multiple indications. By applying Flamel's drug delivery expertise, we expect to improve the applicability of these promising candidates to the indications we are seeking to address. We also expect to fuel this collaboration with further innovative molecules in Digna's pipeline as we develop further preclinical data in those programmes.”P144 is a synthetic peptide of 14 amino acids (730-743) of human TGF-b1 RIII (Betaglican), acting as a TGF-beta 1 inhibitor, as described by Ezquerro I-J. et al. (2003). This peptide binds and blocks the biological activity of the cytokine Transforming Growth Factor beta1 (TGF-beta1).  This cytokine has multiple and potent biological effects over cell growth regulation, immunomodulation, angiogenesis, fibrogenesis, and tumor development, among others. Blocking TGF-beta 1 could be an important factor to limit or reverse fibrosis in different organs and therefore ameliorate various sclerosis conditions. Digna Biotech is investigating other potential indications for Disitertide including cardiac fibrosis, prosthetic implant-induced fibrosis and wet macular degeneration of retina.P17 is a synthetic peptide of 15 amino acids selected by phage display on the basis of its ability to bind to human TGF-beta isoforms 1, 2 and 3, acting as a TGF-beta 1 inhibitor, as described by Dotor J. et al. (2007).  P17 may be applicable for the treatment of liver fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, metastasis of lung cancer to bone, angiogenis, melanoma, immunosuppression and wet macular degeneration of retina.Methylthioadenosine (MTA) is a naturally occurring sulfur-containing nucleoside present in all mammalian tissues, as described by Avila M.A. et al. (2004). The combination of immunomodulatory and neuroprotective activity is of particular interest in the potential treatment of numerous indications with high unmet medical need. MTA may be applicable for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, transplant rejection and multiple sclerosis, among other potential central nervous disorders.The Medusa drug delivery platform consists of proprietary nanogels for the formulation and/or the extended release of a broad range of biologics (including proteins, antibodies, peptides and vaccines) and of small molecules (injectable drugs). The nanogel has been proven to be safe and biodegradable: Flamel Technologies filed a DMF for Medusa with the FDA on February 12, 2011 (assigned number 024634). Medusa enables the controlled delivery from 1 day up to 14 days of non-denatured or non-modified drugs that maintain full bioactivity. It is used to develop Biobetters with potentially improved efficacy and reduced toxicity, as well as greater patient convenience.The Micropump micro-encapsulation drug delivery platform (oral drugs) is designed to increase the absorption time of drugs, particularly for drugs only absorbed in the small intestine. It enables the achievement of precise pharmacokinetics and it can be presented in various dosage forms such as capsules, tablets, sachets or oral suspensions (LiquiTime) without modifying the release rate. Flamel has also developed another drug delivery technology for oral drugs, i.e. Trigger Lock for the controlled release of narcotic and opioid analgesics while defeating most commonly employed methods of tampering.Flamel Technologies SA is a leading drug delivery company focused on the goal of developing safer, more efficacious formulations of drugs that address unmet medical needs.Digna Biotech SL is a clinical stage biotech company that has developed 3 molecules to clinical phase in 6 years and its mission is to develop and commercialize the intellectual property generated at Centre for Applied Medical Research (CIMA; Pamplona, Spain).

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Management's Discussion and Analysis  (In thousands, except per share data)  (Unaudited)  You should read the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations set forth in this Item 2 together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, and reference is made to the "Cautionary Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" set forth immediately following the Table of Content of the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 15, 2016 (the "2015 Annual Report") for further information on the forward looking statements herein. In addition, you should read the "Risk Factors" section in Part I, Item 1A of the 2015 Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this quarterly report.  Overview  We are a specialty pharmaceutical company utilizing core competencies in drug delivery and formulation to develop safer and more efficacious pharmaceutical products to address unmet medical needs and/or reduce overall healthcare costs. Flamel has a business model consisting of:  � an Unapproved Marketed Drugs ("UMDs") business with two approved products in the United States, Bloxiverz(R) (neostigmine methylsulfate injection) and Vazculep(R) (phenylephrine hydrochloride injection) that are currently marketed, a third product, Akovaz(R) (ephedrine sulphate injection) for which we obtained FDA approval on April 29, 2016 and which we intend to begin marketing in the third quarter of 2016, and a fourth product currently being studied by us for possible submission for review by the FDA. The UMD business was obtained through the acquisition of �clat on March 13, 2012,  � a branded pediatric specialty pharmaceutical business, with three FDA approved products and one FDA approved medical device, acquired through the acquisition of FSC on February 5, 2016; and  � a branded business, focusing on the development of products utilizing Flamel's proprietary drug delivery platforms. The branded products that are based on Flamel's proprietary drug delivery platforms target high-value solid and liquid oral and alternative dosage forms using 505(b)(2) and Biosimilar pathways where the Company is able to develop strong intellectual property positions and deliver meaningful patient benefits.  Flamel's business model allows the Company to select, develop, seek approval for, and commercialize niche branded and generic products, initially targeted for the U.S. market. The Company is currently able to self-fund the development of most product development opportunities. On May 2, 2016, the company announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the Company's New Drug Application (NDA) for Akovaz(TM) (ephedrine sulfate), a drug administered parenterally as a pressor agent to address clinically important hypotension in surgical settings. The NDA, which is the first to receive approval from the FDA for ephedrine sulfate, was approved as scheduled on April 29, 2016. Flamel expects to launch Akovaz during the third quarter 2016 in a strength of 50mg/mL.  Strategy  The Company's business strategy is designed to drive overall sales and earnings growth while maintaining a return on invested capital at an appropriate premium above the Company's cost of capital. Our key areas of focus address the most significant opportunities and challenges facing the Company, including:  � Unapproved Marketed Drug Development: The Company now derives cash flow and profitability from the sales of two of its UMD products. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 the Company generated $36,041 and $70,194 of sales from the UMD products compared to $47,910 and $79,877 in the same period of 2015, respectively.  o The first UMD product, Bloxiverz, which had sales of $25,620 and $50,367 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, was approved by the FDA on May 31, 2013, and is currently being marketed in the U.S.  o The second UMD product, Vazculep, which had sales of $10,421 and $19,827 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, was approved by the FDA on June 27, 2014 and launched in October 2014 in the U.S.  o A third UMD product, Akovaz, the brand name for the Company's ephedrine sulfate injection, obtained NDA approval on April 29, 2016. We expect to begin marketing this product before September 30, 2016.  - 20 -  Each of the above products are currently or will be commercialized in the United States by Flamel's subsidiary �clat. These products were derived from the acquisition of �clat, which has focused on pursuing FDA approvals through the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. Through our acquisition of �clat we obtained marketing and licensing knowledge of the commercial and regulatory process in the U.S. and E.U. We believe this knowledge has enhanced our ability to identify product candidates for development, leverage new opportunities for the application of our drug delivery platforms, and license and market products in the U.S and E.U. The revenues from these UMD products are now generating cash flow which we can use to fund our second strategy, the development and commercialization of our drug delivery products.  � Development and Commercialization of the Company's Drug Delivery Pipeline Products: In addition to the UMD strategy, the Company is continuing to advance the commercialization of its innovative drug delivery platforms. We have now enhanced our ability to identify new product candidates and to pursue commercial opportunities associated with our drug delivery platforms. The Company's drug delivery platforms allow the creation of competitive and differentiated drug product profiles (e.g., with improved pharmacokinetics, efficacy and/or safety). Flamel owns and develops drug delivery platforms that address key formulation challenges, leading to the development of differentiated drug products for administration in various forms (e.g., capsules, tablets, sachets or liquid suspensions for oral use; or injectables for subcutaneous administration) and can be applied to a broad range of drugs (novel, already-marketed, or off-patent). These product development opportunities allow us to protect our products through patent protection and product differentiation. As a result of developing its own drug delivery platforms the Company's business is now less dependent on the development activities performed by partners, and relies more on the development of its own, self-funded, products. Our proprietary drug delivery platforms include:  o Micropump(R) is a microparticulate system that allows the development and marketing of modified and/or controlled release of solid, oral dosage formulations of drugs (Micropump(R)-carvedilol and Micropump(R)-aspirin formulations have been approved in the U.S. and in the E.U., respectively.  o LiquiTime(R) allows development of modified/controlled release oral products in a liquid suspension formulation particularly suited to children or for patients having issues swallowing tablets or capsules.  o Trigger Lock(TM) allows development of abuse-resistant modified/controlled release formulations of narcotic/opioid analgesics and other drugs susceptible to abuse.  o Medusa(TM) allows the development of extended/modified release of injectable dosage formulations of drugs (e.g., peptides, polypeptides, proteins, and small molecules).  Several products formulated using our proprietary drug delivery platforms are currently under various stages of development for possible marketing either by the Company and/or by partners via licensing/distribution agreements.  The key elements of our pipeline strategy include:  o Continuing to build commercially successful products utilizing Micropump;  o Identifying opportunities and optimizing time-to-market for our (not yet approved) drug delivery platforms, i.e., LiquiTime, Trigger Lock and Medusa;  o Maximizing the technical potential of our existing drug delivery platforms for developing new and proprietary products; and  o Developing and validating improved and complementary drug delivery platforms related to our current drug delivery capabilities.  � Inorganic growth through Acquisitions and/or Partnerships: The Company maintains a strong balance sheet with substantial liquidity and little long term debt. As part of its overall enterprise strategy, the Company expects to explore and pursue appropriate inorganic growth opportunities that complement its drug delivery platforms or acquire proprietary products that enhance profitability and cash flow. This was evidenced in early 2016 with the acquisition of FSC, a specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to providing innovative solutions to unmet medical needs for pediatric patients. Additionally, the Company will leverage the capabilities of its existing and future proprietary products and/or drug delivery platforms with pharmaceutical and biotechnology partnerships or licensing transactions. In 2015, the Company completed a licensing transaction for its LiquiTime technology-based OTC products which was licensed to Elan Pharma International Limited.  Key Business Trends and Highlights  In operating our business and monitoring our performance, we consider a number of performance measures, as well as trends affecting our industry as a whole, which include the following:  � Healthcare and Regulatory Reform: Various health care reform laws in the U.S. may impact our ability to successfully commercialize our products and technologies. The success of our commercialization efforts may depend on the extent to which the government health administration authorities, the health insurance funds in the E.U. Member States, private health insurers and other third party payers in the U.S. will reimburse consumers for the cost of healthcare products and services.  - 21 -  � Pricing Environment for Pharmaceuticals: The pricing environment continues to be in the spotlight of many regulators. As a result the need to obtain and maintain appropriate pricing and reimbursement for our products may become more challenging due to, among other things, the attention being paid to healthcare cost containment and other austerity measures in the U.S. and worldwide.  � Generics Playing a Larger Role in Healthcare: Generic pharmaceutical products will continue to play a large role in the U.S. healthcare system. Specifically the Company has seen additional generic competition to its products and continues to expect generic competition in the future.  � Access to and Cost of Capital: The recent tightening of credit in the U.S. may create challenges for the Company if it were to have the need to raise capital. Currently the Company has no needs to raise capital.  Highlights of our condensed consolidated results for the six months ended June 30, 2016 are as follows:  � Revenue was $38,858 and $75,074 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $48,602 and $81,128 in the same periods last year. This decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in Bloxiverz sales volume as a result of additional competition, partially offset by an increase in sales volume and pricing of Vazculep.  � Operating loss was $11,543 and $5,839 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to operating loss of $2,370 and operating income of $7,644 in the same periods last year.  � Net loss was $19,958 and $26,016 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $16,858 and $3,645 in the same periods last year. These increases were largely driven by a decrease in sales and increases in selling, general and administrative expenses in the current year.  � Diluted net loss per share was $0.48 and $0.63 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $0.42 and $0.09 in the same periods last year.  � Cash and marketable securities increased $10,061 to $154,863 from $144,802 at December 31, 2015.  Critical Accounting Estimates  The Company's condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. To prepare these financial statements, management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be significantly different from these estimates.  Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the audited consolidated financial statements included in our 2015 Form 10-K. The SEC suggests companies provide additional disclosure on those accounting policies considered most critical. The SEC considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management in its application. Our estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. It is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. For a complete discussion of our critical accounting policies, see the "Critical Accounting Policies" section of the MD&A in our 2015 Form 10-K. There were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies, with the exception of changes made to our revenue recognition policy disclosed below, during the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Revenue. Revenue includes sales of pharmaceutical products, amortization of licensing fees, milestone payments for R&D achievements, and compensation for the execution of R&D activities.  Product Sales and Services  Revenue is generally realized or realizable and earned when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company records revenue from product sales when title and risk of ownership have been transferred to the customer, which is typically upon delivery to the customer and when the selling price is determinable. As is customary in the pharmaceutical industry, the Company's gross product sales are subject to a variety of deductions in arriving at reported net product sales. These adjustments include estimates for product returns, chargebacks, payment discounts, rebates, and other sales allowances and are estimated based on analysis of historical data for the product or comparable products, as well as future expectations for such products.  For generic products and branded products sold in mature markets where the ultimate net selling price to customer is estimable, the Company recognizes revenues upon shipment to the wholesaler. For new product launches the Company recognizes revenue once sufficient data is available to determine product acceptance in the marketplace such that product returns may be estimated based on historical data and there is evidence of reorders and consideration is made of wholesaler inventory levels.  - 22 -  Prior to the second quarter 2016, the Company did not have sufficient historical data to estimate certain revenue deductions. As such, it could not accurately estimate the ultimate net selling price of its �clat portfolio of products and as a result delayed revenue recognition until the wholesaler sold the product through to its customers.  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company determined that it has sufficient evidence, history, data and internal controls to estimate the ultimate selling price of its products upon shipment from its warehouse to its customers, the wholesalers. Accordingly, it discontinued the sell through revenue approach and now recognizes revenue once the product is shipped from its warehouse. As a result of this change in accounting estimate, the Company recognized $5,981 in additional revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 that previously would have been deferred until sold by the wholesalers to the hospitals. The impact of this change is reflected as revenue in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Loss for the periods reported.  License and Research Revenue  The Company's license and research revenues consist of fees and milestone payments. Non-refundable fees where we have continuing performance obligations are deferred and are recognized ratably over our projected performance period. We recognize milestone payments, which are typically related to regulatory, commercial or other achievements by us or our licensees and distributors, as revenues when the milestone is accomplished and collection is reasonably assured.  - 23 -  Aug 15, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
