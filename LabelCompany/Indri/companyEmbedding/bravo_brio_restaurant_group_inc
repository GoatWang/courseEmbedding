We are always interested in talking to potential Team Members who have a heart and a passion for hospitality.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Bravo Brio Restaurant Group, Inc. Provides Business Update






GlobeNewswire



Jun 8, 2017 5:42 PM EDT













 


















































  Obtains Waiver Agreement for Credit Agreement  Company to Present at Two  Investor Conferences  COLUMBUS, Ohio, June 08, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bravo Brio Restaurant Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:BBRG) (the Company), owner and operator of the BRAVO! Cucina Italiana (BRAVO!) and BRIO Tuscan Grille (BRIO) restaurant concepts, today provided a business update.  Current PerformanceBrian O'Malley, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We continue to see sequential quarterly sales improvement in our core restaurant base and remain cautiously optimistic that we will see that improvement continue as the year progresses. Guests are reacting positively to our enhanced menus, expanded banquet facilities, and are also taking greater advantage of our off-premise to-go and delivery options. We are further encouraged by the traction we are gaining through our updated training program test which is centered around elevating the dining experience."  Waiver AgreementThe Company and Wells Fargo Bank, and certain lenders under the Company's credit agreement entered into a waiver agreement. The waiver agreement provides a limited waiver of certain events of default by the Company under the credit agreement relating to the Company's non-compliance with the consolidated lease-adjusted leverage ratio contained in the credit agreement which arose out of the Company's requests for, and borrowings of, loans made during the second quarter.  Pursuant to and subject to the terms of the waiver agreement, the required lenders waived such existing events of default. Jim O'Connor, Chief Financial Officer, said, "We just obtained a waiver to our credit agreement and we are working diligently with our lender to amend our existing credit agreement, which we expect to have completed by the second quarter earnings call. While we expect to be in full compliance with our current credit agreement by the end of the second quarter, the amendment should provide us additional financial flexibility as we continue to see our operating performance improve."

	Existing Events of Default


	”);











	WHEREAS, the Borrower has requested that the Required Lenders waive the Existing Events of Default; and









	WHEREAS, the Required Lenders are willing to waive the Existing Events of Default subject to the terms and conditions set forth below.











	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

	Effective Period


	”).









	(b)


	    


	Upon the earlier to occur of the events set forth in clause (a) above, (i) each of the Existing Events of Default shall be reinstated  as if such Existing Event of Default had not been waived hereby and shall constitute an Existing Event of Default occurring on the applicable date of such Existing Event of Default and  (ii) the  Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be immediately entitled to exercise any or all of their rights and remedies arising in respect thereof, including, without limitation,

	(c)

	Bravo Brio Restaurant Group, Inc. Provides Business Update









	Obtains Waiver Agreement for Credit Agreement









	Company to Present at Two Investor Conferences









	Columbus, Ohio - June 8, 2017 - Bravo Brio Restaurant Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: BBRG) (the Company), owner and operator of the BRAVO! Cucina Italiana (BRAVO!) and BRIO Tuscan Grille (BRIO) restaurant concepts, today provided a business update.









	Current Performance




	Brian O'Malley, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We continue to see sequential quarterly sales improvement in our core restaurant base and remain cautiously optimistic that we will see that improvement continue as the year progresses. Guests are reacting positively to our enhanced menus, expanded banquet facilities, and are also taking greater advantage of our off-premise to-go and delivery options. We are further encouraged by the traction we are gaining through our updated training program test which is centered around elevating the dining experience.”









	Waiver Agreement




	The Company and Wells Fargo Bank, and certain lenders under the Company’s credit agreement entered into a waiver agreement. The waiver agreement provides a limited waiver of certain events of defaults by the Company under the credit agreement relating to the Company’s non-compliance with the consolidated lease-adjusted leverage ratio contained in the credit agreement which arose out of the Company’s requests for, and borrowings of, loans made during the second quarter. Pursuant to and subject to the terms of the waiver agreement, the required lenders waived such existing events of default.









	Jim O'Connor, Chief Financial Officer, said, "We just obtained a waiver to our credit agreement and we are working diligently with our lender to amend our existing credit agreement, which we expect to have completed by the second quarter earnings call. While we expect to be in full compliance with our current credit agreement by the end of the second quarter, the amendment should provide us additional financial flexibility as we continue to see our operating performance improve.”









	Investor Conferences




	The Company will be participating at the following upcoming conferences:


















	–






	On Tuesday, June 13, 2017, the Company will present at the 37



	th



	Annual Piper Jaffray Consumer Conference at The Lotte New York Palace Hotel in New York City. The presentation will begin at 2:55 PM ET.





















	–
