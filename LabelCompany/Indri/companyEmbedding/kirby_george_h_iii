			George H. Kirby has served as our President, Chief Executive Office and a member of our Board of Directors since January 20, 2015, replacing Interim Chief Executive Officer David L. Keller. Prior to this, he joined AECOM Technology Corporation (NYSE: ACM) a leading provider of engineering, procurement and construction ("EPC") services in September 2013 as Senior Vice President. In this role, he led their Energy Business Line for the north U.S. region providing services for utilities, power transmission and generation developers, and large industrial energy efficiency end-users. Prior to AECOM, he joined SAIC Energy, Environment, & Infrastructure (NYSE: SAIC) in January 2012 a global leader in solutions for national security, healthcare and engineering, as Managing Director for their Asset Transactions group providing power generation investors and developers with technical and market consulting and advisory services, and was promoted to Vice President in 2013 providing EPC services to Investor Owned Utilities. In 2009, he joined American Superconductor (NASDAQ: AMSC) as Director of Global Sales and was promoted to Managing Director of the Americas and Australia in 2011. From 2000 to 2009, Mr. Kirby held significant leadership roles at General Electric in both GE Energy and GE Capital (NYSE: GE) in product development, global sales, quality and project finance. In June 2016, Mr. Kirby was elected to the Board of Trustees of the Sea Research Foundation, a non-profit organization in Mystic, Connecticut. Mr. Kirby previously served as a director of Blade Dynamics, LLC from April to December 2011, and Schooner, Inc. from June to October 2012. Mr. Kirby earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering from Syracuse University in 1992 and an M.B.A. from Smeal College of Business at Pennsylvania State University in 2008. We believe Mr. Kirby's significant leadership experience in energy industries qualifies him to serve on our Board of Directors.
