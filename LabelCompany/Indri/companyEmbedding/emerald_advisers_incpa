What are analysts saying about Abbott Laboratories stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Abbott Laboratories stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "For the majority of last one month, Abbott is trading above the broader Medical Products industry. We are optimistic about the company’s strong and consistent EPD and Medical Devices performance in the last reported first quarter. Overall, the company stands to benefit from the ongoing integration and synergy achievement of St. Jude. We are also looking forward to the company’s plans to focus on selling portfolio in core therapeutic areas. Recently, Abbott received CE mark for its TactiCath Sensor and Confirm Rx ICM products which is quite encouraging. The company also launched science-based nutrition drinks for better recovery from surgeries. On the flip side, Abbott’s sluggish pediatric business in China continues to hamper growth. Management is also concerned about the on-going economic problem in Venezuela that is expected to remain unresolved in the coming quarters." (6/21/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "Investment summary: We are reiterating our Overweight rating for CORI and we are raising our PT by $2 to $12 following the positive donepezil patch bioequivalence results. Progress in the development of a proprietary pipeline is key, in our opinion, to the performance of the shares. Successful development of patch formulations of donepezil (Aricept) and/or memantine (Namenda) should position the company well to more-effectively monetize the transdermal drug delivery platform, in our opinion. Retention of meaningful commercialization rights could enable the company to turn the corner and pursue other opportunities more broadly, in our opinion. Corplex donepezil pilot study shows bioequivalence. Management reported that the Corplex donepezil pilot study met the FDA statistical criteria for bioequivalence. We note, too, that the patch was well-tolerated, with good skin and GI tolerability." (5/12/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Hold Ratings, 11 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.79)Consensus Price Target: $52.38 (3.04% upside)
