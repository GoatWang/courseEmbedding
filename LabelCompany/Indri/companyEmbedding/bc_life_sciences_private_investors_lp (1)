                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.

                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient

What You Should Know




Can I get an investment property funded using NONE of my own money?

                    Yes and no. It does not have to be your personal funds, however someone will typically have
                    to put money down toward the purchase of an investment property before a lender will seriously
                    consider your loan request. Lenders want you to have "some skin in the game."
                    As a rule of thumb make sure you have 5% or more available - the more the better.
                    If you are refinancing, money down is not always necessary provided you have sufficient equity in
                    the property.
                

What exactly does CiX do?

                    CiX takes the stress out of buying and refinancing investment properties by allowing consumers to
                    get multiple
                    offers from several hard and private money, asset-based lenders in a matter of minutes.
                

We make the funding process so easy, why would you need to look elsewhere?

                    It's free and only takes about 37 seconds to request the funding you need. Your request for funding
                    will be sent
                    to our lending partners who are ready, willing and able to lend on your property. We have the most;
                    diverse,
                    active, and professional pool of lenders on the planet, so if you can't get funding here, it's very
                    likely you
                    can't get funding anywhere.
                

The stress is finally gone

                    Before CiX existed, when you needed funding for a real estate investment you only really had one
                    option… Hope.
                    You had to present your deal to the one or two lenders you could find and hope they would come
                    through.
                    This is not only stressful but very time consuming. Many real estate investors spend more time
                    looking for money
                    than looking for deals. Not anymore. With CiX you can secure the funding you need with the click of
                    a few buttons.
                

Money is now looking for you

                    Lenders have raised billions to deploy into the market and need borrowers like you to lend to. It is
                    simple supply
                    and demand. Money is now looking for you! This means you have more options, can get better rates and
                    terms, and
                    ultimately keep more of the money you make.
                

All the best real estate investment lenders are here

                    We've consolidated the nations best hardmoney + private real estate investment lenders into a
                    funding database under one virtual roof. To gain access to this elite network and a virtually
                    unlimited amount of funding for residential and commercial lending, all you have to do is request
                    the type of funding you’re looking for. The best part is, this tool is 100% free!
                

Lenders will compete to fund your investment property

                    Your request for funding is sent to a network of qualified lenders. Our software analyzes their bids
                    and matches
                    you with the lenders who are willing to meet your unique needs at the lowest rate! For the first
                    time in history,
                    the real estate investment lending industry has been consolidated and is now fully available to you
                    with the click
                    of a few buttons!
                

You can receive loans based off the deal not your credit

                    Our network of lenders provides funding based on the numbers in the deal -- not your credit. Good
                    credit does not
                    hurt, but is not required. Since loans are based on the property, personal info such as bank
                    statements, tax returns,
                    social security number are not required to get matched with the right lender(s)!
                

You sure are lucky you found us

                    No more middlemen raising prices
                    No more missing deals because you can’t get funding
                    No more wasting time looking for lenders
                    No more overpaying for money

In August 2006 the company was acquired by The Financial Times Group for £101m,[1][2] publisher of the Financial Times newspaper and FT.com. FT Group is a division of Pearson PLC, the international media group.
In September 2007, The Mergermarket Group acquired Infinata, an information solutions and marketing analytics provider to the global financial service, life science, and high technology industries.
In March 2010 the company acquired Xtract Research, which provides bond covenant data to help investors understand the impact of covenants on valuation.
In September 2012 the company acquired Inframation Group, a provider of information and senior-level events for the global infrastructure finance community.
In November 2013 Pearson agreed to sell Mergermarket to London private equity investor BC Partners in a transaction valuing the business intelligence and news service at £382m including debt. Based on the deal, Mergermarket was valued at 15 times its last year operating income.[3]
On 15 January 2014, Moody's Investors Service assigned a B3 corporate family rating to the Mergermarket Group. Moody's also assigned a (P)B2 rating to the £150m first lien term loan due 2021 and US$40m Revolving Credit Facility maturing in 2019, and a (P)Caa2 rating to the £70m second lien term loan due 2022, to be issued by Mergermarket USA Inc. The outlook on all ratings is stable. This is the first time Moody's has assigned a rating to Mergermarket.[4]
In July 2017, the Mergermarket Group rebranded as Acuris. The announcement of this move fueled speculation that a sale of the company might come in the next year.[5] Indeed, BC Partners sold a minority stake of around 30% to Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC in July 2017.[6]

GROW in WINNIPEG: Life Sciences



Life SciencesGrow Stronger: Health and Biotech
Winnipeg is a remarkable centre of discovery. When you delve into synergies among biotechnology, agriculture and life sciences, you’ll understand why. Case in point: the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health is the only Level 4 biocontainment lab in the country. We’re also host to the International Centre for Infectious Diseases, the Canadian Centre for Agri-food Research in Health and Medicine, and the Richardson Centre for Functional Foods and Nutraceuticals (located in Winnipeg’s Smartpark development on the University of Manitoba campus).
Winnipeg is the leading pharmaceutical manufacturing centre in Western Canada, and it’s also home to major informatics research organizations actively supporting e-health and data analytics.
All of this cost-effective innovation is built on a solid foundation comprised of the University of Manitoba, over 30 additional R&D institutions and a growing number of private-sector firms.
Health and biotech organizations grow stronger in Winnipeg.
Vital Stats
Winnipeg’s successful life sciences sector benefits from the city’s bio-commercialization resources, business incubators and among the lowest factor costs in North America. A highly supportive provincial government is an active industry partner, helping biotechnology startups gain access to capital and offering a variety of support resources.   
The sector is comprised of clusters of businesses in five key life science subsectors:

Medical devices
Functional foods and nutraceuticals
Bioproducts (also referred to as industrial biotech)
Health informatics
Biopharmaceuticals

Over the past 20 years, entrepreneurs within Winnipeg's biotechnology cluster have created more than 25 globally successful companies, including Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Intelligent Hospital Systems and Medicure Inc. 
Fast Facts

As a percentage of total workforce, Winnipeg boasts the highest concentration of life science professionals of any city in Canada. 
Companies in Winnipeg’s life sciences sector currently employ approximately 6,400 workers.
More than 400 Winnipeg establishments play a supporting role for the life sciences sector in the areas of research and development, laboratory research, and scientific and technical services.
The Canadian functional foods and nutraceuticals industry generated revenue in excess of $11 billion in 2011.
Winnipeg is home to the largest pharmaceutical manufacturing sector in Western Canada, anchored by three large pharmaceutical/medicine manufacturers:  Apotex Fermentation, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International and Vita Health Products.
Winnipeg's life sciences sector includes 136 manufacturing firms; 67 per cent are engaged in medical equipment and supplies manufacturing.

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'

What You Should Know




Can I get an investment property funded using NONE of my own money?

                    Yes and no. It does not have to be your personal funds, however someone will typically have
                    to put money down toward the purchase of an investment property before a lender will seriously
                    consider your loan request. Lenders want you to have "some skin in the game."
                    As a rule of thumb make sure you have 5% or more available - the more the better.
                    If you are refinancing, money down is not always necessary provided you have sufficient equity in
                    the property.
                

What exactly does CiX do?

                    CiX takes the stress out of buying and refinancing investment properties by allowing consumers to
                    get multiple
                    offers from several hard and private money, asset-based lenders in a matter of minutes.
                

We make the funding process so easy, why would you need to look elsewhere?

                    It's free and only takes about 37 seconds to request the funding you need. Your request for funding
                    will be sent
                    to our lending partners who are ready, willing and able to lend on your property. We have the most;
                    diverse,
                    active, and professional pool of lenders on the planet, so if you can't get funding here, it's very
                    likely you
                    can't get funding anywhere.
                

The stress is finally gone

                    Before CiX existed, when you needed funding for a real estate investment you only really had one
                    option… Hope.
                    You had to present your deal to the one or two lenders you could find and hope they would come
                    through.
                    This is not only stressful but very time consuming. Many real estate investors spend more time
                    looking for money
                    than looking for deals. Not anymore. With CiX you can secure the funding you need with the click of
                    a few buttons.
                

Money is now looking for you

                    Lenders have raised billions to deploy into the market and need borrowers like you to lend to. It is
                    simple supply
                    and demand. Money is now looking for you! This means you have more options, can get better rates and
                    terms, and
                    ultimately keep more of the money you make.
                

All the best real estate investment lenders are here

                    We've consolidated the nations best hardmoney + private real estate investment lenders into a
                    funding database under one virtual roof. To gain access to this elite network and a virtually
                    unlimited amount of funding for residential and commercial lending, all you have to do is request
                    the type of funding you’re looking for. The best part is, this tool is 100% free!
                

Lenders will compete to fund your investment property

                    Your request for funding is sent to a network of qualified lenders. Our software analyzes their bids
                    and matches
                    you with the lenders who are willing to meet your unique needs at the lowest rate! For the first
                    time in history,
                    the real estate investment lending industry has been consolidated and is now fully available to you
                    with the click
                    of a few buttons!
                

You can receive loans based off the deal not your credit

                    Our network of lenders provides funding based on the numbers in the deal -- not your credit. Good
                    credit does not
                    hurt, but is not required. Since loans are based on the property, personal info such as bank
                    statements, tax returns,
                    social security number are not required to get matched with the right lender(s)!
                

You sure are lucky you found us

                    No more middlemen raising prices
                    No more missing deals because you can’t get funding
                    No more wasting time looking for lenders
                    No more overpaying for money

Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
