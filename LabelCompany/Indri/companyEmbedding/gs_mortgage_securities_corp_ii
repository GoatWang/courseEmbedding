                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Announcement: Moody's: 41 CMBS Deals Unaffected by Proposed Transfer of Servicing from Bank of America, N.A. to KeyCorp Real Estate Capital Markets, Inc. and Sub-Servicing Agreement between KeyCorp and Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC






                    Global Credit Research - 18 Jun 2013
                









New York, June 18, 2013 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) was informed that KeyCorp Real 
Estate Capital Markets, Inc. (KRECM) entered into a series 
of agreements to purchase substantially all of Bank of America, 
N.A's (Bank of America) commercial mortgage-backed 
securities servicing portfolio (the CMBS Servicing Portfolio). 
Simultaneously with the closing of the purchase of Bank of America's 
servicing portfolio, KRECM will enter into a long-term sub-servicing 
agreement with Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (Berkadia) pursuant to 
which Berkadia will service the CMBS Servicing Portfolio. The Proposed 
Transfer will become effective upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent 
set forth in the governing documents.




Moody's has reviewed the Proposed Transfer and has determined that 
it will not, in and of itself, and at this time, result 
in a downgrade or withdrawal of the current ratings to any class of certificates 
for Moody's rated CMBS deals that are included in the Transfer. 
Please click on http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF333334 
for the List of Affected Credit Ratings. This list is an integral 
part of this Press Release and identifies each affected transaction. 





Moody's opinion only addresses the credit impact associated with the Proposed 
Transfer. Moody's is not expressing any opinion as to whether 
the this Proposed Transfer has, or could have, other non-credit 
related effects that may have a detrimental impact on the interests of 
note holders and/or counterparties.




Moody's will continue to monitor the ratings. Any change 
in the ratings will be publicly disseminated by Moody's through 
appropriate media.

Rating Action: Moody's Affirms Three CMBS Classes of GSMSC II 2007-EOP






                    Global Credit Research - 20 Mar 2013
                







Approximately $1.07 Billion of Structured Securities Affected


New York, March 20, 2013 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) affirmed the ratings of two pooled 
classes and one interest-only class of GS Mortgage Securities Corporation 
II, Commercial Pass Through Certificates, Series 2007-EOP. 
Moody's rating action is as follows: 




Cl. A-1, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Jun 
27, 2007 Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-2, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Jun 
27, 2007 Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. X, Affirmed Ba3 (sf); previously on Feb 22, 
2012 Downgraded to Ba3 (sf)




RATINGS RATIONALE




The affirmations of the pooled classes are due to key parameters, 
including Moody's loan to value (LTV) ratio and Moody's stressed debt 
service coverage ratio (DSCR) remaining within acceptable ranges. 
The rating of the interest-only classes is consistent with the 
expected credit performance of the referenced classes and thus is affirmed. 
The loan benefits from a consistent cash flow derived from a portfolio 
of 83 office properties across the United States. Moody's 
is concerned about the enormity of this $4.6 billion loan 
that faces refinance in February 2014.




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. From 
time to time, Moody's may, if warranted, change these 
expectations. Performance that falls outside the given range may 
indicate that the collateral's credit quality is stronger or weaker than 
Moody's had anticipated when the related securities ratings were issued. 
Even so, a deviation from the expected range will not necessarily 
result in a rating action nor does performance within expectations preclude 
such actions. The decision to take (or not take) a rating action 
is dependent on an assessment of a range of factors including, but 
not exclusively, the performance metrics.




Primary sources of assumption uncertainty are the extent of growth in 
the current macroeconomic environment given the weak pace of recovery 
and commercial real estate property markets. Commercial real estate 
property values are continuing to move in a modestly positive direction 
along with a rise in investment activity and stabilization in core property 
type performance. Limited new construction and moderate job growth 
have aided this improvement. However, a consistent upward 
trend will not be evident until the volume of investment activity steadily 
increases for a significant period, non-performing properties 
are cleared from the pipeline, and fears of a Euro area recession 
are abated.




The hotel sector is performing strongly with nine straight quarters of 
growth and the multifamily sector continues to show increases in demand 
with a growing renter base and declining home ownership. Recovery 
in the office sector continues at a measured pace with minimal additions 
to supply. However, office demand is closely tied to employment, 
where growth remains slow and employers are considering decreases in the 
leased space per employee. Also, primary urban markets are 
outperforming secondary suburban markets. Performance in the retail 
sector continues to be mixed with retail rents declining for the past 
four years, weak demand for new space and lackluster sales driven 
by internet sales growth. Across all property sectors, the 
availability of debt capital continues to improve with robust securitization 
activity of commercial real estate loans supported by a monetary policy 
of low interest rates.




Moody's central global macroeconomic scenario calls for US GDP growth 
for 2013 that is likely to remain close to 2% as the greater impetus 
from the US private sector is likely to broadly offset the drag on activity 
from more restrictive fiscal policy. Thereafter, we expect 
the US economy to expand at a somewhat faster pace than is likely this 
year, closer to its long-run average pace of growth. 
Risks to our forecasts remain skewed to the downside despite recent positive 
developments. Moody's believes that the three most immediate 
risks are: i) the risk of a deeper than currently expected recession 
in the euro area accompanied by deeper credit contraction, potentially 
triggered by a further intensification of the sovereign debt crisis; 
ii) slower-than-expected recovery in major emerging markets 
following the recent slowdown; and iii) an escalation of geopolitical 
tensions, resulting in adverse economic developments.




The principal methodology used in this rating was "Moody's Approach to 
Rating CMBS Large Loan/Single Borrower Transactions" published in July 
2000. The methodology used in rating Class X was "Moody's Approach 
to Rating Structured Finance Interest-Only Securities" published 
in February 2012. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of these methodologies.




Moody's review incorporated the use of the excel-based Large Loan 
Model v 8.5. The large loan model derives credit enhancement 
levels based on an aggregation of adjusted loan level proceeds derived 
from Moody's loan level LTV ratios. Major adjustments to determining 
proceeds include leverage, loan structure, property type, 
and sponsorship. These aggregated proceeds are then further adjusted 
for any pooling benefits associated with loan level diversity, other 
concentrations and correlations. The model incorporates the CMBS 
IO calculator ver1.1, which uses the following inputs to 
calculate the proposed IO rating based on the published methodology: 
original and current bond ratings and credit assessments; original 
and current bond balances grossed up for losses for all bonds the IO(s) 
reference(s) within the transaction; and IO type corresponding to 
an IO type as defined in the published methodology. The calculator 
then returns a calculated IO rating based on both a target and mid-point 
. For example, a target rating basis for a Baa3 (sf) rating 
is a 610 rating factor. The midpoint rating basis for a Baa3 (sf) 
rating is 775 (i.e. the simple average of a Baa3 (sf) rating 
factor of 610 and a Ba1 (sf) rating factor of 940). If the calculated 
IO rating factor is 700, the CMBS IO calculator would provide both 
a Baa3 (sf) and Ba1 (sf) IO indication for consideration by the rating 
committee.




Moody's ratings are determined by a committee process that considers both 
quantitative and qualitative factors. Therefore, the rating 
outcome may differ from the model output.




The rating action is a result of Moody's on-going surveillance 
of commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) transactions. Moody's 
monitors transactions on a monthly basis through a review utilizing MOST® 
(Moody's Surveillance Trends) Reports and Remittance Statements. 
On a periodic basis, Moody's also performs a full transaction review 
that involves a rating committee and a press release. Moody's prior 
transaction review is summarized in a press release dated May 16, 
2012. Please see the ratings tab on the issuer / entity page on 
moodys.com for the last rating action and the ratings history.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the March 6, 2013 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 38% to $4.6 
billion from $6.9 billion at securitization. The 
properties are also encumbered with additional debt in the form of mezzanine 
financing totaling $1.6 billion. The Certificates 
are collateralized by a single floating rate mortgage loan secured by 
83 individual office properties. The properties total approximately 
30 million owned square feet and are located in 13 states and the District 
of Columbia. As of September 2012, portfolio occupancy was 
86% compared to 85% as of December 2011. Since securitization, 
53 properties have been released.




The loan is secured by first priority mortgage liens as well as unencumbered 
equity pledges of borrower's joint venture interests, unencumbered 
cash flow pledges of the borrower's joint venture interests, encumbered 
cash flow pledges of the borrower's joint venture interests, and 
other collateral including covenants to apply proceeds and collateral 
note assignments. Moody's attributes value to only the mortgage 
properties for the rated classes.




The loan was modified in December of 2010. Terms of the modification 
included a term extension with a final extended maturity date of February 
2014; a increased spread payable to certificate holders; fixed 
amortization; additional collateral; and 100% of the 
release price of released properties will be applied to the mortgage loan. 
Modification fees will be paid by the borrower. There is set quarterly 
amortization defined in the modification with approximatley $73 
million to be paid in 2013.




Moody's weighted average pooled loan to value (LTV) ratio is 97% 
and Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) is 1.24X. 
Both LTV and DSCR are similar to the last review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




Moody's did not receive or take into account a third-party 
assessment on the due diligence performed regarding the underlying assets 
or financial instruments related to the monitoring of this transaction 
in the past six months.




In conducting surveillance of this credit, Moody's considered performance 
data contained in servicer and remittance reports. Moody's obtains 
servicer reports on this transaction on a periodic basis, at least 
annually.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this rating action, and 
whose ratings may change as a result of this rating action, the 
associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Avelo Mortgage, LLC – David M. Altshuler – GS Mortgage Securities Corp

		Posted on March 6, 2010 by Neil Garfield	

The following is an excerpt from a 10-K/A SEC Filing, filed by GSR  MORTGAGE LOAN TRUST 2006-8F on 7/1/2008.
Next Section Next Section 				Previous Section Previous Section
http://sec.edgar-online.com/gsr-mortgage-loan-trust-2006-8f/10-ka-amended-annual-report/2008/07/01/section31.aspx
EX-33 (c)
Restated Report on Assessment Regarding Compliance with Applicable  Servicing Criteria
1. Avelo Mortgage, LLC (the “Servicer”) is responsible for assessing  compliance, as of December 31, 2006 and for the period from February 24,  2006 (the first day of the distribution period in which the GS Mortgage  Securities Corp. (“GSMSC”) first issued securities subject to  Regulation AB) through December 31, 2006 (the “Reporting Period”), with  the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB,  excluding the criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(iii),  (d)(2)(ii), (d)(2)(iv), (d)(3)(iii),
(d)(4)(i), (d)(4)(ii), (d)(4)(iii), (d)(4)(vi), (d)(4)(xi), (d)(4)(xii)  and
(d)(4)(xv) of Regulation AB, which the Servicer has concluded are not  applicable to the activities it performs, directly, with respect to the  asset-backed securities transactions covered by this report (such  criteria, after giving effect to the exclusions identified above, the  “Applicable Servicing Criteria”). While the Servicer engages vendors to  perform the servicing criteria in (d)(4)(xi) and (d)(4)(xii), the  Servicer does not take responsibility for the services provided by the  vendors as each vendor provides a separate 1122 Reg AB assessment  regarding compliance with the criteria. The transactions in which the  Servicer was a party are covered by this report included those  asset-backed securities transactions conducted by GS Mortgage Securities  Corp. (“GSMSC”) that were registered with the Securities and Exchange  Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 where the related  asset-backed securities were outstanding during the Reporting Period  (the “Platform”), as listed in Appendix A.
2. The Servicer has complied, in all material respects, with the  applicable servicing criteria as of and for the Reporting Period except  as follows:
The Servicer assessed its compliance with the Applicable Servicing  Criteria for the Reporting Period and has identified a material instance  of non-compliance with servicing criterion set forth in Item  1122(d)(2)(vii) of Regulation AB with respect to the Platform.  Specifically, the Servicer did not prepare reconciliations for all  asset-backed securities related bank accounts within 30 calendar days  after the bank statement cut-off date, or as such other number of days  as specified in the transaction agreements and reconciling items were  not resolved within 90 days of their original identification or such  other number of days as specified in the transaction agreements.
3. The Servicer had taken responsibility for the servicing criteria  set forth in 1122(d)(4)(xi) and 1122(d)(4)(xii) in its previous  assessment dated March 28, 2007. The Servicer has since been informed  that other servicers have taken responsibility for those servicing  criteria in their assessments for the year ended December 31, 2006.  Accordingly, the Servicer has restated its previous assessment for the  for the period February 24, 2006 to December 31, 2006 to exclude the  servicing criteria set forth in 1122(d)(4)(xi) and 1122(d)(4)(xii).
4. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public  accounting firm, has issued an attestation report for the Platform on  the assessment of compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria as  of December 31, 2006 and for the Reporting Period.

                            denominator of which is the Total Principal Payment
                            Amount for that payment date. The portion, if any,
                            of the prepayment premiums or yield maintenance
                            charges remaining after any payments described above
                            will be distributed 100% to the holders of the class
                            X-C certificates.

ADVANCES                    The master servicer and, if it fails to do so, the
                            trustee and, if it fails to do so, the fiscal agent
                            will be obligated to make P&I advances and servicing
                            advances, including delinquent property taxes and
                            insurance, but only to the extent that those
                            advances are not deemed non-recoverable and in the
                            case of P&I advances subject to any appraisal
                            reductions that may occur. For some of the mortgage
                            loans that are part of a split loan structure, the
                            master servicer or special servicer of another
                            securitization may make servicing and P&I advances
                            for the loans included in our trust.

APPRAISAL REDUCTIONS        An appraisal reduction generally will be created in
                            the amount, if any, by which the principal balance
                            of a required appraisal loan (plus other amounts
                            overdue or advanced in connection with such loan)
                            exceeds 90% of the appraised value of the related
                            mortgaged property plus certain escrows and reserves
                            (including letters of credit) held with respect to
                            the mortgage loan. As a result of calculating an
                            appraisal reduction amount for a given mortgage
                            loan, the interest portion of any P&I advance for
                            such loan will be reduced, which will have the
                            effect of reducing the amount of interest available
                            for distribution to the certificates in reverse
                            alphabetical order of the classes. A required
                            appraisal loan will cease to be a required appraisal
                            loan when the related mortgage loan has been brought
                            current for at least three consecutive months and no
                            other circumstances exist, which would cause such
                            mortgage loan to be a required appraisal loan.

OPTIONAL TERMINATION        The master servicer, the special servicer and
                            certain certificateholders will have the option to
                            terminate the trust, in whole but not in part, and
                            purchase the remaining assets of the trust on or
                            after the payment date on which the stated principal
                            balance of the mortgage loans then outstanding is
                            less than 1.0% of the initial mortgage pool balance.
                            The purchase price will generally be at a price
                            equal to the unpaid aggregate principal balance of
                            the mortgage loans (or fair market value in the case
                            of REO Properties), plus accrued and unpaid interest
                            and certain other additional trust fund expenses, as
                            described in the prospectus supplement. In addition,
                            after the certificate balance of the class A-1
                            through class E certificates has been reduced to
                            zero, the trust may also be terminated, subject to
                            the consent of the master servicer (in its sole
                            discretion), if all of the remaining series 2004-GG2
                            certificates (excluding class R and class LR) are
                            held by a single certificateholder, that
                            certificateholder may exchange all of the then
                            outstanding series 2004-GG2 certificates (excluding
                            class R and class LR) for the mortgage loans
                            remaining in the trust.

CONTROLLING CLASS           The class of sequential pay certificates (a) which
                            bears the latest alphabetical class designation
                            (other than the class X-P, class X-C, class R and
                            class LR certificates) and (b) which has a
                            certificate balance greater than 25% of its original
                            certificate balance provided, however, that if no
                            class of sequential pay certificates satisfies
                            clause (b) above, the controlling class will be the
                            outstanding class of sequential pay certificates
                            bearing the latest alphabetical class designation
                            (other than the class X-P, class X-C, class R and
                            class LR certificates); provided, further, with
                            respect to certain issues related to the mortgage
                            loans that are part of a split structure, the holder
                            of the majority interest of the related subordinated
                            or pari passu companion loan may have certain
                            consultation or approval rights with respect to
                            servicing matters, as described in the prospectus
                            supplement.

TENANTS                     References in this term sheet to the rating of a
                            tenant may refer to the rating of a parent of the
                            actual tenant and the rated entity may not be an
                            actual party to that lease. The rated parent may not
                            guarantee the lease.

                            ERISA eligible.

                            certificates are expected to be "mortgage-related
                            securities" for the purposes of SMMEA so long as
                            they remain rated in one of the two highest rating
                            categories by a nationally recognized statistical

(1)  The $190,000,000 loan represents a 44.5% interest in a $427,000,000 loan.
The LTV, DSCR and debt service in this table are based on the total
$427,000,000 financing net of the $37,000,000 guarantee. The Cut-Off Date

(2)  S&P and Moody's have confirmed that the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian
Loan has, in the context of its inclusion in the trust, credit
characteristics consistent with that of an obligation rated "A" by S&P,
and"A3" by Moody's.


o    THE LOAN. The mortgage loan (the "GRAND CANAL SHOPPES AT THE VENETIAN
LOAN") is evidenced by two notes, each of which is secured by a first
mortgage encumbering the regional mall located at 3355 Las Vegas Blvd
S, Las Vegas, Nevada and a leasehold interest in certain property
located within the Venetian Hotel (the "GRAND CANAL SHOPPES AT THE
VENETIAN PROPERTY"). The Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian Loan
represents approximately 7.19% of the initial mortgage pool balance.
The Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian Loan was originated on May 17,
2004 by Archon Financial, L.P. and was subsequently purchased by
Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company, and is now jointly owned by Goldman
Sachs Mortgage Company and Commerzbank AG, New York Branch, each

tenant.

Rent.


o    THE BORROWER. The borrower is Grand Canal Shops II, LLC, a
single-asset, special-purpose entity. Legal counsel to the borrower
delivered a non-consolidation opinion in connection with the
origination of the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian Loan. The
borrower is indirectly wholly-owned by GGP Holding II, Inc., the
common stock of which is wholly-owned by GGP Holding, Inc., the common
stock of which is wholly-owned by GGP Limited Partnership, a
subsidiary of General Growth Properties, Inc. There is no guarantee of
the non-recourse carve-outs of the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian
Loan.


o    ESCROWS. The loan documents provide during a Grand Canal Shoppes at
the Venetian Cash Sweep Period for certain escrows of real estate
taxes and insurance, tenant improvements and leasing commissions and
capital expenditures. A "GRAND CANAL SHOPPES AT THE VENETIAN CASH
SWEEP PERIOD" means the period during the continuance of an event of
default under the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian Loan and/or if,
beginning on June 30, 2005, the net-operating income at the end of any
fiscal quarter of the borrower of the Grand Canal Shoppes at the
Venetian Property for the prior twelve-month period is less than 80%
of the net operating income at origination (origination date NOI)
until the net-operating income as of the end of the fiscal quarter of
the borrower of the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian Property for
the prior twelve-month period is at least equal to 80% of the net
operating income at origination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
borrower is not required to make deposits into the insurance reserve
if the insurance escrow account under the reciprocal easement
agreement is being maintained and each party thereto is making any
required deposits. Additionally, GGP Holding, Inc. has provided a
guarantee of certain unfunded obligations of the borrower relating to
tenant leases.


o    LOCK BOX AND CASH MANAGEMENT. The loan requires a hard lock box. The
loan documents require the borrower to direct the tenants to pay their
rents directly to a lender-controlled sweep account. The loan
documents also require that all cash revenue received by the borrower
or the property manager (other than security deposits) be deposited
into the lender-controlled sweep account within two business days
after receipt. Unless a Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian Cash Sweep
Period is continuing, on each business day any amounts in the
lender-controlled sweep account are swept to an account specified by
the borrower. During any Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian Cash
Sweep Period, on each business day any amounts in the
lender-controlled sweep account are swept to a lender-controlled cash
management account. All amounts remaining in the lender-controlled
cash

management account after payment of the monthly debt service, all
required reserves as described above and any other amounts due under
the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian Loan will be remitted to an
account designated by the borrower. After the occurrence and during
the continuation of an event of default, all amounts remaining in the
lender-controlled cash management account after payment of the monthly
debt service, all required reserves as described above and any other
amounts due under the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian Loan are
required to be deposited into a reserve account and held as additional
collateral for the loan except that prior to an acceleration or
monetary event of default, the lender is required to disburse funds
against invoices for operating expenses pursuant to a budget approved
by lender.


o    PROPERTY MANAGEMENT. The Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian Property
may be self-managed or may be managed by certain affiliates of
borrower or a manager or any management company for whom each Rating
Agency has confirmed in writing will not cause the downgrade,
withdrawal or qualification of then current ratings of any class of
the series 2004-GG2 certificates. The lender may require the borrower
to cease managing the property or replace the property manager if an
event of default under the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian Loan
has occurred and is continuing. The fees of any successor manager
during the continuance of a Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian Cash
Trap Period may not exceed market rates for comparable properties in
the applicable geographic area.


o    MASTER LEASE. The borrower net leases the Casino Level Space pursuant
to a master lease with Venetian Casino Resort, LLC. The master lease
has a remaining term of approximately 89 years and an annual rent of
$1 per year. The borrower is responsible for paying all taxes and
expenses relating to the Casino Level Space, and at the expiration of
the term of the master lease has the option to purchase fee title to
the Casino Level Space for a nominal exercise price. Generally, the
master lease requires that any portion of the Casino Level Space that
is currently used as restaurant or retail venue continue to be used
for such purpose. Additionally, new restaurant tenants (other than
tenants to be located in the food court located in the casino level
space) are required to meet certain quality standards and may not be
part of a franchised chain.


o    RECIPROCAL EASEMENT AGREEMENT. The borrower is a party to a reciprocal
easement agreement with respect to the Grand Canal Shoppes at the
Venetian Property which governs the interrelationship between the
Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian Property and the Venetian. Under
the reciprocal easement agreement, the borrower covenants to
continuously operate the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian Property
and has agreed to maintain the quality standards of the tenant mix at
the property. In addition, the borrower is prohibited from leasing
space to competitors of the Venetian and other businesses inconsistent
with such quality standards. Casualty and business interruption
insurance coverage for the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian
Property is currently provided by a blanket insurance policy covering
the Venetian and meeting the requirements under the reciprocal
easement agreement. Proceeds of such insurance, as well as
condemnation proceeds, are required to be administered in accordance
with the provisions of the reciprocal easement agreement. Under the
reciprocal easement agreement, a transfer of the Grand Canal Shoppes
at the Venetian Property (other than to lender (or a subsequent
transferee) in connection with foreclosure of a mortgage secured by
the property) is subject to a right of first offer in favor of the
owner of the Venetian. Additionally, the owner of the Venetian Casino
Resort has the right to cure certain defaults of borrower under the
Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian Casino Whole Loan and, in the case
of an acceleration of the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian Whole
Loan, has the right, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, to
purchase the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian Whole Loan at a price
equal to the sum of (1) the principal balance of the Grand Canal
Shoppes at the Venetian Whole Loan, (2) accrued and unpaid interest on
the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian Whole Loan, (3) all other
amounts owed by the borrower under the loan documents as of the date
of the purchase and (4) all reasonable fees and expenses incurred by
the lender in connection with the purchase.


o    NEW RETAIL FACILITY. The owners of the Venetian are developing a
hotel, casino and retail complex adjacent to the Venetian, which is
currently scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2006. An
affiliate of the borrower has entered into a forward commitment to
purchase the retail complex (which will be contiguous with the Grand
Canal Shoppes at the Venetian Property), subject to satisfaction of
certain conditions. Upon completion, the parties have agreed to
operate the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian Property and the new
retail complex as an "integrated" mall, including, among other things,
providing for joint maintenance, leasing, marketing, management and
operation. In the event borrower's affiliate defaults in its
obligation to purchase the new retail complex, among other remedies,
the owner of the Venetian may purchase the equity interests in the
borrower for a purchase price not less than the then-outstanding
principal amount of the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian Whole
Loan.

o    EARNOUT GUARANTEE. GGP Holdings, Inc. has provided a guarantee of the
Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian Whole Loan in the amount of
$37,000,000, which amount will be reduced without reinstatement on a
quarterly basis by an amount equal to (i) the product of (a) trailing
12-month actual net operating income for the most recently ended
quarter less $43,700,000 multiplied by (b) 9.0 less (ii) any reduction
amounts applied at a prior determination date.


o    MEZZANINE OR SUBORDINATE INDEBTEDNESS. The Grand Canal Shoppes at
Venetian loan documents permit, among other things, (a) the pledge of
indirect interests in the borrower to secure certain inter-affiliate
debt and (b) the pledge of direct interests in borrower, or issuance
by borrower of preferred equity, or debt granting similar rights as
preferred equity, so long as confirmation is received from each rating
agency that the debt would not result in the downgrade, withdrawal or
qualification of then then-current ratings on the certificates.


o    TERRORISM INSURANCE. The loan documents require the borrower to
maintain insurance coverage for terrorism, satisfactory to lender
(either through such policies not containing a terrorism exclusion, or
through separate policies from insurers with ratings reasonably
satisfactory to lender). The borrower is required to maintain the
terrorism insurance described in the preceding sentence for the year
in which the origination date occurs and thereafter is required to use
commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with those of prudent
owners of institutional quality commercial real estate, to maintain
such terrorism coverage at all times while the Grand Canal Shoppes at
the Venetian Whole Loan is outstanding, provided that such coverage is
available at commercially reasonable rates. See "Risk
Factors--Property Insurance" in the prospectus supplement. The
terrorism coverage is currently provided by a blanket insurance policy
covering the Venetian and meeting requirements under the reciprocal
easement agreement. Proceeds of such insurance are required to be
administered in accordance with the provisions of the reciprocal
easement agreement, with an amount of up to the first $120,000,000
being paid to lender, with remaining proceeds then being distributed
in accordance with the reciprocal easement agreement.

(1)  The loan includes an up-front IO period; however, the UW DSCR reflects the
future amortizing payment.


(2)  S&P and Moody's have confirmed that the Daily News Building Loan has, in
the context of its inclusion in the trust, credit characteristics
consistent with that of an obligation rated "BBB" by S&P, and"Baa2" by

evidenced by a senior note and is secured by a first mortgage
encumbering the office building located at 220 E 42nd Street, New

is evidenced by a junior note (the "DAILY NEWS BUILDING SUBORDINATE
COMPANION LOAN"), with an original principal balance of $56,000,000 and an
interest rate of 7.29%, which loan is subordinate to the Daily News
Building Loan. The Daily News Building Subordinate Companion Loan is not an

o    THE BORROWER. The borrower is SLG 220 News Owner LLC, a single asset,
special purpose entity. Legal counsel to the borrower delivered a
non-consolidation opinion in connection with the origination of the
Daily News Building Loan. The borrower is owned by SL Green Realty
Corp. SL Green Realty Corp. is the guarantor of the non-recourse
carve-outs of the Daily News Building Loan.


o    ESCROWS. The loan documents provide for certain escrows of real estate
taxes, insurance, tenant improvements and leasing commissions and
capital expenditures. In addition, on the closing date, the borrower
was required to either (i) deposit $2,696,000 into a deferred
maintenance and environmental escrow account or (ii) deliver to the
lender a letter of credit for such amount. Further, on the closing
date, the borrower was required to either (i) deposit $2,415,634 into
an unfunded obligations account or (ii) deliver to the lender a letter
of credit for such amount.


o    LOCK BOX AND CASH MANAGEMENT. The loan requires a hard lock box, which
is already in place. The loan documents require the borrower to direct
tenants to pay their rents directly to a lender-controlled account.
The loan documents also require that all rents received by the
borrower or the property manager be deposited into the
lender-controlled account (as well as any other rents, receipts,
security deposits or payments related to lease termination or tenant
default) within one business day of receipt. On each business day, any
amounts in the lender-controlled account in excess of those required
for the payment of the monthly debt service and required reserves are
swept to an account specified by the borrower.


o    PROPERTY MANAGEMENT. SL Green Management LLC, the property manager for
the Daily News Building Property (the "DAILY NEWS BUILDING PROPERTY
MANAGER"), is affiliated with the borrower. The lender may replace the
Daily News Building Property Manager (i) if an event of default is
continuing, (ii) if the manager is insolvent or in bankruptcy or
receivership, or (iii) upon the fraud or willful misconduct of the
manager. The Daily News Building Property Manager is entitled to
management fees equal to 4% of the gross amounts collected as rent and
additional rent and 10% of the cost of all tenant installations and
capital improvements that the Daily News Property Manager is
responsible for supervising.


o    MEZZANINE OR SUBORDINATE INDEBTEDNESS. The Daily News Building
Property also secures the Daily News Building Subordinate Companion
Loan, which is subordinate to the Daily News Building Loan, as
described in the prospectus supplement under "Description of the
Mortgage Pool--The Whole Loans". In addition, the borrower is
permitted to incur up to $50,000,000 in

various garment district tenants. The borrowers are affiliated with
the borrower under the mortgage loan identified herein and on Annex C
to the prospectus supplement as 1410 Broadway, which mortgage loan is
also an asset of the trust.


o    ESCROWS. The loan documents provide for certain escrows of real estate
taxes and insurance premiums. Additionally, the loan documents require
the borrowers to make monthly payments totaling $115,089 per year for
replacement reserves. The borrowers are also required to deposit any
lease termination payments and security deposits applied or other
payments received on account of lease defaults or lease terminations
into a tenant improvement and leasing commission reserve. The loan
documents also provide for an additional springing tenant improvement
and leasing commission reserve (the "LIZ CLAIBORNE RESERVE") in the
event that (i) the lease to Liz Claiborne (the "LIZ CLAIBORNE LEASE")
is cancelled or terminated prior to December 31, 2012, (ii) Liz
Claiborne (or any successor or assign) ceases to operate its business
at the 1441 Broadway Property, (iii) Liz Claiborne (or any successor
or assign) fails to make any regularly scheduled rental payments under
the Liz Claiborne Lease, or (iv) Liz Claiborne (or any successor or
assign) becomes the subject of an insolvency proceeding. The Liz
Claiborne Reserve will also be automatically triggered on August 31,
2010 irrespective of the events referred to above. Upon a Liz
Claiborne Reserve trigger, excess cash flow from the 1441 Broadway
Property will be swept into the Liz Claiborne Reserve until such time
as Liz Claiborne renews or extends the Liz Claiborne Lease, the space
subject to the Liz Claiborne Lease has been re-leased and/or lender
has determined that sufficient funds exist in the Liz Claiborne
Reserve to pay for anticipated tenant improvement costs and leasing
commissions with respect to such space. If the Liz Claiborne Reserve
was triggered due to (a) clause (iii) above, excess cash flow from the
1441 Broadway Property will be swept into the Liz Claiborne Reserve
until such time as the failure to pay rent has been cured and has not
occurred again for a period of 6 consecutive months, (b) clause (iv)
above, excess cash flow from the 1441 Broadway Property will be swept
into the Liz Claiborne Reserve until such time as such insolvency
proceeding has been terminated and the Liz Claiborne Lease has been
affirmed, assumed or assigned in a matter satisfactory to lender.


o    LOCK BOX AND CASH MANAGEMENT. The loan requires a soft lock box, which
is already in place. The loan documents require that all rents
received by the borrowers or the property manager be deposited into a
lender-controlled account (as well as any other rents, receipts,
security deposits or payments related to lease termination or default)
within one business day after receipt. Unless a 1441 Cash Trap Period
is in effect, any amounts in the lender controlled account are
required to be swept on a daily basis into the borrower's operating
account. A "1441 CASH TRAP PERIOD" means any period during which (i)
an event of default (as defined in the loan documents) is continuing,
until the event of default is cured, (ii) the DSCR (based on actual
net cash flow) as of the end of any calendar quarter, is less than
1.05x, until the DSCR minimum threshold has been achieved for two
consecutive calendar quarters, and (iii) during any time that the Liz
Claiborne Reserve is triggered, as described under "Escrows" above.


o    PROPERTY MANAGEMENT. An affiliate of the borrowers, L.H. Charney
Associates, Inc., is the property manager for the 1441 Broadway
Property. The lender may replace the property manager (i) if an event
of default under the loan agreement is continuing, (ii) if the manager
is in material default under the management agreement or (iii) upon
the gross negligence, malfeasance or willful misconduct of the
manager. The annual management fee is 5% of gross receipts, provided
that during a 1441 Cash Trap Period, the annual management fee is
capped at 2% of gross receipts. Leasing commissions are payable
separately based on a fixed schedule.


o    MEZZANINE OR SUBORDINATE INDEBTEDNESS. Other than the 1441 Broadway
Subordinate Companion Loan, mezzanine or subordinate indebtedness is
not permitted.


o    TERRORISM INSURANCE. The 1441 Broadway Property is insured against
acts of terrorism as part of its "all-risk" property coverage. The
loan documents require the borrowers to maintain terrorism insurance
in an amount equal to 100% of the full replacement cost of the 1441
Broadway Property, provided that such coverage is available. In the
event terrorism insurance is not included as port of the "all risk"
property policy, the borrower will be required to purchase terrorism
insurance at a cost up to the Terrorism Premium Cap (defined below).
If the insurance premiums for such policy exceed the Terrorism Premium
Cap, the lender may, at its option (1) purchase such stand-alone
terrorism insurance policy, and require that the borrowers pay the
portion of the premiums equal to the Terrorism Premium Cap or (2)
modify the deductible amounts, policy limits and other required policy
terms to reduce the insurance premiums payable with respect to such
stand-alone terrorism policy to the Terrorism Premium Cap. As used
herein, "TERRORISM PREMIUM CAP" means an amount which is equal to 150%
of the aggregate amount of insurance premiums paid for physical hazard
insurance for the last policy year in which coverage for terrorism was
included as part of the "all risk" property policy, adjusted annually
by a percentage equal to the increase in the Consumer Price Index. See
"Risk Factors--Property Insurance" in the prospectus supplement.

(1)  The $130,000,000 loan represents a 25% interest in a $520,000,000 loan. All
aggregate LTV, DSCR, debt service and loan PSF in this table are based on
the total $520,000,000 financing.


(2)  S&P and Moody's have confirmed that the Garden State Plaza Loan has, in the
context of its inclusion in the trust, credit characteristics consistent
with that of an obligation rated "AA" by S&P, and"A2" by Moody's.


o    THE LOAN. The mortgage loan (the "GARDEN STATE PLAZA LOAN") is
evidenced by a note that is secured by a first mortgage encumbering
the regional mall located at One Garden State Plaza (the "GARDEN STATE
PLAZA PROPERTY") in Paramus, New Jersey at the intersection of Route 4
and Route 17. The Garden State Plaza Loan represents approximately
4.93% of the initial mortgage pool balance. The Garden State Plaza
Loan was jointly originated on May 18, 2004 by German American Capital
Corporation, Lehman Brothers Bank FSB, UBS Real Estate Investments,
Inc. and Archon Financial, L.P. The Garden State Plaza Loan had an
original principal balance and a principal balance as of the cut-off
date of $130,000,000, and an interest rate of 4.9796%. The Garden
State Plaza Loan was used to refinance existing debt on the Garden

o    THE BORROWERS. The borrowers are Westland Garden State Plaza Limited
Partnership ("WESTLAND LP"), a limited partnership and GSP Holdings
LLC ("GSP LLC"), a limited liability company (the "GARDEN STATE
BORROWERS"). In addition to owning the Garden State Plaza Property,
Westland LP owns three subsidiaries. Each of the Garden State
Borrowers are a single-purpose entity, sponsored and controlled by
West?eld America, Inc. and certain affiliates of Prudential Assurance
Company Limited (Aldwych, L.L.C. and Old Kingsway, L.P.)
(collectively, the "GARDEN STATE SPONSORS"). Legal counsel to the
borrower delivered a non-consolidation opinion in connection with the
origination of the Garden State Plaza Loan. West?eld America, Inc.
owns a 46.59% indirect interest in the Garden State Borrowers,
Aldwych, L.L.C. and Old Kingsway, L.P. own a 50% indirect interest in
the Garden State Borrowers and other investors own in the aggregate a
3.41% indirect interest in the Garden State Borrowers. In April 2004,
Westfield announced a proposal to merge the three listed Westfield
entities - Westfield Trust, Westfield America Trust and Westfield
Holdings - to create the world's largest, listed retail property
group. The new entity, known as Westfield Group, began trading on the
Australian Stock Exchange on July 5, 2004.


o    ESCROWS. The loan documents provide for certain escrows of real estate
taxes, insurance and replacements and rollovers. In lieu of making
deposits into the tax and insurance reserve account and the
replacements and rollover reserve, the Garden State Sponsors have
executed a joint but not several guarantee in favor of the lender of

(i) real estate taxes and insurance premiums and deductibles and (ii)
certain leasing expenses, maintenance or repair expenses and the
completion of certain specified improvements or other work to be
performed on the Garden State Plaza Property.


Notwithstanding the guarantee of the Garden State Sponsors, upon the
occurrence of a Garden State Cash Management Event, the Garden State
Borrowers are required to deposit amounts in the tax and insurance reserve
account and in the replacement and rollover reserve fund. Upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of a Garden State Cash Management
Event, the borrower is required to pay to a lender controlled account an
amount equal to the approved operating expenses for the Garden State Plaza
Property for the next month. Unless an event of default has occurred and is
continuing, the lender will release any excess funds in the
lender-controlled account to the borrower. A "GARDEN STATE CASH MANAGEMENT
EVENT" means the period of time from and after (i) an event of default
occurs or (ii) the DSCR at any time is less than 1.10x. A Garden State Cash
Management Event may be terminated no more than six (6) times during the
term of the loan upon, among other things, achieving a debt service
coverage ratio of 1.15x for one ?scal quarter (if the Garden State Plaza
Cash Management Event was due to the debt service coverage ratio falling
below 1.10x) or curing the event of default which caused the Garden State
Plaza Cash Management Event.

o    LOCK BOX AND CASH MANAGEMENT. The loan requires a hard lock box, which
is already in place. The loan documents require the borrower to direct
tenants to pay their rents directly to a lender-controlled account.
The loan documents also require that all rents received by the
borrower or the property manager be deposited into the
lender-controlled account (as well as any other rents, receipts,
security deposits or payments related to lease termination or default)
within one business day of receipt. Prior to the occurrence of a
Garden State Cash Management Event, all funds from the
lender-controlled account will be swept on a daily basis into an
account controlled by the borrower. After the occurrence of a Garden
State Cash Management Event, all funds from the lender-controlled
account will be swept on a daily basis to an account controlled by the
lender and applied to pay monthly debt service, operating expenses,
and any required reserves under the loan documents. If on any payment
date the amount in the lender-controlled account is sufficient to pay
the debt service, operating expenses, and any required reserves under
the loan documents, any excess shall be remitted to the borrower
unless an event of default has occurred and is continuing.


o    PROPERTY MANAGEMENT. Westfield Corporation, Inc., the property manager
for the Garden State Plaza Property (the "GARDEN STATE PLAZA PROPERTY
MANAGER"), is affiliated with the borrower. Upon the occurrence, and
during the continuance, of a Garden State Cash Management Event,
lender may require the Garden State Borrowers to retain a property
management firm to serve as a consultant. The lender may replace the
Garden State Plaza Property Manager upon, or any time after, the
lender or any third party acquires the Garden State Plaza Property by
foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or otherwise.


o    MEZZANINE OR SUBORDINATE INDEBTEDNESS. None permitted.


o    THEATER EXPANSION. Pursuant to the loan documents, upon the
satisfaction of certain conditions including (a) the lender's approval
of the plans and speci?cations, (b) the absence of an event of default
with respect to the Garden State Plaza Whole Loan, (c) the delivery of
an executed lease for the cinema complex, (d) the delivery of cash or
a letter of credit equal to 125% of the amount by which the estimated
costs of the proposed expansion exceed an amount equal to 7% of the
original principal balance of the Garden State Plaza Whole Loan or,
for so long as the Garden State Plaza Sponsors meet certain ?nancial
requirements, the delivery of a completion guarantee by the Garden
State Plaza Sponsors, and (e) due to potential environmental
conditions which may exist with respect to the site, compliance with
certain environmental investigations and mitigants speci?ed in the
related loan documents, the Garden State Plaza Borrowers may acquire
an approximately ?ve-acre existing theatre site adjacent to the Garden
State Plaza Mortgaged Property and construct thereon (i) an
approximately 99,000 square-foot cinema complex, (ii) approximately
35,000 square feet of new in-line mall shop space, (iii) approximately
15,000 square feet of new restaurant space, (iv) an expansion to the
existing food court and (v) a grade parking lot and/or a decked
parking facility. Upon the acquisition of that parcel, it will become
additional collateral for the Garden State Plaza Whole Loan.


o    TERRORISM INSURANCE. The Garden State Sponsors have executed a
guarantee in favor of the lender, which provides that, if the Garden
State Borrowers fail to maintain terrorism insurance coverage from a
qualified carrier in an amount (the "REQUIRED TERRORISM INSURANCE
AMOUNT") at least equal to the lesser of (i) the outstanding principal
balance of the Gardens State Plaza Loan and the Garden State Plaza
Companion Loans and (ii) the insurable value of the Garden State Plaza
Mortgage Loan, as determined pursuant to the related loan documents,
together with business interruption coverage as required under the
related loan documents, then the Garden State Sponsors guarantee to
the mortgagee the full and prompt payment (in accordance with the
terms of such terrorism guarantee, and subject to the limitations on
liability described below) of the amount of any loss or damage with
respect to the Garden State Mortgaged Property caused by an incident
of terrorism or a terrorist act that is not covered by any policies
maintained by the Garden State Borrowers or the Garden State Sponsors
at the time of the occurrence, which loss or damage would have
otherwise been insured if the Garden State Borrowers had maintained
all insurance policies required pursuant to the related loan documents
without any terrorism exclusion, up to the Required Terrorism
Insurance Amount.


The Garden State Sponsors may on behalf of the Garden State Borrowers
obtain and maintain a policy insuring the Garden State Plaza Property
against terrorist acts that satisfies the requirements set forth above.
Garden State Sponsors are jointly and severally liable for 100% of the
guaranteed obligations under such terrorism guarantee, except that this
liability may be reduced with respect to the Garden State Sponsors to
reflect any insurance policy for terrorist acts maintained by them in
addition to insurance maintained by the Garden State Borrowers. In any
event, and in addition to such terrorism guarantee, the Garden State
Borrowers are required to maintain insurance coverage for terrorist acts in
an amount equal to the lesser of (a) the Required Terrorism Insurance
Amount and (b) the difference between the amount of insurance coverage that
is available for terrorist acts for an annual premium of $300,000 and the
amount of insurance maintained by the Garden State Borrowers under existing
policies for loss, damages or liabilities that do not contain an exclusion
for acts of terrorism. In the event that the combined net worth of the
Garden State Sponsors (determined in accordance

the Garden State Sponsors are required to provide a replacement guarantor
or guarantors with a combined net worth equal to or greater than
$2,000,000,000. See "Risk Factors--Property Insurance" in the prospectus
supplement.


o    ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. Certain environmental conditions have been
identi?ed at a property adjacent to the Garden State Plaza Property.
An affiliate of the Garden State Plaza Borrowers has been designated
the responsible party with respect to those environmental conditions
and certain remedial work was performed with respect thereto. An
environmental assessment prepared in connection with the Garden State
Plaza Loan estimated ongoing monitoring costs to be approximately
$30,000. As such, no escrow or guarantee was required with respect to
this matter. However, there can be no assurance that additional
remedial work or monitoring will not be required with respect thereto.

o    LOCK BOX AND CASH MANAGEMENT. The loan requires a hard lock box. The
loan documents require the borrower to direct the tenants to pay their
rents directly to a lender-controlled sweep account. The loan
documents also require that all cash revenue received by the borrower
or the property manager be deposited into the lender-controlled sweep
account within one business day after receipt, other than certain
amounts in respect of kiosk rents. Unless an event of default or Stony
Point Escrow Period is continuing, on each business day any amounts in
the lender-controlled sweep account are swept to an account specified
by the borrower. During the continuance of an event of default or any
Stony Point Escrow Period, once each week any amounts in the
lender-controlled sweep account are swept to a lender-controlled cash
management account. During the continuance of an event of default or a
Stony Point Escrow Period, all amounts remaining in the
lender-controlled cash management account after payment of the monthly
debt service, all required reserves as described above and any other
amounts due under the Stony Point Fashion Park Loan will be remitted

during the continuation of an event of default, the borrower will have
no rights to any money in the lender-controlled sweep account or the
lender-controlled cash management account and the lender may apply any
amounts on deposit in such accounts to the amounts due under the Stony
Point Fashion Park Loan as it determines.


o    PROPERTY MANAGEMENT. The Stony Point Fashion Park Property is managed
by the Taubman Company LLC, and affiliate of the borrower, pursuant to
a management agreement. The management agreement has an initial term
of five years (ending September 2008) with continuous automatic
one-year renewal terms. The lender may require the replacement of the
property manager (i) if an event of default has occurred and the
lender has accelerated the loan or (ii) if the manager becomes
insolvent. The management fee is 4%, based upon rent, common area
charges and other income.


o    MEZZANINE OR SUBORDINATE INDEBTEDNESS. None permitted.


o    TERRORISM INSURANCE. The borrower is required to maintain commercial
property and business income insurance for loss resulting from perils
and acts of terrorism on terms (including amounts) consistent with
those required under the loan documents for comprehensive all risk
insurance and business income insurance at all times during the term
of the Stony Point Fashion Park Loan; provided, however, (A) the
borrower may maintain such coverage through a blanket policy with a
required deductible not in excess of $500,000 (the "STONY POINT
REQUIRED TERRORISM DEDUCTIBLE") or such higher deductible if the
borrower provides the lender a letter of credit in an amount equal to
the difference between the actual deductible and the Stony Point
Required Terrorism Deductible, which letter of credit may be drawn
upon by the lender upon the occurrence of a casualty to pay such
amounts that would have been paid by the issuer of the policies if the
Stony Point Required Terrorism Deductible had been maintained and (B)
the borrower shall only be required to maintain such amount of
coverage as may be obtained at a cost equal to (1) for the first four

(4) years after June 10, 2005, one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of
the cost of the coverage required as of the date of origination (i.e.,
$150,000) and (2) commencing June 10, 2010, two hundred percent (200%)
of the cost of the coverage required as of the date of origination
(i.e., $200,000). See "Risk Factors--Property Insurance" in the
prospectus supplement.


o    ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL. The City of Richmond paid the borrower's
predecessor in interest $13,500,000 for title to certain parking areas
located near the Stony Point Fashion Park Property (the "STONY POINT
FASHION PARK PARKING AREA"). On the fifth anniversary of the opening
of the Stony Point Fashion Park Property, the borrower, or another
creditworthy entity, is required to post an irrevocable letter of
credit in favor of the City of Richmond in the amount that $15,269,650
exceeds the total amount of taxes collected by the City of Richmond
from the Stony Point Fashion Park Property. Each year thereafter, the
letter of credit shall be (i) reduced by the amount of taxes collected
by the City of Richmond in respect of the Stony Point Fashion Park
Property and (ii) increased by an amount equal to an interest rate
times the amount of the letter of credit. On the tenth anniversary of
the opening of the Stony Point Fashion Park Property, the borrower
must either (i) pay the amount of the letter of credit or (ii) the
City of Richmond shall have the right to draw on the letter of credit.
After the tenth anniversary of the opening of the Stony Point Fashion
Park Property, the borrower has an option to repurchase the Stony
Point Fashion Park Parking Area from the City of Richmond for an
amount equal to 50% of the increase in the fair market value of the
Stony Point Fashion Park Parking Area. Pursuant to a reciprocal
easement agreement Dillard's can require the borrower to exercise this
repurchase option and convey a portion of the Stony Point Fashion Park
Parking Area to Dillard's at no cost to Dillard's.

TEN LARGEST MORTGAGE LOANS - 1410 BROADWAY





in 1984. The majority of Mr. Charney's buildings have been located
within the Garment District in New York and he has significant
experience owning and managing buildings in this area and has
long-standing relationships with various garment district tenants. The
borrower is affiliated with the borrowers under the mortgage loan
identified herein and in Annex C to the prospectus supplement as 1441
Broadway, which mortgage loan is also an asset of the trust.


o    ESCROWS. The loan documents provide for certain escrows for real
estate taxes and insurance premiums. The borrower deposited $390,579
into a reserve for immediate repairs. Additionally, the loan documents
require the borrower to make monthly payments totaling $89,285 per
year for replacement reserves on each monthly payment date on which
less than $275,000 is then on deposit in the replacement reserve and
$464,281 per year for tenant improvements and leasing commissions on
each monthly payment date on which less than $1,800,000 is then on
deposit in the tenant improvements and leasing commission reserve. The
borrower is also required to deposit any lease termination payments
and security deposits applied or other payments received on account of
lease defaults or lease terminations into a rollover reserve.


o    LOCK BOX AND CASH MANAGEMENT. The loan requires a soft lock box, which
is already in place. The loan documents require that all rents
received by the borrower or the property manager be deposited into a
lender-controlled account (as well as any other rents, receipts,
security deposits or payments related to lease termination or default)
within one business day after receipt. Unless a 1410 Broadway Cash
Trap Period is in effect, any amounts in the lender controlled account
are swept on daily basis into the borrower's operating account. A
"1410 BROADWAY CASH TRAP PERIOD" means any period during which (i) an
event of default (as defined in the loan documents) is continuing,
until such event of default is cured or (ii) the DSCR (based on actual
net cash flow) as of the end of any calendar quarter is less than
1.05x, until the DSCR minimum threshold has been achieved for two
consecutive calendar quarters. During a 1410 Broadway Cash Trap
Period, all cash in the lender controlled account (after payment of
debt service, required reserves and approved operating expenses) are
to be deposited into a lender controlled cash collateral account and
held as additional collateral for the 1410 Broadway Loan.


o    PROPERTY MANAGEMENT. L.H. Charney Associates, Inc., an affiliate of
the borrower, is the property manager for the 1410 Broadway Property.
The lender may replace the property manager (i) if an event of default
is continuing under the 1410 Broadway Loan, (ii) if the manager is in
material default under the management agreement or (iii) upon the
gross negligence, malfeasance or willful misconduct of the manager.
The annual management fee is 4% of gross receipts, provided that
during a 1410 Broadway Cash Trap Period, the annual management fee is
capped at 2% of gross receipts. Leasing commissions are payable
separately based on a fixed schedule.


o    MEZZANINE OR SUBORDINATE INDEBTEDNESS. Not permitted.


o    TERRORISM INSURANCE. The 1410 Broadway Property is insured against
acts of terrorism as part of its "all-risk" property coverage. The
loan documents require the borrower to maintain terrorism insurance in
an amount equal to 100% of the full replacement cost of the 1410
Broadway Property, provided that such coverage is available. In the
event that terrorism coverage is not included as part of the "all
risk" property policy, the borrower will be required to purchase
terrorism insurance at a cost up to the Terrorism Premium Cap (as
defined below). If the insurance premiums for such policy exceed the
Terrorism Premium Cap, the lender may, at its option (1) purchase such
terrorism insurance policy, and require that the borrower pay the
portion of the premiums equal to the Terrorism Premium Cap or (2)
modify the deductible amounts, policy limits and other required policy
terms to reduce the Insurance Premiums payable with respect to such
policy to the Terrorism Premium Cap. As used herein, "TERRORISM
PREMIUM CAP" means an amount which is equal to 150% of the aggregate
amount insurance premiums paid for physical hazard insurance for the
last policy year in which coverage for terrorism was included as part
of the "all risk" property policy, adjusted annually by a percentage
equal to the increase in the Consumer Price Index. See "Risk
Factors--Property Insurance" in the prospectus supplement.

original principal balance of $85,000,000 and a principal balance as
of the cut-off date of $84,759,743, and an interest rate of 5.750%.

closing date.


o    THE PROPERTY. The Destin Commons property (the "DESTIN COMMONS
PROPERTY") is a mixed-use lifestyle center with net leasable area of
approximately 480,150 square feet. It is located in Destin, Florida
(the Florida Panhandle) where the primary east/west thoroughfare for
the area, Emerald Coast Parkway (US 98), meets the Mid Bay Bridge Road
(SR 293), which provides a four-lane toll causeway back to the
mainland. The Destin Commons Property encompasses 195,195 square feet
of retail anchor space, 215,008 square feet of retail in-line space,
and 69,947 square feet of office space. The office component is
located on the second floors of the buildings that have two stories.


Destin Commons was built and opened in November 2003 by Turnberry

Secret, Wet Seal and Yankee Candle. For in-line tenants with less than
10,000 square feet, annualized sales are $334 psf with occupancy costs,

due to its close proximity to many metropolitan areas in the southeastern
United States.

o    THE PROPERTY. The 111 Eighth Avenue Property is a 17-story, 2,941,646 sf
office building located in the Chelsea submarket of Manhattan, New York. It
is the third-largest building in New York City and occupies an entire city
block between 8th and 9th Avenues and 15th and 16th Streets. Originally
constructed in 1932 as the headquarters of the Port Authority of New York,
the building served as the Port Authority's headquarters until 1972, when
the Port Authority moved to the then newly-completed World Trade Center.
Upon its relocation, the Port Authority sold the building to the Sylvan
Lawrence Family, who sold the property in 1998 to Taconic Investment
Partners ("TACONIC"). Between 1998 and 2004, Taconic oversaw a $50 million
renovation of the building, which positioned the 111 Eighth Avenue Property
as one of the most "connected" building in New York City. The building is
directly above the 9th Avenue fiber loop, which connects directly to the
Trans-Atlantic cable. As such, it is home to 40 of the world's leading
telecommunications providers, including some of the "mission critical"
facilities that support the networks that these providers rely on for
revenue. On-site parking for the building is available in a 342-space,
basement level parking garage.


As of February 28, 2004, the 111 Eighth Avenue Property was 90.0% leased to
60 tenants. In April, the City of New York vacated 148,615 square feet as
part of a citywide agency consolidation to Brooklyn and lower Manhattan
dropping the leased rate to 85%. A new lease for 82,736 sf has been signed
by Nike and a lease for 94,559 sf to WebMD has been fully negotiated,
received lender approval and are out for final signature. The additional
177,295 sf will bring the leased rate to approximately 91%. The three
largest tenants based on net rentable square footage in the building are
Sprint Communications, Inc. (occupies 251,287 sf), Wachovia/Prudential
Securities (occupies 187,645 sf) and CT Corporation, a division of CCH
Legal Information (occupies 165,635 sf). Sprint Corporation ("SPRINT")
(rated "Baa3" by Moody's and "BBB-" by S&P) is the holding company for
Sprint FON (NYSE: FON) and Sprint PCS (NYSE: PCS). During fiscal year
ending December 2003, Sprint reported consolidated revenues of $26.19
billion. Prudential Securities, the original tenant, was acquired by
Wachovia Securities LLC, effective July 2003.

TEN LARGEST MORTGAGE LOANS - 111 EIGHTH AVENUE





The 111 Eighth Avenue Property benefits from an Industrial and Commercial
Incentive Program ("ICIP") tax exemption, valued at $18.9 million as of
2004, which the New York City Department of Finance granted in connection
with Taconic's renovation of the 111 Eighth Avenue Property. This exemption
continues through the 2007/2008 tax year and then will be gradually reduced
to $0 by 2011/2012.


o    THE BORROWER. The borrower is 111 Chelsea Commerce LP, a single asset,
special purpose, bankruptcy remote entity, whose general partner,
Taconic GP Chelsea Holdings LLC, has two independent directors. Legal
counsel to the borrower delivered a non-consolidation opinion in
connection with the origination of the 111 Eighth Avenue Trust Loans.
The sponsors of the borrower are: (i) Taconic (owning a 9% interest in
the borrower), (ii) Jamestown, a Georgia general partnership
("JAMESTOWN") (owning a 70% interest in the borrower), and (iii) The
New York State Common Retirement Fund ("NY RETIREMENT FUND") (owning a
21% interest in the borrower). There is no guarantor of the
non-recourse carve-outs under the 111 Eighth Avenue Loan.


Taconic specializes in acquisition, finance, asset management, property
leasing, management, and real estate development. They have acquired and
developed over 8 million square feet of Class A and Class B office
properties in New York, Chicago, Washington, D.C. and Atlanta. The
principals of Taconic, Paul Pariser and Charles Bendit, founded the firm in
1997 after over twenty year careers in the New York City brokerage
community, most recently as co-heads of Jones Lang Wooton's NY office.


Jamestown was formed in 1983 as a real estate investment and management
company specializing in high-quality commercial real estate. Jamestown
provides real estate investment services in the United States, principally
for German investors. Since its inception, Jamestown has formed or
participated in more than twenty-four commercial real estate funds and,
along with its partners, has acquired over $4 billion of assets with in
excess of $1.9 billion in equity. Stephen Zoukis and Christoph Kahl are the
principals of Jamestown.


The NY Retirement Fund is the second largest public pension fund in the
nation and represents almost one million member and beneficiaries. As of
June 30, 2003, funds under management of the NY Retirement Fund were valued
at approximately $105 billion, with approximately 3.1% ($3.3 billion)
invested in real estate assets.


o    ESCROWS. The loan documents provide for certain escrows of real estate
taxes and insurance. At closing, the borrower deposited $500,000 in
escrow to pay for required repairs at the 111 Eighth Avenue Property
and $3,333,333 in escrow to pay for the final two payments to a former
tenant at the 111 Eighth Avenue Property, as part of a lease
termination agreement with the borrower. Additionally, the borrower is
required to make monthly payments of $49,029 to pay for ongoing
capital improvements to the 111 Eighth Avenue Property. At closing,
the borrower deposited $29,596,526 for tenant improvements and leasing
commissions ("GENERAL TI/LC"). In addition, the loan documents provide
for additional TI/LC reserves ("SPECIAL TI/LC") in an amount equal to
all excess cash after payment of debt service and monthly required
reserves. The Special TI/LC reserves will be funded only in the event
that (i) the DSCR (based on actual net cash flow and an assumed
constant of 9.5%) at the 111 Eighth Avenue Property is less than 1.00x
(and until the 111 Eighth Avenue Property has achieved a DSCR equal to
or greater than 1.00x for 2 consecutive calendar quarters) and (ii)
the amount on deposit in the General TI/LC reserve is less than
$8,000,000. No Special TI/LC reserves are required at any time that
the amount on deposit in the General TI/LC reserve is equal to or
greater than $8,000,000.


o    LOCK BOX AND CASH MANAGEMENT. The loan requires a hard lock box, which
is already in place. The loan documents require the borrower to direct
tenants to pay their rents directly to a lender-controlled account.
The loan documents also require that all rents received by the
borrower or the property manager be deposited into the
lender-controlled account (as well as any other rents, receipts,
security deposits or payments related to lease termination or default)
within one business day of receipt. All funds from the
lender-controlled account are transferred to the borrower's operating
account, unless an event of default is continuing or deposits to the
Special TI/LC are required. During the continuance of an event of
default or if deposits for the Special TI/LC are required, funds in
the lock box will be swept on a daily basis into an account controlled
by the lender and applied to pay debt service, operating expenses, and
any required reserves under the loan documents. Upon the occurrence
and during the continuance of an event of default, lender may apply
any sums then held pursuant to the cash management agreement to the
payment of the debt.


o    PROPERTY MANAGEMENT. Taconic Management Company LLC (the "TACONIC
MANAGER"), an affiliate of the borrower, is the property manager for
the 111 Eighth Avenue Property. The lender may replace the property
manager upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of
default under the 111 Eighth Avenue Loan or in the event of the fraud
or willful misconduct

which includes 450 Park Avenue in New York, NY, 600 West Chicago
Avenue in Chicago, IL, and AtlantaXchange in downtown Atlanta, GA. The
Taconic Manager's forty-person organization is headquartered within
111 Eighth Avenue. The current management fee is 3%, provided that if
there is an event of default, management fees in excess of $1,000,000
will not be paid out of property revenues.


o    MEZZANINE OR SUBORDINATE INDEBTEDNESS. Other than the 111 Eighth
Avenue Subordinate Companion Loans, mezzanine or subordinate
indebtedness is not permitted.


o    OTHER ENCUMBRANCES. In connection with the syndication of limited
partnership interests and non-managing member interests in upper-tier
Jamestown entities, and as security for certain bridge loans made to
those upper-tier Jamestown entities, the loan documents permit liens
to be placed upon the right to receive subscription payments, capital
contributions and other distributions of such limited partnership
interests and non-managing member interests. The loan documents,
however, prohibit the creation of any lien that would affect the
control or management of the 111 Eighth Avenue borrower or its
managing member and the foreclosure of such liens and do not grant the
lien holder any intercreditor rights against the holders of the 111
Eighth Avenue Whole Loan.


o    TERRORISM INSURANCE. The loan documents require the borrower to
maintain terrorism insurance in an amount equal to 100% of the then
replacement cost of the 111 Eighth Avenue Property. The 111 Eighth
Avenue Property has terrorism coverage as part of its "all-risk"
property insurance policy. In the event that coverage for terrorism is
not included as part of the "all risk" property policy, the borrower
will, nevertheless be required to obtain coverage for terrorism (as
stand alone coverage) to the extent available, in an amount equal to
the lesser of (a) $500,000,000 and (b) the amount that may be
purchased for the Maximum Required Premium (hereinafter defined);
provided, however, if the insurance premiums payable with respect to
such insurance coverage, exceed the Maximum Required Premium, the
lender may, at its option (1) purchase the policy, with the borrower
paying only the portion of the insurance premiums that equals the
Maximum Required Premium and lender paying the excess or (2) modify
the deductible amounts, policy limits and other required policy terms
to reduce the insurance premiums payable with respect to the policy to
the Maximum Required Premium. As used herein, the "MAXIMUM REQUIRED
PREMIUM" means an amount equal to the greater of (x) 25% of the
aggregate insurance premiums payable with respect to all the property
insurance coverage for the prior policy year and (y) $1,150,000. See
"Risk Factors--Property Insurance" in the prospectus supplement.

The Town & Country Loan had an initial term of 120 months and has a remaining
term of 120 months. The Town & Country Loan requires payments of interest and
principal based on a 300-month schedule, with required monthly payments of
$476,536.97. The scheduled maturity date is the payment date in September 2014.

(1)  Reflects annual operating statements ending September.


(2)  Based on trailing 12 months ended May 31, 2004.


o    THE BORROWER. The borrower is a special-purpose, bankruptcy-remote entity,
with an independent director. Legal counsel to borrower delivered a
non-consolidation opinion in connection with the origination of the Town &
Country Loan. The sponsor of the borrower is Atlas Hotels, Inc. ("ATLAS
HOTELS"), a privately owned hotel operating and management company based in
San Diego, California. Atlas Hotels guaranteed the non-recourse carveouts
of the Town & Country Loan. Atlas Hotels is an independent operator that,
in addition to Town & Country Resort Property, owns and operates the
Carriage Inn, a full-service, 160 room hotel in Ridgecrest, CA. The staff
at the Town & Country Resort Property average over 21 years at the
property. Atlas Hotels constructed the property in phases between 1950 and
1970 and has owned and operated it ever since. Despite its age, the
property has been well maintained with over $17 million of capital
improvements invested in the property over the past five years.


o    ESCROWS. The loan documents provide for certain escrows of real estate
taxes and insurance and provide for collection of a minimum of 5% of
revenues received into a replacement reserve account. The borrower
deposited $255,125 at closing into the replacement reserve for capital
expenditures projected in year one. The borrower also funded a
deferred-maintenance reserve of $343,750, which is 125% of the amount
specified in the property condition report.


o    CONTEMPLATED RENOVATIONS. The borrower has indicated it intends to renovate
the exhibit hall, the hotel lobby, the hotel central core/pool/ patio area
and add new hotel rooms. The loan documents provide that the borrower may
perform any or all of these renovations, provided that (i) such renovations
do not materially and adversely affect the borrower's financial condition
or the value of the Town & Country Resort Property, (ii) if the cost of the
renovations exceeds $3,500,000, the borrower is required to post security
with lender in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the
renovation and $3,500,000, (iii) if one or more of the renovations (at any
one time) will result in removing more than 85 hotel rooms (at any one
time) from service for a period of more than 90 days, the borrower is
required to first obtain lender's written consent (and the lender has
agreed it will not unreasonably withhold such consent).


o    LOCK BOX AND CASH MANAGEMENT. The loan requires a hard lock box, which is
already in place. The loan documents require the borrower to direct credit
card receipts directly to a lender-controlled account. The borrower and the
manager are also required to cause all non-credit card receipts to be
transmitted into the lender-controlled account within two business days of
receipt. Unless a Town & Country Cash Trap Period exists, any amounts in
the lender-controlled account are swept on a daily basis into the
borrower's operating account. A "Town & Country Cash Trap Period" means any
period during which (i) an event of default is continuing, until such event
of default is cured or (ii) the DSCR (based on calculation of net cash flow
as defined in the loan documents) at the end of any quarter is less than
1.10x, until the DSCR minimum threshold has been achieved for two
consecutive quarterly reporting periods. During a Town & Country Cash Trap
Period, all remaining cash (after payment of debt service, required
reserves and approved operating expenses) is required to be deposited into
a cash collateral account and held by the lender as additional collateral
for the Town & Country Loan (and the lender has the right, during the
continuance of an event of default, to apply the cash collateral to the
debt). Additionally, if a mezzanine loan (as described below) is
outstanding and a Town & Country Cash Trap Period does not exist, all
amounts in the lender controlled account will be swept into another lender
controlled account and used by lender to cover debt service, required
reserve payments and approved operating expenses, with any remaining funds
being disbursed to the borrower.

TEN LARGEST MORTGAGE LOANS - TOWN & COUNTRY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------








o    PROPERTY MANAGEMENT. Atlas Hotels, an affiliate of the borrower, is the
property manager of the Town & Country Resort Property. Atlas Hotels has
managed the Town & Country Resort Property since its original construction
and also manages the Carriage Inn, a full-service, 160 room hotel in
Ridgecrest, CA. The property manager receives a management fee equal to
3.0% of the gross revenues. The lender may replace the property manager if

(i) the borrower fails to maintain a DSCR (based on calculation of net cash
flow as defined in the loan documents) of at least 1.10x for two
consecutive calendar quarters, (ii) an event of default is continuing under
the Town & Country Loan, (iii) the property manager is in default under the
management agreement, or (iv) the property manager exhibits gross
negligence, malfeasance or willful misconduct.


o    MEZZANINE OR SUBORDINATE INDEBTEDNESS. The direct and indirect equity
owners of the borrower are permitted to incur mezzanine debt from an
Approved Mezzanine Lender (as defined below) secured by a pledge of 100% of
their equity interests, provided that, among other things, (i) the combined
maximum loan to "as is" appraised value is not more than 65%, (ii) the
combined debt service coverage ratio is at least 1.35x (based upon the
actual net cash flow for the preceding 12 month period), (iii) the
mezzanine loan is co-terminous with the term of the Town & Country Loan;

(iv) the Approved Mezzanine Lender enters into an acceptable intercreditor
agreement, and (v) the borrower delivers Rating Agency confirmation that
the mezzanine debt will not result in the downgrade, withdrawal or
qualification of the then current ratings of the series 2004-GG2
certificates. With respect to the Town & Country Loan, "Approved Mezzanine
Lender" means (a) any bank, savings and loan association, investment bank,
insurance company, trust company, commercial credit corporation, pension
plan, pension fund, pension advisory firm, mutual fund, government entity
or plan, investment company or institution substantially similar to any of
the foregoing, provided in each case that such institution (i) has total
assets (in name or under management) in excess of $600,000,000 and (except
with respect to a pension advisory firm or similar fiduciary)
capital/statutory surplus or shareholder's equity in excess of $250,000,000
and (ii) is regularly engaged in the business of making or owning
commercial real estate loans or operating commercial mortgage properties or

(b) any other mezzanine lender that has been approved by the Rating
Agencies.


o    TERRORISM INSURANCE. The loan documents require the borrower to maintain
terrorism insurance in an amount equal to 100% of the then replacement cost
of the Town & Country Resort Property. The Town & Country Resort Property
currently has terrorism coverage as part of its "all-risk" property
insurance policy. In the event that coverage for terrorism is not included
as part of the "all risk" property policy, the borrower will be required to
purchase terrorism insurance, to the extent available; provided that the
borrower will not be required to pay an insurance premium in excess of 25%
of the aggregate insurance premiums paid with respect to all the property
insurance coverage for the prior policy year (as adjusted annually by
increases in CPI) (the "TERRORISM PREMIUM CAP"); provided that if the
insurance premiums payable with respect to such terrorism insurance
coverage exceed the Terrorism Premium Cap, the lender may, at its option

(1) purchase the insurance and require that the borrower pay only the
portion of the insurance premium that equals the Terrorism Premium Cap (in
which case, lender would pay the excess) or (2) modify the deductible
amounts, policy limits and other required policy terms to reduce the
insurance premiums payable with respect to the policy to the Terrorism
Premium Cap. See "Risk Factors--Property Insurance" in the prospectus
supplement.

(1)  Calculated based on approximate square footage occupied by each tenant.


o    THE BORROWER. The borrower is TUP 130, LLC, a single asset
bankruptcy-remote single member limited liability company with an
independent director, sponsored by a joint venture between affiliates
(and their affiliated family members and trusts) of David Hocker &
Associates, Inc. ("DHA") and R.F. Coffin Enterprises, Inc. The
borrower's sole member is TUP 130 Company, LP. Legal counsel to the
borrower delivered a non-consolidation opinion in connection with the
origination of the Barnes Crossing Loan. There is no guarantor of the
non-recourse carve-outs under the Barnes Crossing Loan.


o    ESCROWS. The loan documents provide for certain escrows of real estate
taxes and insurance and provide for collection of replacement
reserves. In addition, the loan documents call for an initial deposit
of $600,000 into a reserve for tenant improvement and leasing
commissions and monthly deposits of $36,896, if and while any Anchor
Condition, as defined below, exists. If at any time the balance
decreases to less than $600,000, the borrower must replenish it via
re-institution of monthly deposits of $36,896 ($442,751 per year). Any
payments received for lease terminations and liquidations of security
deposits from defaulted tenants are also required to be deposited in
the leasing reserve. The borrower funded an initial deferred
maintenance reserve of $1,500,000 for replacement of the roof. The
borrower is required to establish a capital expenditure reserve to be
funded with monthly deposits of $9,838.92 ($118,067 per year). An
"ANCHOR CONDITION" (A) exists if, with respect to an anchor tenant at
the mortgaged property, (i) such anchor tenant's lease is terminated,

(ii) it files bankruptcy, (iii) it ceases operations at the premises,

(iv) it is in material monetary default or (v) it fails to renew its
lease at least twelve months prior to its lease expiration, and (B)
will end if and when any condition listed above is remedied or when
the borrower provides an acceptable replacement anchor tenant. If and
while an Anchor Condition exists with respect to two anchor tenants,
excess cash flow after debt service, required reserve deposits and
operating expenses (if not then swept as additional loan collateral
due to a CRC Event (as defined below) will be deposited into the
leasing reserve.


o    LOCK BOX AND CASH MANAGEMENT. The loan requires a hard lock box, which
is already in place. The loan documents require the borrower to direct
the tenants to pay their rents directly to a lender-controlled
account. The loan documents also require that all rents received by
the borrower or the property manager be deposited into the hard lock
box or deposit account (as well as any other rents, receipts, security
deposits or payments related to lease termination or default) within
one business day after receipt. The loan documents require that funds
in the deposit account be used to pay debt service, reserves and, if a
CRC Event occurs or if an Anchor Condition exists with respect to two
or more anchor tenants, approved operating expenses. Any funds
remaining in the lock box after application of the amounts specified
above, will be returned to the borrower within one business day of the
payment date under the Barnes Crossing Loan. A "CRC EVENT" means (i)
the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default (as

defined in the loan documents), until such time that the Event of
Default is cured, or (ii) the DSCR measured as of the end of any
calendar quarter (based on actual annual net cash flow for the
12-month period ending at the end of such quarter) is not at least
1.05x, until such time that the DSCR is at least 1.05x measured at the
end of any calendar quarter.


o    PROPERTY MANAGEMENT. The Barnes Crossing Property is managed by DHA
(the "BARNES CROSSING MANAGER") and R.F. Coffin Enterprises, Inc. (the
"BARNES CROSSING ADDITIONAL MANAGER"). The Barnes Crossing Manager and
the Barnes Crossing Additional Manager are responsible for the
operation, management, maintenance, promotion and marketing of the
Barnes Crossing Property, with the Barnes Crossing Additional Manager
assisting the Barnes Crossing Manger to the extent such assistance is
reasonably required by the borrower. DHA, a retail real estate
development and management company, headquartered in Owensboro,
Kentucky, was founded in 1964. It opened its first shopping center,
Wesleyan Park Plaza, in Owensboro, Kentucky. Since its inception, DHA
has developed 40 shopping centers containing over 14 million square
feet of retail space in 13 southeastern states, valued at
$800,000,000. Currently, DHA's existing portfolio consists of eight
retail developments containing 4.3 million square feet in four states.
DHA provides real estate services including: retail property
development and leasing; acquisition and finance; property management
and operations; and design and construction. The lender may replace
the Barnes Crossing Manager or the Barnes Crossing Additional Manager

(i) upon a CRC Event, or (ii) upon the gross negligence, malfeasance
or willful misconduct of the Barnes Crossing Manager or the Barnes
Crossing Additional Manager.


o    RELEASE OF COLLATERAL. The loan documents permit the borrower to
obtain a release of the Parisian parcel from the lien of the mortgage
upon the substitution of $3,500,000 in eligible defeasance collateral
and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the
loan documents, in connection with repositioning of the Parisian
premises with a replacement anchor, a combination of junior anchors,
or one or more junior anchors and additional in-line space.
Additionally, the borrower has an option to purchase the McRae's
parcel (not collateral for the Barnes Crossing Loan) under certain
circumstances, in the event McRae's discontinues a retail department
store business at the parcel after its operating covenant terminates
in August 2006. If the borrower purchases the McRae's parcel, this
parcel would become additional collateral for the Barnes Crossing
Loan; provided however, that in the event the borrower were to sell
this parcel to an affiliate of the borrower, a substitute anchor, or a
third party that would lease space to a substitute anchor, the
borrower will be permitted to release this pad from the lien of the
mortgage without payment of any release price.


o    MEZZANINE OR SUBORDINATE INDEBTEDNESS. Not Permitted.


o    TERRORISM INSURANCE. The Barnes Crossing Property is insured against
acts of terrorism as part of its all-risk property insurance. The loan
documents require the borrower to maintain property insurance over the
term of the Barnes Crossing Loan. On future annual renewals, terrorism
insurance must be maintained, subject to a premium limit equal to the
greater of (i) 50% of the total property insurance premium without
terrorism coverage or (ii) 200% of the premium for such terrorism
coverage at loan closing, subject to certain adjustments set forth in
the loan documents. See "Risk Factors--Property Insurance" in the
prospectus supplement.

How cash-out refinancing works



The cash out refinance is designed to accomplish two goals — to improve on the terms of an existing home loan and deliver additional funds at a low interest rate. Other types of mortgage refinance include the rate and term refinance, in which the new loan amount is equal to the remaining balance on the old mortgage, and the limited cash out refinance, in which the closing costs are added wrapped into the new loan, increasing its balance.It only makes sense to undertake a cash-out refinance if the new loan comes with a better refinance rate or more favorable terms (replacing an adjustable rate home loan with a fixed rate mortgage, for example).

Refinance with cash out: conforming loans
It is important to note that cash out refinancing generally costs more than rate and term or limited cash out refinancing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, require lenders to collect surcharges for these loans (called “conforming” mortgages) because they are considered riskier.
The added costs of cash out refinancing can be substantial and should be considered carefully. If, for example, a homeowner wishes to refinance a $200,000 mortgage and take an additional $10,000 cash out, there may be no extra costs (the new loan amount is less than 60 percent of the home’s value and the borrower has a 700 FICO score, for example). On the other hand, if the homeowner has a 650 FICO and the new loan amount is 83 percent of the property value, it would cost an extra $6,300 to borrow $10,000!
In general, cash out refinancing is likely to be the lowest cost option when the amount of additional cash is relatively high. In the above example, the added costs come to 63 percent of the amount borrowed. If the homeowner were to take $100,000 cash out, however, the added costs come to nine percent of the amount borrowed — a considerably lower figure. The chart below shows the added costs, which depend on the borrower’s credit score and the loan-to-value ratio. Notice cash out is limited to 85 percent of the property value.




What is cash-out refinancing?
A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

Glossary Terms
​ Cash-Out Refinancing

A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

​ Equity

The difference between the fair market value of an asset (like a home) and the amount of debt against that asset (like a mortgage balance).

​  Rate and Term Refinancing

A mortgage refinance that replaces the existing mortgage with a new one but does not disburse cash to the borrower. Rate and term refinancing is undertaken simply to improve on the terms of the old loan – reducing the interest rate is a popular goal.

​  Refinance 

Refinancing means replacing one loan with a new, better loan. Improving the terms of a loan can mean obtaining a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment, replacing an adjustable or variable rate loan with a fixed-rate loan or increasing the size of the loan and taking the difference in cash.

Cash-Out Refinance Pros
Cash out refinancing offers a few advantages over other sources of funds:

Because it’s secured by real estate, the interest rate is lower than rates for unsecured financing.
Because it’s a first mortgage, the interest rate is lower than rates for home equity loans, which are usually second mortgages.
The interest may be tax-deductible. Check with a tax pro.



Cash-Out Refinance Cons

Underwriting guidelines are stricter than for rate and term refinancing.
Costs are higher because surcharges are assessed against the entire refinance, not just the amount of cash out.
Cash out refinancing takes longer than setting up a home equity loan or personal (unsecured) loan.
Increasing the loan-to-value to over 80 percent requires mortgage insurance.







 



Alternatives to cash-out refinancing
Homeowners considering a cash out refinance should compare the costs of all available options:

Rate and term refinance plus a home equity loan (if terms of existing loan can be bettered)
Adding just a home equity loan (if existing loan cannot be improved)
Taking a personal loan (if credit rating is good and costs are low)
Consolidating debt with a debt management plan or balance transfer card

Cash out refinancing is a valid strategy for financing anything from college tuition to debt consolidation to home improvements. However, homeowners should run the numbers and consider the total cost of borrowing — lender fees, interest rates and third party costs — before committing.

Will you save money by refinancing your current loan?
A mortgage refinance can mean big savings, but it may come at a price in the short term. The decision to refinance generally comes down to whether you'll be in your home long enough for your monthly savings to outweigh the upfront refinancing costs. Our Refinance Calculator can help you determine the amount of time you'll need to stay in your home after refinancing your mortgage to breakeven and cover your costs.

Breakeven Analysis







                                    Monthly Payment
                                    ?
There are several ways to calculate your refinance breakeven. The "quick and dirty" method involves dividing the difference in your monthly payment by the refinancing costs. That isn't necessarily the most accurate method, and the longer you've been paying your current loan, the less accurate that breakeven calculation is. In addition, this method won't help you if your refinancing from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year loan.










                                    Interest Expense
                                    ?
The next method is based on the difference in  interest expense between your current loan and a refinance mortgage. Your breakeven is that point in which the total interest savings equals the cost of refinancing. This method allows you to compare loans with different terms.










                                    Mortgage Tax Deduction
                                    ?
If you itemize your deductions when you file your taxes, it affects your breakeven point. Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage deductions. Refinancing to a lower rate decreases your mortgage interest deduction.










                                    Pay Down Existing Mortgage
                                    ?
You can choose to refinance or leave your mortgage alone, but you have another option -- use your cash to pay down your mortgage balance instead of spending it on refinancing. You can reamortize your loan to reduce your payment or accelerate your repayment. This breakeven method measures how long it would take for your refinance payment less the reamortized payment on your current mortgage to cover the costs of refinancing.

What is the HARP Program?
When you have little equity in your home, or owe as much or more on your mortgage than your home is worth, it can be difficult to find a lender willing to help you refinance.
                            But for borrowers who have remained current on their mortgages, and have loans owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, there is hope. It’s called Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP).
                        
Introduced in March 2009, HARP enables borrowers with little or no equity to refinance into more affordable mortgages without new or additional mortgage insurance.
                            HARP targets borrowers with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios equal to or greater than 80 percent and who have limited delinquencies over the 12 months prior to refinancing.







Significant changes have been made to HARP since the program was first introduced. For example, in 2011 the LTV ceiling was removed, property appraisal requirements were waived in certain circumstances, certain risk fees for borrowers
                            selecting shorter amortization terms were eliminated, and certain representations and warranties were waived. In 2013, the eligibility date was changed from the date the loan was acquired by Fannie Mae                            or Freddie Mac to the date on the note, increasing the pool of eligible borrowers.
                        
Through HARP, you can get a lower interest rate (which means less out-of-pocket costs each month), get a shorter loan term, or change from an adjustable to fixed-rate
                            mortgage. There’s no minimum credit score needed, either.
                        
And now that HARP guidelines are simpler, even people who were formerly turned down may now be eligible for HARP refinancing.
                        
Find out if you qualify for HARP!




How can HARP help me?
If you are current on your mortgage; have a mortgage that is owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and owe as much or more than your home is currently worth, you may be eligible for HARP refinancing. That can mean significant savings
                            by: 

Lowering your monthly payment
Reducing your interest rate
Securing a fixed-rate mortgage that won’t change over time
Building equity faster—shorter term options may be available
Lower closing costs because an appraisal is not usually required
Check your HARP eligibility‎!





HARP program includes:


No underwater limits
Borrowers will now be able to refinance regardless of how far their homes have fallen in value. Previous loan-to-value limits were set at 125 percent.
                                


No appraisals or underwriting
Most homeowners will not have to get an appraisal or have their loan underwritten, making their refinance process smoother and faster.


Modified fees
Certain risk-based fees for borrowers who refinance into shorter-term loans have been reduced.


Less paperwork
Lenders now need less paperwork for income verification, and have the option of qualifying a borrower by documenting that the borrower has at least 12 months
                                    of mortgage payments in reserve.


Program Deadline
The end date to get a HARP refinance is September 30, 2017.


Check if you qualify for HARP before it's gone!
