Longtime CFO Mark Buthman: “I’m Ready for a Change”
Buthman, who has been with Kimberly-Clark for 33 years, the last 12 as CFO, wants some new challenges.

Mark Buthman graduated from the University of Iowa in May of 1982 with a degree in finance and business. The next month, he went to work for Kimberly-Clark as a cost analyst at a Memphis manufacturing facility.
Thirty-three years later, he is still with the paper-products maker, the only full-time employer he’s had. But not for much longer. Buthman, the company’s CFO since January 2003, will step down from that role on April 27 and retire at year-end.
Although he’s now one of the more senior finance chiefs among Fortune 500 companies, and his particular employer has $20 billion in annual revenue and 43,000 employees, Buthman says he never aspired to the role. For much of his career, he assumed he’d wind up running one of Kimberly-Clark’s businesses.
Mark Buthman
That changed in the late 1990s, when he was vice president of strategic planning and analysis and began to see that he was on a track that could take him to the top finance seat, if that was what he wanted. In 2000, Tom Falk, then the company’s chief operating officer, confided in Buthman that Falk would likely be Kimberly-Clark’s next chief executive, and that when that time came he wanted Buthman to be his CFO.
“Tom is probably the smartest person I’ve ever met, and he’s got a brilliant financial mind,” Buthman says of Falk, who’s still the CEO. “I told him, ‘Tom, you’re so good at finance that I’m not sure being your CFO would be much fun.’ I stepped back over a weekend to think and talk to my wife about it. I wanted to be at the leadership table that would set the company’s course for the future, so on Monday I told him that if that was the role he wanted me to play, I’d be honored to do it.”
Questioning his suitability for a role was old hat for Buthman. “Early on in my career, I was a beneficiary of leaders in our organization who always saw more potential in me than I saw in myself,” he says. “Before I became CFO, I never had a job at Kimberly-Clark that lasted more than two years. In each climb to the next level there was an element of uncertainty. Some people brim with confidence and make their own path. I learned along the way. People saw that potential in me, and that’s part of our job as leaders, to make that right judgment of when someone is ready to stretch to that next climb.”
A significant challenge arose six years into Buthman’s tenure as CFO. He had been 42 when he took on the role, leading a team whose senior members were largely in their 50s and 60s. “They were very good at what they did, they’d all been in their roles, at Kimberly-Clark or elsewhere, for at least 15 years, and they were not going to let me make a mistake,” he says. “They were like a warm blanket.”
In 2009, the company put an early retirement offer on the table, and eight of those people left in the same month. Suddenly, Buthman was missing 200 years of leadership experience. “We had robust succession plans for every one of them, and we had started to build capabilities behind them, but I didn’t think it was all going to happen at once,” he says. “I was really nervous.
It turned out to be an excellent learning experience, though. Buthman was overwhelmed by a surge of innovation and fresh ideas put forth by the new group over the next year.
For example, the new blood came up with a number of ideas for closing the books earlier, and since 2009 the turnaround time has shrunk from nine days to four. Forming a new leadership team with largely different backgrounds from the old one and reaping the benefits from the new perspectives opened his eyes. Buthman decided he would set their direction and “just let them go.”
“Now, we made more mistakes at first,” he says, “but it was a way to unlock our potential and make my impact much bigger. I was involved in important things that I really had to have my heart and soul in, but there are many important decisions that have to be made in a finance organization every day that are much better made by, for example, our treasurer, our head of tax, or the CFO of our consumer division, instead of having my hands in the mix.”
In fact, the need to make fewer decisions is a hallmark of a modern CFO, according to Buthman. When he started out back in the 1980s, he says, all information flowed uphill in an organization, so those at the top added value by making key strategic decisions.
“Today I actually make relatively few decisions, because information is now disseminated so widely. My job now is to set direction, set boundaries, help set culture, and try to put the people closest to a problem in [a] position to make good decisions.”
The idea that new leadership brings fresh ideas is actually one of the reasons behind Buthman’s plan to retire. “I am now one of those people who have been in a role for a long time,” he says. “The organization kind of adapts to you. Succession planning is not just about individual people, it’s about the whole ecosystem. Fresh eyes on old problems create innovation. I’m at a point where after 13 years in the CFO role, all my best ideas have been tried. I didn’t want to be the guy who stayed a year or two too long. I have a certain way of leading, and Maria Henry [who will take the finance reins from Buthman] will have a different way.”
He gives some other reasons for his impending departure. He’s accomplished most of what he set out to accomplish, for one. He also wants to “exercise [his] leadership muscles” outside of Kimberly-Clark, perhaps as a member of boards and as a mentor to young finance professionals. “I have an idea that new CFOs may not have enough support to get them jump-started, and there may be an opportunity to help them, either as a CFO or a coach,” he says.
Otherwise, Buthman, still young at 55, says he doesn’t yet know what else his future may hold. One thing he won’t do, he says, is take another CFO job.
Asked to name the highlight of his career, Buthman says that from a company standpoint there was no one event that stood out. He points instead to the three CEOs he’s worked under, each of which pushed Kimberly-Clark in a new direction.
The first, Darwin Smith in the 1980s, took it from a pulp-and-paper operation, managing millions of acres of timberland around the world, to a consumer-products company. The second, Wayne Sanders, pushed for a change in portfolio composition in the 1990s, when Buthman, as a point person on a series of acquisitions and divestitures, helped to again reshape the company. That effort created the international business that is now its growth driver. Falk’s tenure has been about shaping the organization’s execution focus, putting together a deeper leadership team, and improving its marketing, brand-building, and strategic-thinking capabilities.
From a personal standpoint, Buthman says, he’s proudest of having had an impact on people. Since he’s been at the company for such a long time, he’s gotten “hundreds” of notes since announcing his retirement plan. “Not one of them highlighted a business decision I made, or a compelling speech, or anything else business-oriented,” he says. “They were all about little ways I had an effect on them. You don’t think about that as you’re going through the journey, but to me the ability to inspire people is very fulfilling.”
How do you feel on the inside, Buthman is asked, about leaving the company after so many years? He doesn’t appear to be overly sentimental. “People come and go,” he says. “It doesn’t mean your personal relationships with them change. I’ve had a long run, so I’m anxious to try some other things to push myself and grow. I’m ready for a change.”

Driving Individual Innovation: Mark Buthman, CFO, Kimberly-Clark







Mark Buthman
Mark Buthman, SVP and CFO of Kimberly-Clark Corporation since 2003, is known for establishing the “Power of a CFO,” a mindset to motivate his finance organization of 1,600 people to offer ideas and challenge the status quo.
In addition to overseeing a global finance organization spanning 54 countries, he is responsible for Kimberly-Clark’s real estate, investor relations, information technology (IT) and procurement teams.
Mr. Buthman, who has announced he will be retiring at the end of the year, discusses why it’s important to push not only his finance team but also IT, sales, marketing and others, to bring more value—to themselves as well as to the company.
Q: How does the “Power of a CFO” work in practice in a finance organization that is so large and dispersed across different geographies?
Mark Buthman: “The Power of a CFO” is more about a mindset, behaviors and thinking like a CFO rather than specific skills. I often say that in finance our job is to bring an independent, economic mindset to difficult business problems. So in keeping with “The Power of a CFO,” this is a mindset that I want the 1,600 people in my finance organization to take. The three ideas at the core of the “Power of a CFO” are: inspire, drive and transform. The simple construct of inspire, drive and transform is based on my own personal objectives. All the results I’m responsible for, whether it’s interest expense, cash flow, business unit performance, that’s under what I can drive, and that cascades to my finance deputies. I’m very much a believer that if you can get your top 100 leaders modeling desired behavior, others will look to them and emulate them.
I expect everyone on my team to inspire the people around them to drive business results, to improve their performance and transform their capabilities every day. Every single person in my organization has those three categories of objectives, although they’re not strictly prescribed. I want all of our employees to come to work every day trying to do things just a little bit better and to never be satisfied with the status quo. In a sense, it’s about individual innovation.
To put the program into action, we encourage everyone in the finance organization to send us their ideas for improvement. My leadership team provides feedback, and we communicate the ideas out through various channels, including videos, blogs and face-to-face meetings. We also have an awards program to recognize achievement, with an award given for each of the behaviors we’re trying to drive. For example, a new employee based in Costa Rica attended a kick-off meeting on the “Power of a CFO” and followed up with an idea that later would save the company millions of dollars. The program comes down to sharing great ideas, especially across functional boundaries and geographies, to make things better.
Q: You also train your finance staff in risk-taking skills. Why and how are you doing that?
Mark Buthman: A few years ago, we conducted an engagement survey and found that our finance people did not feel empowered to take risks; in fact, they believed they were encouraged to avoid risk. That bothered me because I knew that without the right approach to risk-taking, we could be held back in creating value. I discussed the findings with our head of risk management, and a few months later he came back with ideas for a smart risk-taking and decision-making program. To date, we’ve trained 4,500 people in smart risk-taking, and it has become part of our core leadership behavior of decision making. Talk about someone who embodies “The Power of a CFO.” This person wasn’t operating from an assignment, but rather from his own initiative.
Q: What guidance can you offer CFOs looking to develop their finance teams?
Mark Buthman: I think you need to articulate what your expectations are. That’s the real value of the three categories of inspire, drive and transform—to make it easier for others to understand my priorities. Setting clear expectations with your team and your customers is important, and often that can involve changing the mindset of teams and recalibrating what’s expected within the business. You also have to provide tools and development programs to reach everybody, especially in a large organization, such as an online university with hundreds of resources.
We provide a lot of in-person training, including problem-solving. For example, with our top talent we do a simulation in which a CFO and a CEO come into the room and pressure test their conclusions. We also offer rotations to provide people experiences within different parts of the organization. When possible, we provide our finance team experience outside of finance, which can really stretch their leadership capabilities.
Q: Is “The Power of a CFO” and your other talent development programs used outside of finance?
Mark Buthman: Yes, in part, as the concepts apply universally. I have talked with our sales, marketing analytics and digital teams, as well as our IT and procurement organizations. To me this can apply to anyone. It’s about thinking like an aspirational leader and unlocking the potential of each person in the organization to deliver their best in a way that they can figure out. Of course, not everyone wants to take this approach, so that is the challenge. My response is, “It’s not just to make your life easier; it’s to have a bigger impact.” A big part of the challenge is figuring out how to bring changes to the wider organization, so others can understand and strive for something they never had before.
Q: Since the IT function reports to you, how do you see finance benefiting from a closer alignment to IT?
Mark Buthman: There’s a wealth of information out there, and it is a big, untapped opportunity for us. The connection linking IT, finance and marketing is going to get closer and closer. Our challenge is how to connect data from across the company in a way that drives insights. So it’s about figuring out how to use the data and apply individual logic to it. We have a project called “True North,” which uses statistical methods to understand correlations which translate into predictive analytics, and to help predict actions for business decisions that are being made. For example, “If I do this trade promotion, what will the result be? Or If I run this marketing campaign, what will the result be?” My dream is to have the right information to make the right decisions on the desktop of every decision-maker around the world right at the time they need to make the decision. It’s very possible, but it’s also a very complicated problem to solve. There’s no information we need to make a decision that can’t be delivered to the desktop. It’s all available to us.

Online Shopping to Set Holiday Record: Survey

                          With the holiday shopping season in full swing, the internet is widening its lead as consumers’ most preferred shopping destination, and an increasingly “digital mindset” is influencing how gift-givers research and make purchases. These are just some of the findings from Deloitte’s 31st Annual Holiday Survey of consumer spending intentions and trends. The internet is not only having an impact on where people shop and how much they spend, but on how they shop, according to the survey.
                        



Deloitte’s 2015 Holiday Survey: Consumers Upbeat Amid Retail Disruption

                          Consumers anticipate spending 11% more on holiday items in 2015 and many intend to spend more than or the same as last year, according to Deloitte’s 2015 Annual Holiday Survey. The expected uptick, which is occurring despite flat income growth, is attributed by Deloitte economists to an improving labor market, increasing home values and lower gas prices. The survey also found that concerns about personal data protection persist. Nevertheless, over half of those surveyed indicate they will continue to patronize retailers that have experienced a data breach.

Four Ways CFOs Can Avoid a Digital Talent Crunch

                          Technology is redefining how work gets done, both in the back office and in frontline operations. While the rapid growth of digital technologies creates new opportunities for finance, it also creates the potential for a digital divide: If members of the finance team lack the necessary skillsets and business acumen, they may not be able to make the most of these new digital capabilities.  Learn how CFOs can help their organization advance its digital efforts by focusing on leadership, culture, skills development and engagement.
                        



Keeping Finance Talent Relevant to Changing Needs: Charles Holley, CFO-in-Residence

                          It’s no secret that talent is key to a CFO’s success, yet talent is a perennial top challenge for CFOs. That’s partly due to the continually changing definition of what it means to have a talented finance team, says Charles Holley, an independent senior advisor to Deloitte. Drawing on his extensive leadership experiences, he explains how to identify, recruit and develop the people best suited for the fast-changing demands of finance. The key, he says, is finding the best athletes and keeping their capabilities relevant and aligned to the needs of the business.
                        



FP&A: Why Talent Counts and What CFOs Can Do to Improve It

                          To elevate the strategic contribution that a finance organization’s FP&A team can make, CFOs should focus on developing the team’s technical, professional and leadership competencies. Specifically, they can use a four-part model that provides opportunities to gain education and experience with exposure to key decision-makers and the expectation that FP&A will function more strategically. Rotating talent from FP&A into the business and back again can also help team members acquire both a broader understanding of the organization and the specialized knowledge that can make this function integral to the organization’s success.

                            Mark Buthman: Facilitating and framing issues

Mark Buthman,Chief financial officer, Kimberly-Clark Corporation
Kimberly-Clark has a great tradition of innovation. It pioneered five of the eight consumer product categories where it does business, including facial tissues, training and youth pants, and bathroom tissue. Now the company is under pressure to innovate in the way it does business, too, as it drives an ambitious international expansion. Mark Buthman, who has been chief financial officer for more than 10 years, sees the CFO as a facilitator and framer of issues, someone who can help the company expand rapidly even while improving its profitability. Here, he explains how the role of CFO at Kimberly-Clark is changing.
What are the primary opportunities and challenges that face Kimberly-Clark?
The biggest driver of our business is international growth. As per capita incomes grow around the world, our categories are among the first that consumers enter for the first time, or where they aspire to better performance, better brands.
At the same time, as the economy has become more difficult in developed markets, we need to provide differentiation and clear value in terms of the performance and the perception of our products. People are nervous about spending. Our products have to be demonstrably better than the alternatives.
So we have to have great product innovation and great product performance and we have to communicate that performance effectively, all over the world.
In the emerging markets, are you designing new business models and changing pricing to grow rapidly?
The key for us is balancing the global approach—scalable ideas and model—with the local market and local consumer. Keeping that balance is a challenge because you want to drive scale, but in local markets there are different demand dynamics that you have to respond to.
For instance, in China, with disposable diapers, there are clear expectations in terms of fit and leakage protection, and yet they don’t want to change their babies as often as folks in the United States do. With Huggies, we have to figure out how to deliver to those expectations at a price point the parents in China can afford. We’ve had to find a way to manufacture and to provide the same functional benefit at a lower cost.
How did the CFO function play a role in that?
We partnered with the businesses to design a new product development, procurement, manufacturing and marketing model in China. First we framed the problem that needed to be solved. Then we used information and analytics to provide some options.
What about in the developed markets. What role are you playing there?
In every one of our categories, we have to be competitive on price and have the best- performing product. That’s a universal truth. In a big box store, where you have our products side by side with another premium product, we have to price very competitively or the consumer may switch. So the role we play is in working with all the parts of our company—supply chain, product development, manufacturing— to create a cost structure that will support sustainable investment and make the product successful. We bring the various stakeholders together. We’re at the table when every key strategic decision is made. We bring an independent, economic perspective to the decision.
You have been CFO for more than 10 years. How is the role changing?
Some things are the same. We don’t have unlimited resources, so the CFO has to be the champion of resource allocation. Next, we help with setting goals and targets that balance investments. We take into consideration the degree of difficulty in getting something done, risks, and prospects for growth, profitability and returns on capital. Then we hold teams accountable for their business results.
What’s changing, though, is the role of information technology in business. Earlier, the CFO had access to all the information, aggregated it and used it when making decisions. Now, thanks to the Internet and other technologies, people throughout the organization have great access to information. In the old days my job was directing and deciding. Now I should be facilitating, orchestrating and influencing rather than mandating. My expectation for my team and myself is that we develop a compelling business case and champion the change. This way, we’re working to drive change that is embraced. We’re not so much pushing as the organization is pulling.
How do you help drive agility within the business?
The competitive environment has accelerated so much that we’ve got to be much more nimble, much more agile, much more wired in. In the planning process, there are much shorter lead times to project what the business is going to do.
At Kimberly-Clark, we talk a lot about taking smart risks. In a lot of companies, the finance role is being a policeman. But, here, we’re more of a teacher, a leader, a facilitator. If our role is just to say no any time there’s a risk on the table, we’ re not going to create much value for our shareholders. Our job is to help frame issues and get the organization to take smart, calculated risks.
Will you provide an example where you played the facilitator and framer role in an effort that let to a new revenue opportunity?
One area where we have done that is in the international expansion. We have helped the company size up the emerging markets opportunities and figure out how to successfully compete in them. Now, about half of our total capital spend is on building capacity and innovation. In 2012, for the first time, we spent more capital in developing markets than in developed markets. The shift in our capital allocation didn’t mirror the growth of business in these newer markets; it led the transformation of the business. That was a shift that my team led.
At the same time, we have dramatically increased marketing in developing markets—to establish our brands there. We have done that while increasing our gross margins. That’s possible because of the cost improvements we’re making.
What is technology’s role in making the company more efficient, innovative and competitive?
The Internet and transparency of consumer information and competitive cost information is changing the way the whole world works. Your ability to sustain a pricing advantage in an Internet-driven world is about a nanosecond. So we’re joined at the hip with the CIO, Jennifer Sepull; in fact, she reports to me. Our goal is to provide information so business leaders can make better, faster and higher quality decisions.
My vision for our organization is to have the right information on the desktop for all of our decision makers, so they can make a quality decision when they need to make it. We’re not there yet. The CIO and the CFO can partner to bring that reality to life.
We need mobile and collaboration technologies to drive team engagement across functional and geographic boundaries. If I can use technology to get information more rapidly across our organization, it gives us the opportunity to unlock the best ideas.
Technology also improves our ability to do things better. We can compare our performance against benchmarks. And we can share our problem-solving experiences. I don’t have to wrestle with an issue by myself. I can find somebody else who has dealt with the same issue already, and learn from him or her. The connections that technology provides are invaluable.
How has your relationship with the IT function changed over the years?
In the old days, the CFO was the gatekeeper of the money. The CIO had to come and ask for money, like everybody else. Now, it’s more a conversation about how we invest in IT as a core capability. We’re helping control costs by adopting standard technologies and standard ways of handling data across the organization, and by eliminating redundant systems. Once you’ve done that you can free up resources to spend on new capabilities, on innovation. So, the most important role for the CFO is framing issues that create new opportunities, enthusiasm and energy throughout the company.

Coaching the Next Generation: Mark Buthman, Board Director and Retired CFO







 







Mark Buthman






 
Mark Buthman spent 33 years at Kimberly-Clark, working his way up from a cost analyst to CFO and serving in several non-finance posts along the way. Having retired at the end of 2015, he now sits on the boards of for-profit and non-profit organizations and serves on the Financial Executives Advisory Group for Deloitte’s CFO Program.
Mr. Buthman discusses what his 12-year term as CFO taught him, the steps he took to develop finance employees to their full potential, and how he helps to guide current and aspiring CFOs in this conversation with Sanford (Sandy) Cockrell III, U.S. national managing partner, CFO Program, Deloitte LLP. Mr. Buthman also talks about the relationship between the board and the CFO and what boards expect of CFOs.
 







Sanford Cockrell III






 
Sandy Cockrell: You spent your entire career at Kimberly-Clark, but not always in finance. What were the key milestones in reaching the CFO position?
Mark Buthman: I always wanted to drive business results, to lead teams, and to coach, influence and develop people. Those were more important motivators for me than becoming CFO. In fact, I think the non-finance roles I took on were the most important because they forced me to lead without relying on my financial skills and experiences. Running a tissue plant, for example, was a fantastic leadership opportunity because I literally brought nothing to the table other than perhaps the ability to do the budget. Everything else was about getting the team to where it needed to go.
At one point, I was also asked to support some M&A transactions, but I didn’t have extensive training in it at the time. Those projects came with a lot of responsibility and forced me to learn skills and a new nomenclature very rapidly. They really tested my learning agility, and I’m grateful that I had the opportunity to stretch myself in a new space.
Sandy Cockrell: You believe in the value of measuring and improving employee engagement. How have you seen such efforts translate into results?
Mark Buthman: I think a highly engaged workforce correlates to improved bottom-line performance. About halfway into my tenure as CFO we did an engagement survey that showed that some people in my finance organization didn’t feel like they were empowered to take risks. They felt like they were more encouraged to cut costs and avoid risks than to drive growth in the business. That frustrated me because business is about taking calculated risks, and to me the finance organization is the ideal resource to be able to help the business determine risk/reward tradeoffs.
I shared my concern with the head of risk management at the time, and he worked with someone from our legal team to put together a program called “Smart Risk-Taking.” Within about 18 months the program trained 5,000 people, both within and outside finance. “Smart Risk-Taking” ultimately became an element of one of the core behaviors we expected from anyone in a leadership role.
Sandy Cockrell: You also have advocated for pushing decision-making down in the organization. What is the benefit of doing that?
Mark Buthman: The role of a finance leader is to drive business performance, and much of that depends on empowering the organization to make smart decisions strategically, tactically and operationally. There are times when you have to take the decision or draw a bright line that can’t be crossed, but I think leaders are most effective when they take on the roles of coach, teacher and influencer so their teams make the calls and own the results.
Prior to the digital revolution, the role of the CFO was to accumulate information from different silos, bring it together and make decisions at the top of the organization. There was really no other way to do it. Today most of the information needed to make decisions—even big, strategic decisions—is readily available to many people in the organization, which gives the CFO a golden opportunity to push decision-making down and empower teams. To do that, one has to be good at articulating a clear vision and giving people a framework. One colleague described it as “the freedom of boundaries,” meaning that he understood his latitude to make decisions as long as he knew what lines couldn’t be crossed. As the CFO, when you empower teams this way, it can free you up to have much greater influence on the business.  If every decision needs to come to your desk, that’s going to slow decision making and limit your impact.
Sandy Cockrell: You have significant experience as a board director. What has it taught you about the relationship between the board and the CFO?
Mark Buthman: Serving on boards has exposed me to a diverse range of business strategies and leadership styles, and has given me an appreciation for the importance of looking at a business from the outside in. As a CFO, my experience as a board member helped me understand how to communicate to the board the essential things they need to know while keeping the discussions at a high level. Until I sat on the other side of those conversations as a director, I didn’t fully realize the importance of communications from a board member’s perspective.
I stress to sitting CFOs that working with the audit committee, in particular, can provide them with an opportunity to highlight talent in the finance organization. That helps foster more trust within the audit committee that the right people are in the right roles and they are going to do the right thing. Board members can actually help CFOs develop their talent because they bring an objective perspective free of the day-to-day relationships with people.
I’ve also learned that what boards want to see most in a CFO is someone with a strong functional and ethical foundation, a strategic mindset, and the ability to attract and build exceptional talent with strong communication and influencing skills. And, of course, CFOs need to understand when and how to alert the board to an emerging issue. Having served in both roles, I encourage CFOs to view the board as a resource and to make the effort to reach out to an individual board member if their skills can help address a particular issue, including talent matters.
Sandy Cockrell: You spend some of your time coaching other CFOs. What do you encourage them to focus on?
Mark Buthman: I tell new CFOs that they now have broader responsibilities than they’ve ever had before, yet they have only half the time to meet them all. That’s because more of their time is committed to board meetings, investor calls and roadshows, earnings, forecast reviews, CEO leadership meetings, travel and other activities. Their calendar may be booked a full year out or more. So as CFO, the ability to manage your time effectively and to invest it where it makes the most difference is something you have to get your arms around. One technique that helped me—even although it goes against conventional teaching—was to drop most of my one-on-one meetings. We made exceptions for cases where someone needed coaching, help in setting direction or problem-solving, or needed to communicate an emerging issue.
I also encourage the CFOs I work with to help their teams identify and act on their purpose and values as much or more than the work they do.  For example, when I became CFO I had a game plan to improve our core finance capabilities, set a clear tone at the top, have a robust set of internal controls and address talent development, typical expectations for many finance organizations. I refer to those as the “what.”
Despite all the work being done, however, I had the sense that our finance organization, including myself, was still not reaching its full potential. Eventually, I realized it was because we had not addressed the “why.”  So together we rallied around a very simple message: to empower our leaders to think like a CFO with a mission to drive business results, inspire our teams and each other, and transform the way we did our work.  If everyone in an organization feels empowered to focus on those three things, good outcomes can happen.  At the end of the day if an organization is 80% right and 100% aligned that is a terrific result, and much better than being 100% right and only 20% aligned.

Keeping Finance Talent Relevant to Changing Needs: Charles Holley, CFO-in-Residence

                          It’s no secret that talent is key to a CFO’s success, yet talent is a perennial top challenge for CFOs. That’s partly due to the continually changing definition of what it means to have a talented finance team, says Charles Holley, an independent senior advisor to Deloitte. Drawing on his extensive leadership experiences, he explains how to identify, recruit and develop the people best suited for the fast-changing demands of finance. The key, he says, is finding the best athletes and keeping their capabilities relevant and aligned to the needs of the business.
                        



FP&A: Why Talent Counts and What CFOs Can Do to Improve It

                          To elevate the strategic contribution that a finance organization’s FP&A team can make, CFOs should focus on developing the team’s technical, professional and leadership competencies. Specifically, they can use a four-part model that provides opportunities to gain education and experience with exposure to key decision-makers and the expectation that FP&A will function more strategically. Rotating talent from FP&A into the business and back again can also help team members acquire both a broader understanding of the organization and the specialized knowledge that can make this function integral to the organization’s success.
