Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and “best-efforts” basis: no
minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The
offering price per share is $0.04. The following table sets forth the uses of
proceeds assuming the sale of 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities
offered for sale by the Company. Our use of net proceeds are listed in the order
of priority in which you intend to use them. There is no assurance that we will
raise the full $100,000 as anticipated and there is no guarantee that we will
receive any proceeds from the offering.

             Gross proceeds                 $50,000   $75,000   $100,000
             Offering expenses            $   8,500 $   8,500 $    8,500
             Net proceeds                 $  41,500 $  66,500 $   91,500
             SEC reporting and compliance $  10,000 $  10,000 $   10,000
             Establishing an office       $   2,000 $   2,500 $    3,000
             Website development          $   1,500 $   2,000 $    2,500
             Marketing and advertising    $   5,000 $   6,000 $    7,000
             Salary to employees          $   5,000 $  10,000 $   15,000
             Used Cars Purchase           $  18,000 $  36,000 $   54,000

The above figures represent only estimated costs. The estimated cost of this
registration statement is $8,500 which will be paid from offering proceeds. If
the offering proceeds are less than registration costs, Beken Aitbaev, our
president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds to
complete the registration process. Mr. Aitbaev’s verbal agreement to provide us
loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. Also, these
loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be
sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and
quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board when and if our common stocks
become eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Mr. Aitbaev
will not be paid any compensation or anything from the proceeds of this
offering. There is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by Mr.
Aitbaev. Mr. Aitbaev will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when we
generate substantial revenues to pay the obligation.


There are few barriers of entry in the car business and level of competition is
extremely high. There are many domestic and international car dealers and
dealership companies which are licensed and able to purchase car at auctions and
sell to their clients. We will be in direct competition with them. Many large
car dealerships have greater financial capabilities than us and will be able to
provide more favorable credit terms to the buyers of automobiles. Many of these
companies may have a greater, more established customer base than us. We will
likely lose business to such companies. Also, many of these companies will be
able to afford to offer greater price discounts than us which may also cause us
to lose business. In addition, we will be competing with unlicensed private
sellers of cars.


Company Description
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 29, 2013. We plan to be in
the business of selling used cars that we purchase in the United States to
customers in Kyrgyzstan. We plan to purchase our cars primarily at used cars
stores, private sellers, dealer-auctions and sell them to private


 buyers or
other car dealers in Kyrgystan. We plan to develop a website that will display a
variety of used cars and their prices in US market, and will advertise our
services and fees. As of today, we purchased a car for $7,000, which we then
sold for $8,200. This purchase was financed by Beken Aitbaev, our president and
director, who loaned the Company funds. We may loan the funds from Beken
Aitbaev, our president and director for future purchases, however, he has no
formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to
the company. We are depend on the proceeds from this offering for our short-term
liquidity needs to fund future purchases. In a long term we may need additional
financing. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing.
There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if
available, on terms that will be acceptable to us. Because we are not certain
how we will fund our long-term liquidity needs, we have no ability to assess
when we might be profitable. Our principal office address is located at Frunze
Street 176, Issikatinskiy, Milianfan, Kyrgyzstan, 720000. Our telephone number
is +996-558-414146. Our plan of operation is forward-looking and there is no
assurance that we will ever reach profitable operations. We are a development
stage company and have generated $8,200 in revenue. It is likely that we will
not be able to achieve profitability and will have to cease operations due to
the lack of funding.

We are in the business of selling used automobiles in Kyrgyzstan. We will rely
on our sole officer and director’s knowledge and expertise of the car industry
in conducting our operations. Our service will include, checking the condition
of the car, shipping and handling and custom clearing if needed. Depending on
the number of shares that we sell from this offering, we plan to keep a small
inventory of cars. This inventory will consist of most popular models with
highest turnover rate. We will display the cars that we own on our website. Our
customers will be able to select a car on our website according to their budget
and preferences. Our customers will also be able to order cars which are not
displayed on our website by specifying the make, model and year. When we do not
have the car that our client wants, we will search for it in car auctions and
through network of other car dealers. If our clients wants to choose cars
individually throughout the auction or other options we will consult them for
10% interest.

We plan to offer our used cars at price marked-up from 10% to 20% of our cost.
Our customers will be asked to pay us the full price in advance. There is no
guarantee that our customer will pay the full purchase price in advance. In some
cases we will ask for lower advance payments and the remainder during 7 days
after the automobile is loaded and left a sea port. When we do not have a
particular car in inventory, we will generally ask our client for prepayment
before purchasing the car on their behalf. To be able to extend credit payment
terms to more customers we may need to raise additional funds. If we are not
able to raise the additional funds our business may fail. Also, there is no
guarantee that we will receive desired commission payment and may have to lower
our prices of cars, resulting in diminished profits or loses. When we do not
take prepayment and buy cars at our own expense, there a chance that we do not
sell them for a extended period of time or never at all, which will result in
loss of revenue and disruption of our business.

Our principal executive offices are located at Frunze Street 176, Issikatinskiy,

	NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(UNAUDITED)


	February 28, 2017


	 



	NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS



	 


	AB INTERNATIONAL GROUP CORP. (the “Company”, “we” or “us”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 29, 2013 (“Inception”). The Company’s fiscal year end is August 31.


	 


	On January 22, 2016, the Company's former sole officer, who owned 83% of the Company's outstanding common shares, sold all his common shares to un-related investors. Subsequently, the Company modified its business plan and is currently focusing on the creation of a mobile app marketing engine to be used for movie trailer promotion thru a mobile smartphone app in China. To date, all revenues have been transacted in Hong Kong Dollars.


	 



	NOTE 2 –SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	 



	Basis of Presentation



	 


	The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars.


	 


	The accompanying condensed financial statements of the Company have been prepared, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the results of operations of the Company for the periods presented. These condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2016. The results of operations for the period ended February 28, 2017, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2017.


	 


	The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, in the United States of America, require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 



	Intangible Assets



	 


	Intangible assets are stated at cost and depreciated on the straight line method over the estimated life of the asset, which is 5 years. Management determined the useful life of the asset through analyzing the life of which the intangible asset would generate ongoing revenues for the Company. The intangible assets are a mobile application product that is used to generate sales by utilizing the mobile app as advertising for third parties, events, or products.


	 


	The intangible assets were acquired from a third party provider. Amortized costs of the intangible asset are recorded as cost of sales, as the intangible asset is directly related to generation of revenues in the Company.

	Table of Contents






	 



	Revenue Recognition



	 


	The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification No. 605, “Revenue Recognition” ("ASC-605"), ASC-605 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. The Company has recognized the revenues associated with mobile app sales once the criteria has been met, the product has been delivered, and collectability is reasonably assured from the individual customer. To date, the Company’s sales primarily involved transactions whereby the customers utilized the Company’s mobile applications to interact with potential moviegoers, and direct the users of the applications to movie trailer websites and applications.


	 



	Accounts Receivable



	 


	Accounts receivable consist of amounts due from promotional services provided through app sales. Amounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in its existing accounts receivable. No amount for bad debt expense has been recorded by the Company.


	 



	Foreign Currency Translation 





	 


	The Company’s functional currency is the US dollar. Certain balances and transactions included in the financial statements are in Hong Kong dollars and are translated into US dollar using current exchange rates or the spot rate, if applicable. Gains and losses from foreign currency translations are immaterial for separate classification for the period ending February 28, 2017.


	 



	Basic and Diluted Income (Loss) Per Share



	 


	The Company computes income (loss) per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260, “Earnings per Share” which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted income (loss) per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.


	 


	No potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments were issued or outstanding during the six month periods ended February 28, 2017 and February 29, 2016.


	 



	Recent accounting pronouncements



	 


	Management has reviewed all the recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company other than those relating to the revised requirements related to revenue recognition, which are required for annual periods beginning subsequent to December 15, 2016.


	 



	NOTE 3 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS



	 


	In support of the Company’s efforts and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by shareholders. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note.


	 


	During the six month period ended February 28, 2017, a shareholder was repaid $1,184 for operating expenses. As at February 28, 2017 and August 31, 2016, the Company owed $1,613 and $2,797 to this shareholder, respectively. The amounts are due on demand, unsecured, and non-interest bearing.

	NOTE 4 – INCOME TAXES



	 


	Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards. Due to the change in control during the year ended August 31, 2016, the Company is expecting limitations on the loss carry forward amounts that were generated prior to the change in control.

	The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of February 28, 2017 was $6,191, and $25,638 as of August 31, 2016. In assessing the recovery of the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of future deferred tax assets, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. As a result, management determined it was more likely than not the deferred tax assets would not be realized as of February 28, 2017 and August 31, 2016. Management estimates the Company’s tax liability in Hong Kong to be immaterial.

	MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION




	 


	FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS


	 


	Statements made in this Form 10-Q that are not historical or current facts are "forward-looking statements" made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "approximate" or "continue," or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.


	 


	GENERAL


	 


	We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 29, 2013. We initially planned to be in the business of purchasing used cars in the United States and selling them to customers in Kyrgyzstan.


	 


	On January 22, 2016, the Company's former sole officer, who owned 83% of the Company's outstanding common shares, sold all his common shares to un-related investor Jianli Deng, the Company's current Chief Executive Officer and sole Director. After the stock sale, the Company modified its business plan and presently focuses on revenues generated from a mobile app marketing engine.


	 


	We may borrow funds from our officers and shareholders for working capital, however, they have no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the Company.

	RESULTS OF OPERATION


	 


	Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.

	CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES


	 


	We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the six month period ended February 28, 2017, net cash flows used in operating activities were $33,125 consisting of a net income of $55,564, amortization of $10,000, a decrease in prepaid expenses of $18,833, increase in accounts receivable of $40,536, decrease in accounts payable of $77,073, and change in assets from discontinued operations of $587. Net cash flows used in operating activities was $5,857 for the six month period ended February 29, 2016, consisting of a net loss of $10,560 from continuing operations, a net loss of $627 from discontinued operations, and a change in liabilities from discontinued operations of $5,330.


	 


	CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES


	 


	We neither generated, nor used, funds in investing activities during the three months ended February 28, 2017 or February 29, 2016.


	 


	CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES


	 


	We generated $1,184 in financing activities from a shareholder loan for the six months ended February 28, 2017. No funds were generated nor used during the six months ended February 29, 2016.


	 


	PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING


	 


	We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds, further issuances of securities and loans from our principal shareholder. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.


	 


	Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next 12 months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to developmental expenses associated with a start-up business. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances equity and/or debt securities. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.


	 


	MATERIAL COMMITMENTS


	 


	As of February 28, 2017, we had no material commitments.


	 


	PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT


	 


	We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months.


	 


	OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS


	 


	As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

	GOING CONCERN


	 


	The independent auditors' audit report accompanying our August 31, 2016 financial statements contained an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared "assuming that we will continue as a going concern," which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.

	ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES




	 


	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.


	 


	An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of February 28, 2017. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Such officer also confirmed that there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three-month period ended February 28, 2017 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	AB INTERNATIONAL GROUP CORP.







	NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



	(UNAUDITED)


	November 30, 2016


	 



	NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS



	 


	AB INTERNATIONAL GROUP CORP. (the “Company”, “we” or “us”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 29, 2013 (“Inception”). The Company’s fiscal year end is August 31.


	 


	On January 22, 2016, the Company's former sole officer, who owned 83% of the Company's outstanding common shares, sold all his common shares to un-related investors. Subsequently, the Company modified its business plan and is currently focusing on the creation of a mobile app marketing engine to be used for movie trailer promotion thru a mobile smartphone app in China.


	 



	NOTE 2 –SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	 



	Basis of Presentation



	 


	The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars.


	 


	The accompanying condensed financial statements of the Company have been prepared, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the results of operations of the Company for the periods presented. These condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2016. The results of operations for the period ended November 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2017.


	 


	The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, in the United States of America, require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 



	Intangible Assets



	 


	Intangible assets are stated at cost and depreciated on the straight line method over the estimated life of the asset, which is 5 years. The intangible assets are a mobile application product that is used to generate sales by utilizing the mobile app as advertising for third parties, events, or products.


	 



	Revenue Recognition



	 


	The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification No. 605, “Revenue Recognition” ("ASC-605"), ASC-605 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. The Company has recognized the revenues associated mobile app sales once the criteria has been met, the product has been delivered, and collectability is reasonably assured from the individual vendor.


	 




	 




	6















	Table of Contents






	 



	Accounts Receivable



	 


	Accounts receivable consist of amounts due from promotional services provided through app sales. Amounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in its existing accounts receivable. No amount for bad debt expense has been recorded by the company.


	 



	Basic and Diluted Income (Loss) Per Share



	 


	The Company computes income (loss) per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260, “Earnings per Share” which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted income (loss) per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.


	 


	No potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments were issued or outstanding during the three month periods ended November 30, 2016 and 2015.


	 



	Recent accounting pronouncements



	 


	Management has reviewed all the recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company other than those relating to the revised requirements related to revenue recognition, which are required subsequent to December 15, 2016.


	 



	NOTE 3 – GOING CONCERN



	 


	The Company has an accumulated deficit of $31,197 from continuing operations, and a deficit of $40,189 from discontinued operations as of November 30, 2016. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 


	 


	The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and, or, obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand, loans from directors and, or, the private placement of common stock.


	 



	NOTE 4 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS



	 


	In support of the Company’s efforts and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by shareholders. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note.


	 


	During the three month period ended November 30, 2016, a shareholder advanced $1,816 to the Company for operating expenses. As at November 30, 2016 and August 31, 2016, the Company owed $4,613 and $2,797 to this shareholder, respectively. The amounts are due on demand, unsecured, and non-interest bearing.


	 



	NOTE 5 – INCOME TAXES



	 


	As of November 30, 2016 the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of $71,385 that may be available to reduce future years' taxable income through 2035. Subsequent to the Company's change in control, the Company has a net operating loss carryforward of $31,196. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards.


	 




	 




	7















	Table of Contents






	 


	Due to the change in control during the year, the Company is expecting limitations on the loss carry forward amounts that were generated prior to the change in control.

	The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of November 30, 2016 was $10,919, and $12,838 as of August 31, 2016. In assessing the recovery of the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of future deferred tax assets, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. As a result, management determined it was more likely than not the deferred tax assets would not be realized as of November 30, 2016 and August 31, 2016.

	MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION


	AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION




	 


	FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS


	 


	Statements made in this Form 10-Q that are not historical or current facts are "forward-looking statements" made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "approximate" or "continue," or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.


	 


	General


	 


	We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 29, 2013. We initially planned to be in the business of purchasing used cars in the United States and selling them to customers in Kyrgyzstan.


	 


	On January 22, 2016, the Company's former sole officer, who owned 83% of the Company's outstanding common shares, sold all his common shares to un-related investor Jianli Deng, the Company's current Chief Executive Officer and sole Director. After the stock sale, the Company modified its business plan and presently focuses on revenues generated from a mobile app marketing engine.


	 


	We may borrow funds from our officers and shareholders for working capital, however, they have no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the Company.


	 


	RESULTS OF OPERATION


	 


	Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.


	 


	THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2015


	 


	REVENUE


	 


	During the three month periods ended November 30, 2016 and November 30, 2015 we generated $42,829 and $0 of revenue, respectively.


	 


	COST OF SALES


	 


	During the three month periods ended November 30, 2016 and November 30, 2015 we incurred $5,000 and $0 of cost of sales, respectively.


	 


	OPERATING EXPENSES


	 


	During the three month period ended November 30, 2016, we incurred general and administrative expenses of $24,846, and related party wages of $7,500. General and administrative expenses incurred during the three month period ended November 30, 2016 were generally related to corporate overhead, financial and administrative contracted services, such as legal and accounting, developmental costs, and marketing expenses. During the three months ended November 30, 2015, we incurred operating expenses of $6,190 related to our discontinued operations.

	NET PROFIT


	 


	Our net profit for the three month period ended November 30, 2016 was $5,482 compared to a net loss of $6,190 during the three month period ended November 30, 2015, all related to our discontinued operations.


	 


	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES


	 


	As of November 30, 2016, our total assets were $250,189 compared to $314,498 in total assets at August 31, 2016. Total assets as of November 30, 2016 comprised cash of $109,308, accounts receivable of $42,829, prepaid expenses of $6,668 and $91,384 in intangible assets while as at August 31, 2016 total assets comprised cash of $166,826, accounts receivable of $28,200, prepaid expenses of $22,501 and $96,384 in intangible assets. As of November 30, 2016 and August 31, 2016, our current liabilities were $10,232 and $80,023 respectively.


	 


	Stockholders' equity was $239,957 as of November 30, 2016 compared to $234,475 as of August 31, 2016.


	 


	CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES


	 


	We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the three month period ended November 30, 2016, net cash flows used in operating activities were $59,334 consisting of a net profit of $5,482, depreciation of $5,000, a decrease in prepaid expenses of $15,833, increase in accounts receivable of $14,629, decrease in accounts payable of $71,607, and change in assets from discontinued operations of $587. Net cash flows used in operating activities was $3,650 for the three month period ended November 30, 2015, consisting of a net loss of $6,190, and a change in liabilities from discontinued operations of $2,540.


	 


	CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES


	 


	We neither generated, nor used, funds in investing activities during the three months ended November 30, 2016 or November 30, 2015.


	 


	CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES


	 


	We generated $1,816 in financing activities from a shareholder loan for the three months ended November 30, 2016. No funds were generated nor used during the three months ended November 30, 2015.


	 


	PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING


	 


	We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds, further issuances of securities and loans from our principal shareholder. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.


	 


	Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next 12 months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to developmental expenses associated with a start-up business. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances equity and/or debt securities. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.

	GOING CONCERN


	 


	The independent auditors' audit report accompanying our August 31, 2016 financial statements contained an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared "assuming that we will continue as a going concern," which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.
