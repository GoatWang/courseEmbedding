BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 12/08/2003
            

                BBB has determined that Canfield Medical Supply Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.
                

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur
                        
7. total cost of the transaction, including tax, shipping and handling, and other related charges



                    3. If selling products or providing services on Web sites or via other electronic means:

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 
1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached. 2. Honor representations by correcting mistakes as quickly as possible.







Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Diabetes supplies and Medicare – FAQs

QA Text: 

QA Question: What is competitive bidding?



A change in the amount Medicare reimburses retail and mail-order suppliers for certain products, including diabetes testing supplies. The latest round went into effect on July 1, 2016. It reduced the number of mail-order companies that Medicare has authorized to provide diabetes testing supplies to Fee for Service Medicare Patients (traditional Medicare Part B only) but did not reduce the number of retailers approved to provide supplies. For questions on approved suppliers, call 1-844-942-2654, or visit competitivebidding.knowmycopay.com

QA Question: I use Medicare Advantage. Am I affected?



No, if patients are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan (like an HMO or PPO) or commercial managed care plan, you are not impacted by competitive bidding.
Back to top







QA Question: Do I need to switch to another meter or test strips?



No, your OneTouch® meters and test strips continue to be reimbursed under Medicare Part B. You won’t have to pay more and you can still get them from either retail or mail order. OneTouch® is the #1 recommended brand by doctors and pharmacists.‡
Back to top







QA Question: What happened with Medicare reimbursement and my OneTouch® diabetes supplies? What does it mean for Medicare Patients?



Your OneTouch® diabetes supplies continue to be covered by Medicare Part B. You can find them widely available at retail pharmacies. What changed is that some mail order companies may not offer OneTouch® diabetes supplies and may try to switch you to a different brand. You can keep receiving your OneTouch® test strips without interruption by switching to an approved vendor.
Back to top







QA Question: Will I have to pay more for OneTouch® diabetes supplies?



No, under Medicare, all products are reimbursed at the same rate. You won’t pay more to get the #1 recommended brand by doctors and pharmacists.
Back to top







QA Question: What will my diabetic testing supplies cost me on Medicare?



Your OneTouch® meter and OneTouch® test strips are always covered under Medicare Part B (your red, white and blue card). With most supplemental insurance, patients will pay $0 out-of-pocket.†
Back to top







QA Question: I use Home delivery through my neighborhood pharmacy. What about that?



Local home delivery is no longer an option for pharmacies without a CMS contract. In order to receive diabetes testing supplies at home, you have to use an approved mail order supplier.
For questions on approved suppliers call 1-844-942-2654, or visit KnowMyCoPay.com.

QA Question: What types of Diabetes Supplies are covered under Medicare Part B?



Meters
Blood Glucose Test Strips
Control Solution
Batteries
Lancing Devices
Lancets

QA Question: What has happened with insulin pumps and pump supplies under Medicare?



CMS has decided to temporarily delay moving forward with next steps on the Competitive Bidding Program that includes insulin pumps and supplies. We will keep you updated as we learn more.
Back to top







QA Question: I also use an insulin pump, are there any changes in my insulin pump supplies?



Call your insulin pump manufacturer to find out the mail order company in your area to service insulin pump supplies.
