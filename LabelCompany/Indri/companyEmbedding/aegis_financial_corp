Performance data quoted represents past performance; past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance of the fund may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. For performance data current to the most recent month end, please call us at 800-528-3780.  Performance data does not reflect the redemption fee, which would have reduced the total return. Performance data for the AVFAX shares with load reflects the Class A maximum sales charge of 3.75%. Additionally, performance for the Class A Shares without load is shown at NAV, and does not reflect the maximum sales charge. If reflected, total return would be reduced.

13F Filings



The Security, Class, and CUSIP columns in the table below are shown exactly as filed by the investor.
        We do our best to track continuity of investments through acquisitions, and this will be reflected in
        the table as changes in names and cusips.
In addition to descriptive data, performance of the investment
        is shown over time. To calculate quarterly performance, we first calculate cost basis of the shares purchased during the quarter, then use
            that to calculate gross profit. Quarterly return is Gross Profit / Starting Portfolio value.
Note that cost basis is calculated and stored in thousands, so small quarterly changes in shares frequently
            result in a cost basis of zero.

Tegaderm™ CHG I.V. Securement Dressing is the only transparent dressing cleared and proven to reduce CRBSI and vascular catheter colonization that aligns with evidence-based guidelines and practice standards. The dressing provides four essential elements you need to protect I.V. sites in one integrated, easy-to-use product.
 

Infection reduction
Site visibility
Consistent application
Catheter securement

How does it work?
Tegaderm™ CHG I.V. Securement Dressings deliver immediate and continuous CHG protection for up to 7 days,* plus all the benefits of our Tegaderm™ I.V. Advanced Securement Dressing. The CHG gel pad is designed to conform around the catheter and hub, and the gel pad remains transparent even in the presence of blood, saline and exudate, providing visibility to the insertion site.
Learn more about Tegaderm™ CHG Dressings in our Tegaderm™ CHG dressings brochure.
Find full specifications, application and removal videos, and Instructions for Use on our product detail page.
*In vitro studies show the dressing is a microbial barrier and protects the insertion site against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and yeast, including organisms most commonly associated with catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).











          
	Tegaderm™ CHG Dressings for your application.

Tegaderm™ CHG I.V. Securement Dressing is the only transparent dressing cleared and proven to reduce CRBSI and vascular catheter colonization that aligns with evidence-based guidelines and practice standards. The dressing provides four essential elements you need to protect I.V. sites in one integrated, easy-to-use product.
 

Infection reduction
Site visibility
Consistent application
Catheter securement

How does it work?
Tegaderm™ CHG I.V. Securement Dressings deliver immediate and continuous CHG protection for up to 7 days,* plus all the benefits of our Tegaderm™ I.V. Advanced Securement Dressing. The CHG gel pad is designed to conform around the catheter and hub, and the gel pad remains transparent even in the presence of blood, saline and exudate, providing visibility to the insertion site.
Learn more about Tegaderm™ CHG Dressings in our Tegaderm™ CHG dressings brochure.
Find full specifications, application and removal videos, and Instructions for Use on our product detail page.
*In vitro studies show the dressing is a microbial barrier and protects the insertion site against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and yeast, including organisms most commonly associated with catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).
