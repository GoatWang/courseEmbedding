Article excerpt

  For traditional marketers, organization means structure: distinct product, channel, and customer groups. But new-style marketing organizations understand that "boxes and lines" structures can't drive value in fast-moving environments.    As the marketplace evolves ever more rapidly, marketers struggle to keep pace. Their traditional stratagems--redesigning market segmentations, building strong brands, and hiring cadres of marketing managers--continue to be necessary. But unless those solutions can be mobilized rapidly, many marketers could find themselves overtaken by their competitors, for a fundamentally different way of organizing companies to exploit opportunity seems to be emerging among many growth leaders. You might call them venture-marketing organizations (VMOs), since like venture capitalists they are quick to spot new possibilities, to allocate resources to the best ones, and to cut their losses as they go.    Such groups realize that to outpace the market consistently, they must not only create fluid organizational structures but also provide for unyielding rigor in measurement and decision making. As a result, they enjoy revenue growth rates that on average are one and a half times those of the competition (exhibit, on the next page). Incumbent or attacker alike, they are capturing more than their share of market opportunities.    Stay fluid    When traditional marketers think of organization, they mean structure: distinct product, channel, and customer groups focusing on specific functional tasks, such as brand management, customer segment management, and market research. Functional managers play the pivotal roles in these functionally focused groups, which are responsible for generating ideas and taking them to market.    But the traditional approach hinders the fluidity required to keep pace with the market's evolution. For when market priorities change, traditionalists take a "wreck and rebuild" approach that consumes the precious time of top executives, disrupts action on the front lines, and, worst of all, often fails to yield the intended results. Sixty-seven percent of respondents in a Watson Wyatt survey [1] said that in most cases the complex and confusing changes companies passed through during such reorganizations did little to improve their performance.    New-style marketing groups understand that formal structures can't drive value in fast-moving environments. To make organizations keep pace with the market, these groups rely not on periodic restructurings but on a continual process of evolution. VMOs do have designated managers for core products, segments, and channels, but the number of these managers, the scope of their responsibilities, and the people to whom they report evolve constantly to reflect changing opportunities.    At Dell Computer, for instance, the incentive system rewards marketing managers who successfully identify and capture so many market opportunities that some of their business must be passed on to other managers. Divisions divide into smaller and smaller units, and profit-and-loss responsibility spreads out among more and more managers--an approach that encourages all of them to turn the needs of their customers into products and services as quickly as possible.    First USA's credit card unit is another organization whose strong growth over the past few years has been propelled by the new approach. It has few solid-line reporting relationships. New positions are created above, beside, or below their predecessors, and new people are constantly being placed in shared resource poois, which are constantly reconfigured dynamically.    Although First USA has had performance problems since being acquired by Bank One, the phenomenal earlier growth rate of the credit card issuer was propelled largely by its VMO approach. First USA routinely makes organizational changes in the ordinary flow of business, without slowing down day-to-day progress on initiatives. …

Article excerpt

Simplicity, focus, and integration in the merchandising process dramatically boost retail performance  OVER THE PAST three years, The Gap has generated a return on invested capital (ROIC) double that of the average specialty retailer. Similarly, Wal-Mart's ROIC is 50 percent higher than that of the average discounter. Perhaps more surprising, even in the traditional department store format, Dillard's and Nordstrom have outperformed their competitors by more than 50 percent. In fact, in every major retailing format in the United States, there is a significant -- and sustained -- gap between the financial performance of the front runners and the format average.  A McKinsey research project that set out to identify the underlying causes of this performance gap pinpoints the management of the merchandising process. Across the board, the best-performing retailers have fundamentally rethought their merchandising approach and repositioned it as the core of their business -- an integrated set of activities designed to deliver a clear, narrowly-defined set of benefits to target customers. In more specific terms, they have:    * Simplified the merchandising process wherever possible by making the tough choices needed to reduce strategic complexity;    * Focused it on assortment performance; and    * Managed it in an integrated fashion rather than as the three distinct functions of buying, selling, and distribution.  There is, of course, no easy way to do all this. Nor is it easy even for the leaders to stay ahead, as recently lower returns at Wal-Mart, The Gap, and Nordstrom indicate. That is the bad news. The good news is that industry experience does highlight a set of best practices that other retailers can put to work dramatically to increase merchandising effectiveness.  Complexity  Retailers inevitably find their operations growing more complex. One reason for this is the large number of individual decision makers (buyers, distributors, and store personnel) who have a significant effect on strategy and execution and who add complexity through their everyday actions. Another is that the high fixed costs of retailing exert continual pressure to add new products and capture incremental revenue. Not only does this ratchet up complexity, it also raises the cost of selecting, buying, and delivering each product. The predictable result: buyers have to make too many decisions for too many different types of store on too little information.  Managers often underestimate the cost -- financial and operational -- of added retail complexity. In financial terms, this complexity is directly reflected in selling, administrative, and other operating costs. Among department stores, the cost gap between good and average performers can be 3 percentage points or more; among specialty stores, up to 5 percentage points. In operational terms, lower sales, slower inventory turns, and lower gross margins occur when buyers cannot cope with the complexity of their business. These effects can readily be seen in the gap between good and average performers' markdown rates: a 2.5 percentage point difference among department stores; 4 percentage points among specialty shops.  Leading retailers have achieved these performance premiums by reducing complexity. They have stopped trying to be everything to everybody. Regardless of their format or the market segment in which they compete, each has created a huge competitive advantage by focusing product offerings, narrowing market concentration, standardizing store size and layout, and simplifying the buyer's job.  Product focus  Most multi-category retailers carry tens of thousands of items: 70,000 stock keeping units (SKUs) is not unusual for a discounter; a full-line department store often carries close to a million. Many of these items require fundamentally different sourcing and distribution methods and are in demand for only a few short months before seasons and hence assortments change. …
