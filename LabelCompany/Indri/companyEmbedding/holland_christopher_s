It's free!Your colleagues, classmates, and 500 million other professionals are on LinkedIn.View Christopher’s Full ProfileSummary» What’s New► In mid-2015 I left the Atlanta Film Festival and have been consulting with both filmmakers and festivals (including the Atlanta Jewish Film Festival, Portland FF, and Oxford FF) on marketing and strategy.► During the summer I raised more than $11,000 for the second edition of my book "Film Festival Secrets,” which will be released in print and online in the summer of 2016. This includes a season of podcast episodes that will serve as research for the new edition.► Although I enjoy the freedom of freelancing, I do miss the social aspects of being part of a team. That’s the environment in which I do my best work, so I’m looking for organizations who would value someone like me on their side.► Atlanta is a very different town than the one I left 20 years ago, and I’m enthused about the opportunities here, both in the film industry (production in the city is growing quickly) and in technology & marketing. Film will always be a part of my life, but I have worked in the world beyond the film industry and I’m excited about the challenges there.ExperienceProgramming & Operations ManagerAtlanta Jewish Film FestivalMay 2016  –  Present (1 year 3 months)Greater Atlanta AreaOversee the development of new programming initiatives and work in concert with the AJFF team to create business plans and operational procedures for executing those programs. Marketing and Strategy ConsultantFilm Festival Secrets2008  –  Present (9 years)Film Festival Secrets is the filmmaking advocacy, education, and consulting business based on my experience on all sides of the indie film industry. While primarily I am concerned with film festival strategy (a step in the filmmaking process that few artists consider until it is upon them), I also advise filmmakers on matters of film marketing and distribution.Consulting with filmmakers grew out of the publication of the book "Film Festival Secrets," which was published in 2008 and is available on Amazon and as an ebook. I'm working on a 2nd edition for 2016.

Since I came aboard as Operations director and later assumed a role in Marketing:✔ Festival attendance went up about 75%.✔ Event revenues went up.✔ Member numbers quadrupled.✔ The festival received a record number of film submissions (~3700, up from 3200 in 2013, and up from 2800 in 2012).✔ I coordinated the festival’s first Kickstarter campaign and helped raise nearly $18,000 in pledges to pay for more filmmakers to come to the 2014 Festival. The following year, the campaign raised more than $21,000 under my stewardship.✔ Filmmaker and audience feedback were overwhelmingly positive.I can’t claim full credit for the performance of the passionate team here, but here are a few things I’m pleased to have accomplished.✔ Adopted new standards and practices for film programming & submissions, website, email campaigns, social media, CRM, ticketing✔ Established regular and open communications between programmers and filmmakers during the call for entries season✔ Expanded the festival’s educational programming ✔ Created the festival’s first webinar series for filmmakers and administered online classes given by other instructors ✔ Implemented new systems for team collaboration✔ Managed year-round and seasonal staff in the execution of three successful festival seasons.Operations DirectorAtlanta Film FestivalDecember 2012  –  June 2013 (7 months)Greater Atlanta AreaAfter a few months of consulting with the festival on business operations, I joined the ATLFF staff to lead the execution of print traffic, ticketing, handling film submissions, venue management, and office operations.

Whether you're a first-timer with a comedy short or a seasoned veteran with a documentary feature, you all face the same set of problems. You all ask the same questions. You all want the pleasure of seeing your film play before a festival audience and gain the recognition it deserves. This is your book. Film Festival secrets will help you select the right festivals for your film, prepare your festival screener, save money on festival fees, create marketing collateral, and craft a screening sell out plan. And that's just the beginning.Authors: Christopher HollandRadio Times Guide to FilmRadio TimesSeptember 2010With a grand total of 22,123 films (an increase of 350 on last year and including 532 new entries), this ninth edition of the Guide boasts better coverage than ever. The new entries comprise films released in UK cinemas during the past 12 months, and movies, old and new, that have been screened on television or become available on DVD during the same time period and have never before appeared in the Guide. And, as always, we aim to be the most up-to-date film guide on the market, thanks to the advance work of our dedicated reviewers. You will find a large number of reviews for movies that hadn t made it to cinemas in the UK at the time of going to press, and 20 previews clearly signposted of major upcoming films that were not available for review prior to our deadline.

He has an excellent ability to look on both sides of an argument, weigh the pros and cons and commit to a direction. His genuine passion to help lead our customers through the entire product experience, from sign up to on-boarding to becoming true fans.See moreSee lessI've had the pleasure of knowing, and working with Chris in several different capacities over the last 6 years. We initially worked together at the Austin Film Festival where he was instrumental in moving our marketing efforts to the next level, integrating extensive online outreach, and a social media presence for the festival in the earliest days of the medium. 

During his tenure at B-Side Entertainment, Chris was more than just our sales point of contact, he was our technical liason, our collaborator, and our guide. His knowledge of the industry, and the technology associated with it, made our experience simple and painless, and provided a great insight into our audience.

Years later, our paths crossed again during my time at the International Film Festival Summit, where Chris returned as a conference sponsor and marketing partner. He was tireless in his efforts to reach out to our attendees, counseling them on festival strategy and provided immeasurable added value to their conference experience.

I have no doubt he will continue to bring that commitment to excellence to all of his current and future professional endeavors, and I would not hesitate to recommend him as an employee, consultant, or collaborator.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended ChristopherView Christopher’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact Christopher directlyView Christopher’s Full ProfileNot the Christopher you’re looking for?

                                                    1 photoI’m a producer of marketing, distribution, and festival strategy for independent filmmakers around the world. I also wrote Film Festival Secrets: A Handbook for Independent Filmmakers (filmfestivalsecrets.com). For more than a decade I've worked on all sides of the festival circuit, including time spent at B-Side Entertainment, Slated, IFP, the Austin Film Festival and Atlanta Film Festival. I believe that hot dogs are not sandwiches.

                    About Christopher                




I’m a producer of marketing, distribution, and festival strategy for independent filmmakers around the world. I also wrote Film Festival Secrets: A Handbook for Independent Filmmakers (filmfestivalsecrets.com). For more than a decade I've worked on all sides of the festival circuit, including time spent at B-Side Entertainment, Slated, IFP, the Austin Film Festival and Atlanta Film Festival. I believe that hot dogs are not sandwiches.
