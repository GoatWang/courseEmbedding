2. Investment information
The distribution of information contained on our site in certain countries may be restricted by law and persons who access it are required to inform themselves and to comply with any such restrictions. This information does not constitute an offer or solicitation in any jurisdiction in which such an offer or solicitation is not authorised or to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such an offer or solicitation. Persons interested in acquiring any investment should inform themselves as to: (i) the legal requirements within the countries of their nationality, residence, ordinary residence or domicile for such acquisition; (ii) any foreign exchange control requirement which they might encounter on the acquisition or sale of investments; and (iii) the income tax and other tax consequences which might be relevant to the acquisition, holding or disposal of any investment. We, our affiliated companies and our and their members and/or directors, officers and/or employees may have holdings in the investment funds referred to on our site (“Funds”) and may otherwise be interested in transactions that you effect in such Funds.
3. Risk Factors
Past performance may not be repeated and should not be seen as a guide to future performance. The value of the investments and the income therefrom may go down as well as up and investors may not get back the original amount invested. You are not certain to make money from your investments and you may lose money. Exchange rates may cause the value of overseas investments and the income therefrom to rise and fall. The levels and bases of and reliefs from taxation may change. Any tax reliefs referred to are those currently available and their value depends on the circumstances of the individual investor. Investors should consult their own tax adviser in order to understand any applicable tax consequences. Nothing contained on our site constitutes investment, legal, tax or other advice, nor is it to be relied upon when making investment or other decisions. The information on our site is provided solely on the basis that you make your own investment decisions. You should obtain relevant and specific professional advice before making any decision to enter into an investment transaction.
4. Sales Restrictions
Each Fund is, or, when and if established, will be, both an unrecognised collective investment scheme for the purposes of the UK Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (“FSMA”) and an alternative investment fund (“AIF”) for the purposes of the EU Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”). Our site is exempt from the restriction in section 238(1) of FSMA on the communication of an invitation or inducement to participate in a collective investment scheme, by virtue of Section 238(5) of FSMA and Chapter 4.12 of the FCA Conduct of Business Sourcebook. Accordingly, our site is directed only at persons who are categorised as either a professional client or an eligible counterparty (within the meaning of the FCA Rules) in respect of interests in the relevant Fund. The investments and investment services to which our site relates are only available to such persons and other persons should not act or rely on it. In particular, no investment or service to which our site may relate is intended for retail clients nor will be made available to retail clients. Investors in the Funds will not benefit from the rules and regulations made under FSMA for the protection of investors, nor from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Interests in the Funds are not dealt in or on a recognised or designated investment exchange for the purposes of FSMA, nor is there a market maker in such interests, and it may therefore be difficult for an investor to dispose of his interests otherwise than by way of redemption. An application for interests in any of the Funds should only be made having read fully the relevant prospectus. It is your responsibility to use such prospectus and by making an application you will be deemed to represent that you have read such prospectus and agree to be bound by its contents.
Information for investors in the European Union (“EU”) and European Economic Area (“EEA”)Interests in the Funds may be offered or placed in a member state of the EU or EEA (each, a “Member State”) only to the extent that: (1) the Fund is permitted to be marketed to professional investors in that Member State in accordance with AIFMD (to the extent implemented into the local law/regulation of that Member State); or (2) such offering or placement is otherwise lawful in that Member State (including at the initiative of the potential investor).

Such Fund interests may only be offered or sold directly or indirectly in the United States or to any US person in reliance on certain exemptions from registration under the 1933 Act and rules promulgated thereunder.
