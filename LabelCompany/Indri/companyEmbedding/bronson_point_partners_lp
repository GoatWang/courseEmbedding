A Look At Bronson Point Partners' Holdings | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»A Look At Bronson Point Partners' HoldingsNov. 21, 2011  4:24 AM ET|| Includes: ABVT, ASEI, CAG, CNX, GE, IFF, IGT, IMAX, KNOL, LOW, MDLZ, NEM, PG, RCL, SPY, WFC, XRXby: Insider MonkeyInsider Monkey Newsletter provider, fund holdings, insider ownershipInsider MonkeyBronson Point Partners is a hedge fund founded by Larry Foley and Paul Farrell in 2009. Prior to establishing Bronson Point, Larry Foley was a senior portfolio manager at SAC Capital and Paul Farrell was at Pequot co-managing the firm’s Scout Fund Group. Bronson Point combines fundamental research with active portfolio management and makes long/short equity investments in U.S. stocks. Bronson Point reduced its portfolio from $244 million at the end of June to only $135 million at the end of the third quarter. Bronson Point also cut almost half of its positions. It had had 88 positions at the end of the second quarter, and now it only holds 49 positions. The company has sold out a number of stocks. For instance, it sold out Conagra Inc (NYSE:CAG). CAG was a new position in Bronson Point’s portfolio in the second quarter. CAG returned 3.96% since the end of September, underperforming the market by almost 8%. Bronson Point also sold out Newmont Mining Corp (NYSE:NEM), which was also a new position of the fund in the second quarter. NEM returned 10.63% since the end of the third quarter, underperforming the market by 1%. In addition to CAG and NEM, Bronson Point also sold out Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (NYSE:RCL), Lowes Companies Inc (NYSE:LOW), Xerox Corp (NYSE:XRX), International Game Technology (NYSE:IGT), American Science & Energy Inc (NASDAQ:ASEI), and Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG). Bronson Point doubled its holding in RAH to $5.4 million. RAH returned 7.13% since the end of September. Besides RAH, Bronson also doubled its position in Imax Corp (NYSE:IMAX) to $2.6 million. IMAX returned 32.9% since the end of September, beating the market by over 20 percentage points. Bronson Point increased its stake in Abovenet Inc (NYSE:ABVT), Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC), International Flavors & Fragrances (NYSE:IFF) and Knology Inc (NASDAQ:KNOL) as well. Bronson Point bought new stakes in Consol Energy Inc (NYSE:CNX). The fund initiated a brand new $4.92 million position in CNX over the third quarter. The energy company reported net income of $167.33 million for the third quarter of 2011, up from $75.38 million last year. CNX returned 23.41% since the end of September, beating the SPY by about 12 percentage points.
 Bronson Point is also bullish about Kraft Foods Inc (KFT) and General Electric Co (NYSE:GE). The fund opened new positions in these two stocks. It reported to own $4.2 million worth of KFT and $3.4 million worth of GE at the end of September. KFT returned 5.66% and GE returned 6.44% since the end of September. Though both stocks underperformed the market during the same period, they were quite popular among hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. Warren Buffett had $3.5 billion invested in KFT and $147 million invested in GE. Other fund managers bullish about these two stocks include Ken Fisher and Cliff Asness. We like Bronson Point Partners. Although it is a new hedge fund, its two founders, Larry Foley and Paul Farrell, had years of experience in portfolio management and combined their experiences from different hedge fund firms to open Bronson. We believe that by focusing on the best stock picks of Bronson Point Partners, investors are more likely to beat the market in the long term.

Ex-SAC, Pequot managers to launch hedge fund firm | Reuters

Larry Foley, who had been a senior portfolio manager at SAC from 1994 to 2008, and Paul Farrell, a member of Pequot's executive committee and co-portfolio manager of its Scout Fund Group, plan to open Bronson Point Partners on January 1, 2010.   Foley and Farrell's pedigree will likely prompt many hedge fund industry investors to give the pair a close look. But how much money the men will actually manage to raise remains unclear at a time when investors are becoming ever pickier about where they commit their capital.   To woo potential clients, Bronson Point's principals said they have committed at least $25 million of their own money and promise a "disciplined approach to fund-raising, organic growth and risk management." They will concentrate on U.S. stocks, running a so-called long/short equity strategy.   Investors traditionally want to see fund managers invest part of their own fortunes, with plans to expand the fund in a measured way.   To get into Bronson Point, investors need to put down $1 million, an average figure for most small hedge funds. It will charge a 2 percent annual management fee plus an incentive fee of 17 percent to 20 percent, depending on how long investors agree to leave their money with the new firm.   Bronson Point in its brochure promises to use an "opportunistic approach combining fundamental research and active portfolio management." The team, which also includes ex-SAC trader Jonathan Marcus, said retailer Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY.O) and regional sporting goods store Hibbett Sports (HIBB.O) are among the fund's core holdings.   Foley and Farrell are among a growing number of investment managers who are trying to set up their own firms at a time pension funds and endowments are eager to put money into alternative assets like hedge funds to try and recoup losses during the financial crisis. Former Goldman Sachs star Mark Carhart is also planning to launch his own firm next year.   While people with powerful resumes like Foley and Farrell used to be able to raise hundreds of millions of dollars quickly, analysts said it will be harder for newcomers now.   Investors want more details about how people who break off from huge firms will run their own, often a difficult task when they have been used to working with a team of risk managers, lawyers and marketers.   Analysts also noted concerns about Pequot's history after its founder, Arthur Samberg, surprised investors and employees by shutting down the firm in May after regulators reopened a probe into possible insider trading.   SAC Capital Advisors manages $12.9 billion and has scored an average annual return of 30 percent since its launch in 1992. The returns have stirred envy on Wall Street and speculation about how its founder, Steven A. Cohen, managed to deliver such consistently strong returns for so long.
