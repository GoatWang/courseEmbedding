Firm History
Continental Advisors was founded in 1999 by David Purcell and his brother, Paul.  They represent their family’s fourth generation of financial services industry professionals.  In fact, the name “Continental” was selected to honor the heritage of a successful financial advisory practice and insurance agency started by their great-grandfather nearly 100 years ago in Salt Lake City, Utah.
 
Continental Advisors evolved from a dream, a belief and years of training and practical experience.  The dream was to own and operate an independent client-focused investment management business. The belief was that equity market inefficiencies could be exploited by disciplined fundamental analysis and stock picking.

Salt Lake City, UT circa 1940 – The office of Continental Agency & Co. with Founder, P.J. Purcell and Partner, Phil J. Purcell

The final stage of Continental’s evolutionary formation came during Dave Purcell’s eight years working at Warburg Dillon Read LLC (WDR) and its predecessor organizations (originally O’Connor and Associates).  In addition to formal training in derivatives and risk management, Dave worked with leading pension funds, hedge funds and institutional asset managers across North America. In his last position at WDR, Dave led a team that specialized in developing programs to structure portfolios incorporating strategic or fundamental investment strategies, with the tactical use of equity options.
 
In 1999, Dave founded Continental as the logical next step to employ and build upon many of the best practices of several portfolio managers he most respected.  The Purcell brothers, along with senior partner Dave O’Neill, have spent more than a decade refining and executing upon these best practices, which are embodied in Continental’s twelve investment principles.  At the core, Continental attempts to combine traditional value-based investing in public equities with updated risk management tools and techniques.  Continental focuses research activities primarily in specific sectors (financial services and healthcare).  Further, fundamental research and the investment decision making process remain concentrated at the senior partner level, not delegated to teams of vice presidents, analysts and associates.  Finally, the firm remains at the forefront in attempting to create portfolios with asymmetric exposures through the active use of equity options as a complement to the fundamental research discipline.
Over its fifteen year history, the firm has grown to include five partners, and nine total employees.  Today, the firm manages approximately $272 million in assets for multiple investor types, including high net worth families and individuals across three portfolio strategies (Financial Services, Healthcare and Opportunities).

Firm Overview
Continental Advisors LLC is an SEC-registered investment adviser founded in 1999. The firm is focused primarily on three long-short equity fund strategies (Financial Services, Healthcare and Opportunities).  The senior principals of the firm have worked together for over a decade and, on average, bring more than 20 years experience in the securities and money management industry.  The firm manages approximately $272 million in assets for multiple investor types, including high net worth families and individuals.
 
Investment Strategy 
Our investment strategy is focused primarily on publicly traded equity securities.  We seek to preserve and grow capital by combining attractive attributes of “traditional” hedged equity portfolios with “modern” risk management tools and practices.  The firm operates with a highly disciplined approach, focused on longer term investment time horizons, and relying on fundamental valuation measures driven by projected cash flows.  We strongly believe in aligning the economic interests of investor clients and firm principals.
 
Investment Process 
Our process is focused on identifying individual securities that are trading at prices not reflective of our perception of their value.  We attempt to develop and exploit a competitive advantage in security selection by concentrating on specific industries and/or specific subsectors within industries.  We are not benchmark, style or capitalization constrained.  We conduct analysis of a diverse mix of small, mid and large capitalization companies.  We engage in extensive primary research.  Our research activities are focused on trying to develop and maintain an edge over other market participants evaluating the investment merits of the companies in our sectors.  Activities that assist us in developing an advantage include: maintaining earnings and cash flow models, speaking to company management frequently, listening to company conference calls and presentations, talking to competitors, customers and suppliers, reviewing SEC documents, reading sell-side analyst reports and generally trying to obtain any and all publicly available information that improves our understanding of the company.  Our investment professionals are frequently on the road visiting companies and attending conferences and trade shows.  We maintain personal and professional relationships with industry executives, private equity managers, regulators, lobbyists, buy-side analysts and sell-side analysts.  Our long side investment process is strategic, while the short side is tactical.
 
Risk Management Philosophy 
We believe risk management is an activity, a discipline and a culture – not a system.  Our risk management process is continuous and self-improving over time through a feedback mechanism.  We use several risk management tools (both proprietary and third party) to optimize, monitor, evaluate and adjust the risk of our portfolio.  We optimize through fundamental analysis, security selection, position capital at risk, factor and/or subsector risk, diversification, net directional exposure and gross exposure.  We monitor real time exposures and portfolio shocks.  We evaluate through detailed performance attribution (longs vs. shorts, benchmark relative, % upside vs. downside participation, etc.).  We adjust based on these results and on-going response to market news and events.

Continental Advisors’ Investment Principles
Continental Advisors has adopted the following principles under which it endeavors to operate its business and that serve as cultural guideposts for the firm:
 



It is the client’s money


Eat your own cooking


Be disciplined and humble


There are diseconomies of scale to active portfolio management


Nobody can predict where the stock market is going


Stocks represent an economic interest in the future cash flows of a business


Risk management is more important than total rate of return


Focus on investment strategies where you think you have a competitive advantage - skip everything else


Use all available investment instruments to optimize the risk and return profile of the portfolio


Leverage can be and has been deadly - use it with great care


People who sustain the worst losses are usually those who overreach


Worst reality is always worse than the worst case scenario - the real investment world does not behave according to historical standard deviations

Firm Overview
Continental Advisors LLC is an SEC-registered investment adviser founded in 1999. The firm is focused primarily on three long-short equity fund strategies (Financial Services, Healthcare and Opportunities).  The senior principals of the firm have worked together for over a decade and, on average, bring more than 20 years experience in the securities and money management industry.  The firm manages approximately $272 million in assets for multiple investor types, including high net worth families and individuals.
 
Investment Strategy 
Our investment strategy is focused primarily on publicly traded equity securities.  We seek to preserve and grow capital by combining attractive attributes of “traditional” hedged equity portfolios with “modern” risk management tools and practices.  The firm operates with a highly disciplined approach, focused on longer term investment time horizons, and relying on fundamental valuation measures driven by projected cash flows.  We strongly believe in aligning the economic interests of investor clients and firm principals.
 
Investment Process 
Our process is focused on identifying individual securities that are trading at prices not reflective of our perception of their value.  We attempt to develop and exploit a competitive advantage in security selection by concentrating on specific industries and/or specific subsectors within industries.  We are not benchmark, style or capitalization constrained.  We conduct analysis of a diverse mix of small, mid and large capitalization companies.  We engage in extensive primary research.  Our research activities are focused on trying to develop and maintain an edge over other market participants evaluating the investment merits of the companies in our sectors.  Activities that assist us in developing an advantage include: maintaining earnings and cash flow models, speaking to company management frequently, listening to company conference calls and presentations, talking to competitors, customers and suppliers, reviewing SEC documents, reading sell-side analyst reports and generally trying to obtain any and all publicly available information that improves our understanding of the company.  Our investment professionals are frequently on the road visiting companies and attending conferences and trade shows.  We maintain personal and professional relationships with industry executives, private equity managers, regulators, lobbyists, buy-side analysts and sell-side analysts.  Our long side investment process is strategic, while the short side is tactical.
 
Risk Management Philosophy 
We believe risk management is an activity, a discipline and a culture – not a system.  Our risk management process is continuous and self-improving over time through a feedback mechanism.  We use several risk management tools (both proprietary and third party) to optimize, monitor, evaluate and adjust the risk of our portfolio.  We optimize through fundamental analysis, security selection, position capital at risk, factor and/or subsector risk, diversification, net directional exposure and gross exposure.  We monitor real time exposures and portfolio shocks.  We evaluate through detailed performance attribution (longs vs. shorts, benchmark relative, % upside vs. downside participation, etc.).  We adjust based on these results and on-going response to market news and events.

Continental Advisors’ Investment Principles
Continental Advisors has adopted the following principles under which it endeavors to operate its business and that serve as cultural guideposts for the firm:
 



It is the client’s money


Eat your own cooking


Be disciplined and humble


There are diseconomies of scale to active portfolio management


Nobody can predict where the stock market is going


Stocks represent an economic interest in the future cash flows of a business


Risk management is more important than total rate of return


Focus on investment strategies where you think you have a competitive advantage - skip everything else


Use all available investment instruments to optimize the risk and return profile of the portfolio


Leverage can be and has been deadly - use it with great care


People who sustain the worst losses are usually those who overreach


Worst reality is always worse than the worst case scenario - the real investment world does not behave according to historical standard deviations
